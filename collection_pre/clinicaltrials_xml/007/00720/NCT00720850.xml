	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that lenalidomide can be an effective drug in preventing relapse of MDS and AML patients with chromosomal abnormalities involving monosomy 5 or del5q after allogeneic HSCT. Due to its immunomodulatory action it might also be able to enhance a T - or NK cell mediated graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind a possible, yet unknown influence on modulation of clinical GVHD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytogenetics are main predictors of outcome in patients with MDS and AML. In fact, a monosomy 5 (-5) or del5q (excluding typical 5q-syndrome) are mostly poor prognostic markers also because being frequently part of a complex karyotype. Together, these patients often do not respond to conventional chemotherapy and can only be cured by allogeneic HSCT. Nevertheless, even after transplantation the relapse rate is considerably high and in the majority of patient's relapses occur within the first year after HSCT. Lenalidomide has been successfully used in MDS patients with del5q, irrespective of additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated also impressive anti-proliferative effects of the compound in cell lines harbouring a monosomy 5. Therefore, it seems to be a promising compound in preventing relapse of high-risk MDS or AML patients with chromosomal abnormalities involving del5q or -5 after allogeneic HSCT. Due to its immunomodulatory action it might also be able to enhance T - or NK cell mediated graft versus leukemia effects. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether lenalidomide could modulate or enhance clinical graft versus host disease.</detailed_description>

The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e. intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants], tubal ligation, partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap).

Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. active uncontrolled acute GVHD overall grade 34 Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide). History of arterial or venous embolism or stroke Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy to treat MDS or AML within 28 days of baseline (patients within a clinical trial evaluating new conditioning regimens are allowed to participate in the LENAMAINT study) Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or lenalidomide. history of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs.
