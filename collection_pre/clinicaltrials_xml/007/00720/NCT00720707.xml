	<detailed_description>coverage of gingival recession defects has been considered as a matter of interest for dental practitioners.subjects with a paired gingival recession defect will be selected from the patients who sought dental treatment at our department.Random allocation of the treatment sites to test (CAF+ EMD+ADM) and control (CAF + ADM) groups will be performed by a person who is external to the study and using a computerized selection of random numbers for allocation of the study groups.The parameters of the study are as following items: probing depth( PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (WKT), recession depth from cemento- enamel junction (RD), recession width (RW), distance between mucogingival junction and the stent (MGJ), Plaque (PI) and gingival (GI) indices and root coverage percentage (RC) and the patients will be followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>
