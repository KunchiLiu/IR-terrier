	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Vandetanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without vandetanib in treating patients with head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy together with vandetanib in treating patients with high-risk stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy (RT) With or Without Vandetanib in Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To screen for an indication that the addition of vandetanib to chemoradiotherapy may prolong disease-free survival as compared to a combination of chemoradiotherapy in patients with resected, high-risk stage III or IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Secondary - To determine whether this treatment regimen can be delivered safely and successfully following surgical resection for advanced head and neck cancer. - To estimate the locoregional progression, distant metastasis, and overall survival rates for patients treated with this regimen. - To examine the distribution of selected biomarkers that may include but are not limited to EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor, total and phosphorylated), E-cadherin, pMAPK (phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase), pAKT, Stat-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), Ki-67, COX-2 (cyclooxygenase 2), and cyclin B1 (G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B1)expression in this group of patients and to explore the potential correlation between these markers with the ultimate treatment outcome OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod performance status (0 vs 1) and primary site of disease (oral cavity/hypopharynx vs larynx vs oropharynx, HPV+ (human papillomavirus positive) vs oropharynx, HPV- (human papillomavirus negative)). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 times a week for up to 6.5 weeks and receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43 of radiotherapy. - Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I and receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour once a week beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy. Patients also receive oral vandetanib once daily beginning 14 days prior to the start of radiotherapy. In both arms, treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tissue samples from all patients are collected and reviewed. Tissue from patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma is analyzed for human papillomavirus. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
