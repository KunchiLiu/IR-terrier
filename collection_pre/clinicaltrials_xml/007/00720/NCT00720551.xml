	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to calibrate the STISIM driving simulator under influence of three different dosages of ethanol (0.05%, 0.08% and 0.11% BAC). The levels of performance decrement for the three blood alcohol concentrations will serve as a standard for comparing the effects that will be observed with psychoactive drugs in future trials. This will make the results of these future studies more easily to interpret and will provide health care providers and policy makers who read our scientific work with an easy-to-understand and clinically relevant comparison.</brief_summary>
