	<brief_title>The Risk of Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B After Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been reported that HBV replication can be reacted after chemotherapy or immunotherapy, which will lead to exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B (ECHB). It is still unknown that if percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will react the replication of HBV or not. This study aim to find out the risk of exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or hepatectomy for HCC, and it's effect to treatment outcome.</detailed_description>
