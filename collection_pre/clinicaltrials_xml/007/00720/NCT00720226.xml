	<brief_summary>Evidence in animals shows that losartan can prevent or reverse inflammation and lung damage due to smoking. The goal of this study is to determine whether this drug which is also used to treat hypertension can stabilize or improve lung function in people who have from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Losartan in Preventing Progression of COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be given either losartan in a dose of 50-100 mg per day for a period of one year.
