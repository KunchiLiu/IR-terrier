	<brief_summary>Granuloma annulare is a benign, usually self-limiting, cutaneous dermatosis, which typically presents as asymptomatic, flesh-colored or red papules, frequently arranged in an annular pattern on the distal extremities. Although localized granuloma annulare is most commonly observed, a generalized or disseminated form can occur. The etiology of granuloma annulare is unknown, however, multiple inciting factors have been proposed. The purpose of the investigators is to review the outcomes of treatment of granuloma annulare (GA) resistant to standard regimens that resolved after a 3-months treatment course of monthly rifampin, ofloxacin, and minocycline (ROM) therapy, successfully used to treat paucibacillary leprosy, a disease with clinical and histopathologic similarity to GA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will document the regimen treatment each patient has had and then review the following from the patient's chart to target our specific aims as outlined above. 1. What previous treatment options have been or/are currently being used? 2. How long did the patient take the treatment for? 3. Was the patient able to discontinue or become less dependent on prior treatment? 4. Was the disease process slowed by the treatment?; 5. Were there any side effects that the patient experienced with treatment?</detailed_description>
