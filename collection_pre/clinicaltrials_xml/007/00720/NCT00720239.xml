	<brief_summary>The study will test a new wound healing dressing called Taliderm® on leg ulcers caused by chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Some people with CVI have poor vein circulation that causes ulcers to develop on the lower legs. This new dressing is hoped to help the ulcers heal more quickly. The study hypothesis is to determine whether the TalidermR Wound Dressing, a poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (pGlcNAc) derived membrane material expedites wound healing in humans with venous stasis ulcers.</brief_summary>
