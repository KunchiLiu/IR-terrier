	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) after stopping therapy is low and acceptable in patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) who have completed 3 months of therapy and who have a negative D-dimer test on therapy and 1 month after stopping therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Be &gt;= 18 years of age 2. Have had ONE episode of unprovoked proximal DVT and/or PE 3. Have completed 3 uninterrupted months of warfarin therapy (target INR of 2.03.0) 1. Another indication for longterm anticoagulation (e.g., atrial fibrillation) 2. A high risk of bleeding as evidenced by any of the following: Age greater than 75 years Previous episode of major bleeding where the cause was not effectively treated Known chronic thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 120,000 x 10^9 /L Known chronic renal impairment with a creatinine of more than 150 mumols /litre (1.7 mg/dl) Known chronic liver disease with a total bilirubin of more than 25 mumols /litre (1.5 mg/dl) Active peptic ulcer disease Poor compliance with, or control of, anticoagulant therapy during initial treatment Requires dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel) 3. A vena caval filter 4. Has had Ddimer testing performed within 2 months of potential enrollment other than for evaluation of suspected recurrent VTE that was not confirmed 5. Has a life expectancy less than 5 years 6. Is unable to attend followup visits because of geographic inaccessibility 7. Is participating in a competing clinical investigation</criteria>
