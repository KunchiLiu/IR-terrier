	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness (seroprotection and seroconversion as measured by the hemagglutination inhibition [HI] assay) of an investigational Vero cell-derived, trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine in adults 50 years of age and older. Subjects will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a single intramuscular injection of either the investigational vaccine or a licensed egg-derived seasonal influenza vaccine. Blood will be drawn from all subjects for a determination of HI antibody titers on Days 0 and 21, body temperature and injection site reactions will be monitored daily for 7 days. In addition, subjects will be monitored for adverse events and rises in body temperature until Day 21 and again until Day 180.</brief_summary>
