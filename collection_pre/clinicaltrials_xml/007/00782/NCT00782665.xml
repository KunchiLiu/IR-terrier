	<brief_summary>This study is designed to demonstrate that women in labor become infected without exhibiting any clinical signs or symptoms of infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myometrial Biopsy for the Detection of Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The infection is a dynamic process probably beginning shortly after the onset of labor. This process continues and is enhanced during active uterine contractions, which result in bacteria from the vagina being drawn up into the uterine cavity. During labor, bacterial colonization of the amniotic fluid, the decidua, and even the fetus can occur, resulting in infection of the mother and the fetus.</detailed_description>
