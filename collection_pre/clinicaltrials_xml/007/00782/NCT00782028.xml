	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that relative to families who receive standard individual postpartum and pediatric care, families that receive group care will be more likely to have: - Improved maternal and child health behaviors: i.e increased breastfeeding, exercise, child safety measures in the home and decreased smoking. - Better health care use for babies: i.e. attend more care visits, on-time and complete immunizations and decreased emergency services use. - Better psychosocial outcomes for the families: i.e. decreased stress and depression, and increased social support. - Improved parenting skills: i.e. improved knowledge of child development, involvement in developmentally appropriate activities, and parental sense of competence.</brief_summary>
