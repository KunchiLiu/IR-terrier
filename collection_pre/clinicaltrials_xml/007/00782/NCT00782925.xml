	<brief_summary>At Lyon University Medical Center, back problems are the leading cause of sick leave. The course of lower back pain is usually relatively short (recovery occurs within 4 to 6 weeks in 90% of cases). However, about 5-10% develop chronic lower back pain. Although this is a relatively small group, the economic consequences are enormous (accounting for 70 to 80% of the total cost of lower back pain). Nowadays, some very general training sessions are offered to workers at Lyon University Medical Center, irrespective of their lower back pain status. These very general training sessions are mostly preventive and primary in nature (like back school program) despite the fact that these people already have a history of lower back pain, the main risk factor of recurrence and chronic pain. Since the 1980, some multidisciplinary functional restoration programs have been advised as a strategy for secondary and tertiary prevention of lower back pain. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of physical exercise combined with an educational program and self-led exercise for Lyon University Medical Center workers with lower back pain. We hope this intervention will reduce the risk of recurrence and chronic lower back pain.</brief_summary>
