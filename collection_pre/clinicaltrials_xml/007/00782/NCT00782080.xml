	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of St. John´s Wort/Valerian Extract Versus Placebo in Children and Adolescents With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADHD is a common childhood disorder associated with attention problems and disruptive behavior. Clinical evidence suggests that a herbal drug combination of St. John´s Wort /Valerian extract may be effective in treating ADHD symptoms in methylphenidate and atomoxetine naive patients. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of an herbal treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an herbal product or placebo twice a day for the duration of 8 weeks. Participants will come in for study visits after 2 and 8 weeks for the assessment of ADHD symptoms, performance and spontaneous movements. Side effects will be monitored continuously and also assessed by rating scales.</detailed_description>
