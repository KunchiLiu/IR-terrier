	<criteria>Key Confirmed diagnosis of aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia (MCL) according to WHO criteria for SM and established criteria for ASM and MCL (Valent et al 2003), presenting with at least one measurable CFinding. ECOG performance status of 03 Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks ECG: QTc interval ≤ 450 ms Meeting the following laboratory values: AST and ALT must be ≤ 5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) if this elevation is solely due to ASM/MCL, otherwise AST, ALT must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum Bilirubin must be ≤ 3 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) if this elevation is solely due to ASM/MCL, otherwise serum bilirubin must be 1.5 x ULN Serum Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Key Any other concurrent severe known disease (except carcinoma insitu) concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition including congestive heart failure grade III or IV according to the NYHA classification or with ejection fraction &lt; 50%, etc. Patients with any pulmonary infiltrate including those suspected to be of infectious origin. Exception: Patients with a pleural effusion related to the disease under study as confirmed by the investigator are permitted to enter the study Patients who have demonstrated relapse to 3 or more prior regimens of SM treatment (not including those given for supportive care) Patients who have received any investigational agent, chemotherapy, interferonα, or 2chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CdA, cladribine) within 30 days prior to first dose Patients who have ASM with eosinophilia and known positivity for the FIP1L1PDGFRα fusion unless they have demonstrated relapse or disease progression on prior imatinib therapy</criteria>
