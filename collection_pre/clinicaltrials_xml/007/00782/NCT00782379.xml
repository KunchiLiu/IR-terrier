	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide, before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving high-dose cyclophosphamide together with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works when given together with a donor stem cell transplant, followed by tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and high-dose cyclophosphamide, in treating patients with high-risk hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To estimate the incidence of graft rejection and severe graft-versus-host disease after myeloablative HLA-mismatched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from first-degree relatives in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. Secondary - To estimate overall survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, and event-free survival in these patients. - To characterize additional hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities of myeloablative haploidentical PBSCT. - To characterize donor hematopoietic chimerism in peripheral blood stem cells after PBSCT. OUTLINE: - Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -2, busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -3 and -2. - Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo infusion of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. - Post-transplant regimen: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus IV over 24 hours or orally twice daily on days 5-180, and oral mycophenolate mofetil 3 times daily on days 5-34 followed by a taper to day 90. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or clinically significant graft-vs-host disease. After completion of PBSCT, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of one of the following highrisk hematologic malignancies: Chronic myelogenous leukemia meeting one of the following criteria: Disease in chronic phase and resistant to available tyrosine kinase inhibitors Disease in accelerated phase Disease with blast crisis that has entered into a second chronic phase after induction chemotherapy Acute myelogenous leukemia meeting the following criteria: Marrow blasts &lt; 5% but persistence of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or FISH Must meet one of the following criteria: Disease in second or subsequent complete remission Primary induction chemotherapy failure with disease subsequently entering complete remission Disease in first complete remission with poorrisk cytogenetics or arising from preceding hematological disease Myelodysplastic syndrome meeting at least one of the following criteria: Treatmentrelated Monosomy 7 or complex cytogenetics International prognostic scoring system score ≥ 1.5 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia Acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma meeting the following criteria: Marrow blasts &lt; 5% but persistence of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or FISH Must meet one of the following criteria: Disease in second or subsequent complete remission Acute lymphocytic leukemia with poorrisk karyotype [e.g., t(9;22) or bcrabl fusion, t(4;11), or other MLL translocation] and in first complete remission Chronic lymphocytic leukemia or prolymphocytic leukemia meeting both of the following criteria: Previously treated disease that has either relapsed or failed to respond adequately to conventionaldose therapy including purine analogs In the opinion of the transplant physician, unlikely to benefit from reduced intensity transplantation due to the presence of one or more highrisk features (i.e., bulky tumor masses, B symptoms, and/or inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy) Hodgkin or nonHodgkin lymphoma (including lowgrade, mantle cell, and intermediategrade/diffuse disease) meeting the following criteria: Previously treated disease that has either relapsed or failed to respond adequately to conventionaldose therapy or autologous transplantation In the opinion of the transplant physician, unlikely to benefit from reduced intensity transplantation due to the presence of one or more highrisk features (i.e., bulky tumor masses, B symptoms, and/or inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy) NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult nonHodgkin lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of "indolent" or "aggressive" lymphoma will replace the former terminology of "low", "intermediate", or "high" grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology. No available matched related or unrelated donor OR a matched related or unrelated donor will not be available in the time frame necessary to perform a transplant Availability of a firstdegree relative (parent, child, sibling) matched at 3/65/6 loci (HLAA, B, DR) Donor must be willing to donate mobilized peripheral blood stem cells No positive HLA crossmatch in the hostvsgraft direction or high titer donorspecific antibodies PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Karnofsky performance status 70100% Bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL (unless due to hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome, or primary malignancy) Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min Not pregnant Fertile patients must use effective contraception LVEF (Left ventriculr ejection fraction) ≥ 45% FEV_1 and forced vital capacity ≥ 50% predicted No HIV positivity No debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed consent or receiving optimal treatment and followup PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics No immunosuppressive agents ≤ 24 hours after completion of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (including steroids as antiemetics)</criteria>
