	<criteria>Written informed consent from either the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative Diagnosis of a PID disorder as defined by World Health Organization criteria1 for which the subject had been receiving a regimen of weekly or biweekly (everyotherweek) subcutaneous IgG infusions or IGIV infusions every 21 to 28 days over a period of at least 8 weeks prestudy at an equivalent of a 4week dose of 300 to 800 mg/kg bodyweight Adults/adolescents aged 16 years and older) For female subjects of childbearing age: negative urine pregnancy test result at study entry and agreement to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study Subjects positive at enrollment for one or more of the following: HBsAg, PCR for HCV, PCR for HIV Type 1 Subjects with levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory Subjects with neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;= 500/mm3). Subjects with serum creatinine levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for age and gender Subjects with current history of malignancy Subjects with a history of thrombotic episodes (deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) Subjects with abnormal protein loss (protein losing enteropathy, nephritic syndrome, severe lung disease) Subjects with anemia that in the opinion of the investigator precluded phlebotomy for laboratory studies Subjects who had been exposed to any blood or blood product other than an intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV), SC immunoglobulin (SCIG), immune serum globulin (ISG) preparations, or albumin within the 6 months prior to study entry. Subjects with an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions (urticaria, breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) following IGIV, SCIG and/or ISG infusions Subjects with IgA deficiency and known anti IgA antibodies Subjects who had received antibiotic therapy for the treatment of infection within 7 days prior to enrollment Subjects who had participated in another clinical study involving an investigational product or device within 28 days prior to study entry Subjects with inability or unwillingness to meet all the requirements of this study If female, pregnancy or lactation at time of study entry</criteria>
