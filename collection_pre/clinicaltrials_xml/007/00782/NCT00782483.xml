	<brief_summary>Lasers are being used to treat Port Wine Stains (PWS), but the laser doesn't always work. Only about 10% of PWS can be completely cleared. The research team believes that the investigators can improve the response of PWS to laser therapy by using a computer program that the principal investigator of this study (Dr. Shafirstein PhD) has developed. The purpose of this study is to test the validity of this computer program. Personalized Interactive Laser Therapy (PILT) could significantly improve clinical outcomes of laser treatment of PWS.</brief_summary>
