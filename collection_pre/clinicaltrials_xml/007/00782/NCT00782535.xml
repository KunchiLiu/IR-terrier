Patient has a history of asthma Patient has a blood eosinophil count &gt; 500/µL Patient has a history of allergic rhinitis or atopy Patient had a COPD exacerbation or a lower respiratory tract infection within 8 weeks prior to screening, or during the runin period, that resulted in the use of an antibiotic, or oral or parenteral corticosteroids Patient is on an inhaled corticosteroid that has been initiated, or the effective dose has been changed, within 4 weeks prior to screening or during the runin period Patient has an uncontrolled cardiovascular (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension), respiratory, hematologic, immunologic, renal, neurologic, hepatic, endocrine (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) or other disease, or any condition that might, in the judgment of the Investigator, place the patient at undue risk or potentially compromise the results or interpretation of the study Patient has clinically significant abnormal routine hematology (e.g., anemia) and/or clinical chemistry value(s). Patient has a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmias Patient has lung cancer or a history of lung cancer Patient has active cancer or a history of cancer with less than 5 years disease free survival time (whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases).
