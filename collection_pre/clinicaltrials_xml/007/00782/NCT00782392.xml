	<brief_summary>We are developing an oral supplement of carbohydrates to be added to infant formulas in order to improve brain development, immune function, and overall health of infants and children. After a careful review of what is known about these sugars, there is very little information regarding their use in infants and children, although there is some information in adults and animals. Many of these sugars have been used in a glyco-nutritional supplement in adults and children, with minimal or no reported side effects. We are developing a custom blend of important individual sugars, and need information regarding their dosing and blood concentrations following oral intake of the carbohydrate supplement. Timed blood samples following the carbohydrate supplement will provide us with a better understanding of the most effective dose and the metabolism of these sugars in adults. This will give us the preliminary information we need for developing an oral supplement of special sugars that can be added to infant formulas to help improve brain development and immune function in infants and children.</brief_summary>
