	<brief_summary>Postpartum anemia (PPA) and Postpartum depression (PPD) are common afflictions affecting women after childbirth. Both disorders have a significant impact on women's health and functional status. Despite common symptoms and characteristics, a link between these entities has not been adequately studied. The objective of this study is to determine whether postpartum anemia is an independent risk factor for the development of postpartum depression. This prospective cohort study will include all women delivered by elective term cesarean delivery. Hemoglobin and iron levels will be measured, standardized questionnaires for assessment of PPD, functional status and lactation will be administered before discharge and at 3 &amp; 6 weeks post partum. Hemoglobin levels at each time point will be analyzed for correlation with depressive symptoms, functional status and lactation success.</brief_summary>
