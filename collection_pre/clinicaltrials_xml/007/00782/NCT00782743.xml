	<brief_summary>In this open, prospective, non-randomised, parallel group, unicentric pilot-study will be compared the progress of valvular and coronary calcification with regard to the therapy with either acetyl-salicylic acid or phenprocoumon. The progress of calcification is documented by comparison of cardial stratified computed tomography. It is supposed that treatment with phenprocumon leads to increased coronary and valvular calcification as well to decreased blood levels of carboxylated matrix-GLA-protein</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Phenprocoumon and Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be allocated to two groups with either 1. anticoagulation with phenprocoumon (needed for at least 1 year) 2. therapy with ASA Both treatment groups should include to 50% patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60 ml/min and &gt; 15 ml/min. All patients will undergo a screening procedure with evaluation of calcium regulating proteins, echocardiography and stratified computed tomography of the heart. Medical check up's are planned after 1,3,6, 12 and 18 months. Prior investigations concern diastolic ventricular function under long lasting therapy with phenprocoumon and the influence of long lasting therapy with phenprocoumon in patients suffering from aortic valve sclerosis.</detailed_description>
