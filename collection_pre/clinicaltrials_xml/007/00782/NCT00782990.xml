Participants: 49 consecutive 35 to 70 years old women with urodynamic SUI. Setting: Urology department of a district general hospital at Leganés (Madrid), Spain. Intervention: 24 patients randomised to TVT and 25 to CS. Measurements: Main outcome: Assessment before treatment and at 6-months, 1-year and 3-years postoperatively with the incontinence severity symptoms index (ISS) and the incontinence impact symptoms index (IIS) Secondary outcome: 3 groups to asses cure rates: cured, improved and failure.</detailed_description>
