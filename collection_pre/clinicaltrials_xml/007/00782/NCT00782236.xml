	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the implant stability at the time of abutment placement on implants placed in healed extraction sockets treated with Straumann BoneCeramic (SBC) versus Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Straumann BoneCeramic vs. Allograft Bone in Extraction Sockets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will undergo a single tooth extraction and then will be randomized to receive SBC or FDBA. Following a healing period of 6 months, a core biopsy will be taken of the augmented site and a dental implant will be placed. The subject will be followed for one year following dental implant placement for implant success and survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have voluntarily signed the informed consent form Subjects must be between the ages of 18 and 80 Subjects must need a single tooth extraction in ADA sites 36 and 1114 without septal bone in the maxilla and in ADA sites 1930 without septal bone in the mandible and would benefit from prosthetic reconstruction with a dental implant Subjects must be committed to the study and the required followup visits Subjects must be in good general health as assessed by the Investigator Presence of conditions requiring chronic routine prophylactic use of antibiotics Pregnancy Medical conditions requiring prolonged use of steroids History of leukocyte dysfunction and deficiencies History of bleeding disorders History of neoplastic disease requiring the use of chemotherapy History of radiation therapy to the head and neck Subjects with a history of renal failure Subjects with severe or uncontrolled metabolic bone disorders Uncontrolled endocrine disorders Subjects who knowingly have HIV or hepatitis Physical handicaps that would interfere with the ability to perform adequate oral hygiene Subjects who have undergone administration of any investigational drug or device within 30 days of enrollment in the study Alcoholism or drug abuse Subjects who are heavy smokers (&gt;10 cigarettes per day or cigar equivalents) or chew tobacco Conditions or circumstances, in the opinion of the Investigator, which would prevent completion of study participation or interfere with analysis of study results, such as history of noncompliance or unreliability Local inflammation including untreated periodontitis Mucosal diseases such as erosive lichen planus History of local radiation therapy Presence of oral lesions (such as ulcerations or malignancy) Bone defects that exclude implant restoration Subjects who have a full mouth plaque level &gt;30% at the baseline visit Severe bruxing or clenching habits Persistent intraoral infection Subjects presenting with an acute abscess in the tooth to be extracted or in the adjacent teeth to the extraction site (sites with presence of asymptomatic chronic lesions are eligible) Subjects with inadequate oral hygiene or unmotivated for adequate home care At the time of tooth extraction, if any bony wall is severely damaged or completely lost (i.e., anything other than a four wall extraction socket)</criteria>
