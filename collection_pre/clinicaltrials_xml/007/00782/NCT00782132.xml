	<brief_summary>Since the identification of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s, there have been significant advances made in the management and long-term prognosis for infected individuals. Currently, with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-positive individuals may live a healthy and productive life for years to decades after diagnosis. As life expectancy has increased, this group of people has begun to engage in family planning. This has created a need for access to advanced reproductive technologies and fertility treatments. While attempting to achieve pregnancy, utilization of these services can help to minimize the risk of transmission in serodiscordant couples, and can allow treatment of subfertile couples. Access to these services may be limited in Ontario for a variety of reasons. The purpose of this study is to determine the access to infertility clinics and services in Ontario for couples in which one or both partners is infected with HIV.</brief_summary>
