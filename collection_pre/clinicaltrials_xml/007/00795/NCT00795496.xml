	<brief_summary>The investigators will contact 64 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) who participated in a long-term tacrolimus ointment trial in Helsinki 10 years ago, and ask them to participate in this follow-up study. The investigators will do the same tests as 10 years ago, i.e. bronchial hyperreactivity, skin prick tests, serum-IgE, Mantoux-test (2 TU), and questionnaires about asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms. The investigators also collect data about their AD medication during the last 10 years. The investigators hypothesis is that when the skin condition improves in patients with AD the brochial hyperreactivity improves. The investigators also want to study whether different treatments play a role in the development or resolution of bronchial hyperreactivity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will by letters and telephone contact all patients (n=64) who fulfill the inclusion criteria for this study. The testing in the study (bronchial hyperreactivity, skin prick testing, serum IgE) is cross-sectional, but we retrospectively collect data from the last 10 years about the skin condition and medication for atopic diseases.</detailed_description>
