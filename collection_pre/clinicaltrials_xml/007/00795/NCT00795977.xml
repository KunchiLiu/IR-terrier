	<brief_title>Preoperative Intratumor Dendritic Cells Injection Immunotherapy for Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor even with extensive surgery, and development of new treatment modalities is much-expected for cure of this disease. Dendritic cells (DCs) immunotherapy is expected favorable outcome when it is approached directly to the cancer tissue. To evaluate safety and immunological responses, we conducted a phase I/II study of intra-tumor DCs immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer patients.</detailed_description>
