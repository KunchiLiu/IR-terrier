	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the change in trunk fat mass, assessed by Double Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) after 26 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir or insulin NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) (both combined with insulin aspart at the main meals) in overweight and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with type 2 diabetes who have been treated with 2 or 3 doses of insulin (one of them must be a premix) for at least 3 months prior to inclusion in trial Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between 7.011.0 % Body Mass Index (BMI) between 27.540 kg/m^2 Treatment with any oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in the last 6 months except metformin (subjects currently treated with metformin within the interval of 1000 2550 mg daily may be included in the trial. The dose should have remained unchanged for a period of 2 months prior to randomisation and should be expected to remain unchanged throughout the trial period) Use of approved weight lowering pharmacotherapy (e.g. orlistat, sibutramin, rimonabant) or obesity induced by drug treatment (e.g. corticosteroids, Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics) Previous or planned surgical treatment of obesity Total daily insulin dose higher or equal 2 IU/kg Proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy that has required acute treatment within the last six months Receipt of any investigational drug within 1 month prior to this trial Cardiac disease defined according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, unstable angina pectoris and/or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months previous to the selection</criteria>
