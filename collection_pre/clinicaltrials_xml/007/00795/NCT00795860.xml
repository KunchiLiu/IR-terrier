	<brief_summary>Clearly the effects of diet and exercise are beneficial for obese persons, but the underlying mechanisms for the improvements in metabolic health are not completely clear. Although mounting evidence suggests that alterations in lipid metabolism in persons with abdominal obesity are associated with a several medical complications, including diabetes, little is known about the factors responsible for this effect. The project in this application is designed to examine how the addition of endurance exercise training to a weight-loss program alters whole-body fatty acid availability, uptake, and oxidation as well as the expression of cellular factors that regulate these processes. In addition, we will evaluate whether these alterations are associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity. In the end, these experiments will provide insight into the cellular and whole-body adaptations in fatty acid metabolism in response to weight-loss and exercise training that may lead to enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Identifying relationships between gene expression, whole-body fatty acid metabolism and clinical outcome measurements, such as insulin sensitivity, may lead to improvements in the therapeutic and/or the preventative approach to obesity and its co-morbidities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fatty Acid Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity: the Role of Endurance Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite robust findings emphasizing the importance of weight-loss and exercise for the prevention and management of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms responsible for the improvements in metabolic health are not completely understood. Mounting evidence suggests that abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism in persons with abdominal obesity are associated with insulin resistance. Alterations in fatty acid mobilization and oxidation may be primary adaptations responsible for the improvements in metabolic health after weight-loss and endurance exercise training. We hypothesize that a disparity between muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation is regulated by the expression of genes and proteins that participate in intracellular transport, trafficking, and metabolism of fatty acids. We believe that alterations in the expression of these factors in response to weight-loss and endurance exercise training will underlie changes in the non-oxidative disposal of fatty acids, and thereby improve insulin sensitivity. We will determine the effects of weight-loss and exercise training on whole-body fatty acid mobilization and oxidation and the expression of factors that regulate these processes in skeletal muscle. In addition, we will evaluate how these alterations are associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity. These studies will provide insight into how cellular alterations with weight-loss and exercise training and the accompanying changes in whole-body fatty acid metabolism may lead to improvements in metabolic health.</detailed_description>
