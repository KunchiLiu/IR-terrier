	<brief_title>Safety Study of 5-Azacitidine and Standard Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Relapsing After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a major problem in patients with poor prognosis AML or MDS. Donor lymphocyte infusions alone re-induce remission in a minority of these patients, which may be the result of poor differentiation of the leukemic cells. The study drug 5-Aza is effective in AML and MDS.In addition to direct cytotoxicity, it alters gene expression and induces differentiation of leukemic blast cells. Furthermore, DNA-demethylating treatment results in an induction of transcription and cell surface expression of formerly unexpressed KIRs (killer Ig-like receptors) in NK cells, which are involved in the specific recognition of leukemic target cells and who are able to generate a specific graft-versus leukemia effect. The increased expression of MHC class I and II molecules on the surface of the recipient's leukemic cells and the de novo expression of formerly silenced KIR genes in donor NK cells due to treatment with 5-Aza may result in an increased susceptibility of myeloid leukemic cells to the allogeneic graft versus leukemia effect. Therefore, the graft-versus leukemia effect by donor lymphocyte infusions and NK cells from the original donor may be supported by additional therapy with 5-Azacitidine.</detailed_description>
