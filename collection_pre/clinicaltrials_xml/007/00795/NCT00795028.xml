	<brief_summary>Patients who have suffered a first hip fracture have a higher risk of falling and sustaining another hip fracture compared with age-matched adults who did not fracture. Although exercise is key to reversing this pattern, there have been very few trials that aimed to improve muscle strength and balance as well as enhance bone health following hip fracture. Therefore, we propose to conduct an RCT that delivers either 12 months of standard care or standard care plus graduated exercise program for older women who have sustained a recent hip fracture.</brief_summary>
