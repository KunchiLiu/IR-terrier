After consent and enrollment, the timeline is as follows:A. T.R.U.E. TEST panels 1.1, 2.1 ,3.1 will be applied to the skin on the subject's back. All patch test panels will remain at the back until removed at the #2 Clinic Visit that occurs 2 days later. B. Skin reactions to all patch test panel allergens will be evaluated and scored shortly after panel removal.C. Skin reactions will be evaluated and scored again at either 3 or 4 days after #1 Clinic Visit. An additional follow-up visit (#3B Clinic Visit) may occur days after day 0 if needed to verify skin reactions.D. Skin reactions will be evaluated and scored again at the #4 Clinic Visit, which will occur 7 days +/- 2 days after #1 Clinic Visit (day 0). E. A follow up visit will take place approximately 3 weeks (21 + 2 days) after #1 Clinic Visit (day 0) to record any late or persistent reactions, and any adverse events. Investigators may elect to perform this evaluation via telephone if no reactions are present.</detailed_description>
