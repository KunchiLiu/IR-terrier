	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Ondansetron may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing stem cell transplant. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well ondansetron works in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ondansetron in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the incidence of nausea, retching and vomiting related to administration of autologous hematopoetic stem cells cryopreserved in DMSO can be reduced by the use of a single dose of intravenous ondansetron prior to the stem cell infusion. II. To determine the number of patients who experience nausea and vomiting. OUTLINE: Patients receive ondansetron IV once 30-60 minutes before undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.</detailed_description>
