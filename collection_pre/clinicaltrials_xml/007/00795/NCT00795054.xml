	<brief_title>The Financial Impact of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation on Patient and Family</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the indicated treatment for many life-threatening illnesses affecting both adults and children. Transplant recovery and late effects require long-term medical care. At the same time that the family faces a medical crisis, a resulting financial crisis may also be pending, but is often pushed to the background due to the necessity of first preserving life. A large proportion of patients undergoing HSCT incur significant financial burden from out-of-pocket costs and a decrease in household income. Predetermined variables, both medical and demographic, gathered at the pre-transplant clinical consultation have the potential to predict the patients at greatest financial risk. This study will describe both the out-of-pocket costs and the income changes that may result from HSCT to help patients and their caregivers have a clearer picture of these costs and develop a financial plan. Health care providers can utilize this information to better inform patients and connect them to resources.</detailed_description>
