	<brief_summary>Regulation of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin secretion are major actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Determining whether alterations in GLP-1 may contribute to abnormal EGP and insulin secretion in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was the objective of the current study. The investigators hypothesized that defects in GLP-1 may explain the inappropriate basal EGP and diminished insulin secretion in IFG, and, furthermore, that by increasing circulating GLP-1 levels (using a new medicine called "sitagliptin") the investigators could reverse these defects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy, sedentary, nonsmokers, men and women 4570 years old Subjects were placed into 1 of the 2 groups based on two 2hour 75g oral glucose tolerance tests (2h OGTT), separated by one week: a control group with normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=14; fasting glucose &lt;5.6 mmol/l and 2h OGTT &lt;7.8 mmol/l), or IFG (n=10; fasting glucose 5.66.9 mmol/l, and 2h OGTT &lt;7.8 mmol/l). Subjects were excluded for: thyroid stimulating hormone &lt;50 or &gt;500 mU/l, fasting triglycerides &gt;10.3 mmol/l, creatinine &gt;130 Î¼mol/l, elevated liver function tests (&gt;2X normal), hematocrit &lt; 38%, or WBC&lt;3.0 x 103. Use of medications for lipid and/or glucose lowering also excluded enrollees. Women may not have used hormone replacement therapy in the past 1 year. Smokers. BMI &lt;25 or &gt;40 kg/m2. Diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.</criteria>
