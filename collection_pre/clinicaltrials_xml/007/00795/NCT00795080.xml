	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to decide which position of the neck affects cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flow between the spinal cord and the brain. CSF is a fluid that flows up and down your spinal cord, around the brain and into the ventricles of the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic MRI and Quantitative MR CSF Flow Studies in Craniovertebral Junction Anomalies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To perform dynamic cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) coupled with CSF flow studies to assess changes in CSF flow velocities with changing position of the neck at the CVJ and aqueduct of Sylvius in patients with Chiari 1 malformations and similar malformations fo the CVJ leading to inherent instability in this region, and determine if there is any correlation of these findings to clinical outcome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy volunteers must be 18 yrs of age or older. Patients w/Chiari 1 or CVJ malformations must be 12 yrs of age or older, Who can cooperate in flexing and extending their neck within the cervical spine coil used for MR Imaging. Pediatric patients will be included only if they can cooperate for the additional sequences for the study and will not require sedation or any form of anesthesia. Patients who are medically unstable or cannot voluntarily flex or extend their necks. Patients' hardware placed in the head or necks which are incompatible with MR imaging. Patient requiring any form of sedation which can lead to compromise of the airway with maneuvers described above. History of prior head trauma or history of neurological conditions which can lead to altered CSF dynamics that can interfere with the outcome of this study.</criteria>
