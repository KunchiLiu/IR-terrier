	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that circulating EMP is a useful surrogate marker of early stage of endothelial damage. To determine the effects of chronic smoking on circulating EMP, from healthy volunteers who have habit of chronic smoking, peripheral blood is drawn at the time of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) examination. Spot urine is also collected. Circulating EMPs are counted using flow-cytometry. After 2-week smoking cessation, the measurements were repeated.</brief_summary>
