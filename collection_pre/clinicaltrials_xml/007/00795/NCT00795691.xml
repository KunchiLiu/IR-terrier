	<brief_title>Diabetes Dietary Study- Low Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is not only a risk factor for type 2 diabetes but it also frequently increases the need for insulin requirement in people with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese. However, since insulin is a lipogenic hormone, insulin or sulfonylurea therapy that increases circulating insulin levels often results in additional weight gain. Controlled-carbohydrate "ketogenic" diets have been popular as an alternative way of losing weight, but little is known about the safety and efficacy of using a ketogenic approach in the management of overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The proposed study will randomize a group of 126 overweight or obese (BMI &gt; 25 and &lt; 40) adults with type 2 diabetes to either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat weight loss diet. The primary study endpoint will be six and twelve month changes in glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints include adiposity (BMI, body composition and fat distribution); blood glucose patterns (from self-monitoring records); change in antidiabetic medications (potential decrease in number and dosage), lipids, insulin sensitivity from a meal tolerance test, other metabolic markers (C-reactive protein, leptin) and participants' lifestyle (physical activity and diet) and perceptions of satiety, quality of life, mood, and well-being.</detailed_description>

Current hypokalemia defined as serum potassium levels &lt;3.5 mg/dL. Osteoporosis Type 1 diabetes (history of ketoacidosis or undetectable fasting Cpeptide levels) History of severe or repeated hypoglycemia, or hypoglycemia unawareness. Lack of recourse to another person in the immediate vicinity in the unlikely event that they require outside assistance for severe hypoglycemia. Triglyceride levels &gt; 400 mg/dL. Inability or unwillingness to comply with any aspects of the dietary and research protocol. Weight changes &gt; 10 lbs in the past three months. History of binge eating disorder or other eating disorders. Pregnancy or intention to become pregnant in the next 12 months.
