	<brief_summary>To diagnose bleeding inside the head, children need to have a CT Scan or MRI of their heads. Not all doctors order these though, especially when there is no history of injury or when children don't look too sick. Unfortunately, this means that some children's bleeding doesn't get diagnosed as early as it could. This study wants to find a way to detect bleeding inside the head without using a CT scan or MRI.</brief_summary>
