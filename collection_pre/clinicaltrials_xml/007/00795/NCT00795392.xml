	<brief_summary>Perioperative psychological care is increasingly recognized as an essential part in the surgical environment. Previous studies have developed a strategy to evaluate the psychological influence after operations and found that postoperative psychological states significantly associated with the outcomes of patients. However, preoperative evaluation of patients the physicians do thus far is mainly the physical status assessment following the scale of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Whether a full-scale evaluation of preoperative psychological status to surgical patients could be a predictor to postoperative outcomes or not is not still completely understood. The investigators hypothesized that the preoperative psychological assessment would be an important predictor to outcomes.</brief_summary>
