	<brief_summary>Chronic neck pain is a common condition that can negatively impact quality of life. Substance P is one of the chemicals in the body that can transmit pain signals from overloaded neck muscles to the brain. Topical capsaicin blocks the action of Substance P by releasing, and subsequently depleting the body's store of Substance P in the nerves. Topical capsaicin has been reported to be an effective therapy for a number of persistent pain conditions including diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-mastectomy pain. This study will evaluate the efficacy of topical capsaicin to reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life in adults with chronic muscular neck pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Topical Capsaicin to Reduce Pain and Improve Health-related Quality of Life in Adults With Chronic Myofascial Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will employ a double blinded randomized controlled cross-over trial design. A total of 60 patients aged 18-65 with at least 3 months of myofascial neck pain will be recruited to participate in the study. The participants will be randomized into two groups. Each group will undergo two 4-week treatment arms separated by a 4-week wash-out period. Participants will apply a topical gel patch 12 hours each day overlying painful areas in the neck and shoulder girdle for each 4-week period. The topical gel patch used in each arm of the study will be identical except the placebo will not contain the active ingredient, 0.1% capsaicin. Both topical gel patches will be supplied by Caleb Pharmaceuticals. Each participant will complete 3 surveys at baseline and after each 4-week treatment arm: 1) McGill Pain Scale, 2) visual analog scale, and 3) Short Form 36 (general quality of life data). Paired T-tests will be used to evaluate for statistically significant changes between treatment with the control gel versus the active ingredient gel containing the capsaicin.</detailed_description>
