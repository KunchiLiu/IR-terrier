	<brief_title>Effects of a Beverage Rich in Fruit Extracts on Risk Factors Associated With Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the potential of a beverage containing plant and fruit extracts rich in polyphenolics to modulate vascular risk. Novel risk factors for vascular disease will be assessed including non-invasive assessment of vascular function by pulse wave analysis / pulse wave velocity and laser doppler iontophoresis.</detailed_description>
