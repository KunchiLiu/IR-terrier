	<brief_summary>TELFIT is a monocenter, controlled, randomised trial. It focuses on type 1 diabetes patients that have attended a functional insulin therapy training course. The Primary objective of the TELFIT study is to evaluate whether a PDA with telemonitoring by phone reinforces the effects of the functional insulin therapy training course as compared with conventional care. Main judgment criteria: comparison of HbA1c means between M0 (start) and M3(3 months)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reinforcement of the Impact of a Functional Insulin Therapy Training Course by Telemonotoring With a PDA-phone in Type 1 Diabetic Patients. The TELFIT Study Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will attend a functional insulin therapy training course and be randomized into 2 groups. One group will receive a PDA-phone and one month of phone consultations with a nurse and a physician. The other group will only have the usual paper support. This study compares the evolution of HbA1c in the 2 groups over a period of 3 months. It also assesses time spent by nurses and physicians, changes in quality of life, hypoglycaemia frequency and weight changes.</detailed_description>
