	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if an extension of bromfenac BID monotherapy is effective in the decreasing retinal thickening post cataract IOL placement surgery. No studies exist on how long to treat with an NSAID post cataract IOL placement surgery. Currently, NSAID therapy post IOL placement surgery is in conjunction with steroid treatment, lasting approximately 3 weeks. This study is designed to examine if there is benefit to extending NSAID monotherapy in regards to macular thickening and the incidence of CME.</brief_summary>
