	<brief_summary>The current trial was designed to demonstrate faster recovery in participants undergoing elective surgeries requiring profound neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium to a fourth twitch/first twitch (T4/T1) ratio of 0.9, after reversal of a target depth of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) of 1-2 Post Tetanic Count (PTC) by 4.0 mg.kg-1 Sugammadex compared to Placebo, to evaluate the safety of 4.0 mg.kg-1 Sugammadex and to evaluate the Operating Room (OR) and Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) length of stay for these participants.</brief_summary>
