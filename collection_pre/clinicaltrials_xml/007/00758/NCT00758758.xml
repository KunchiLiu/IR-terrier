	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical investigation is to compare patients treated with Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) using the Hedrocel Cervical Fusion Device, with a concurrent, randomized, control group receiving autologous iliac crest bone graft or allograft and test the hypothesis that ACDF with Hedrocel is non-inferior to ACDF with allograft or autologous bone graft.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this clinical investigation is to compare patients treated with Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) using the Hedrocel Cervical Fusion Device, with a concurrent, randomized, control group receiving autologous iliac crest bone graft. Success criteria include radiographic evidence of fusion, and improvement in pain, function and overall quality of life. If shown to be successful, the use of the Hedrocel Cervical Fusion Device would eliminate complications associated with harvesting autologous bone graft and provide an alternative for those who are unable to provide autologous bone graft from the iliac crest.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The patient qualifies for ACDF based upon physical examination and medical history. The patient has single or two adjacent levels(s) symptomatic cervical disc disease (including disc herniation and/or spondylosis) from the C3C4 disc to the C7T1 disc with associated radiculopathy and/or myelopathy due to nerve root and/or spinal cord compression due to herniated nucleus pulposus or osteophyte formation on the posterior vertebral endplates. Patients who are candidates for surgery based on radicular symptoms must have at least one month of conservative treatment prior to inclusion in the study. The patient has no history of previous anterior cervical fusion surgery at the involved levels. The patient has no history of previous cervical fusion surgery at the adjacent levels. The patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent. The patient is likely to complete the required followup. The patient is mentally compromised (e.g., under treatment for a psychiatric disorder or has senile dementia or Alzheimer's disease), or has evidence of alcohol or other substance abuse for the previous 12 months. The patient has a neuromuscular disorder that would engender unacceptable risk of instability, implant fixation failure, or complications in postoperative care. The patient has a diagnosed systemic disease that requires the chronic administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory and steroidal drugs. The patient has osteopenia to a degree that would contraindicate spinal instrumentation (borderline osteoporosis). The patient has osteoporosis to a degree that would contraindicate spinal instrumentation. The patient is unable or unwilling to attend postoperative followup visits. The patient has received an investigational drug within the previous six months or an investigational device within the previous 12 months. The patient has a spinal condition other than Cervical DDD based upon physical examination and medical history. The patient has an infection site distant from the involved levels that may spread to the involved levels hematogenously. The patient has insufficient bone stock to fix the component. The patient has a known sensitivity to metallic implants. The patient is a prisoner. The patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40.</criteria>
