	<brief_title>Docetaxel/Carboplatin Versus Docetaxel/Caelyx in Pretreated Patients With Ovarian Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The second-line treatment in advanced ovarian cancer has been proved effective in prolonging overall survival and improving quality of life. In patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (relapsed disease after 6 months from the end of first line chemotherapy) the combination of paclitaxel/carboplatin is considered the standard treatment. Generally, the combination platinum-based chemotherapy may well be associated with a survival benefit in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Carboplatin, pegylated doxorubicin (caelyx) docetaxel, have been approved for second-line treatment of ovarian carcinoma and seem to be active in platinum-sensitive disease.</detailed_description>
