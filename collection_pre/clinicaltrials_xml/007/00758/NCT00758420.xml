	<brief_title>Randomized, Single Blind, Placebo Controlled, to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Polidocanol Injectable Foam for Treatment of Symptomatic, Visible Varicose Veins With SFJ Incompetence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of polidocanol injectable foam vs placebo treatments in relief of symptoms using two disease specific questionnaires, establishment of a minimally important difference (MID) for the questionnaires, improvement in the appearance of visible varicosities by a patient and medical assessments aided by pre and post treatment photographs, and a central independent assessor evaluating pre and post treatment photographs. In addition, the study will evaluate the efficacy of polidocanol injectable foam vs the placebo treatment in the elimination of SFJ reflux or occlusion of the treated vein, and to determine whether the placebo procedure blinds the patient to treatment assignment.</detailed_description>
