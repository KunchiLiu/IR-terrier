	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine if there is any relationship between respiratory rate and Heart Failure events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Of Respiratory Rate Level And Trend Evaluation in Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the CORRELATE-HF study is to collect RRT data in heart failure patients to gain a better understanding of how respiratory rate changes in relation to all cause clinical events as well as other diagnostic features, including but not limited to, activity level, heart rate, and lead impedance.</detailed_description>
