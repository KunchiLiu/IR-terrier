	<brief_summary>The project includes a systematic review to inform refinement of intervention components and a pilot RCT to determine the uptake, feasibility, and potential value of a hypertension self-management strategy using personal health records. The review follows generally acceptable systematic review and/or meta-analytic techniques; with specific attention devoted towards accessing information and effectiveness data from unpublished studies or reports within grey literature and contacting individuals with expertise in chronic disease management in primary care. Findings of the review will be used to expand/modify an existing intervention 'template' to yield an evidence-based strategy with potential to enhance self-management of hypertension in primary care. The pilot RCT will assess the utility of the multifaceted intervention, delivered in part via a secure patient-controlled personal electronic health record, compared with the usual family practice management, for patients with undiagnosed or uncontrolled elevated blood pressure. Patients who are hypertensive or identified as high risk are expected to benefit from the increased flexibility and autonomy of out-of-physician-office self-monitoring with self-management support. This initial evaluation will focus on the change in hypertension knowledge, patient self-efficacy, and patient engagement in self management activities after 3 months, in the intervention group compared to the control group; the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to patients and providers; and the processes involved in linking the patient self-management experience back to the patient's health care providers to promote coordination of care. Secondary outcomes include change in blood pressure, number and content of interactions with providers, and changes in management, including antihypertensive medication.</brief_summary>
