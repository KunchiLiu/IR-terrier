	<brief_title>Single Intravenous Administration of TB-402 for the Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) After Total Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available anticoagulant therapies for the prevention of VTE include low molecular weight heparins, pentasaccharides and vitamin K antagonists, all of which have inherent limitations(1-3). Improved anticoagulant agents are therefore required(4). A novel antithrombotic agent requires demonstration of both efficacy and safety in relevant populations. Phase II studies are frequently performed in patients undergoing total hip replacement and/or total knee replacement because of the high and well documented incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the absence of adequate thromboprophylaxis(5-7). In this study, we assess the safety and efficacy of TB-402, a novel antithrombotic agent that partially inhibits factor VIII, in the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery.</detailed_description>
