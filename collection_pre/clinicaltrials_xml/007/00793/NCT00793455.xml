	<brief_title>Outreach for Patients With Uncompleted Colorectal Cancer Screening Orders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We designed an intervention to focus on patients who have received and accepted a referral for colonoscopy, yet have exhibited some barriers to screening as demonstrated by a lack of screening completion. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent intervention (patient reminder, print and multimedia materials) on colorectal screening completion among this target population.</detailed_description>
