	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 2-arm study of bosutinib administered in combination with exemestane versus exemestane alone. This is a 2-part study consisting of a safety lead-in phase and randomized phase 2 portion. Subjects in part 1 will receive bosutinib and exemestane daily, and will be closely monitored for 28 days. If no safety concerns arise, then future eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to the main phase of the study. They will either receive bosutinib daily combined with daily exemestane, or daily exemestane alone for a specified period of time. Subjects will be followed up for survival after treatment discontinuation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study was terminated on 19 Apr 2010 due to unfavorable risk benefit ratio which did not support continuation in part 2 of the study. Even if the safety profile of the combination of Bosutinib and Exemestane was acceptable 25% of subjects had treatment related liver events including 14% of severe liver events.</detailed_description>
