	<brief_summary>This study will investigate safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of BI 201335 NA in HCV genotype 1 infected patients treated for 14 days monotherapy followed by BI 201335 NA combination therapy with PegIFN/RBV for an additional 14 days for treatment-naïve patients; or for 28 days as BI 201335 NA combination therapy with PegIFN/RBV for treatment-experienced patients. A secondary objective is to investigate antiviral activity, potential drug-drug interactions and safety of combination therapy of BI 201335 NA and PegIFN/RBV up to 28 days for treatment-naïve patients.</brief_summary>
