	<brief_title>Effects of Contrast Media on Subjects With Stable Reduced Renal Function Undergoing Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute decline in renal function after the administration of iodinated contrast agents. CIN is commonly defined as an increase in post contrast serum creatinine (SCr) greater than or equal to 25% or an absolute increase greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from pre contrast baseline values. Study will evaluate and compare the effects of two (2) contrast media products on renal function in subjects with stable reduced renal function while undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females 18 years of age or older Subjects scheduled for a clinically indicated CECT requiring 40 grams of iodine (125 mL) Subjects have an abnormal screening SCr that results in a calculated eGFR of &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the MDRD formula and acute causes for an elevation in SCr have been excluded Subjects have stable reduced renal function which is defined as an abnormal screening SCr measurement with a &lt; 15% difference from the oldest historical SCr measurement obtained within the proceeding 1 week to 12 weeks Subjects must provide written consent and agree to abide by the site and study requirements Subjects previously entered into this study Subjects on dialysis Subjects received any investigational drug within 30 days of contrast administration or participated in an investigational study within 30 days prior to study enrollment Subjects have undergone a procedure using iodinated or gadolinium contrast agent within 7 days prior to contrast administration, or is scheduled to receive additional doses of contrast agents during the 4872 hour poststudy contrast administration Subjects in acute renal failure or have one or more known causes of acute renal failure Subjects have known or suspected unstable renal function Subjects scheduled for a surgical intervention or other procedure within 72 hours after the contrast administration Subjects taking NSAIDs (with the exception of ASA) and/or any type of diuretics who cannot discontinue these drugs post contrast administration and hold all subsequent doses until the 4872 hour post contrast SCr has been drawn Subjects taking aminoglycosides Subjects known to have an organ transplantation Subjects have severe congestive heart failure (Class IIIIV)</criteria>
