	<brief_summary>This is an observational study of composite indices, including the CLARA (CLinical ARthritis Activity) index, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in routine clinical practice in Italy in order to evaluate clinical remission and low disease activity. Data will be collected only from patients providing informed consent. In this study we aimed to assess the psychometric properties of a new composite instrument termed CLinical ARthritis Activity (PRO-CLARA) that uses only three PRO measures from among the 7 ACR Core Data Set. We hypothesized that this index would facilitate rapid and easy RA activity assessment in daily routine.</brief_summary>
