	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to (1) determine whether local injection of lidocaine used during Mohs surgery will elevate serum lidocaine concentrations to a level that could cause systemic symptoms and (2) determine whether sustained high levels of serum lidocaine occur after intralesional anesthesia on the face and neck. This study is a cross-sectional study of 10 subjects with basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the face or neck requiring Mohs micrographic surgery. The study will consist of a brief questionnaire and blood draws during their Moh's surgical procedure.</brief_summary>
