	<brief_title>Laparotomy Versus Percutaneous Puncture in Patients With Abdominal Compartment Syndrome During Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We anticipated that decompressive laparotomy with temporary abdominal closure, beside all potentially negative side effects that early open surgery carries in patients with acute pancreatitis, results in decrease of overall mortality and major morbidity. The DECOMPRESS study is designed to compare effects of decompressive laparotomy with temporary abdominal closure and percutaneous puncture with placement of abdominal catheter in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome during acute pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
