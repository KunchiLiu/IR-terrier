	<brief_title>Study of IMC-1121B in Patients With Tumors That Have Not Responded to Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the anti-VEGFR-2 monoclonal antibody IMC-1121B administered weekly in patients with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.</detailed_description>

At least 28 days must have elapsed from major surgery, prior chemotherapy, prior treatment with an investigational agent or device, or prior radiation therapy (palliative radiation therapy is allowed). Accessible for treatment and followup. Patients enrolled in this trial must be treated at the participating center. Patients with large centrallylocated pulmonary lesions adjacent to or invading large blood vessels. Patients who have had chemotherapy or therapeutic radiotherapy within 28 days (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or patients with ongoing side effects ≥ grade 2 due to agents administered more than 28 days earlier. Prior left chest wall radiotherapy or a cumulative anthracycline dose ≥ 300mg/m2 (if the ejection fraction is within normal institutional limits, the patient can be enrolled). Any concurrent malignancy other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with a previous malignancy but without evidence of disease ≥ 3 years will be allowed to enter the trial.
