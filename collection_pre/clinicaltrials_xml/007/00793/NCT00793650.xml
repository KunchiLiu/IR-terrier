	<criteria>Patients with multiple myeloma who are eligible for an autologous peripheral blood progenitor transplant Male and female subjects between the age of 18 and 70 years. Patient has given informed consent prior to any study related procedures with the knowledge that consent can be withdrawn at anytime without prejudice to future medical care Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements Female subject is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male subjects agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of the study. Biopsy proven diagnosis of multiple myeloma from bone marrow aspirate and biopsy prior to study initiation Patient has achieved less than 90% disease reduction from previous treatment prior to transplant (as measured by serum or urine protein electrophoresis) and has more than 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow, or patient has progressed and has more than 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow. Karnofsky Performance Status score of ≥ 60% Patient has met the following laboratory requirements prior to Day 4 Platelet count ≥ 50, 000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 500/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (transfusion allowed to meet this criterion) Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/min Toxic effects of previous therapy or surgery resolved to Grade 2 or better Unsupportable anemia with &lt; 10b/dL Patient has a calculated or measured creatinine clearance of &lt; 30mL/min within 14 days before enrollment Patient has ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol Patient has had an allergic reaction to melphalan or chlorambucil Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women. Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study Cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction such that patients do not meet institutional pretransplant evaluation criteria Known central nervous system involvement or suspicion of involvement with Myeloma Other active malignancies (with the exception of basal and squamous cell skin cancer) within 5 years of study entry. Patients with treated prostate or cervical cancer in situ who are 2 or more years from therapy and remain free of disease may be entered into the study at the investigator's discretion.
