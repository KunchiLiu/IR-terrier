	<brief_title>A Controlled Study of Uric Acid on the Progression of IgA Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been reported that hyperuricemia is a risk factor for progression of IgAN. This will be a prospective, randomized study. Eligible IgAN patients will be randomized into the treatment group and the control group. Patients in treatment group will receive allopurinol and usual therapy. Patients in control group will receive usual therapy with placebo. If with hypertension, add the CCB and the Î²-blocker. Fasting uric acid, serum creatinine, albumin, routine blood test, urine microscopy and dipstick, proteinuria of 24 hours and blood pressure will be measured every month. After followed-up for 6 months, the curative effect of Allopurinol on blood pressure, proteinuria and the progression of IgA nephropathy will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
