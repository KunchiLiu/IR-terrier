	<brief_summary>The common causes of mortality are late stages of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and infections, are associated with abnormalities of the immune system, an underlying state of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. These processes have not been carefully described in the chronic kidney disease population. The researcher can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to determine the immune system in individuals with chronic kidney disease and describe the association with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in that population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy can measure the absolute concentrations of reduced and oxygenated hemoglobins,cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, blood loss,blood hemoglobin concentration, water and lipid concentrations of the tissue. The researchers can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to monitor volume changes during the hemodialysis treatment and to correlate the changes in volume and blood pressure with the measures of oxidative stress and inflammation used in this study. The researchers can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy data to compare to laboratory parameters routinely measured to clinical parameters such as cause of chronic kidney disease, blood pressure and dialysis-related parameters.</detailed_description>
