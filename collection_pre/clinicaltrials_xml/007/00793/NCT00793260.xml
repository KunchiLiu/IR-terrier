	<criteria>All employees, dependents and retirees in one of seven large employer groups, including a state university system, a state employee group, two manufacturing companies, a natural resource extraction company, a public educational service agency, and a nonprofit multiple employer association for independent colleges were eligible for inclusion. no financial information was available from their facility and professional claims; they were in an employer subgroup ineligible for care support services; they asked not be to contacted or were deceased; gender information was missing from their eligibility files; their claims data from the year prior to the start of the study indicated diagnoses of HIV, AIDS, endstage renal disease (ESRD), organ transplants, or necrotizing fasciitis (intended to improve the likelihood of a balanced distribution of costs and conditions); OR they were in an employer subgroup with less than four months of enrollment prior to the study start date (resulting in too little information for stratification).</criteria>
