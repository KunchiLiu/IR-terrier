	<brief_title>Medical Nutrition Therapy or Standard Care in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, or Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part II of the study, patients are stratified according to tumor type (pancreatic vs lung vs prostate). Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I (Medical nutrition therapy): intervention with a registered dietitian or nutrition professional. MNT is a cyclical process which includes nutrition assessment, intervention, follow-up, and reassessment. Patients will receive a total of three (3) visits with the dietitian over a six-week period with follow-up during weeks 2-3 and weeks 6-9 based on their treatment schedule. - Arm II (standard care): Standard nutritional care includes the National Cancer Institute's booklet "Eating Hints for cancer patients: before, during &amp; after treatment". In both arms, patients' weight, fat free mass, and Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment Score (PG-SGA) score will be assessed before, during, and after the intervention. The PG-SGA includes a patient report of symptoms and a healthcare professional assessment of medical, metabolic, and physical parameters.</detailed_description>
