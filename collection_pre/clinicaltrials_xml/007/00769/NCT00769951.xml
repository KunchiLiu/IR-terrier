	<brief_title>Study of Physical and Mental Health of Older Patients With Newly Diagnosed Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To create a Geriatric-Oncology database of patients 65 years of age and older with newly diagnosed cancer who have been identified as being at increased risk of functional decline and mortality within a year. - To enhance the Geriatric-Oncology Database by linking it to the Central Medicare Services (CMS) Database and the Ohio Death Files. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo a 1-hour comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline and periodically during the study as part of routine care. The assessments include the Lawton's nine-item Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL); the Katz's Activity of Daily Living (ADL); the Timed Up and Go Test; the Karnofsky Physician-Rated Performance Rating Scale (KPS); the number of falls in the past 6 months; the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA); the Body Mass Index; the percent of unintentional weight loss in the past 6 months; the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Subscale (emotional/information and tangible subscales); the MOS Social Activity Limitations Measures; the Charlson Comorbidity Index; the Cumulative Index Rating Scale Geriatrics (CIRS-G); the ACE-27; the Folstein's Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); the Functional Pain Scale; and a list of medications. Data will be obtained from patients medical records at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years. At completion of 1 and 3 years of follow up, the Geriatric-Oncology Database will be linked to the Central Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Database and the Ohio Death Files.</detailed_description>
