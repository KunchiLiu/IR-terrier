	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: The recurrence rate of HCC patients after radical resection is about 60-70%. This study is based on the hypothesis that CIK treatment could decrease the recurrence rate by 15% to 20%. Abstract: This is a randomized controlled study. About 200 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent radical resection will be included. The patients will be randomized to group A (receive CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up) without any anti-cancer treatment after resection of HCC, and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Study treatment: Patients in group A will receive 4 cycles of CIK treatments within 3 months after their liver resection. Patients in group B will have no anti-cancer therapy. Anti-virus and other supportive therapies are available in both groups.</brief_summary>
