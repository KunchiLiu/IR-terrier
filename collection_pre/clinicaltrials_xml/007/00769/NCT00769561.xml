	<brief_title>Biofeedback-Based Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Temporomandibular Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a biofeedback-based cognitive behavioral treatment for temporomandibular disorders using a randomized controlled design. 100 patients suffering from chronic temporomandibular disorder are diagnosed using Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Subsequently, patients are randomly assigned to either a psychological intervention receiving 8 sessions of biofeedback-based cognitive behavioral treatment or to a dental intervention receiving interocclusal splint therapy. Assessment takes place at baseline, after treatment approximately 8 weeks later, 3 and 6 months follow up. The effects of the interventions are evaluated in terms of reduction in pain intensity, pain related disability, psychological variables such as somatoform symptoms, depression and pain related cognitive adjustment as well as nocturnal electromyographic (EMG) activity. Additionally, the study aims at identifying variables that predict treatment outcome. Further analyses include initial changes in treatment motivation and illness perceptions and its influence on treatment success, as well as changes in psychophysiological stress reactivity through treatment.</detailed_description>
