	<brief_summary>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common progressive and debilitating muscle disease beginning in persons over 50 years of age. This study will assess the safety and tolerability of Arimoclomol in IBM as compared to placebo over 4 months of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arimoclomol in Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IBM is a chronic disorder in which muscles become inflamed (swollen) and cause muscle weakening. The cause is unknown. There is new evidence to suggest that the pathology in IBM results from cellular changes induced by a variety of stressful events and diseases. In response to these stressful events the body's normal response is to increase the levels of Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) to help counteract and stop these cellular changes. In people with IBM this increase does not appear sufficient enough to reverse these toxic cellular changes. Arimoclomol causes the body to make more of this HSP protein. By increasing HSP levels in IBM patients we hope to reverse the toxic cellular changes that might be responsible for the pathology of IBM.</detailed_description>
