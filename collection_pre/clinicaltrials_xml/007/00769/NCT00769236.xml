	<brief_summary>We propose to study the intestinal secretion of ASCA by evaluating them in biopsy culture supernatants from a cohort of patients suffering from CD (n=80) and a cohort of control patients (UC (n=40) and patients without IBD (n=40 )).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Intestinal Secretion of Antibodies and Auto-antibodies Associated With Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Its diagnosis is based upon clinical, endoscopic and histological parameters but recent studies have shown that seric evaluation of immunological markers (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auti-antibodies (ANCA)) could be useful. Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the young people. Antibodies anti-chitobisoside carbohydrate (ACCA), anti-laminaribioside carbohydrate (ALCA) and anti-mannobioside carbohydrate (AMCA) have been described as new serological markers of CD.</detailed_description>
