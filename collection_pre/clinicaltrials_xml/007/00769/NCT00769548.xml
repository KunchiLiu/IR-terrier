	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Hormone therapy combined with radiation therapy may be a more effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of four different combinations of radiation and hormone therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Hormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Examine whether total androgen suppression (TAS) with flutamide/goserelin and whole-pelvic irradiation followed by a cone-down boost to the prostate improves progression-free survival at 5 years by at least 10% compared to TAS and prostate-only irradiation in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate at significant risk of nodal involvement. II. Examine whether induction and concurrent (neoadjuvant) TAS and radiotherapy improves the progression-free survival at 5 years by at least 10% compared to adjuvant TAS and radiotherapy. III. Compare treatments with regard to local control, time to distant failure, and overall survival. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy with Radiotherapy. Flutamide, FLUT, NSC-147834; Goserelin, Zoladex, ZDX, NSC-606864; with irradiation of the whole pelvis followed by a boost to the prostate using photons of at least 6 MV. Arm II: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy with Radiotherapy; FLUT; ZDX; with irradiation of the prostate using equipment as in Arm I. Arm III: Radiotherapy followed by Adjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy. Irradiation as in Arm I; followed by FLUT; ZDX. Arm IV: Radiotherapy followed by Adjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy. Irradiation as in Arm II; followed by FLUT; ZDX. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,200 patients will be accrued over 2.5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate Any stage with an estimated risk of node involvement at least 15% (and therefore at significant risk for local and/or systemic failure) based on pretreatment PSA and Gleason score (GS), e.g.: GS of 7 and PSA greater than 7.5 ng/mL GS of 6 and PSA greater than 22.5 ng/mL GS of 5 and PSA greater than 37.5 ng/mL PSA greater than 4 and less than 100 ng/mL Highest pretreatment value determined by a monoclonal assay that has a normal range of 04 ng/mL PSA measured by polyclonal assay (e.g., Yang) that has a normal range of 02.5 ng/mL may need to be divided by a conversion factor of approximately 1.5 GS determination required prior to entry No distant metastases No biopsy proven lymph node involvement Ineligible for protocol RTOG9408 (clinical stages T2cT4 with GS of 6 or higher are eligible for this study) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Any age Performance status: Karnofsky 70100% Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Liver function tests no greater than 1.2 times normal Renal: Not specified Other: No major medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent completion of treatment or interfere with followup No second malignancy within 5 years except superficial nonmelanomatous skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Not specified Chemotherapy: No prior chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: At least 90 days since testosterone At least 60 days since finasteride Radiotherapy: No prior radiotherapy Surgery: No more than 60 days since surgical staging No radical surgery or cryosurgery</criteria>
