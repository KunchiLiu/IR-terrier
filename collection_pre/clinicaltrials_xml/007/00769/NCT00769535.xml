	<brief_summary>Polymorphisms of HSP70 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic liver disease and healthy controls will be measured by PCR-RFLP or direct sequencing. The clinical relevance of patients will be compared in those with polymorphism and those without.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Polymorphism of Heat Shock Protein 70 Gene and Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) may be involved in various aspects of immune system including infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immunity. The relationship between HSP70 expression, disease activity and cancer prognosis varied according to type of cancer. The overexpression of HSP70 by tumor cells contributes to tumor behavior. HSP70 is present in normal and abnormal hepatocytes, and was reported to be over-expressed in both hepatoma cell lines and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Recent study indicated that HSP70 is a molecular marker during early hepatocarcinogenesis. It is also involved in anti-tumor immunity in HCC.We also investigate the polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter, and correlated to clinical relevance.</detailed_description>
