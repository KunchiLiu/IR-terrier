	<brief_title>Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Progressive Systemic Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate at 6 months in patients with systemic mastocytosis treated with thalidomide. Secondary - Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease progression.</detailed_description>
