	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the hypothesis that the implementation of an educational program that informs spine patients about their condition, treatment options, prioritization on the wait list, and post-operative care would improve functional outcome and quality of life scores following surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study on the Use of Educational Programs Prior to Lumbar Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous literature has shown that longer waits to lumbar spine surgery can have negative effects on the patients perceived function and quality of life both pre- and post-operatively. Patients report deterioration during this long wait, commonly over 6 months in Ontario. The proposed study intends to evaluate the impact of two different educational methods for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. This prospective randomized clinical trial will assign patients to two different educational groups: one of solely standard care, and the other of standard care with the addition of presentation of a 10 minute educational video informing spine patients about their condition, treatment options, prioritization on the wait list and post-operative care. Outcome measures will be assessed through four different questionnaires concerning specific conditions, pain, quality of life, etc., both pre-operatively and post-operatively. Providing patients with this accurate information may coincide with positive outcome measures. The more successful educational program, as found by this study, may then be provided to all spine patients. This educational program may bring about an increase in overall well-being of spine patients by having a positive impact on the quality of life both pre- and post-operatively.</detailed_description>
