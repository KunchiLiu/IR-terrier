	<brief_summary>Sensory function is different in persistent postherniotomy pain patients than in operated controls, suggesting this to be a neuropathic pain syndrome. By performing quantitative sensory testing, the specific changes in pain patients will be revealed, thereby aiding in designing future treatment trials. MRI scans of the groin regions in pain patients and control patients will be evaluated by senior MRI specialists assessing potential pathology to the region (Mesh, inflammation, edema, funicle etc.) Assessors will be blinded to clinical status, and surgery.</brief_summary>
