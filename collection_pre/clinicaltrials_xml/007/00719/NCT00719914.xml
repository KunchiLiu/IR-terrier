	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this research study is to try to improve the results of the standard treatment for heart attacks. Normally, heart attack patients get a fast dose and a slow dose of eptifibatide in the emergency room, shortly after arriving. This drug is usually given through a vein in the arm. However, eptifibatide can also be injected directly into the heart's blood supply just before angioplasty, a common procedure to unblock a blood vessel in the heart. This new way of giving the drug is being studying.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the IC-TITAN study is to demonstrate that an IC bolus of eptifibatide added to an upstream double-bolus and infusion regimen of eptifibatide administered intravenously and initiated early in the ER will result in significant additional clot resolution in vivo when compared with an IC injection of placebo (saline). The primary endpoint chosen to evaluate this hypothesis is the improvement in percent diameter stenosis of the culprit artery following the IC bolus administration of eptifibatide vs. IC placebo (saline) as assessed with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).</detailed_description>
