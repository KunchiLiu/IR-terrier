	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Aromatase inhibitor therapy is used in treating postmenopausal women who have hormone-dependent breast cancer. It is not yet known what effect aromatase inhibitor therapy has on blood vessel function. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of aromatase inhibitor therapy on blood vessel function in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy on Blood Vessel Function in Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the effect of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy on endothelial function in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to breast cancer hormone-receptor status (positive vs negative). - Group 1 (hormone receptor-positive): Patients receive aromatase inhibition therapy for up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. - Group 2 (hormone receptor-negative): Patients do not receive adjuvant treatment. Endothelial function is measured in both groups at baseline and at follow up by the room temperature peripheral arterial tonometry (RT-PAT) index using the EndoPAT method.</detailed_description>
