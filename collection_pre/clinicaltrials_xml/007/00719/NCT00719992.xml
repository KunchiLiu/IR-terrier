	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to assess the amount of additive value of HS-CRP levels to a positive exercise tolerance test (ETT) in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD) using coronary angiography as the gold standard. The investigators concluded that HS-CRP can be used as a single predictor of coronary vessel involvement in patients with stable angina and positive ETT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Value of HS-CRP in Stable Angina.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the investigators included 97 patients with positive ETT and stable angina and saw that Hs-CRP is the only predictor of severity of CAD as compared with coronary angiography in stable angina patients.</detailed_description>
