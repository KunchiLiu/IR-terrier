	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of polestriding (walking with poles) and traditional walking on physical endurance in subjects with poor circulation in their legs. Another goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of a walking program in increasing the amount of oxygen in the calf muscles and therefore improving overall physical activity and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polestriding Versus Walking for Subjects With Poor Leg Circulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD/PVD) is caused by decreased blood flow to the legs. The most common symptom is intermittent claudication pain during walking that is relieved by rest. Walking is the primary treatment prescribed for PAD rehabilitation. Polestriding uses muscles of the upper and lower body in a continuous movement. Walking with poles increases stride length, cadence and walking speed and decreases ground reaction forces on the joints. Subjects in this study will participate in a walking program with or without poles. Dr. Collins' research focuses on physical activity interventions to improve the functional status of persons with chronic illness. Several rehabilitation studies have tested the efficacy of walking exercise for patients with PAD. Studies on polestriding indicate that it may be superior to traditional walking, but these two methods have never been compared. Approximately 30% of patients with coronary artery disease have PAD as their only symptom. As the population ages and more people are affected by this debilitating condition, nurse-initiated rehabilitative therapies, such as polestriding, need to be explored. The consent form explains the purpose of the study in addition to the procedures, risks, benefits, options, confidentiality, costs, and compensation. Participants are also asked to sign a HIPPA authorization.</detailed_description>
