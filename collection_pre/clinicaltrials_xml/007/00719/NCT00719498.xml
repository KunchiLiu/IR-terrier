	<brief_title>Effect of Early High-dose Epoetin Alfa During Cardiac Arrest (Pilot Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: To test the possible neuroprotective effect of early high-dose erythropoietin alpha after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Safety, pharmacokinetics and an estimation of potential risks benefits of EPO treatment were evaluated. Methodology: An open labelled, pilot, matched control study. Following resuscitation with mild hypothermia with after OHCA, participants received a first dose of EPO-alpha followed by four additional injections within 48 hours (40 000 IU intravenously each injection). Plasma Epo-alpha levels were measured at different time points. Outcome and adverse events were assessed up to day 28 and were compared with those of matched-paired controls Pilot, open-labelled, matched controls study performed between Nov 2003 and May 2004. As the first step, the effect of high-dose Epo-alpha for 20 consecutive patients with OHCA who had been successfully resuscitated by the emergency medical service was studied. The participants received the first dose of Epo-alpha as soon as possible after stable ROSC, followed by an additional injection every 12h during the first 48 hours ICU admission (40 000 IU intravenously each injection). Collected data included demographics, clinical characteristics, biological features, treatment and outcome. Severity was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiologic Score 2 (SAPS2). Mortality and neurological outcome were recorded at day 28. All unexpected events were assessed in order to detect potential side effects of High-dose Epo administration. As the second step, the outcomes observed among the prospective Epo-treated patients were compared to the cohort with outcomes observed among case-matched historical controls. Two matched controls were selected for each Epo-treated patient. Neurological assessment was performed on admission and each day between days 1 and 7, and at days 14, 21 and 28. Blood samples were drawn daily from day 1 to day 7 and weekly from day 7 to day 28. For the pharmacokinetics blood samples were drawn just before and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, 72h, 78h, 84h, and 96 h after the first administration of Epo-alpha. Intravenous Epo-alpha: First dose as soon as possible after stable return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), followed by an additional injection every 12 hours during the first 48 hours. (40 000 IU at each injection)</detailed_description>
