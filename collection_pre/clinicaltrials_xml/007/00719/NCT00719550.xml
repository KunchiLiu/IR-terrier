	<brief_summary>Study Phase: 1b/2 Indication: Previously untreated subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. Primary Objective(s): Part 1: To identify safe dose levels of AMG 102, up to 15 mg/kg Q3W, to combine with ECX. Part 2 (phase 2-double-blind): To estimate with pre-specified precision the effect of the addition of AMG 102 to ECX on progression free survival (PFS).</brief_summary>
