	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: American ginseng may reduce fatigue in patients with cancer. It is not yet known whether American ginseng is more effective than a placebo in treating cancer-related fatigue. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying American ginseng to see how well it works in treating patients with fatigue caused by cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>American Ginseng in Treating Patients With Fatigue Caused by Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the efficacy of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) as therapy for cancer-related fatigue as measured by the general subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF). Secondary - To evaluate toxicities and tolerability of American ginseng when used for cancer-related fatigue. - To examine stress as a mediating variable on the effects of American ginseng on cancer-related fatigue. - To explore the impact of American ginseng on various dimensions of fatigue as measured by the other subscales of the MFSI-SF, functional interference as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, and well being as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), as well as the single measure of fatigue. - To determine clinically significant changes in fatigue scores using the global impression of change. - To evaluate whether there are differences in the efficacy of American ginseng for fatigue based on minority populations. Tertiary - To describe cortisol and cytokine values in fatigued cancer survivors and to evaluate the relationship of cortisol and cytokines to fatigue severity as well as to patterns of alterations previously documented in fatigued breast cancer survivors. - To evaluate whether Wisconsin Ginseng impacts the expression of cortisol and cytokine in fatigued cancer survivors. - To evaluate the role of cortisol and cytokine changes as the mechanism by which Wisconsin Ginseng can ameliorate cancer related fatigue. - To evaluate the relationships between cytokine and cortisol levels with secondary outcomes such as mood and stress. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to baseline fatigue score (4-7 vs 8-10), disease status of current cancer (initial diagnosis vs recurrent disease), current treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, endocrine therapy [i.e., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors], or other targeted therapy) ( yes vs no), duration of all prior cancer treatment in patient's lifetime (none vs ≤ 180 days vs &gt; 180 days), and current tumor type (hematologic vs solid tumor malignancy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral American ginseng twice daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses. Patients are instructed to complete the Ginseng Symptom Experience Diary and the Linear Analogue Scale weekly. Patients also complete the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study therapy. Patients who are not actively receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy undergo blood and saliva sample collection at baseline and periodically during study therapy for correlative studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Required characteristics ≥ 18 years of age Men or women with a history of cancerrelated fatigue as defined by an average score ≥ 4 over the past 30 days on the numeric analogue scale (1 10) The presence of fatigue ≥ 1 month prior to randomization ECOG performance score 0, 1, or 2 Histologic or cytologic proven cancer other than brain cancer or CNS lymphoma, undergoing curative intent therapy (including antihormonal therapies such as tamoxifen or leuprolide) or those having completed curative intent therapy who were diagnosed within the past 2 years Note: If a patient is receiving treatment for their disease such as chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy or radiation therapy then, the patient must have completed ≥ 1 cycle of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or ≥ 1 week of radiation treatment. Laboratory values obtained prior to randomization: Hgb ≥ 11 (must be obtained ≤ 30 days; patients must not be transfused ≤ 30 days to meet this criterion) Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x UNL (must be obtained ≤ 180 days prior to randomization) AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) ≤ 1.5 x UNL (must be obtained ≤ 180 days prior to randomization) Negative pregnancy test done ≤ 7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only Ability to complete patient questionnaires alone or with assistance Controlled: Pain (≤ 4 on Linear Analogue Scale) Insomnia (≤ 4 on Linear Analogue Scale) Willingness to provide blood/saliva samples for correlative studies. Note: These samples are only required for those not receiving active treatment for their disease. Active treatment is defined as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy, not antihormone therapy such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors or leuprolide. 2. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to ginseng Prior use of ginseng capsules for fatigue in the past year Note: Prior use of teas or drinks containing ginseng is allowed, however, patients will be asked to avoid these beverages while on the study. Uncontrolled hypertension on more than one occasion (diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100, systolic &gt; 160) measured ≤ 90 days prior to randomization Currently using any other pharmacologic agents or nonpharmacologic interventions to specifically treat fatigue including psychostimulants, antidepressants, acupuncture, etc. Note: Antidepressants used to treat items other than fatigue (such as hot flashes) are allowed if the patient has been on a stable dose for ≥ 1 month and plans to continue for ≥ 1 month. Erythropoietin agents to treat anemia are allowed. Exercise is allowed. Known brain metastasis or primary CNS malignancy Chronic systemic steroid use (including CHOP therapy or as part of any regular cancer treatment, however, steroids used as prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting are allowed) to prevent rash with Alimta, low dose dexamethasone will be allowed. Diabetes Type I or II (defined by being on oral hypoglycemics or insulin). Psychiatric disorder such as severe depression, manic depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or schizophrenia. (Defined per medical history). ≤ 4 weeks from major surgery to randomization, including any procedure that requires general anesthetic Any of the following: Pregnant women Nursing women Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception Pain requiring opioid pain medication, however, over the counter analgesics such as Tylenol or ibuprofen are allowed. Use of full dose of anticoagulant therapy (Exception: 1 mg/day of Coumadin for preventing catheter clots is allowed). Use of MAO inhibitors. Planning to start or complete any type of cancer therapy during the 8 week, double blind, course of the study, once randomized on the study. Note: If not currently getting treatment, no chemotherapy agents ≤ 21 days prior to randomization. Combination treatment regimens that have components ending at different times are allowed, as long as any part of the initially started treatment continues through the double blind portion of the study. Malnutrition, active infection, significant pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease as determined by the physician, as they could impact fatigue. Use of any over the counter herbal/dietary supplement marketed for fatigue or energy (for example, products containing any type of ginseng, rhodiola rosea, high doses of caffeine, guarana, or anything called an "adaptogen"). Uncontrolled nausea or vomiting or any symptom that would prevent the ability to comply with daily oral ginseng/placebo treatment. Uncontrolled thyroid disorder.
