	<criteria>Patients selected for inclusion will present for primary shoulder arthroplasty with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis and will consent to participate. Are under 18 years of age or over 70 Diagnosis of AVN, Inflammatory Arthritis, Fracture or Malunion. Have a hemiarthroplasty Have destruction of the proximal humerus that precludes rigid fixation of the humeral component Have arthritis with insufficient cuff tissue Have had a failed rotator cuff surgery Have loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified Have evidence of active infection Present with a condition of neuromuscular compromise of the shoulder (e.g., neuropathic joints or brachial plexus injury with a flail shoulder joint) Have a known active metastatic or neoplastic disease Are unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program or would fail to return for the postoperative followup visits prescribed by the protocol Are skeletally immature. Have a known allergic reaction to implant metals, polyethylene or a tissue reaction to corrosion or wear products Have other conditions such as central nervous system disturbances, alcohol or drug addiction, etc. that may make effective evaluation of the joint replacement difficult or impossible Are currently participating in another clinical study Are taking &gt; 10mg/day corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) excluding inhalers, within 3 months prior to surgery Are currently involved in any personal injury litigation, medical legal or worker's compensation claims.</criteria>
