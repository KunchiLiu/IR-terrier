	<brief_title>Neonatal Erythropoietin in Asphyxiated Term Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newborn infants with birth asphyxia are at high risk of death or long-term neurologic disability; yet therapies for birth asphyxia are currently limited. Erythropoietin (Epo) is a FDA-approved drug that is an effective neuroprotective agent in animal models of birth asphyxia. This is a phase I dose finding multi-center trial that will test the safety and pharmacokinetics of Epo in human infants with birth asphyxia. The long-term objectives of the proposed research are to reduce mortality and to decrease the risk of long-term disabilities in infants who survive beyond the newborn period.</detailed_description>
