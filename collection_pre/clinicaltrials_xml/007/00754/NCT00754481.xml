	<brief_title>Hypothermia for Cardiac Arrest in Paediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest is associated with a high morbidity and mortality in children and hypothermia therapy has the potential to be beneficial in children following cardiac arrest. We have a track record of both clinical and laboratory research of hypothermia therapy following cardiac arrest at the Hospital for Sick Children and have begun a 3-site randomized controlled pilot study of hypothermia therapy following cardiac arrest in children funded by The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario. We are currently expanding the study to an 11 site pilot study with bridge funding from the American Heart Association. Recently two trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating the efficacy of 12 hours and 24 hours of hypothermia therapy following ventricular arrhythmia-induced cardiac arrest in adults. The results of these important studies suggest that hypothermia therapy will be beneficial in children following cardiac arrest. There are however important differences in the etiology, pathophysiology, neuropathology, therapy and outcome of cardiac arrest in children compared to adults. We need to conduct a pilot study of hypothermia therapy following cardiac arrest at 11 Children's Hospitals to test the feasibility of recruitment and to test the appropriateness of our inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to proceeding to a large multi-centre trial. We chose 11 large children's hospitals with large cardiac arrest populations with a track record of resuscitation research to improve the feasibility of patient recruitment into this pilot study. The pilot data will be used to do a sample size calculation for the larger randomized controlled study. It will also be important to demonstrate enrolment in an important sub-group of patients, those being placed on ECMO post-arrest. Patients randomized to cooling on ECMO will have rapid core cooling via the extracorporeal circuit and this rapid cooling may lead to a more pronounced therapeutic effect.</detailed_description>
