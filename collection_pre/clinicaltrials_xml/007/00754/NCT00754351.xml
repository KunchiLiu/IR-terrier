	<brief_title>Docetaxel, Gemcitabine and Bevacizumab for Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel plus gemcitabine is an active combination in the salvage treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Administered every two weeks, this combination has a favorable toxicity profile, and promising activity in &gt; 1st line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Recently, initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone. This study will evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to a biweekly regimen of docetaxel and gemcitabine in the salvage therapy for metastatic breast cancer.</detailed_description>
