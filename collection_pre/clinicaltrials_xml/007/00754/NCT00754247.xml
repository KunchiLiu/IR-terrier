	<brief_summary>Keloids are thought to result from derailments in the typical wound healing process following cutaneous injury. Current treatment options for keloids include intralesional corticosteroids, silicone gel sheeting, compression, surgery and adjuvants to surgery, including radiation and cryotherapy. 0.5% hydrocortisone, silicone, vitamin E lotion (HSE) and onion extract gel (OE) are widely used over-the-counter medications for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars. However, their efficacy and safety have not been compared in a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective fashion. This study is being undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety of HSE versus OE versus placebo (Cetearyl alcohol; CEA) in subjects with hypertrophic scars and keloids. This is an investigator-blinded study, which means that the doctor evaluating you will not know if you are receiving the study medication or not. Another doctor will be supplying you with the medication and discussing any problems that you may have with the medication. You will be assigned to one of the three treatment groups: HSE, OE, or CEA. The group will be assigned by chance and you will have two in three chances of receiving treatment with a study medication, HSE or OE. The no treatment group will receive CEA, a bland lotion, containing no active ingredients such as steroids, silicone, vitamin E, or onion extract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparative Study Evaluating the Tolerability and Efficacy of Two Topical Therapies for the Treatment of Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will last up to 16 weeks, with a total of 5 visits to the clinic (Baseline visit, Week 4, 8, 12, and 16 ), excluding the Screening Visit. Screening Visit/Baseline Visit: Patients will read and be explained the informed consent. Patients who agree to participate will sign the informed consent and a copy will be given to them. Medical history and exclusion/inclusion criteria will be reviewed; if a patient qualifies he/she will be assigned a randomization number for the treatment. At the baseline visit, medical history and exclusion/inclusion criteria since the screening visit will be reviewed. Patients randomized to the HSE group will receive one tube and apply the first application to the keloid/hypertrophic scar during the baseline visit. Patients randomized to the OE group will be given a tube of OE gel and will apply the first application to the keloid/hypertrophic scar. Patients in the placebo group will be given a bottle of CEA lotion, the placebo medication, and will apply the first application to the keloid/hypertrophic scar. The medications will be given by the unblinded investigator and the blinded investigator will be evaluating the patients. Photographs of the patient's keloid/hypertrophic scar will be taken, and the keloid/hypertrophic scar will be measured/assessed according to Methods of Study Lesion Assessment (below). A urine pregnancy test will be obtained for all women of child-bearing potential. Week 4, 8, 12, and 16 Visit: Patients will be asked about side effects since last visit. Photographs of the patient's keloid/hypertrophic scar will be taken and the keloid/hypertrophic scar will be measured/assessed according to Methods of Study Lesion Assessment (below). A urine pregnancy test will be obtained at for all women of child-bearing potential. Methods of Study Lesion Assessment A. Volume B.
