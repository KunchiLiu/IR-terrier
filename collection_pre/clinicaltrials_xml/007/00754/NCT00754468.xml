	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment effect, depth of injury, and side effects using technology involving the spray of liquid nitrogen through a catheter (CryoSpray AblationTM, "CSA" or "cryospray therapy") onto healthy tissue via esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) using surgical resection specimens from subjects undergoing esophagectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CryoSpray Ablation(TM)to Determine Treatment Effect, Depth of Injury, and Side Effects in the Esophagus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a single center study consisting of no more than 10 subjects who are undergoing scheduled esophagectomy for reasons unrelated to the study. Subjects will be divided into 2 Groups in a sequential fashion based on the time of enrollment (Subject 1 in Group1, Subject 2 in Group 2, Subject 3 in Group1, Subject 4 in Group 2, etc). Potential study subjects will be referred from clinical practice. After entry into the study with written informed consent, subjects will be scheduled for the EGD with cryospray ablation treatment 7 days prior to the expected esophagectomy date. All subjects will receive narcotic analgesics to control symptoms. Endpoints related to pathology will be assessed by two independent reviewers, one from the Institution's Department of Pathology, and one from an independent Pathology lab chosen by the sponsor. The reviewers will evaluate the pathology slides to assess maximal extent of depth of injury, side effects, and pathological changes associated with CSA. All reviewers will be blinded to the treatment conditions of the specimens.</detailed_description>

Known history of unresolved drug or alcohol dependency that would limit ability to comprehend or follow instructions related to informed consent, posttreatment instructions, or followup guidelines. Refusal or inability to give consent. Concurrent chemotherapy. Prior or concurrent endoscopic ablation therapy within 4 cm from the CSA treatment area including, but not limited to, cryospray therapy, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy, multipolar electro coagulation, endoscopic mucosal resection, radiofrequency ablation, or argon plasma coagulation.
