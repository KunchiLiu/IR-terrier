	<brief_title>Endoscopic Stenting for Chronic Abdominal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic stenting is increasingly used for the treatment of a variety of pancreatic disorders. Although a number of studies suggest that pancreatic stenting relieves abdominal pain in approximately 70% of patients, there has been no randomized study. Since any intervention may improve pain, the effectiveness of endoscopy cannot be ascertained without a true placebo arm or sham therapy group. The study will aim to determine the effectiveness of pancreatic stents in relieving chronic pain in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. Since these procedures do carry risk, a placebo controlled fashion is used for this study</detailed_description>
