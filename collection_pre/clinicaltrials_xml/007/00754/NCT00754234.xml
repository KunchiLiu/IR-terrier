	<brief_summary>This study will measure nonheme iron absorption from each of the 7 daily MyPyramid menus. Such measurements will confirm whether modifications are needed to meet dietary iron recommendations and will provide data useful for validation algorithms to calculate dietary iron bioavailability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Bioavailability From MyPyramid Menus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonheme iron absorption is measured with 59Fe tracer added to a 1-day menu, with iron retention detected two weeks later in a whole body scintillation counter. Each subject has iron absorption measured from each of 7 1-d menus formulated to meet the US dietary guidelines (MyPyramid menus), with the order of menus randomly assigned. Each subject participates for 14 wk to test all 7 menus.</detailed_description>
