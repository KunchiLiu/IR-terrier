	<brief_title>L-Carnitine L-Tartrate in Preventing Peripheral Neuropathy Caused By Chemotherapy in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate the tolerability and usefulness of the dietary supplement, L-carnitine L-tartrate, in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in women with metastatic breast cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral L-carnitine L-tartrate twice daily beginning on day 2 of the first course of chemotherapy and continuing until after completion of 4 courses of chemotherapy. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily beginning on day 2 of the first course of chemotherapy and continuing until after completion of 4 courses of chemotherapy. Patients complete questionnaires periodically to assess neuropathy, pain, fatigue, sleep, and activities of daily living. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
