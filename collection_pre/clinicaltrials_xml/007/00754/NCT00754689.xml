	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of rimonabant/metformin combinations in Glycosylated Hemoglobin 1c (A1C) reduction over the corresponding single agent metformin and over rimonabant alone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at 9 months. The secondary objective is to investigate the effects of rimonabant/metformin combinations for reducing fasted plasma glucose, body weight and triglycerides, and raising High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) in comparison with metformin at 9 months. Another objective is to evaluate the safety of rimonabant in combination with metformin over a period of up to 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
