	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare aesthetic results of two different type of sutures (subcuticular versus synthetic glue) in post-thyroidectomy incisions. It is a randomized clinical trial (single blinded) designed as a superiority study, since in the authors' hypotheses glue can give better results compared with subcuticular suture in this particular district. Secondary objective is to investigate if other factors (like the use of cold/warm blade, the sex, the presence of diabetes, the lenght of incision) can influence aesthetic results.</brief_summary>
