	<brief_title>A Phase II Study to Assess Acute Toxicity and Quality of Life of Patients With Carcinoma of the Anal Canal Receiving Chemotherapy and Radiation Using Helical Tomotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II study using tomotherapy for radiation treatment delivery along with concurrent 5-FU/mitomycin C for the treatment of T2-T4 cancer of the anal canal. They hypothesis is that helical tomotherapy could minimize radiation related toxicity by avoiding or limiting doses to structures such as small bowel, external genitalia, skin, bladder, rectum, and femoral neck and head. This is expected to limit or reduce treatment related toxicity and hence prevent or reduce treatment breaks. This may result in delivery of radical treatment with better local control and treatment outcome than using the current radiation treatment technique at our center.</detailed_description>
