	<brief_title>Exploratory Cognition Study of Sertindole in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive deficits, including impairments in areas such as memory, attention, and executive function, are major determinants and predictors of long-term disability in schizophrenia. At present, available antipsychotic medications are relatively ineffective in improving cognition. However, scientific discoveries during the past decade suggest that it may be possible to develop medications that are effective in improving cognition in schizophrenia. One of the important reasons to focus on cognitive deficits as a target for pharmacological treatment, is the association found between cognitive impairment and social dysfunction observed in patients with schizophrenia. Pervasive cognitive deficits have a limiting effect on the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia including social interaction and problem solving, community living, and employment prospects.</detailed_description>
