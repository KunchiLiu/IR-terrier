	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this non interventional study is to assess the independent prognostic role on overall survival of primary tumour 18F-FDG uptake value (SUVmax) measured on 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) in patients with non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancers treated with curative intent, taking into account the other conventional prognostic factors (performance status, age, sex, disease stage).</brief_summary>
