	<brief_title>Study on Metabolic Parameters of Sertindole in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is estimated to be around 20-25% of the population and is particularly high in patients with schizophrenia. Individuals with metabolic syndrome are twice as likely to die from, and three times as likely to suffer from a heart attack or stroke compared to individuals without the syndrome. Patients on atypical antipsychotic medication should be considered a high risk group for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight gain is common in patients taking neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics, and excessive body weight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
