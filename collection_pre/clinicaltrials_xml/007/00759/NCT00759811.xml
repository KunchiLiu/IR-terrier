	<brief_title>METhotrexate Therapy Effects in the Physical Capacity of Patients With ISchemic Heart Failure (METIS Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies have showed the importance of proinflammatory mediators in the heart failure. However, there is a lack of benefit of therapies that tried to neutralize these mediators. Methotrexate has adenosine-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Methotrexate limits infarct size via this adenosine-dependent mechanisms in heart of dogs (J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 2004 Apr;43(4):574-9). A recent trial showed that this drug reduced proinflammatory mediators in patients with heart failure (Am Heart J. 2006 Jan;151(1):62-8). These data suggest that methotrexate may improve physical capacity in patients ischemic heart failure reducing inflammation, but a randomized clinical trial is necessary to prove it.</detailed_description>
