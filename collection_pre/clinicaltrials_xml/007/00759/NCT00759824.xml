	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine if the addition of valproic acid to a combination of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and vindesine could increase progression-free survival in patients relapsing after first-line chemotherapy including platinum derivatives, cisplatin or carboplatin, and etoposide.</brief_summary>
