	<brief_summary>Impaired mobility is a major health problem affecting many subjects with diabetes mellitus. It is associated with loss of quality of life and it is a strong predictor for poor health outcomes. Reduced lower extremity muscle function, as a consequence of diabetic polyneuropathy, is a major cause of impaired mobility. We hypothesize that a programme of resistance training will counterbalance the effects of polyneuropathy on muscle wasting, and will improve mobility and associated quality of life. The objective of this study is to develop a resistance training intervention that improves mobility and quality of life in diabetic patients. It is also our intension to achieve a better understanding of the relation between diabetic neuropathy and muscle weakness, limited mobility and quality of life. Moreover, insight will be gained in optimizing training programmes for neuropathic patients.</brief_summary>
