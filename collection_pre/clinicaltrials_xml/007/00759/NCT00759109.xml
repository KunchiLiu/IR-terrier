	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the role of peginterferon α-2b (50 μg/week) vs. control (no treatment) in the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma, in adult patients with cirrhosis and initial signs of portal hypertension who did not respond to previous combined therapy with interferon alfa + ribavirin or peginterferon alfa + ribavirin or to interferon alfa monotherapy and with a high proliferation rate before entering the study. The duration of treatment will be 3 years, and the follow-up period will be 2 years.</brief_summary>
