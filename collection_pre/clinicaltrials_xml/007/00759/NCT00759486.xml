	<brief_title>Pediatric Facial Fracture Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, long-term, comprehensive growth and development study of the pediatric craniofacial skeleton following fracture. This study will encompass two specific aims: 1. To compare the growth and development of the pediatric craniofacial skeleton after fracture to publish standardized means of dentofacial growth in the Bolton-Brush Growth Study. Patients will be matched according to age, gender, and ethnicity. The status of dental eruption will be recorded as well as the vertical and anteroposterior classification of occlusion. The effect of trauma on the eruption and vitality of permanent teeth will be recorded. We will further assess the popularly held theories of craniofacial growth and effects of injury to various facial growth sites (i.e. mandibular condyles, nasal septum). 2. Attempt to evaluate the effects of various treatment modalities of facial fracture on skeletal growth and development (i.e. open reduction and internal fixation versus closed reduction and external fixation), (open reduction and internal fixation with metallic vs. absorbable fixation). We will evaluate the effect of metallic internal fixation on subsequent craniofacial skeletal growth and development, as well as the routine needed for its removal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria for inclusion in the research study will be any pediatric patient, birth to 18 years, who are in the active phase of craniofacial skeletal growth, and have sustained a craniofacial fracture. The racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subject population reflects the demographics of the University of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area and/or the patient population of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The investigators shall attempt to recruit subjects in respective proportion to these demographics. No exclusion criteria shall be based on race, ethnicity, gender or HIV status. Criteria for exclusion in the research study will be any pediatric patient, birth to 18 years, who are not in the active phase of craniofacial skeletal growth, and have not sustained a craniofacial fracture.</criteria>
