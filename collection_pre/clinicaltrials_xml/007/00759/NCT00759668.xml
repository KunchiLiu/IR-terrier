	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is: - to compare visual parameters (Subjective refraction and Visual Acuity (VA)) and safety (tilt, decentration and posterior chamber opacification (PCO)) in a prospective series of 40 patients after bilateral implantation of AcrySof Natural ReSTOR (Model SN60D3) or AcrySof Natural Monofocal (Model SN60AT) - to assess patient satisfaction before and after implant</brief_summary>
