	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that reducing the release of free fatty acids (FFA) from fat cells will restore insulin-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation in people with the metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Free Fatty Acid Reduction on Vascular Function in the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that acipimox, by decreasing plasma FFA concentrations, will augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation in conduit vessels and insulin-mediated vasodilation in forearm resistance arterioles in vivo, whole-body insulin sensitivity, and AKT (also known as Protein Kinase B) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation in skin biopsy specimens ex vivo, when compared with placebo.</detailed_description>
