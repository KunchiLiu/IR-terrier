	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of three different vasodilators including diltiazem, verapamil and nitroglycerin for reversal of no-reflow/slow-flow during direct percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Different Vasodilators on Coronary No-reflow During primAry percuTaneous Coronary intErvention in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No-reflow/slow-flow is a frequent observation during direct PCI for AMI and associated with a poor clinical outcome. The present pharmacological management involves the use of different vasodilators including nitrates, verapamil, adenosine and nicorandil. But no randomized trial has been conducted to assess any of these agents, or to determine the appropriate dosage. This prospective randomized study aimed to confirm favorable effects of diltiazem on no-reflow/slow-flow during direct PCI for AMI compared with verapamil and nitroglycerin.</detailed_description>
