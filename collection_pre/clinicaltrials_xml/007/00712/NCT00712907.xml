	<brief_summary>High arterial blood oxygen tension leads to vasoconstriction of retinal vessels, possibly related to an interaction between reactive oxygen species and endothelium-derived vasoactive factors. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant capable of reversing endothelial dysfunction due to increased oxidant stress. Vitamin C appears to have vasodilatory properties, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study we hypothesized that hyperoxic vasoconstriction of retinal vessels could be diminished by vitamin C. Ocular blood flow will be determined by non-invasive methods, including laser Doppler velocimetry and the Zeiss retinal vessel analyser.</brief_summary>
