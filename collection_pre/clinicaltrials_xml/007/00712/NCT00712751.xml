	<brief_summary>We know that treatment for rectal, colorectal or anal cancer can impact sexual function. This study aims to learn: - How the treatment affects emotional and social well-being. - How a new sexual health educational program affects you. Cancer patients seek education for lots of reasons. It often helps them cope because they can express their feelings with a trained professional. This study is open to individuals who have been treated for rectal, colorectal or anal cancer. It involves a new type of sexual health counseling program. It will teach participants skills that they can use to improve their sex lives. These skills may also improve physical and emotional well-being. We will compare the new type of sexual health program with the standard care patients receive after treatment for rectal, colorectal or anal cancer.</brief_summary>
