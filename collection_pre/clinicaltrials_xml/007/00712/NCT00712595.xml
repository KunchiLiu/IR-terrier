	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to estimate the efficacy and safety of the daily administration of mifepristone 5 mg versus 10 mg for three months for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The hypothesis of the study is that both mifepristone doses reduce the volume of the myoma in about 40% after 3 months of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone for Treatment of Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women, in fertile age or in premenopausal status, presenting symptomatic uterine fibroids were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg or 10 of mifepristone. The diminishing of prevalence of symptoms attributable to uterine fibroids is the most important goal to achieve under both treatments. The possible side effects of mifepristone are slight and women's adherence to treatment is remarkable. Also the reduction of the volumes of the uterus and fibroids contribute to enhance the wellbeing of subjects.</detailed_description>
