	<brief_summary>- DermaVir is a plasmid DNA-containing synthetic nanomedicine. It is administered topically with DermaPrep to target Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells with DermaVir migrate to lymph nodes and express HIV-like particles that induce immune responses to kill HIV-infected cells. - Hypothesis: Single DermaVir immunization is safe and immunogenic measured by induction of HIV-specific precursor/memory T cell responses. - GIHU004 was a phase I dose escalation study conducted in Hungary. It evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of three dosing regimens of topical DermaVir immunization for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals on fully suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single DermaVir Immunization in HIV-1 Infected Patients on HAART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enrolled nine HIV-infected adult subjects in three sequential dose cohorts. All had durable suppression of HIV-RNA on HAART over the previous 6 months and CD4 count over 300 cells/mm3. Subjects, received on study Day 0 a single DermaVir immunization: - Low dose: 0.1 mg pDNA, 0.8 mL DermaVir administered under two DermaPrep patches. - Medium dose: 0.4 mg pDNA, 3.2 mL DermaVir administered under four DermaPrep patches. - High dose: 0.8 mg pDNA, 6.4 mL DermaVir administered under eight DermaPrep patches. Subjects were on study for a total of 28 days followed by a post-treatment safety follow-up for 48 weeks. HAART was not interrupted. All subjects completed the 28-day treatment and 48 weeks safety follow up phase.</detailed_description>

All subjects must not participate in a conception process (e.g. active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) and, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study volunteer/ partner must use two reliable methods of contraception simultaneously while receiving the protocolspecified vaccination and for 3 months after the last vaccination.
