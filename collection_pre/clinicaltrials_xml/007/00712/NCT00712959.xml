	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect additional immunogenicity and safety data on re-dosing with Tdap vaccine (ADACEL®) in a continuing effort to address the public health need to establish broader population immunity against pertussis, as well as diphtheria and tetanus. Primary Objective: - To assess immune response to Tdap vaccine (ADACEL®) one month after booster vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Received Tdap or TdapIPV vaccine in study TD9707 or TD9805. Never previously received Tdap vaccine and has not received any tetanus, diphtheria , or pertussiscontaining vaccine in the past 10 years. Participated in TD9707 or TD9805 but does not meet inclusion/ exclusion criteria or willing to undergo phlebotomy but not willing to receive Tdap (ADACEL®) vaccine. Signed Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved informed consent form Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures For a woman, a negative urine pregnancy test and the use of effective method(s) of contraception, or the inability to become pregnant Exclusion Criteria : Any condition listed as a contraindication in the ADACEL® Canadian product monograph Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine Chronic illness, at a stage that could interfere with trial conduct or completion, in the opinion of the investigator Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months, or longterm systemic (injected or oral) corticosteroid therapy. Individuals on a tapering dose schedule of oral steroids lasting less than 7 days may be included in the trial as long as they have not received more than 1 course within the last 2 weeks prior to enrollment Febrile illness (temperature ≥ 37.5°C [99.5°F]) at the time of inclusion History of documented diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus disease since participation in studies TD9707 or TD9805. Or history of documented diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus disease in the last 10 years. Known or suspected receipt of a diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanuscontaining vaccine since participation in study TD9707 or TD9805. For Group 2, known or suspected receipt of a diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanuscontaining vaccine in the last 10 years. Receipt of any vaccine, other than influenza vaccine, in the 28day period prior to Visit 1 or scheduled to receive any vaccine, other than influenza vaccine, in the period between Visit 1 and Visit 2. For influenza vaccine only, defer if received in the 14 days prior to enrollment or scheduled to receive prior to Visit 2. Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or a lifethreatening reaction after previous administration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same substances Unable to attend the scheduled visits or to comply with the study procedures In females of childbearing potential, known pregnancy or positive serum/urine pregnancy test Breastfeeding woman Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or a medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment. Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period Current alcohol or recreational drug use that may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with trial procedures Thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder, anticoagulation therapy contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination Subject deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized without his/her consent. Other events which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude vaccination at the time of Visit 1 For Group 3 History of documented diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus disease since participation in study TD9707 or TD9805 Known or suspected receipt of a diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanuscontaining vaccine since participation in study TD9707 or TD9805.</criteria>
