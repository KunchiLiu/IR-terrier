	<brief_title>Use of Cold and Compression Therapy With Total Knee Replacement Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of cryotherapy with compression for orthopedic postoperative recovery has not been fully investigated. A new device has been developed that combines cold and intermittent pneumatic compression in a single system. A well-controlled clinical study evaluating the clinical effectiveness of cryotherapy with compression in an orthopedic postoperative application is the subject of this protocol. Patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee and scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty procedure will be invited to participate in this study.</detailed_description>
