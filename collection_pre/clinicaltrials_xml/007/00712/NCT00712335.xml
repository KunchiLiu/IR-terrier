	<brief_title>The Effects of Montelukast on Smokers With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many smokers have insufficient control of their symptoms due to inefficacy of ICS in this subpopulation of asthmatics. Cigarette smoking has been shown to stimulate production of cysLTs. CysLTs could activate production of IL-8 for neutrophilia as well as cause eosinophilia in the airway of asthmatics. LTRAs are felt to be less efficacious than ICS in smokers with asthma. However, LTRA's unique mechanism of action could be particularly efficacious in preventing worsening symptoms and lung function for smokers with asthma. Given this, along with the fact that ICS are less effective in smokers, targeting cysLT could lead to significant clinical benefits for asthmatic smokers. Data from this study may possibly serve as crucial data for the significant clinical benefits for asthmatic smokers and determination of the mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in smokers with asthma.</detailed_description>
