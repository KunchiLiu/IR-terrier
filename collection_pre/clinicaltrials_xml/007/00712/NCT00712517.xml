	<brief_title>Propofol Versus Volatile Anesthesia in Post Operative Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing s stripping operation for varicose veins will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 patients will receive propofol anesthesia. Group 2 patients will receive sevoflurane anesthesia. Intraoperative measurements including mean-arterial pressure, heart rate, propofol infusion rate, remifentanil infusion rate, and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration will be taken at 15 minute intervals. Patients in both groups will receive Piritramid as necessary to control pain either intravenously or through patient controlled pump. VAS pain score, mean-arterial pressure, heart rate, nausea will be evaluated at 30 minute intervals during the first four postoperative hours. Piritramid dosage and vomiting will be recorded through the first postoperative morning. Patients will rate pain based on the VAS score for the period between leaving the recovery room and the first postoperative morning</detailed_description>
