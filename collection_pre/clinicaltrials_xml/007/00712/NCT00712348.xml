	<brief_title>Switchover Trial From Imiglucerase to Plant Cell Expressed Recombinant Human Glucocerebrosidase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, switchover trial to assess the safety of taliglucerase alfa in 30 patients with Gaucher disease who are currently being treated with imiglucerase (Cerezyme®) ERT. Eligible patients will enter a 12-week Stability Evaluation Period to establish the stability of their disease. Patients with stable disease will then be switched from their imiglucerase treatment to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of taliglucerase alfa every two weeks for a total of 20 IV infusions. The dose of taliglucerase alfa will be equal to each patient's previous imiglucerase dose. The infusions will be administered at the selected investigational site (clinic/hospital), infusion center, or at home. At the end of the 9-month treatment period (20 visits, 38 weeks) eligible patients will be offered enrollment in an open-label extension study.</detailed_description>
