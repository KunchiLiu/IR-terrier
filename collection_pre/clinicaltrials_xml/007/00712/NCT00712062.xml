	<brief_title>Study of Pemetrexed to Treat Recurrent or Progressive Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the aggressive upfront use of methotrexate-based chemotherapy, primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) almost uniformly results in recurrence or progression and death. Palliative chemotherapy offers an improvement in time-to-progression, symptom control, quality of life, and potentially, survival. However, no established chemotherapy regimen for recurrence exists and new treatments are needed. Pemetrexed is a rationale strategy for therapeutic palliation of recurrent or progressive PCNSL, given its mechanism of action, convenient administration, single agent efficacy, its well established management algorithms, and its evidence of safety and efficacy in systemic malignancies.</detailed_description>
