	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Chinese Herbal Therapy for Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide, particularly in westernized societies and has continued to increase in prevalence over the past two decades. Inhaled corticosteroids have become the first-line treatment for persistent asthma even though side effects have been reported. New asthma medications, including leukotriene inhibitors and anti-IgE, have shown limited benefits. Patients have increasingly turned to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for treatment of their asthma, despite the uncertainty of its benefits due a lack of well-controlled scientific studies. We have developed a Chinese herbal formula composed of 3 herbs called ASHMI. It has been previously shown in murine studies that ASHMI (a formula containing Ling Zhi, Ku Shen and Gan Cao) has therapeutic effects on the major pathogenic mechanisms of asthma-airway hyperreactivity, pulmonary inflammation, and airway remodeling, as well as a down-regulating of TH2 response. A subsequent study in 91 asthmatic patients in Weifang, China found ASHMI to be a safe and effective alternative to prednisone for treating asthma and exhibited a beneficial effect on TH1 and TH2 balance. Additionally, a Phase I study conducted in the United States showed good tolerability to ASHMI. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that ASHMI will be a safe medication in patients with asthma.</detailed_description>
