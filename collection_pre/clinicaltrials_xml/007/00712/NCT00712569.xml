	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about how patients who have looked up cancer-related information on the internet talk with their doctors. We are interested in these conversations even if the patients do not think they will talk about the information with their doctor during their visit. We will audio record doctor-patient visits and listen to these recordings to learn about how patients who have looked up cancer-related internet information talk to their doctors and how their doctors talk to them. We will also give patients questionnaires before and after their appointments to learn about what they think about communicating with their doctors.</brief_summary>
