	<brief_summary>The impact of different coordination patterns on team performance during anesthesia inductions are analyzed using videotapes. These records are examined using various categorization systems (ETHZ), focussing on changes of coordinative behaviour with shifting situational requirements. A rating system comprising multiple categories is used to evaluate team performance. An integrated simulator study facilitates validation of the rating system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adaptive Coordination in Anaesthesia Teams and Its Relationship to Clinical Performance.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video tapes and vital parameter readings are recorded with a setup allowing synchronized recordings. Thus, exact timing between events on different data channels can be determined. Data are analyzed for unforeseen events, technical performance, and team coordination / non-technical performance.</detailed_description>
