	<brief_summary>PET CT is one of the imaging tools that are used for staging of urological malignancies. C11 Choline is a novel isotope with the advantage of its minimal secretion in the urine. This advantage makes it a potentially better metabolic marker then others such as FDG. Preliminary studies showed ~95% sensitivity in the diagnosis of TCC. Our Goal is to continue the evaluation of this method as a diagnostic and follow up tool in different urological malignancies.</brief_summary>
