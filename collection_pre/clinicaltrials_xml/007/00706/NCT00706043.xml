	<brief_summary>Low back pain is a very common disease. Among the persons suffering of acute low back pain, about 10% are at risk of developping chronic pain. A screening questionnaire assessing this risk has been developed and validated in Swedish and English (Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire, Linton, 2003). The aim of our study is to validate a french translation of this questionnaire. Patients suffering from acute low back pain will be asked to fill in several questionnaires at day 0, and 6 and 12 month later.</brief_summary>
