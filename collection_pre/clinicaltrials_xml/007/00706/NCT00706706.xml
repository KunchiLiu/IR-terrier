	<criteria>Histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with metastases with a component of clear (conventional) cell histology that is not amenable to surgery. Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease Male or female, 18 years of age or older. ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Resolution of all acute toxic effects Adequate organ function. Renal cell carcinoma without any clear (conventional) cell component. Prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease of any kind of RCC, such as Interferon or Interleukin, chemotherapy, hormonal, investigational or targeted therapies. Patients may have received prior adjuvant therapy with Interferon and/or Interleukin if recurrence occurred &gt; 6 months after adjuvant therapy completion. Major surgery or radiation therapy &lt;4 weeks of starting the study treatment. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is at least one measurable lesion that has not been irradiated. NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage &lt;4 weeks of starting the study treatment. Diagnosis of any second malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ cervical cancer. History of or known brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease on screening CT or MRI scan. Any of the following within the 12 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and 6 months for pulmonary embolism. Preexisting thyroid abnormality with thyroid function that cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, or prolongation of the QTc interval to &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy). Ongoing treatment with therapeutic doses of Coumadin (low dose Coumadin up to 2 mg PO daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed). Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related illness. Current treatment on another clinical trial. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
