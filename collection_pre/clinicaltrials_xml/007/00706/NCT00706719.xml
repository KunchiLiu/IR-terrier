	<brief_title>To Evaluate Sperm Parameters in Men With Secondary Hypogonadism Previously Treated With Topical Testosterone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was designed to determine if Androxal® would affect sperm parameters (count, concentration, volume) in men with secondary hypogonadism who have been previously treated with topical testosterone. A maximum of twelve subjects per group were randomized to daily treatments of Androxal® or topical testosterone (Testim®) for six months. The protocol was later amended to include a treatment group who received Androxal after a 3 month wash out period.</detailed_description>
