	<brief_summary>Study of anatomical fixation with a 34mm proximal extension</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>34mm Cuff Study for Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 34mm proximal extension stent graft is intended to augment the primary 28mm infrarenal bifurcated stent graft to accommodate patient anatomy (neck diameters up to 32mm) and provide an effective seal to prevent/repair proximal Type I endoleaks.</detailed_description>
