	<brief_summary>CP-945598 is a potent and selective Cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor antagonist currently being developed for the treatment of obesity. CP-945598 is also being considered as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study will investigate the steady-state safety, toleration and pharmacokinetics of multiple oral dose administration of CP-945598. Results will be used to estimate the pharmacokinetic characteristics in NASH patients and underwrite the safety of this compound prior to any further studies in NASH patients.</brief_summary>
