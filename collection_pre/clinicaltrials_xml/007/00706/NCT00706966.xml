	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, may help in learning how well dutasteride works in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy and low-risk prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in patients receiving dutasteride for benign prostatic hypertrophy and low-risk prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging in Patients Receiving Dutasteride for Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy and Low-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether there is a decrease in the extent of prostate cancer as measured by endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy and low-risk prostate cancer treated with dutasteride for 6 months. Secondary - To monitor the effects of dutasteride on serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA). - To monitor the effects of dutasteride on symptom and quality-of-life indices. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily for 6 months. Patients undergo endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire, American Urological Association Symptom Index, Functional Alterations due to Changes in Elimination, and Spitzer Quality-of-Life Index at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate Clinical stage T1b, T1c, or T2a disease Gleason score ≤ 6 Maximal prostatespecific antigen (PSA) &lt; 10 ng/mL Demonstrates intraprostatic metabolite abnormalities, consistent with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (i.e., ≥ 3 voxels with magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging [MRSI] scores 45) by baseline MRI and MRSI Has symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy and is currently undergoing watchful waiting OR opting to undergo permanent seed implant (i.e., brachytherapy), but requires neoadjuvant androgen suppression for prostate shrinkage No regional lymph node involvement No evidence of distant metastases Zubrod performance status 01 Able to swallow and retain oral medications Other prior or concurrent invasive cancer, other than localized basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Contraindications to MRI/MRSI, including any of the following: Prostate biopsy (within the past 8 weeks) and any continued postbiopsy bleeding Rectal bleeding Anal fissures Rectal surgery (endtoend anastomosis) Inflammatory bowel disease Prior radical prostatectomy Hip replacement Certain types of penile implants Vascular clips Known anaphylactic reaction to latex compounds Anticoagulant drugs Severe claustrophobia Cardiac pacemaker Metal in eye Any other metallic or foreign object in the body Unstable serious comorbidities including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, coronary artery syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident Major medical or psychiatric illness that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude the completion of treatment and interfere with follow up Known hypersensitivity to any 5αreductase inhibitor or drug chemically related to the study drug Prior radical surgery (prostatectomy) or cryosurgery for prostate cancer Prior pelvic irradiation, prostate brachytherapy, or bilateral orchiectomy Prior or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer Prior hormonal therapy, such as luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists (e.g., goserelin or leuprolide acetate), antiandrogens (e.g., flutamide or bicalutamide), or estrogens (e.g., diethylstilbestrol) Prior or concurrent finasteride, dutasteride, other drugs with known antiandrogenic properties (e.g., spironolactone or progestational agents), or any dietary or herbal supplement (e.g., selenium, vitamin E, saw palmetto, or PCSPES)</criteria>
