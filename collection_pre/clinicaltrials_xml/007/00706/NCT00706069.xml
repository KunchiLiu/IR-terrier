	<brief_title>Vinorelbine Oral Plus Capecitabine Combination In Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination capecitabine-vinorelbine, with iv administration of vinorelbine, has been studied in a phase [I]/[II], with favourable profile of toxicity in pretreated patients with anthracyclines and/or taxanes (Oncology News International vol 12, no 3, suppl 2, 2003). In a study of toxicity and effectiveness, Vanhopher reported objective response rates (PR) in 21 from 45 patients (47%) and stabilization of disease (SD) in 16 patients (36%). Severe leucopenia (grade 4), was reported in 5% of patients (Borquez D, et al: Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 19: Abstract 420, 2000)</detailed_description>
