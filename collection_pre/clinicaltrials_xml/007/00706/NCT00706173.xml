	<brief_summary>Developing novel and effective pharmacologic interventions for this post-traumatic stress disorder is important. The investigators propose to replicate findings of an earlier published pilot study using low dose hydrocortisone as a treatment for PTSD. In order to do so in a more meaningful way, the investigators will conduct a larger but similar randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over design treatment study examining the use of low dose hydrocortisone (or placebo) for 4 weeks in combat veterans suffering from PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that, as described by Aerni et al. (2004), administration of daily hydrocortisone will lead to a reduction in PTSD symptom severity, but particularly for re-experiencing types (e.g., flashbacks, nightmares)of symptoms. The investigators also hope to examine potential predictors and moderators of treatment response based on subjects' clinical characteristics, as well as serum cortisol and ACTH levels.</brief_summary>
