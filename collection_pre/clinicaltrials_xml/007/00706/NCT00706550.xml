	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the best timing for administering pneumococcal vaccine (PV) to HIV-infected adults that have CD4 cell counts of more than 200 and are not yet receiving combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). Participants in this study will be assigned by chance to receive vaccination with PV prior to starting ART or after at least 6 months of ART. Antibody levels to components of the PV will be measured at 6 months and 12 months after vaccination. The results will tell us if patients that receive PV after 6 months of ART have better response to the vaccine than those that get vaccinated prior to treatment.</brief_summary>
