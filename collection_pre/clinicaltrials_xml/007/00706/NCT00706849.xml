	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether mipomersen safely and effectively lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who are already on a stable dose of other lipid-lowering agents (including maximally tolerated statin therapy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of ISIS 301012 (Mipomersen) as Add-on in Familial Hypercholesterolemic Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of lipoprotein metabolism characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C, premature onset of atherosclerosis and development of xanthomata. Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia typically have total plasma cholesterol between 350 to 550 mg/dL and disease onset in their third and fourth decade. Mipomersen (ISIS 301012) is an antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called apolipoprotein B (apo-B). Apo-B plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream. High LDL-C is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other diseases of blood vessels. It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart attacks and other major adverse cardiovascular events. This study consisted of a 26-week treatment period and a 24-week post-treatment follow-up period (with the exception of patients who enrolled in the open-label extension study [Study 301012-CS6; NCT00694109]). The treatment period spanned the time during which the study treatment was administered until the later of the primary efficacy time point (PET) or 14 days beyond the last day of study drug administration. The post-treatment follow-up period began the day after completion of the treatment period and ended on the day of the patient's last contact date within the study. Following treatment and Week 28 evaluations, eligible patients who tolerated study drug could elect to enroll in an open-label extension study (301012-CS6). Patients who were not eligible for or who elected not to enroll in the open-label extension study and patients who discontinued during the 26-week treatment period were followed in this study for an additional 24 weeks from administration of the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>
