	<brief_summary>This study is looking at the effects of certain long-acting bronchodilators on patients with asthma who have specific genetic variations. The investigators are interested in a certain common genetic variation in the receptor for beta-agonists, which is found in as many of one-sixth of the population. There is evidence that patients with asthma who have this variation may not do as well when treated with albuterol on a regular basis. The investigators will be looking at whether patients with this variation have more asthma exacerbations over the course of a year when treated with salmeterol or formoterol, which are long-acting forms of albuterol; and whether these patients have fewer exacerbations when treated with tiotropium, which is a different long-acting bronchodilator that does not act at this receptor. In both groups patients will also be receiving inhaled steroids.</brief_summary>
