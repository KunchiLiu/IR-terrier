Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study. Administration of an influenza vaccine within 1 year preceding the study start. Administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccine during the entire study Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within 1 year preceding the study start History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Not stabilized or clinically serious chronic underlying disease. Lactating female. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study</criteria>
