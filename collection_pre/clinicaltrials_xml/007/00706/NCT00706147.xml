	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will be to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of arimoclomol in subjects with SOD1 positive familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This type of ALS is HEREDITARY (runs in families), and at least one other person in the family must have had ALS. Study hypotheses: Arimoclomol, taken at a dose of 200 mg three times daily will improve survival as defined by time to death, tracheostomy or permanent assisted ventilation. In addition, it will be safe and well tolerated in subjects with SOD1 positive familial ALS. Funding Source - FDA-OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/III Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial of Arimoclomol in SOD1 Positive Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a seamless, adaptive, phase II/III design, the investigators will determine the safety and efficacy of arimoclomol in patients with SOD1 positive familial ALS. Both stage-1 and stage-2 are randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled in a population of patients with rapidly progressive SOD1 positive familial ALS. Patients with ALS, a history of a relative affected with ALS (i.e. familial ALS) and the presence of a demonstrable mutation in the SOD1 gene that is known to be associated with rapidly progressive disease, will be eligible for inclusion in this study. Potentially eligible subjects will undergo screening via telephone and, if necessary, review of outside medical records. The intervention will continue for up to 12 months. In the event that a participant reaches a study endpoint (e.g. tracheostomy or permanently assisted ventilation) study drug will be terminated. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will travel a study site for final eligibility determination, baseline evaluation and will then be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or arimoclomol at a dose of 200 mg t.i.d. Participants will then be evaluated again in person at a study site at Month-2. Subsequent telephonic evaluations at Month-3, -4, -5, -6, -8, and -10 will be performed in participants' homes. Safety and tolerability evaluations will be performed at each of these visits. Collection of blood samples for safety laboratory analyses and measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and weight will be performed at Months -1, -3, -5, -6, -8, and -10 in the participant's home by a representative of a medical monitoring company. A study coordinator may perform an in-person visit at Month-12, or this visit may occur telephonically. A final evaluation will be performed via telephone at Month -13 (30 days after the last dose of study medication).</detailed_description>

Presence of any of the following clinical conditions: Substance abuse within the past year. Unstable cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, hematologic, or active infectious disease. AIDS or AIDSrelated complex. Unstable psychiatric illness defined as psychosis (hallucinations or delusions), untreated major depression within 90 days of the screening visit. Positive pregnancy test at screening visit. Screening laboratory values: Creatinine greater than 1.5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspartate aminotransferase (AST). greater than 3.0 times the upper limit of normal. Total bilirubin greater than 2.0 times the upper limit of normal.
