	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter crossover study to determine the oral bioavailability of new ABT-263 formulations relative to that of the current ABT-263 formulation being administered in ongoing Phase 1/2a studies. Approximately 36 evaluable subjects with lymphoid malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and solid tumors will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>
