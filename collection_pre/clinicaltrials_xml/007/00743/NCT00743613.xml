	<brief_title>Predicting Peripheral Arterial Disease in Men With Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complaint in the primary care office. It is frequently found in men with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes, and may also be an early warning of peripheral arterial disease. We looked for a relationship between the degree of ED and the presence of PAD as measured by the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) associated with co-morbid conditions. Men over the age of 50 with hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or tobacco use were asked to complete a Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). An ABI was measured using a hand held Doppler. 175 men from two urban and three suburban Family Practices in Tidewater Virginia participated. Outcome measures included SHIM scores, ABI, Systolic Blood Pressure, LDL, Hemoglobin A1C and tobacco use. Moderate or severe erectile dysfunction (SHIM &lt; 11.0) was identified in 44% of participants. More than 12.5% of men with severe ED (SHIM &lt; 7.0) had an ABI positive for PAD at 0.95 or less. The results were adjusted for the presence of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use. Men with hypertension did not demonstrate a significant increase in the frequency of PAD compared to diabetics or smokers. Neither race nor age was found to increase the prevalence of ED. The complaint of erectile dysfunction in men over age 50 should prompt a physician to consider peripheral arterial disease. A simple self-administered SHIM test should help identify men at risk for PAD and suggest further evaluation if the score is 7.0 or less.</detailed_description>
