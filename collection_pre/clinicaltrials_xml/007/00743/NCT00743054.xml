	<detailed_description>Due to the lack of specific indicators for the early diagnosis of RCC, the RCC patients often have distant metastasis when diagnosed and their five-year survival rate is much low. Therefore, the biological markers of RCC are needed for early detection, early treatment and improvement of the survival rate of RCC patients. MiRNA and tumor are closely related. MiRNA can control the important cancer-related genes and participate in the tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and angiogenesis. In this study, RCC related miRNA and the target genes of related miRNA will be examined,and the relationship between RCC related miRNA and the RCC pathological types, TNM (tumor-nodes-metastasis) stages and prognosis will be analyzed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of miRNA in the formation of RCC and look for the biomarker of RCC.</detailed_description>
