	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography lymphoscintigraphy, may help lower the dose of radiation therapy after surgery, and help prevent lymphedema. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography lymphoscintigraphy followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy to see how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage I or stage II breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To assess the feasibility of integrating Philips Precedence SPECT/CT® images with GE PET/CT Fusion software to reduce radiation dosimetry delivered to lymph nodes draining the arm in patients after surgery for stage I or II breast cancer. - To examine the differences in radiation dosimetry in these patients using 3-D conformal radiotherapy with vs without the Philips Precedence SPECT/CT®. - To compare reduction in lymph node radiation dosimetry in these patients using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) with 3-D conformal radiotherapy vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive filtered technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) intradermally and undergo single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) imaging at the time of TcSC and 2 hours after injection. Patients then undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the whole breast, including the low axilla and lymph nodes identified by the Phillips Precedence SPECT/CT® at a dose determined by computer analysis of the imaging information. Patients complete a lymphedema screening questionnaire at baseline and at 12 and 24 months after treatment.</detailed_description>
