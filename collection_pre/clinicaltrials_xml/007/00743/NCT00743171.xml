	<detailed_description>Study period between 1/2/2000 and 31/12/2003 Follow-up until 31/12/2007 Patient will be stratified according to adherence to HS during the first 2 postoperative years Good adherent patient: patient performed ≥ 80% of predicted HS within 24 months Moderate adherent patient: patient performed ≥ 50% of predicted HS within 24 months Non-adherent patient: patient performed &lt; 50% of predicted HS within 24 months. Primary outcome measure graft loss at end of follow-up Secondary outcome measure number of acute rejections during follow-up number of hospitalisation during follow-up Incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome during follow-up</detailed_description>
