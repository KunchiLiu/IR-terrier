	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of a diet rich in palm olein, a fraction of palm oil, to a diet rich in olive oil and a diet rich in Danish lard on plasma total-, LDL and HDL cholesterol as well as triacylglycerol (TAG), fasting insulin and glucose, C reactive protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in healthy men. The investigators hypothesis is that palm olein and olive oil will have the same effect on plasma total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL concentration and maybe also on the secondary outcome parameters that are related to cardiovascular disease risk. This may be caused by the differences in the sn-positioning of palmitic acid in palm olein. This difference may cause the palmitic acid in palm olein to be more prone to soap formations and excretion than palmitic acid from other sources, e.g. lard. This study is a double blinded, randomized, controlled 3 x 3 week crossover intervention study, without washout periods. The participants receive the three test foods in random order, decided by draw of lots. Blood samples are drawn in duplicate (on two following days) before and after each dietary period.</brief_summary>
