	<brief_title>Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Ozarelix in Patients With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients who meet the entry IPSS inclusion criteria at Week 0 will be randomized and enroll in the double-blind treatment period. Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms and will receive two 6-month courses of study drug administered on Days 0 and 14 of each 6-month course. Treatment arms include: ozarelix 30mg + 15mg, ozarelix 15mg + 15mg or placebo + placebo. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at defined intervals throughout the study. At Week 52 all patients on study will be eligible to receive ozarelix for two additional courses in the open-label treatment period.</detailed_description>
