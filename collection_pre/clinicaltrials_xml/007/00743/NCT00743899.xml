	<brief_title>Conservative Versus Aggressive Revascularization in Patients With Intermediate Lesions Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Angiography Guidance Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate whether conservative revascularization using criteria of 70% diameter stenosis would be non-inferior to aggressive revascularization using criteria of 50% diameter stenosis in coronary intermediate lesions, we conducted the Conservative Revascularization versus Aggressive Revascularization for Coronary Stenting with Everolimus-Eluting Stents (SMART-CASE) trial.</detailed_description>
