	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to get information from volunteers without cancer and patients with cancer who have received a new investigational study agent called, "[F-18] RGDK5," to evaluate biodistribution and dosimetry for the study agent and determine F-18 RGD-K5 uptake in angiogenic tumor. the system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory, Phase 0 Study of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging Agent, F-18 RGD-K5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[F-18]RGD-K5 is being investigated as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for the detection and localization of angiogenesis tissue or lesions supporting the application and role of integrins in anti-angiogenic therapies to benefit patients with cancer and inflammatory diseases. The primary objectives of this exploratory study are: - To gain information on biodistribution of [F-18]RGD-K5, and to evaluate the PET images with [F-18]RGD-K5 for resolution, signal to background ratio and for the detection and localization of angiogenesis tissue. This Exploratory Investigational New Drug (EIND) study is designed to obtain preliminary imaging and fundamental biodistribution, metabolism and safety information to demonstrate early proof of concept. The information collected under this study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management for the subject.</detailed_description>

For Cancer Subjects (first three bullets the same as 'normals') Subject is &lt; 18 at the time of investigational product administration Female subject is pregnant or nursing: by testing on site at the institution (serum or urine ßHCG) Subject is unable to remain still for duration of imaging procedure Subject has known hyper or hypocoagulation syndromes.
