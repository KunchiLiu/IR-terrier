	<brief_title>Influence of Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF) on Healing of Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) Tear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous platelet-rich matrices may aid in the healing of ligaments &amp; tendons by promoting and accelerating tissue healing because of the release of growth factors including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) from platelet alpha-granules.</detailed_description>
