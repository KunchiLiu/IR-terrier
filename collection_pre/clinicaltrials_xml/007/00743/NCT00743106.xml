	<brief_summary>This trial will study the effects of fenoldopam on renal function in patients who have a single kidney undergoing surgery to remove part of that kidney secondary to renal cell carcinoma. The investigators will monitor and evaluate throughout the perioperative course the kidney function. Normally kidney function is predicted to show a worsening followed by an improvement after surgery. The investigators want to specifically identify if the use of fenoldopam lessens the injury to the kidney with this surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Fenoldopam in Solitary Partial Nephrectomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, blinded study-dividing patients into one of two groups: fenoldopam or placebo. The infusion will commence after placing the patient in a lateral/flex position during the operation. The infusion will continue for a total of 24 hours.Study time period will be approximately six weeks from the date of surgery. Specifically, the following pre- and post operative laboratory results will be recorded if available: . Basic metabolic panel - pre-op, post op days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks - Serum osmolality, urine osmolality, urine sodium - pre-op, post op days 1, 3 - Glomerular filtration rate - pre-op, post op days 1, 3, and 6 weeks</detailed_description>
