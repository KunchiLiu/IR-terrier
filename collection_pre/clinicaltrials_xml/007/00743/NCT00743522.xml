	<brief_summary>Although shock therapy is effective in terminating ventricular tachycardia (VT), it can be painful to the patient and repetitive shocks can decrease a patient's quality of life. Previous studies have suggested that one or more sets of aggressive device parameter settings may reduce the total number of shocks in primary prevention patients. In addition to shock therapies, antitachycardia pacing (ATP) is also available in ICDs to treat VT. The PROVIDE trial aims to prospectively study the effect of high detection rates, prolonged detection intervals, aggressive SVT discriminators, and extensive ATP therapy in prolonging the time to first shock in primary prevention patients.</brief_summary>
