	<brief_title>Impact Study of Community Based Treatment of Neonatal Infection by Health Extension Workers on Neonatal Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although 44% of neonatal deaths in Ethiopia are due to infection, access to treatment for neonatal infections is very low for most families. Even though the newly adapted Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) package includes assessment of newborns, if a baby has any danger signs that may be suggestive of infection and is taken to health posts, the baby is to be referred to hospital for treatment. Given that only about 5% of neonatal deaths occur in hospitals and the distance to hospital is often far and the costs prohibitive, very few babies are likely to receive essential lifesaving antibiotics. Evidence from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal demonstrates that community health workers can effectively manage neonatal infections at home. However it is not known whether and community-based management of neonatal infections is effective, feasible and acceptable in the Ethiopian context. Local evidence regarding lives saved and cost is required in order to inform health policy and programming regarding community-based treatment of neonatal infections.</detailed_description>
