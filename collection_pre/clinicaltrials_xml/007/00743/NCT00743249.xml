	<brief_title>Punctal Plug Study to Determine the Safety and Retention Times of Various Lengths of Canalicular Stents in Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 6 visits conducted over a period of 3 months. At Visit 1 (Day 0), the canalicular stent was inserted. If the stent insertion failed, the subject was rescheduled for insertion at the Day 2 visit. If the stent insertion was not successfully completed by the end of the Day 2 visit, the subject was discontinued from the study. Any subject who had the stent inserted but lost the stent (noticed or unnoticed) after the Day 2 Visit was considered to have completed the study.</detailed_description>
