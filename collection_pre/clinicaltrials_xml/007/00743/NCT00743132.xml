	<brief_summary>ARF is a frequent event after hepatic resection and therefore clinically highly relevant. There is limited evidence on the incidence of postoperative ARF and its clinical relevance in patients undergoing liver resection. This study will evaluate the incidence of acute renal failure (ARF) after liver resection and its impact on postoperative mortality.</brief_summary>
