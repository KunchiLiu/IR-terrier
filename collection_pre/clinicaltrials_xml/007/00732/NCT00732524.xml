	<detailed_description>This study is an open label randomized controlled trial in adult DM2 patients seen in ED services at John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County serving a largely uninsured/underserved population. Individuals more than 18 years of age with DM2, either with new onset DM2 or known diabetics who did not take oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 2 weeks, presenting with fasting blood glucose (FBG) 300-500 mg/dl or random blood glucose (RBG) 400-700 mg/dl and who did not have any exclusion criteria listed in Table 1, were eligible for the study. Subjects were randomized to one of the two fixed dose treatment groups: 1) Glipizide XL 10 mg orally daily prior to breakfast (G group), 2) Glipizide XL 10 mg orally daily along with Insulin Glargine 10 units at bedtime, subcutaneously (G+G group).</detailed_description>
