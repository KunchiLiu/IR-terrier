	<brief_summary>Intraoperative blood loss is a major concern during hepatic resection, as it has been shown to adversely affect patients' perioperative outcome. Reduction of central venous pressure during parenchymal transection has been shown to effectively lower liver hemorrhage. While CVP reduction is mainly achieved via fluid restriction and diuretics, dehydration may impair organ function. Moreover, it may lead to hemodynamic instability, particularly in case of severe bleeding. For this reason the technique of infrahepatic inferior vena cava clamping has been suggested which is able to lower CVP without the need for fluid restriction. In the present study the two strategies to reduce CVP and by this intraoperative bleeding, namely fluid restriction and inferior vena cava clamping are compared with intraoperative blood loss as primary endpoint.</brief_summary>
