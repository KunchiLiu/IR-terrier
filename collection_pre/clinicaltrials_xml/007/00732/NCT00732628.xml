	<brief_title>Evaluating Outcomes in the Placement of Boomerang Percutaneous Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to document our experiences using the Boomerang closure device. Several different closure devices are used in the department of Radiology. A closure device is something that is placed in the artery in the leg just prior to removing the catheters from your leg at the end of the imaging or treatment procedure that is to be performed in the Department of Radiology. The devices used are all FDA approved. This study will compare the Boomerang device (a newer FDA approved device) to the other older devices currently being used. You may not have the Boomerang device used in your procedure; however, the Boomerang device is used in almost all of our patients undergoing a neuro imaging or treatment procedure. The neuroradiologist will determine which device if any is best for you based on the size of your artery, your medical condition etc. We will only collect data about you and your procedure if the Boomerang device is used.</detailed_description>
