	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the efficacy of peginterferon α-2b, compared to a control arm not receiving any maintenance treatment, in adult subjects with multiple myeloma who have responded to a prior induction therapy. Peginterferon α-2b will be given once weekly as an injection until disease progression or relapse, or for up to a maximum of 5 years (whichever occurs first).</brief_summary>
