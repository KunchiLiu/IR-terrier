	<brief_title>Is Topiramate Effective in Treating Dizziness in Patient's With Migraine-Associated Dizziness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine is a common disorder, often associated with dizziness symptoms. In many cases, dizziness is one of the only manifestations of migraine headaches. Various classes of drugs have been advocated as treatment for migraine-associated dizziness, though none has been shown to be superior over the others. Topiramate is a drug approved for migraine prophylaxis. This study is designed to assess if there are significant changes in dizziness frequency and severity in patients diagnosed with migraine-associated dizziness treated with topiramate. Demonstrating benefit of topiramate with a placebo-controlled study to alleviate symptoms of dizziness would serve to clarify effective treatment options for patients with migraine-associated dizziness.</detailed_description>
