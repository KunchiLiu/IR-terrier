	<brief_summary>The principal aim of this project is to determine the time course of development of contact lens and contact lens case contamination during daily wear of silicone hydrogel lenses. The secondary aim of the study is to determine whether the time course of development of contact lens and contact lens case contamination varies between two different contact lens care systems.</brief_summary>
