	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between 5-HT2R function, impulsivity and cue reactivity in cocaine dependent subjects and healthy controls and examine specific effects of escitalopram and mirtazapine on impulsivity and cue reactivity in human cocaine users.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: We will test the hypothesis that cocaine-dependent subjects will exhibit greater impulsivity than controls as determined by a battery of impulsivity measures and that impulsivity will be associated with specific profiles of 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression in platelets. We predict that treatment of cocaine-dependent subjects with escitalopram and/or mirtazapine will reduce impulsivity and cocaine-positive urines, in concert with a normalized balance of platelet 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression. Specific Aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that cocaine-dependent subjects will exhibit greater cue reactivity than controls as determined by a modified Stroop task, and that cue reactivity will be associated with specific profiles of 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression in platelets. We predict that treatment of cocaine-dependent subjects with escitalopram and/or mirtazapine will reduce cue reactivity and cocaine-positive urines, in concert with a normalized balance of platelet 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression. Specific Aim 3: We will test the hypothesis that specific polymorphisms in the 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR will predict baseline impulsivity and/or cue reactivity as well as treatment response to serotonergic medications in cocaine-dependent subjects.</detailed_description>
