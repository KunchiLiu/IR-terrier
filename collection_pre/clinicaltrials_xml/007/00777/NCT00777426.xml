	<brief_summary>A total of 60 participants will be enrolled. They will be in 3 groups 1. ARV-naïve, HIV-positive ≥ 20 year of age with HAD (n=25) who intend to start ARV 2. ARV-naïve, HIV-positive ≥ 20 year of age without HAD (n=25), who intend to start ARV 3. HIV-negative ≥ 20 year of age (n=10). The protocol team will work with the primary care physician to ensure that the subjects receive standard HIV and ARV care; however, initiation of ARV is not a requirement of the study and ARV will not be provided by the study. Participant accrual will include 10-15 participants per year. HIV-positive subjects will be tentatively enrolled in HAD vs. non-HAD groups by the enrolling neurologist and subsequently confirmed to that group by a consensus conference held every 6 months by the study neurologists. In cases of disagreement, cases will be re-assigned to the consensus conference determination and recruitment will continue. An external validation consensus conference will be conducted as well every 6-12 months to monitor correct assignment of the level of impairment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV-1 Specific Immune Responses in Thai Individuals With HIV Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This application focuses on the role of cellular immune responses in HIV dementia (HAD) versus non-HAD individuals in a cognitively characterized cohort followed for one year. Increasing evidence links strong CD4+ T helper function to robust CD8+ CTL responses. HIV-1-infected individuals who are able to maintain strong HIV-1 specific T cell responses have better clinical outcomes and rarely develop neurological signs or symptoms. Monocyte/macrophage (M/M) infiltration into the white matter of the brain is a hallmark of HAD; however, the mechanisms by which M/M are recruited to the brain are not clearly understood. We hypothesize that the loss of specific HIV-1 T cell response results in activation/dysregulation of M/M leading to their accumulation in the brain. To test this hypothesis will characterize Thai HIV-1-infected individuals as follows: 25 HAD individuals, 25 CD4-, education-, gender-, and age-matched non-HAD individuals and 10 HIV negative controls. We will then: 1) define CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function by evaluating HIV-1 specific responses in HAD vs. non-HAD groups; 2) simultaneously correlate these responses to M/M subpopulation cell number, percentage, and immune function; 3) correlate these responses to HIV-1 proviral load and autologous viral sequences (viral escape sequences and HIV quasispecies); and 4) evaluate the impact of ARV on dementia related to changes in immunological responses. Since little is known of the interaction between CD4+ T helper responses, CTL function, and the level of M/M subpopulation activation in the neuropathogenesis of HAD, this innovative study will elucidate the role of HIV-1 specific immune responses in HAD and provide new insights into HIV-1 neuropathogenesis and its relationship to peripheral immune responses, potentially opening exciting new areas for further investigation.</detailed_description>

Stable treated opportunistic infections on maintenance therapy, minor infections such as oral thrush and Kaposi's Sarcoma limited to the skin will be allowed. Current or recent fevers or meningeal signs suggestive of CNS opportunistic infection.* History of preexisting neurologic disease to include stroke, multiple sclerosis History of psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, or post traumatic stress disorder.
