	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how effective cediranib is in treating a brain tumour called recurrent glioblastoma. Two drugs are being tested in this study. Lomustine is an approved oral chemotherapy that belongs to the class of drugs called alkylating agents. Cediranib is a new drug that has not yet been approved for this disease. This study will compare the use of lomustine with cediranib, cediranib alone or lomustine with placebo ("inactive substance") to see whether the combination or cediranib alone will be more effective than the chemotherapy alone (lomustine) in preventing the growth of cancer cells.</brief_summary>
