	<brief_summary>NT 201, also known as IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®/Bocouture®), is a Botulinum toxin type A preparation free of complexing proteins (150 kiloDalton). Injected into the muscle, NT201 causes a reversible local relaxation of the injected muscle. Botulinum toxin type A is used for aesthetic treatment of mimic wrinkles and in the therapy of neurologic diseases. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy (non-inferiority) of NT 201 in comparison with OnabotulinumtoxinA (Vistabel®) in the treatment of glabellar frown lines.</brief_summary>
