	<brief_summary>The study will compared the effects of bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), obstructive sleep apnea current reference treatment, on diastolic blood pressure in untreated mildly hypertensive sleep apnea patients. The hypothesis is that blocking endothelin receptors with a drug will have the same systemic blood pressure lowering effect than nCPAP in sleep apnea patients.</brief_summary>
