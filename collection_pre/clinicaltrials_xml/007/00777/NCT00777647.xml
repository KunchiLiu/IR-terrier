	<brief_summary>Compared to solid foods, the nutritional energy of drinks may bypass the appetite regulation leading to obesity development. Although drinks sweetened with aspartame are available the anticipated positive effect of these drinks on obesity development has not been convincing. However, the mechanisms linking drinks intake to obesity are yet to be clarified. The investigators aim is to investigate the long-term effects of intake of soft drinks, milk and water. The study is a parallel, intervention trial with 80 overweight, healthy volunteers. They will be randomly selected to drink one liter a day of one of the four drinks for six months. The objectives are changes in numerous circulating metabolic risk factors, changes in body weight, anthropometric data and fat distribution (measured by DEXA, MRI and MR-spectroscopy). The investigators expect to clarify the mechanisms linking drinking habits to obesity development and provide scientifically based nutritional guidelines.</brief_summary>
