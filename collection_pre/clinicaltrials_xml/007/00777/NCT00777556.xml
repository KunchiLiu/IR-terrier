	<brief_title>Emergency Contraception Actual Use Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To simulate an over-the-counter (OTC) setting, each potential subject was expected to read the label text on the outside of the study package and determine whether and how to use the study product without provider direction or assistance. The study product, Plan B® 1.5, was to be dispensed only to those subjects who appropriately self-selected and indicated that they wanted to participate in the study and receive study product. Subjects could also appropriately self-select not to use the study product. Follow-up contact was to be conducted at approximately one, four, and eight weeks following the date the subject was dispensed study product. At these contacts, subjects answered questions regarding product use, health problems since last contact, and pregnancy status. Subjects were not to be permitted to enroll more than once in this Actual Use Study, however to assess repeat use of emergency contraceptives (EC) (use in addition to the study product) subjects were also queried at the one-, four-, and eight-week follow-up contacts regarding use of additional EC.</detailed_description>
