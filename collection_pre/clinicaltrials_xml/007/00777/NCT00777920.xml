	<brief_summary>This Phase 3, international, multicenter, open-label study will monitor the long-term safety of ambrisentan in adults with pulmonary hypertension. The available ambrisentan doses for this study are 5 or 10 mg administered orally once daily; the approved doses of ambrisentan in the United States, Canada, and the European Union are 5 and 10 mg. Investigators will be able to adjust ambrisentan dose as clinically indicated. A minimum of 4 weeks between dose adjustments is required. Participants receiving other therapies for pulmonary hypertension that are not contraindicated for concomitant use with ambrisentan are permitted to enroll in this study and continue to receive such therapies. Participants enrolled in this study will receive treatment with ambrisentan until such time as the investigator or participant chooses to stop ambrisentan treatment, ambrisentan becomes commercially available, or the Sponsor stops the study.</brief_summary>
