	<brief_summary>Preservation of fertility is limited. Current methods include embryo cryopreservation and while still experimental, ovarian cryopreservation. In single women who are at risk for infertility secondary to cancer or couples who have ethical reasons to avoid embryo cryopreservation, oocyte cryopreservation is an alternative Purpose of study is to compare slow freeze to vitrification of human oocytes. Successful cryopreservation and subsequent thawing programs are characterized by avoiding ice crystal formation.Vitrification, newer alternative to slow freeze method, process by which water is prevented from forming ice. Our hypothesis is that higher survival rate per oocyte is to be expected in the vitrification group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Slow-freezing to Vitrification of Oocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although several reviews of smaller studies of cryoprotectant methodology exist randomized controlled trials,comparing slow-freeze-rapid-thaw procedure to vitrification of oocytes, are not available. The purpose of this study is to compare these two methods of oocyte cryopreservation in human oocytes.</detailed_description>
