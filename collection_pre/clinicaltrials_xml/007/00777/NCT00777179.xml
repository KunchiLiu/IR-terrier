	<brief_summary>This study is multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase II study comparing vandetanib (300mg daily) plus best supportive care (BSC) to placebo plus BSC as maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have received and responded to prior platinum-doublet systemic chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study is to compare the Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 3 months in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with or without vandetanib maintenance.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (IIIbIV) at the time of original diagnosis. Completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy of gemcitabine (1,000 or 1250mg/m^2/day on day 1 and 8) and cisplatin (7080mg/m^2/day on day 1) every 3 weeks and have shown response, Complete Response(CR), Partial Response (PR) or stable disease (SD) by RECIST. WHO PS 01 No prior radiotherapy to chest, immunotherapy or biologic therapy Mixed small cell and non smallcell lung cancer history. Prior treatment with EGFR TKIs or VEGFR TKIs (prior treatment with cetuximab [Erbitux] or bevacizumab [Avastin] is not permitted.) Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent condition which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks before the start of study therapy. Major surgery within 4 weeks, or incomplete healed surgical incision before starting study therapy.</criteria>
