	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for liver cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To assess the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. (Phase I) - To assess the safety and efficacy of RT in these patients. (Phase II) - To generate reproducible peptide patterns of the serum proteome or specific serum sub proteomes in these patients. - To assess changes in the proteome or sub proteome patterns after RT in these patients. - To detect peptides that discriminate between before and after RT in these patients. - To identify these discriminating peptides in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients undergo radiotherapy (RT) once daily, five days a week, for 6 weeks. Intensity-modulated, 3-dimensional conformal, or fractionated stereotactic RT may be used. After completion of study therapy, patients in the phase I portion are followed for 1 year and patients in the phase II portion are followed for 3 years.</detailed_description>
