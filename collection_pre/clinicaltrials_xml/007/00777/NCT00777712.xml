	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this research is to utilize wound derived inflammatory cells from diabetic versus non diabetic human chronic wounds to understand mechanisms that are responsible for disregulated inflammation in individuals with diabetes. Biology of normal (peripheral blood derived cells) versus wound derived cells will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Underlying Impaired Diabetic Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aims: 1. To study biology of wound derived inflammatory cells and fluid from diabetic versus non diabetic wounds. 2. To characterize mechanisms that are responsible for dysregulated wound inflammatory cell function in individuals with diabetes. 3. To characterize differences in the biology of normal peripheral blood derived cells versus wound derived cells. The long-term goal of this study is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired wound healing in diabetics.</detailed_description>
