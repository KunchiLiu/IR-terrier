	<brief_summary>The use of steroids after kidney transplantation has been challenged because of variable adverse effects which may increase the patient morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive regimens consisting of cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or tacrolimus (TAC) and MMF after steroid withdrawal 6 months after kidney transplantation in low-risk patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus Therapy With Steroid Withdrawal in Living-Donor Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>131 patients were randomized to CsA (n = 63) or TAC (n = 68). Of 118 patients who did not have a biopsy-proven rejection episode and who had a serum creatinine level &lt; 2.0 mg/dL 6 months after transplantation, 55 were of the CsA group and 63 were of the TAC group. We assessed patient and graft survival, acute rejection episodes, and adverse events 5 years after transplantation.</detailed_description>
