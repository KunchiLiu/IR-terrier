	<brief_summary>Iron overload has been associated with greater brain injury in ischemia/reperfusion experimental stroke models and ischemic stroke patients, especially in those treated with thrombolytic treatment. Deferoxamine administration, an iron chelator, offers a neuroprotective action in ischemia/reperfusion animal models. Primary objective: To evaluate the security and tolerability of deferoxamine endovenous treatment in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with iv. tPA. Secondary objectives: To study pharmacokinetics of deferoxamine given by endovenous bolus (10 mg/Kg) followed by 72-hour continuous intravenous infusion (20, 40 o 60 mg/Kg). To evaluate the deferoxamine effect in clinical outcome, infarct volume and hemorrhagic transformation and brain edema development. Methodology: Double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose-finding phase II clinical trial. Study stages: 1st: bolus+20 mg/Kg/day vs. Placebo (n=15:5); 2nd: bolus+40 mg/Kg/day vs. Placebo (n=15:5); 3rd: bolus+60 mg/Kg/day vs placebo (n=15:5). These doses will be increased according to security results of the previous stage. Patients will be continuously monitored in stroke units. Laboratory parameters will be measured at baseline, 24h, 72h and 30 days to evaluate adverse events related to the drug. Serum deferoxamine and feroxamine concentrations will be measured along time after the injection in a subgroup of patients to the pharmacokinetics study. CT scan will be performed at 24-36h to assess hemorrhagic transformation and brain edema. The NIH Stroke Scale will be evaluated during hospitalization, and the Rankin score at discharge and 3 months. If deferoxamine demonstrate to be secure and well tolerated treatment in acute stroke patients, it may be a new therapy option to lower the brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion.</brief_summary>
