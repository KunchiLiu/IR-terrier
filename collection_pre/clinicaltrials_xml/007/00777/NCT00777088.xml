	<brief_title>Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with large or giant aneurysms of the internal carotid artery treated with PED. Angiographic follow-up occurs at 3 and 5 years.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aneurysm</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Intracranial Aneurysm</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age 21 to 75 years, inclusive Patient has a single target IA in the anterior or posterior circulation that: a) Is located in the following regions of the internal carotid artery: i. Paraophthalmic (including paraclinoid, ophthalmic and hypophyseal segments) ii. Cavernous iii. Petrous b) Has a neck &gt;4 mm or no discernible neck AND a size (maximum fundus diameter) &gt;10 mm c) Has a parent vessel with diameter 2.5 5.0 mm distal/proximal to the target IA Subject has provided written informed consent using the IRBapproved consent form Subject has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements More than one IA requires treatment in the next 6 months Subarachnoid hemorrhage from target IA in the past 60 days Unstable neurologic deficit (i.e., any worsening of clinical condition in the last 30 days) Irreversible bleeding disorder Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3 or known platelet dysfunction Inability to tolerate, documented evidence of adverse reaction or contraindication to study medications Stent in place at the target IA Contraindication to CT scan or MRI Allergy to contrast used in angiography that cannot be medically controlled Known severe allergy to platinum or cobalt/chromium alloys Relative contraindication to angiography (e.g., serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) Woman of childbearing potential who cannot provide a negative pregnancy test Evidence of active infection at the time of treatment Other conditions of the heart, blood, brain or intracranial vessels that carry a high risk of neurologic events (e.g., severe heart failure, atrial fibrillation, known carotid stenosis) Any comorbid disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to complete followup assessments to 180 days Extracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the carotid artery for anterior circulation aneurysms Intracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the treated vessel</criteria>
