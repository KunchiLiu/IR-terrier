	<criteria>Age 21 to 75 years, inclusive Patient has a single target IA that: 1. is located in the following regions of the internal carotid artery: i. Paraophthalmic (including paraclinoid, ophthalmic and hypophyseal segments) ii. Cavernous iii. Petrous 2. is saccular 3. has a parent vessel with diameter 2.55.0 mm If target IA has a neck &gt;4 mm, at least 2 of 3 members of an independent expert committee (IEC) have confirmed that coil embolization with optional adjunctive techniques** has a very high likelihood of procedural success (i.e., coil placement and retention) Subject has provided written informed consent using the IRBapproved consent form Subject has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements ** Adjunctive techniques include intravascular balloons ["balloon remodeling"], 3D coils, dual catheter techniques. Target IA has BOTH neck &gt;4 mm AND size (maximum fundus diameter) &gt;10 mm More than one IA requires treatment in the next 6 months Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the past 60 days Any intracranial hemorrhage in the last 42 days Major surgery in the last 42 days Coils in place in the target IA Unstable neurologic deficit (i.e., any worsening of clinical condition in the last 30 days) Known irreversible bleeding disorder Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3 or known platelet dysfunction Inability to tolerate, documented evidence of adverse reaction or contraindication to study medications Prior stent placement at target site Contraindication to CT scan AND MRI Known allergy to contrast used in angiography that cannot be medically controlled Known severe allergy to platinum or cobalt/chromium alloys Relative contraindication to angiography (e.g., serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) Woman of childbearing potential who cannot provide a negative pregnancy test Evidence of active infection at the time of treatment Other known conditions of the heart, blood, brain or intracranial vessels that carry a high risk of neurologic events (e.g., severe heart failure, atrial fibrillation, known carotid stenosis) Current use of cocaine or other illicit substance Any comorbid disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to complete followup assessments to 180 days Extracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the carotid artery Intracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the treated vessel</criteria>
