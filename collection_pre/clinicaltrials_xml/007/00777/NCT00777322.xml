	<brief_title>T-Cat Laser &amp; Cross-linking for Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Theoretical framework: Corneal ectasia is a relative weakness in the structure of the cornea, which produces a progressive change in its shape with resultant visual distortion. Excimer laser surface ablation can be used to re−shape the corneal profile. When the corneal shape is very irregular, corneal topography data gives the best information as to how to re−shape the cornea into a normal profile, and this Topography−Computer Assisted Treatment (T−Cat) will be used to modulate the surface corneal shape. It is known that collagen cross−linking in the cornea occurs naturally with age, and in diabetes, both of which seem to prevent progressive ectasia. Corneal collagen cross−linking with riboflavin has been shown to stabilize the cornea in keratoconus, and prevents progression of the disease. If cross−linking is performed at that moment that the cornea has been re−shaped by T−Cat treatment, it should help prevent the corneal thinning resultant from the laser treatment from destabilising the cornea and causing progressive ectasia. Purpose: To determine whether excimer laser corneal surface ablation (T−Cat) can be safely combined with simultaneous corneal collagen cross−linking treatment to produce an improved and stable corneal profile. Design: Prospective, interventional trial.</detailed_description>
