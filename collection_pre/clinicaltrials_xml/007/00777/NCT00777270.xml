	<brief_title>Continuous Versus Interrupted Sutures for Repair of Episiotomy or Second Degree Tears: a Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>445 women who participated in the project had undergone normal deliveries with episiotomy or second-grade tearing of the perineum. One group was repaired with continuous non-locking suture in the vagina, perineum and subcutaneous tissue. The other group used continuous locking suture of the vagina, interrupted sutures in the perineum muscle and interrupted transcutaneous suture. The threads used for stitching were identical in both groups. The same questions were asked concerning the sensation of pain and the use of painkillers, the second and the tenth day and at the three months.</detailed_description>
