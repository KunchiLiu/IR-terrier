	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010) in comparison to exenatide (Byetta®), as an add-on treatment to metformin, over a period of 24 weeks of treatment, followed by an extension. The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide in comparison to exenatide (Byetta®), as an add-on treatment to metformin, on glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction (absolute change) at Week 24. The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide on percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than 7 percent (%) or HbA1c less than or equal to (&lt;=) 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight; to evaluate safety, tolerability and to assess the impact of gastrointestinal tolerance on quality of life (QoL) (patient assessment of upper gastrointestinal disorders - quality of life [PAGI-QOL]).</brief_summary>
