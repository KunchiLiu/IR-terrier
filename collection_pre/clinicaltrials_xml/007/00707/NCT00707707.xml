	<brief_summary>This is the first part of a 2-part study assessing the efficacy of AZD2281 in combination with paclitaxel in 1st or 2nd line treatment of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer. This first part (Phase I) is an open-label, intra patient dose finding study to establish the appropriate doses and schedule of paclitaxel and AZD2281 in combination, to be used in the randomized Phase II part. The safety and tolerability of AZD2281 in combination with paclitaxel will be explored. Approximately 10 patients per cohort from 4-5 countries will be enrolled in Phase I.</brief_summary>
