	<brief_summary>The Barosense Trans-oral Endoscopic Restrictive Implant System (TERIS) is an investigational system being evaluated for safety The system uses endoscopic guidance to trans-orally implant a restrictive reservoir for food entering the stomach in obese and morbidly obese subjects to induce early and prolonged satiety. The Intended Use of the system is for the treatment of obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Center Feasibility Study of Trans-oral Endoscopic Restrictive Implant System (TERIS) for Treatment of Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is now considered to be epidemic through most of the industrialized world. The consequences of obesity on long-term health of individuals is now well documented. While lifestyle changes in diet and activity level are the key instruments to arresting or reversing this condition, conventional medically supervised programs have proven only marginally effective. Bariatric surgery has shown to be a reliable long-term treatment for reducing excess body weight. Though surgical techniques have evolved and complication rates have been reduced, surgery on these patients still carries significant mortality and morbidity. Techniques and instruments are now being developed to allow for Endoscopic approaches to these procedures that will aim to reduce the complications associated with open or laparoscopic technique for these procedures. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the Trans-oral Endoscopic Restrictive Implant System (TERIS) procedure for the treatment of obesity over a six month follow-up period. A secondary objective is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the TERIS procedure in order to guide the design of future studies, including a pivotal trial. This is a prospective feasibility study at up to 3 investigational sites of up to 40 subjects who are obese and have failed standard obesity therapy of diet, exercise, behavior modification, and pharmacologic agents either alone, or in combination. Up to 60 subjects may be enrolled, and undergo baseline evaluation in order to obtain a final total of up to 40 subjects appropriate for trans-oral implant. Barosense intends to use data from this study in support of subsequent investigational studies, including a pivotal trial</detailed_description>

Subjects undergoing chronic steroid therapy. 15. Subjects undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. 16. Subjects who cannot discontinue either prescription or over the counter weight loss medications for at least 30 days prior to the procedure as well as during the trial period. 17.
