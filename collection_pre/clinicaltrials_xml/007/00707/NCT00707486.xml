	<brief_title>A Randomized, Self Controlled Clinical Study of Hemostatic Efficacy of the HemCon Dental Dressing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HemCon® Bandage has been successfully used to achieve hemostasis in patients with high systolic pressure, high blood volume wounds, and to promote hemostasis on a massive scale compared to the hemostasis requirements of oral surgery wounds. Therefore, a human clinical trial has recently been completed evaluating the efficacy of using the HemCon® Bandage in a smaller finished size for dental extraction and other oral surgery sites. The HemCon® Bandage was proven to be significantly better at promoting hemostasis of oral surgery wounds than the control (cotton gauze or Gelfoam) in all subjects tested. All HemCon® Bandage sites achieved hemostasis faster than the control sites. Based on this data, a 510(k) was submitted and has received FDA clearance for the HemCon® Dental Dressing to be used as an oral wound dressing intended as a physical barrier for temporary protection of oral mucosal tissue and to provide pain relief. This study evaluates the FDA cleared HemCon® Dental Dressing for use in hemostasis of soft oral tissue subsequent to dental surgical procedures such as tooth extractions excluding procedures involving primary closure of the HemCon® Dental Dressing within the oral wound.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients requiring 2 or 4 3rd molar tooth extraction procedures. Index pairing must reflect anatomically similar extraction locations, i.e., for 2 extractions both must be upper or both must be lower extractions. Patients must be 14 years of age or older Patients must be available for a minimum of one post operative evaluation to be scheduled at the time of the procedure approximately 7 days post surgery. Additional followup visits may be scheduled at the discretion of the surgeon based on the severity of particular patient cases or the patient's need for earlier followup. Extraction sites do not require primary closure or suturing Willingness and ability to provide informed consent/ assent for participation Patients with seafood allergies Patients who have discontinued the use of anticoagulant medications (e.g., aspirin, coumadin, Plavix, etc.) for a minimum of 3 days prior to their planned surgical visit. Scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure other than 3rd molar tooth extractions Scheduled to undergo 2 extractions whereby one is an upper 3rd molar and the other is a lower 3rd molar. These will not reflect a proper index pairing for statistical calculations and data analysis based on anatomical similarities. Extraction procedures are expected to require primary closure or suturing of the HemCon® Dental Dressing within the oral wound. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent/ assent for participation as a subject Patients who are currently taking anticoagulant medications (e.g., aspirin, coumadin, Plavix, etc.) or have discontinued their anticoagulant medications less than 3 days prior to their surgical visit. Patients who are undergoing bisphosphonate therapy.</criteria>
