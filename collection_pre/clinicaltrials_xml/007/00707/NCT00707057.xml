	<brief_title>Ibuprofen Extended-Release Dental Pain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, multiple-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of Ibuprofen 600 mg Extended-Release Tablets in a study of dental pain following extraction of third molar teeth. The surgery will consist of surgical extraction of 1-2 impacted third molars, of which one must be a mandibular impaction that is partially impacted in either tissue or bone. Subjects will be stratified according to baseline pain intensity, as rated on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS)and gender.</detailed_description>
