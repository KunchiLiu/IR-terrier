	<brief_title>Zalutumumab in Combination With Radiotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Ineligible for Platinum Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, multi-center, phase I/II dose-escalation clinical trial investigating the safety of zalutumumab in combination with radiotherapy. The safety of zalutumumab doses in combination with radiotherapy (RT) will be investigated using 3 patient cohorts in a dose-escalation / de-escalation design based on Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT). The dose-escalation starts at 8 mg/kg zalutumumab in combination with RT. Initially, three patients will be treated at a dose level and observed for DLTs. If none of the three patients experience a DLT, then the next cohort of three patients is treated at the next higher dose of zalutumumab. If one of three patients treated at a dose level experience a DLT, then three more patients are treated at the same dose level. If two or more of the three patients experience DLTs, then the next cohort of three patients should be treated at the next lower dose of zalutumumab, unless at least six patients on that dose have already been dosed. Furthermore, if 1 or fewer DLTs are observed among six patients at a given dose level, then the next cohort of three patients is treated at the next higher dose of zalutumumab. The maximum tolerated dose will be decided by Genmab based on the recommendations made by the IDMC on the basis of their review of the aggregated safety data.</detailed_description>
