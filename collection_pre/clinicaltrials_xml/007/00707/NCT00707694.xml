	<brief_summary>We believe extreme longevity is due to specific genes which function to delay aging and prevent disease. The purpose of our research is to identify the genes/mutations associated with healthier aging; to understand the biological functions of these genes/mutations; and to develop therapies to replicate these preservative genetic activities in individuals who do not have the genetic profile for longevity.</brief_summary>
