	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether genotyping for CYP2D6 and 2C19 polymorphisms or intense clinical monitoring of treatment and adverse effects improves the antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia. This study is designed as a three-armed prospective randomized controlled clinical trial and includes 300 patients with schizophrenia. Patients are followed for a period of one year. During the study period the following effect measures are registered: - Time to discontinuation of all antipsychotic medications - Number of changes in medication dose - Number of changes in medication - Compliance (patientsÂ´ adherence to medical treatment) - Clinical symptoms - Adverse effects</brief_summary>
