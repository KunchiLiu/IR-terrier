After obtaining informed consent,all received epidural anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200000 via epidural cathetes at L2-3 or L3-4 in a volume suffient to achieve a T4 sensory level bilaterally. After the umbilical cord was clamped,patients were assigned randomly to three groups.The placebo group,N-5 group,and N-10 group received 4 ml epidural solution containing morphine 4 mg plus either saline, nalbuphine 5 mg, and nalbuphine 10 mg respectively.At the post anesthetic care unit, intravenous pethidine PCA were administered for inadequate pain control.
