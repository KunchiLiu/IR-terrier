	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and immunogenicity of a combination vaccine that includes tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap). The study will be conducted in 48 pregnant women and 32 non-pregnant women. Safety of the newborn infant and the effect of the mother's vaccination on the infants' immune responses prior to vaccinating infants with another combination vaccine to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis will be evaluated. Participants will be 18-45 years old. Pregnant volunteers will be 30-32 weeks pregnant and at a low risk for pregnancy complications. Pregnant volunteers will receive 2 injections (1 vaccine and 1 placebo, inactive substance); non-pregnant volunteers will receive 1 injection of vaccine. Blood samples will be collected from the mother and infant, along with the baby's growth measurements. Participation for mother infant pairs is about 15 months and about 7 months for non-pregnant women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pertussis Vaccine in Healthy Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pertussis, "whooping cough", caused by the gram negative pleomorphic bacillus, Bordetella pertussis, is a highly contagious, potentially life-threatening respiratory illness that has re-emerged in the United States (US) as a cause of morbidity and mortality in infants less than 6 months of age as well as morbidity in adolescents and adults. Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (Tdap) immunization of women in the third trimester of pregnancy represents an opportunity to protect the vulnerable very young infants through passively acquired maternal pertussis specific antibodies. Tdap vaccine is being evaluated for this purpose since there is no monovalent acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine available in the U.S. This is a multi-site, randomized, double masked, cross-over study in 48 healthy pregnant women, 18-45 years of age who will be randomized (2:1) into two groups. One group will receive a single dose of Tdap vaccine at 30-32 weeks of gestation and a postpartum dose of saline. The other group will receive saline at 30-32 weeks of gestation and a postpartum dose of Tdap vaccine. On May 30, 2008 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued a recommendation for use of Tdap in pregnant and postpartum women: "Pregnant women (including women who are breastfeeding) who have not received a dose of Tdap previously should receive Tdap after delivery and before discharge from the hospital or birthing center if 2 years or more have elapsed since the most recent administration of Td." This study design provides a control for the evaluation of the safety of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy and provides compliance with the ACIP recommendation. Immune responses to Tdap vaccine measured in antepartum and postpartum women enrolled in this clinical trial will be compared. Also, immune responses of the 32 pregnant women antenatally immunized with Tdap will be compared to those in approximately 32 healthy non-pregnant women contemporaneously enrolled into 2 age groups (18-39 years and 40-45 years) that are equal to the pregnant women. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Tdap vaccine in pregnant women and their neonates and the effect of maternal immunization on the infant immune response to DTaP vaccinations. The safety of and immune response to Tdap vaccine in the 32 pregnant women immunized antenatally will be compared to that in approximately 32 non-pregnant women enrolled contemporaneously. The primary objectives of this phase I study are: to evaluate the safety of a single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection of Tdap vaccine in healthy pregnant women vaccinated at 30-32 weeks of gestation compared to women immunized postpartum and a non-pregnant control group; and to evaluate the safety of maternal Tdap immunization in neonates. Secondary objectives are: to assess the immunogenicity of Tdap vaccine in healthy pregnant women compared to women immunized postpartum and a non-pregnant control group; to determine the efficiency of placental transport of maternal pertussis specific antibodies to the neonate; to assess the persistence of the maternal pertussis specific antibodies in infants just prior to receiving the first dose of DTaP [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate] vaccine for infants); and to assess the effects of maternal immunization with Tdap vaccine on infant immune responses to DTaP vaccinations. Study duration will be approximately 3 years. Subject participation will be approximately 15 months (for each mother-infant pair) and 7 months for non-pregnan</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant subjects must meet all inclusion criteria in order to be eligible to participate in the study. 18 45 years of age In the 30th32nd week of a pregnancy at low risk for complications as determined by the Obstetrical Risk Assessment Form [ORAF] and the following criteria: All Pregnant Women: Second trimester or later ultrasound with no significant abnormalities. Alpha fetal protein (AFP) testing, one of the following: 1. Normal maternal serum AFP performed at 1520 weeks' gestation (either as part of the quad screen or separately) 2. Abnormal maternal serum AFP at 1520 weeks' gestation followed by an amniocentesis demonstrating no chromosomal abnormalities AND either normal amniotic fluid AFP or normal amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels. 3. If a serum AFP test is not performed, one of the following: i. A level II ultrasound with no significant abnormalities ii. A normal amniotic fluid AFP test AND an amniocentesis demonstrating no chromosomal abnormalities must be documented. Pregnant Women 4045 years of age: no chromosomal abnormalities identified by diagnostic testing [chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis]. Pregnant Women 1839 years of age: at least one of the following: 1. Level II ultrasound with no significant abnormalities 2.
