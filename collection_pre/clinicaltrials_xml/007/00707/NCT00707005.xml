	<brief_title>Antibiotic Susceptibility of Conjunctival Bacterial Isolates From Refractive Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the most commonly performed refractive surgical procedure for the correction of ametropia worldwide. Infectious keratitis, although rare, is a potentially devastating complication of LASIK, and it can lead to horrifying outcomes. Previous studies on antibiotic susceptibility of preoperative ocular bacterial flora focused primarily on intraocular surgeries with particular interests in endophthalmitis. This study was aimed at refractive surgeries with special interest in infectious keratitis after LASIK. Intraocular surgeries for cataract, glaucoma or retinal disease are performed mostly on aged patients at a large hospital on an inpatient or outpatient basis; however, most refractive surgeries are performed on young, healthy people in private clinics on an outpatient basis. The patient populations are therefore quite different between these two types of surgery. The aim of this study is to determine the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility patterns of conjunctival bacterial flora isolated preoperatively from patients undergoing refractive surgery at an outpatient laser surgery clinic. Preoperative conjunctival swab samples are directly inoculated in culture media at the bedside before topical anesthetic or antibiotic application. Blood agar, chocolate agar, thioglycolate broth, Sabouraud dextrose agar, and Ogawa media are used for bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin (LEV), gatifloxacin (GAT), moxifloxacin (MOX), gemifloxacin (GEM) and other commonly used antibiotics are determined using an E-test.</detailed_description>
