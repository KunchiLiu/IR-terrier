Subject is taking any antihypertensive medication for any reason including for migraine prophylaxis. Subject has a glycosylated hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 Subject has a chronic condition (i.e. osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,fibromyalgia) which requires chronic daily administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (including acetaminophen) or opioids or opioid combination products. Subject, in the investigator's opinion, is likely to have unrecognized cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Subject has a history of congenital heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication, or a history of a clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, contraindicates participation in the study. Subject has evidence or history of any ischemic vascular diseases including: ischemic heart disease, ischemic abdominal syndromes, peripheral vascular disease or Raynaud's Syndrome, or any signs or symptoms consistent with any of the above. Subject has evidence or history of central nervous system pathology including stroke and/or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), epilepsy or structural brain lesions which lower the convulsive threshold, or has been treated with an antiepileptic drug for seizure control within five years prior to Screening. Subject has a history of impaired hepatic or renal function that, in the investigator's opinion, contraindicates participation in the study. Subject has hypersensitivity, allergy, intolerance or contraindication to the use of any triptan, NSAID, or aspirin (including all sumatriptan and naproxen preparations) or has nasal polyps and asthma. Subject is currently taking, or has used, an ergot or ergotderived medication in the previous three months for migraine prophylaxis or is taking a medication that is not stabilized (i.e. change of a dose within the past two months) for chronic or intermittent migraine prophylaxis or for a comorbid condition that is not stabilized. Subject has a recent history of regular use of opioids or barbiturates for the treatment of their migraine headache and/or other nonmigraine pain. Regular use is defined as an average of four days per month over the last six months. Subject has taken or plans to take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), including herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or a CNS stimulant medication (such as atomoxetine, dextroamphetamine and amephetamine products, dexmethlyphenidate, lisdexamdetamine dimesylate and methylphenidate) anytime within two weeks prior to Screening through twoweeks posttreatment.
