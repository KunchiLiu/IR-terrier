Each patient will return to the clinic following enrollment in the study at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter for assessment.

Patients will return to the clinic for baseline visit, week 12, and then will follow the visit schedule provided to them in BPS-MR-PAH-202 main study.</detailed_description>
