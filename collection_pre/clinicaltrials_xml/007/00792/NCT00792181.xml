	<brief_summary>This is an intervention study focusing on both medical and nursing questions. The study is a joint project between the Ambulance services at four cities in West Sweden and Knowledge and research centre, PreHospen at University of Bor√•s. The aim is to prove the importance of a caring relation between a patient and a caregiver in cases when a caregiver treats a patient with benzodiazepines (Midazolam). The overall aim is to show that knowledge and skills in both caring science and medicine can be applied at the same time in order to relieve pain and anxiety in acute myocardial disease. The nursing intervention involves a professional development course for caregivers. The course is expected to deepen the caregivers' knowledge about the encounter with patients as well as cardiovascular treatment. Following questions are formulated: A. What are the effects regarding relieving pain and anxiety in acute myocardial disease? B. What are the effects regarding circulatory influence? C. What are the effects regarding patients' experiences of the ambulance services? D. What are the effects regarding number of care days in relation to acute myocardial disease? E. What are the effects of patients' disease complications?</brief_summary>
