	<brief_summary>The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise on the number of swollen and tender joints associated with rheumatoid arthritis. It was hypothesized that persons would have less inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis after a 12 week exercise program of treadmill walking and weighlifting. Immune parameters were measured to determine potential mechanisms responsible for changes in inflammation with exercise.</brief_summary>
