	<brief_summary>This study will compare CTAP201 with Doxercalciferol in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), undergoing regular hemodialysis, at different dose strengths. This study will also investigate the levels of CTAP201 in the body over time and determine the safety of CTAP201.</brief_summary>
