	<brief_summary>Tissue transfer flaps are a method of moving tissue from a donor location to a recipient location. In the case of a free tissue transfer flaps, the blood vessels to the transferred tissues are detached and then re-attached to different arteries and veins at the recipient site. The process of reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps is not without complications. These complications may include acute arterial or venous occlusion, as well as the development of late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring of Tissue Transfer Flaps by Modulated Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researchers developed a safe, non-contact, intra-operative and post-operative device called Modulated Imaging, can detect changes in a flap's optical properties and can correlate with arterial or venous occlusion or with the development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy.</detailed_description>
