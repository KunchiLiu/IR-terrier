	<brief_summary>This study is being undertaken to compare the clinical outcomes of patients that have unilateral posterolateral lumbar interbody fusion using a traditional open approach versus the MiLIF procedure based on the MiCOR Precision Bone Allograft, specialized Atavi instrumentation, and minimally invasive visualization capabilities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIS MiLIF Versus Open</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized cohort design clinical study to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients that have a minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion (MiLIF) through the Atavi system compared to traditional unilateral open lumbar interbody fusion through a midline incision. the study will involve up to approximately 12 investigational sites and enroll up to 126 patients.</detailed_description>
