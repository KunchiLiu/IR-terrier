	<detailed_description>A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This study is being conducted at two sites, UNMC and the Omaha VA Medical Center. The subject will be asked to take the study drug in the form of a capsule to be taken twice daily. Whether the subject receives methylphenidate or placebo (a pill that has a similar appearance to the study drug, but has no medicine) will be determined by random chance. The probability that the subject will receive methylphenidate is 1 in every 2 subjects or 50% of the time. Subjects receiving methylphenidate will be starting at 5 milligrams (mg) twice daily. Dosage will then be increased to 10mg twice daily at 2 weeks. After the initial visits, the subjects will be asked to come for follow-up every month for the next 4 visits (sixteen weeks total). During each visit subjects will again be asked questions to assess their motivation, memory, functional status and quality of life. Blood will be drawn and an electrocardiogram (ecg/ekg) will be taken to assess the patient's safety twice during the study. Partial Compensation may be available for participation.</detailed_description>
