Active phase: Patients who are confirmed to have undergone autologous peripheral stem cell/ bone marrow transplantation. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential; or, if of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for 10 months after transplantation. Screening phase: Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions in the 10 months posttransplantation.

Active phase: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) during the active phase of the study period. Use of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 14 days preceding the administration of the first dose of the study vaccine or planned use during the active phase of the study period. Use of rituximab (MabThera) more than 60 days after transplant. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of vaccine and ending 30 days after. Pregnant or lactating female.
