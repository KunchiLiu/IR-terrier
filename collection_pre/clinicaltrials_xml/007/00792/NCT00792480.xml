	<brief_title>Does Dietary and Lifestyle Counseling Prevent Excessive Weight Gain During Pregnancy? A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive gestational weight gain is common with about one third of women gaining more weight in pregnancy than is recommended. Unfortunately, the prevalence of excessive gestational weight gain is increasing. Gestational weight gain greater than that recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) is associated with increased risk of gestational complications (hypertension, diabetes, and preeclampsia), infant macrosomia, and complications in delivery including increased risk of cesarean delivery. Currently, there is no evidence-based prenatal counseling protocol available to prevent excessive gestational weight gain. We hypothesize that consistent counseling on appropriate pregnancy diet, weight gain, and the potential complications of excessive gestational weight gain will result in fewer women gaining above the IOM recommendations.</detailed_description>
