	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Pioglitazone in Treating Subjects With Vascular Complications Associated With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, affecting nearly 200 million people, almost all suffering from Type 2 Diabetes. It is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries due to the negative impact of the disease on the cardiovascular system. Treatment, aimed to the reduction of this intrinsic cardiovascular risk, is based on tight control of glucose and all coexisting metabolic abnormalities as well as of biomarkers of inflammation and atherogenesis. Macrovascular complications account for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients, and there is growing evidence that pathophysiologic mechanisms other than hyperglycemia are responsible. The condition of the vascular endothelium in particular has been shown to effect the health and disease of the cardiovascular system. The number and function of endothelial progenitor cells correlate inversely with cardiovascular risk factors and may be a surrogate biologic marker for vascular function and cumulative cardiovascular risk. Pioglitazone is an orally active thiazolidinedione derivative. It is a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation that alters transcription of various genes regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.</detailed_description>
