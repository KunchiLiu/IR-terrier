	<brief_summary>Chronic liver disease are characterized by increased levels of plasma IL-6, but the bioactivity of this cytokine in this disease is not well known. IL-6 receptor complex is regulated by multiple receptors subunits: the soluble form of IL-6 Receptor enhance IL-6 signal by a process called trans-signaling on cells expressing few membrane IL-6 receptors. Soluble gp130 is the natural inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling. The aim of this study is to characterize circulating and liver levels of theses compounds of IL-6 receptor complex, to unravel the bioactivity of IL-6 in this disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients undergoing transjugular liver biopsies for alcoholic liver disease or hepatitis C virus infection will be included in the study to measure plasma cytokines levels, peripheral blood mononuclear cells cytokine release and liver IL-6R compounds mRNA levels.</detailed_description>
