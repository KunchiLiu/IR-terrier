	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Pioglitazone and Atorvastatin Combination Therapy in Treating Subjects With Elevated Risk for Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carotid intima-media thickness is a well described surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk. A thickened carotid intima media layer correlates not only with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors but also the risk of future macrovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The interventional approach of cardiovascular risk factors with angiotensin converting enzyme system blockers, calcium antagonists or beta blockers can result in reduction of progression or even net regression of carotid intima-media thickness. The most potent agents, however, are statins which have consistently shown effects on carotid intima-media thickness in patients with hypercholesterolemia and/or atherosclerotic disease. Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma activation by thiazolidinediones is a promising new approach which reduces insulin resistance and improves lipid profile. In addition to their metabolic activities, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma activators were shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, to improve endothelial function and to inhibit atherogenesis in diabetic and in non-diabetic atherosclerosis-prone animal models. Treatment with peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma agonists have shown to reduce arterial pressure and carotid intima-media thickness in diabetic and non-diabetic patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Pioglitazone in addition to Atorvastatin compared to Atorvastatin alone on vascular risk markers and intima-media thickness in patients with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease.</detailed_description>
