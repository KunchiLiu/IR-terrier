	<brief_summary>Patients were eligible if they had biopsy proven, previously untreated T3 with fixed cord involvement squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus. The study compare conventional radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil followed by conventional radiotherapy. The primary end point was the preservation of the larynx. The secondary end points included toxicity, causes of death and survival rates.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: To compare conventional radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil followed by conventional radiotherapy. The primary end point was the preservation of the larynx. The secondary end points included toxicity, causes of death and survival rates. Design: Multicenter prospective randomized phase III trial. Setting: Academic tertiary care center. Patients: Seventy one adult patients with biopsy-proven previously untreated resectable T3 with fixed cord involvement squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus. Main Outcomes Measures: Patients were evaluated for toxic reactions, and organ preservation and survival rates. Statistical analysis of overall survival and event free survival was performed using the Kaplan Meier method.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients were eligible if they had biopsy proven, previously untreated T3 with fixed cord involvement squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus. Patients also had to have a performance status (PS)&lt; 1, and normal organ functions as defined by an absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 cells/microl, platelet count &gt; 100 000 cells/microl and a calculated creatinine clearance of more than 50 ml/min. Patients with T1, T2 or T4 or M1 (metastatic disease) were ineligible.</criteria>
