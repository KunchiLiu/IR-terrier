	<brief_title>Pioglitazone and Serum Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) in Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with pioglitazone can reduce serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in patients with adult diabetes. Recent research has found that elevated serum ADMA is associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality, particularly in people with diabetes (Boger 2005, Zoccali 2006, Ueda 2007). ADMA, by mediating nitric oxide (NO) availability, may trigger pro-atherogenic effects. High plasma concentration of this substance has been associated with intima-media thickening, left ventricular hypertrophy and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, and associated with increased cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes (Kryzazanowska 2007). The result of higher levels of ADMA and reduced output of NO increases vasoconstriction, increases inflammation, and interferes with endothelial function. Preliminary studies indicate that pioglitazone may reduce ADMA levels, and thus lower cardiovascular risk.Thus, this protocol will test whether pioglitazone can reduce ADMA levels in adult patients with diabetes.</detailed_description>
