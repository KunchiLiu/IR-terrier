	<brief_summary>This study will compare high intensity focused ultrasound to standard brachytherapy in the treatment of primary, organ confined prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study of the SonablateÂ® 500 to Treat Localized (T1c/T2a) Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a prospective, non-randomized concurrently controlled study. The active treatment arm uses the HIFU procedure with the Sonablate device. The control arm uses the brachytherapy procedure. The safety and effectiveness of the Sonablate arm will be compared with the brachytherapy arm. The control arm of the study will be conducted at clinical sites different from the Sonablate arm.</detailed_description>
