	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pioglitazone and Insulin in Treating Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Renal Failure.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and clinically significant kidney disease presenting with contra-indications for metformin and sulfonylurea drugs are usually treated with insulin therapy only. While the prolonged pharmacokinetic insulin profile due to delayed renal insulin elimination already is a hurdle for a successful therapy, impaired kidney function results in increased oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk, especially in patients requiring dialysis. Several potential mechanisms may explain this increased cardiovascular risk, and one, frequent finding is coexistence of several other independent cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension and smoking. In addition, impaired kidney function is associated with elevated markers of inflammation and other putative risk factors for cardiovascular events. The focus of this study is to investigate whether pioglitazone may help improve overall metabolic and cardiovascular risks in patients with end stage renal disease, and if pioglitazone can potentially exert positive effects on kidney function in patients with renal failure requiring dialysis. The duration of treatment for patients completing the study is approximately 26 weeks.</detailed_description>
