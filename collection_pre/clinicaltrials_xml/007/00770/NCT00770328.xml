	<brief_summary>PAI-1 is elevated in obese individuals. TNF-alpha, an inflammatory mediator is believed to play a role in obesity mediated elevations in PAI-1 levels. TNF-alpha blockade with antibodies and the drug pentoxifylline have been shown to lower PAI-1 levels in animal models. This study tests the hypothesis that pentoxifylline will lower PAI-1 levels in human subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Pentoxifylline on PAI-1 in an Obese Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese individuals with elevated PAI-1 levels (greater than 10 ng/ml) are randomized to pentoxifylline 400mg, TID or placebo for 8 weeks. PAI-1, TNF-a and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein are measured at week 0, 4 and 8.</detailed_description>
