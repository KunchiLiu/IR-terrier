	<brief_summary>This is a 36 week dietary intervention pilot study to evaluate the effects of lyophilized black raspberries on rectal polyp burden and biomarkers in subjects with FAP. Subjects will undergo a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy before study treatment to determine eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will undergo a sigmoidoscopy at 36 weeks after the initiation of study treatment. The size and number of rectal polyps will be documented on a code sheet and by photograph. The efficacy outcome will include the percentage reduction in the number of rectal polyps between baseline and 36 weeks.</brief_summary>
