	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Mipomersen (ISIS 301012) As Add-on Therapy in High Risk Hypercholesterolemic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL). Elevated LDL is a major risk factor for CHD. Mipomersen is an antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called apolipoprotein B (apo-B). Apo-B plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (the "bad" cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream. High LDL-C is an independent risk factor for the development of CHD or other diseases of blood vessels. It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart attacks and other major adverse cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study is to determine whether mipomersen safely and effectively lowers LDL-C in patients with high cholesterol who are at high risk for CHD and who are already on the maximally tolerated dose of statin. This study consisted of a 26-week treatment period and a 24-week post-treatment follow-up period. Participants who finished treatment or who discontinued prematurely from the study for any reason were assessed for safety for 24 weeks after the last study drug dose.</detailed_description>
