	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pioglitazone/Metformin Combination Therapy in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dyslipidemia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance is a major endocrinopathy preceding the development of hyperglycemia, diabetic dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. The most common pattern of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes are elevated triglyceride levels, decreased hih-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Each of these dyslipidemia features is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Pioglitazone and Metformin are established drugs which can be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This study will investigate the effects of treatment with fixed Pioglitazone/Metformin combination therapy of Metformin and Glimepiride in Metformin-pretreated type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia. Total participation time in this study is anticipated to be approximately 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
