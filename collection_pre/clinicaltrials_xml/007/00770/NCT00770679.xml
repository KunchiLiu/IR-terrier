	<brief_summary>Cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins improve the functioning of the endothelium, and help prevent heart disease. We are testing whether statins improve endothelial function more in the arteries that have worse endothelium to begin with. One of the functions of the endothelium is to help control how blood vessels dilate (expand) or contract (narrow) in different situations. This affects how blood flows through those vessels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate endothelial function in the arms and legs noninvasively. You are being asked to participate in a study using MRI to test whether a 3-week course of statins improves the endothelium of legs more than it improves the endothelium of arms. Adults with type 2 diabetes may join.</brief_summary>
