	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pioglitazone and Metformin on Cardiovascular Risk in Subjects With Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is established that matrix metalloproteinases play an essential role in the degradation of collagen and other extra cellular matrix macromolecules. In addition, matrix metalloproteinases are implicated in plaque rupture through their capacity to thin the protective cap of the plaque, thus rendering it more vulnerable. In fact, matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels are elevated in patients with unstable plaques and in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels are usually elevated and the atherosclerotic plaques are more vulnerable compared to non-diabetic patients, confirming the role of this proteinase in the development of acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that reduce blood glucose levels and attenuate inflammation and matrix metalloproteinases activity may be a tool for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory effects of pioglitazone are maintained and sustained over a longer observation period when given in combination with insulin in comparison to the metformin plus insulin combination. The duration of treatment for patients completing the study is approximately 6 months.</detailed_description>
