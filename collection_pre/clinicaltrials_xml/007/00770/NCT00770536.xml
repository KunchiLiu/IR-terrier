	<brief_summary>This study is a 2 part, 2 cohort, open-label, dose escalation/de escalation study of AMG 386 in combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled to receive AMG 386 in combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 4 weeks (cohort A) or topotecan weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day dosing schedule (cohort B). Subject enrollment and assignment to either cohort will be based on eligibility and the investigator's discretion. It is hypothesized that AMG 386, in combination with each of the chemotherapy regimens: either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan will be safe and well tolerated in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
