	<brief_title>Open Label Study of Ceftobiprole to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics in Adults Hospitalized in the ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive an intravenous dose of ceftobiprole infused over 4 hours. Multiple blood samples will be obtained to determine the concentration of ceftobiprole in the plasma. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance and volume of distribution will be calculated. 1000mg every 8hours or every 12 hours</detailed_description>
