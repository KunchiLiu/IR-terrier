	<brief_summary>Disturbances of acquired immunity are considered to be responsible, at least partly, for the high infection rate and inadequate response to vaccinations observed in hemodialysis (HD) patients and renal transplant recipient (RTR). The present prospective trial aims at (a) evaluating the immunogenicity of a standard influenza vaccine in HD and RTR patients and (b) at identifying determinants of the immune response.</brief_summary>
