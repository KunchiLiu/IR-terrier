	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate an increase in protein metabolism during treatment with Physioneal 35® (containing lactate 10 mmol/l, calcium 1.75 mmol/l) compared to treatment with Physioneal 40® (containing lactate 15 mmol/l, calcium 1.25 mmol/l) in children and adolescents with end stage renal failure receiving peritoneal dialysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Fat oxidation (13C-enrichment in expiration breath samples for U-C13-algae turnover) - Growth markers (plasma levels of IgF-1, IgF-BP3, leptin) - Biochemical markers of anabolism (plasma levels of total protein, albumin, transferrin) - Serum thyroid function (fT3, fT4, TSH) - Serum lipid status - Serum markers of calcium/phosphate metabolism (PTH, calcium, ionized calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase) - Prevalence of metabolic acidosis/ alkalosis (venous sample), serum lactate - Safety parameters (such as normalized weekly Kt/v, parameters of glucose metabolism, parameters of hepatic function, parameters of calcium-phosphate-metabolism, physical examination incl. standing height, weight, assessment of complications related to peritoneal dialysis as peritonitis, exit infections and inguinal hernia) - Body composition (lean body mass and body fat mass/fluid)</detailed_description>
