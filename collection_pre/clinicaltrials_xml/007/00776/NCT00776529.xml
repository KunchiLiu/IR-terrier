	<brief_summary>AIM: Strengthening and sensorimotor training (e.g with the aim to improve balance) are widely used in rehabilitation. There is little knowledge about the best ways to combine strengthening and sensorimotor training. Therefore, the investigators want to evaluate two types of combinations in healthy participants. Interventions: - Group A: 1.) warm-up; 2.) sensorimotor training; 3.) strength training (nine sessions in four weeks) - Group B: 1.) warm-up; 2.) one strengthening exercise, followed by a sensorimotor exercise, alternating (nine sessions in four weeks) Tests (Before first training and after four weeks): - isokinetic test of knee extensors and flexors (60째/s; 120째/s; 180째/s; 240째/s.) - squat jumps and countermovement jumps - static balance test on an unstable underground (measured with accelerometer) - dynamic balance: star excursion balance test, (a) on stable ground, (b) on unstable ground. Balance tests will be performed (c) in recovered state and (d) fatigue (i.e. after a fatiguing exercise). Hypotheses 1. Group B (alternating sensorimotor and strength exercises) will improve more in the balance tests than Group A (sensorimotor first, strength afterwards). 2. Group B will improve more in the countermovement jump than Group A. 3. There will be no differences in the improvements in the strength, power and squat jump tests between the two groups.</brief_summary>
