	<brief_summary>Aims of the trial: Establishing the profile of the growth factors and other mediators of angiogenesis in different ocular fluids (aqueous humour, vitreous gel and ocular liquid in vitrectomized eyes), in the 2 most frequent proliferative retinopathies - diabetic proliferative retinopathy (PDR) and exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD). Following up the dynamic of this profile before and after intravitreal administration of Bevacizumab (Avastin) as an anti-VEGF blocker. Materials: The research will be conducted on the following categories of patients groups: - nondiabetic patients without AMD or any other diagnosed proliferative ocular disease (controls) - patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD groups) before and after intravitreal injections with Avastin - diabetic patients with different types of diabetic retinopathy, before and after intravitreal Avastin (diabetic groups) Methods: Samples from different ocular fluids will be collected from each group of patients. 10 growth factors and other 10 cytokines will be determined in the ocular fluids samples. Results: The results from the biochemical measurements will be statistically interpreted in order to obtain conclusions for the clinical practice. Conclusions: The conclusions of this trial will be used exclusively for research publications and communications, as well as for clinical practice.</brief_summary>
