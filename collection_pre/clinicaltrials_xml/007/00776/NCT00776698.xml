	<brief_summary>This single arm study will evaluate the feasibility of treatment with 2 dose levels of Avastin in combination with concurrent thoracic radiation and chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Two cohorts of patients will receive 3 cycles of Avastin treatment (7.5mg/kg and 15mg/kg iv every 3 weeks, respectively), concurrently with thoracic radiation and chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide). Once a preferred dose has been established, this dose will be applied to a 3rd cohort, who will then receive maintenance treatment with Avastin as a single agent for 6 additional cycles. The anticipated time on study treatment is &lt;3 months for cohorts 1 and 2, and 3-12 months for cohort 3, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
