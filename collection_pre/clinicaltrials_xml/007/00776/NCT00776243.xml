	<brief_summary>In type 2 diabetic patients, abnormality in secretion or action of incretin(GLP-1, GIP) is observed. Although controversy still exists, the secretion of GLP-1 is thought to be reduced by 20-30% while GIP secretion is normal or slightly elevated, in type 2 diabetic patients. Various parameters such as the duration of diabetes, the amount of meal and their constitution, gastric bypass surgery, and some antidiabetic drugs affect the secretion of incretin. However, the secretion of GLP-1 and GIP in glucotoxic condition and whether they recover after improvement of glycemic status is not known. The investigators aim to study the effect of intensive insulin treatment in uncontrolled diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
