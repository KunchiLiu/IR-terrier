	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that reducing the duration of clopidogrel therapy from 6 months to 6 weeks after DES implantation is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients on ASA and an oral anticoagulant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triple Therapy in Patients on Oral Anticoagulation After Drug Eluting Stent Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) was associated not only with a widening of the indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but also with longer antithrombotic therapy duration. Dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and a thienopyridine is very efficient in preventing adverse events after coronary stenting but it is inferior to oral anticoagulation (OAC) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. OAC is also superior to antiplatelet therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves and the therapy of choice for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. OAC is also administered for left ventricular thrombi and low ejection fraction. There is an increasing number of patients undergoing coronary stenting who are in need of life-long anticoagulation therapy and would therefore require a triple therapy consisting of aspirin, clopidogrel and oral anticoagulation. As oral anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapy impair primary and secondary hemostasis there are concerns that adding warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy might cause increased bleeding rates. Several studies have retrospectively assessed efficacy and safety in patients receiving a triple therapy with various results: major bleeding rates varied from 3,1%-14,9% with total bleeding rates up to 27,5%. Prospective randomized data on this topic are not available. Therefore the aim of this study is to compare a 6 week versus a 6 month triple therapy after DES implantation.</detailed_description>
