	<brief_title>Effects of Oligofructose and Barley on Satiety and Energy Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Increasing gastro-intestinal viscosity or colonic fermentation is suggested to help improve appetite control and reduce food intake. Beta-glucan (BG) and fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) are food ingredients proposed to act this way, but results so far remain inconclusive. Objective: To test the effect of FOS, BG, or their combination in bars on appetite ratings and food intake during 2 consecutive days. Design: In a 4-way balanced order cross-over double-blind design, 21 healthy volunteers (mean BMI 25.9 kg/m2) received a meal replacement bar at 09.00h and an ad libitum lunch at 13.00h on 2 consecutive days. On day 1 only, subjects consumed a second (identical) bar at 17.00h and a fixed snack at 19.00h. The control bar contained 0.3g BG (control, from 6.8 g oats), vs equi-caloric bar formulations containing an additional: 1) 0.9 g BG (from 8.0g barley), 2) 8g FOS, or 3) 0.9 g BG + 8g FOS. Appetite scores and subsequent ad libitum test meal intakes were measured. Bar viscosities were determined under simulated gastric conditions. Results were analyzed using ANCOVA. Results: Addition of BG, FOS or their combination did not affect appetite ratings or food intake, although addition of BG to the bar doubled apparent gastric viscosity (841 vs 351 mPa.s). Conclusions: BG, FOS or their combination in bars at these levels do not improve appetite control when consumed on 2 consecutive days. Efficacy might be increased by a longer exposure period, increasing the BG content, or a form of BG that generates even higher gastric viscosity.</detailed_description>
