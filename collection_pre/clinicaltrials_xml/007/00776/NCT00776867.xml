	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether perifosine- a drug that inhibits the protein AKT, and has had some success in the treatment of adult cancers- is safe and effective in treating cancer. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on the patient and the cancer. The investigators are testing different dose schedules of perifosine and the patient will be asked to partake in one of the dose schedules.</brief_summary>
