	<brief_summary>A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Escalating Single and Multiple-Dose Study of Aramchol in Healthy Male Volunteers. Primary Objectives: 1. To assess and characterize the safety and tolerability of Aramchol in 16 healthy male subjects at single doses ranging between 30 and 900 mg (Part A) and in 30 overweight, mildly hypercholesterolemic, otherwise healthy male subjects receiving multiple doses (Part B) 2. To assess the pharmacokinetics of Aramchol at the administered doses</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Single and Multiple-Dose Study of Aramchol in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Number of Subjects: Total: A total of 46 healthy subjects will be enrolled. Part A: Sixteen (16) subjects will participate in four, 8-person dosing periods. Each cohort will be alternately dosed twice. Part B: Thirty (30) subjects will be enrolled in two, 15-person dose-ascending cohorts. Main Inclusion Criteria: Part A: Healthy male volunteers aged 18-50 (inclusive) years who have provided written informed consent Part B: Mildly overweight (25&lt;BMI&lt;33), with fasting cholesterol levels of 200-300 mg/% or LDL 100-180 mg/% and triglycerides &lt; 200 mg/%, otherwise healthy male volunteers aged 18-50 (inclusive) years, who have provided written informed consent</detailed_description>

History of drug or alcohol abuse. Known allergy to any drug. Known allergy to any drug. Clinically significant abnormalities found in the screening physical exam. Significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) determined within 40 days of the start of the study and on Day (1) before first dosing session.
