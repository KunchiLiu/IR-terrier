	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel is a antiplatelet agent and is effective at reducing intimal hyperplasia in animal models of thrombosis.Several large clinical trials have demonstrated that clopidogrel with aspirin can reduce ischemic events and mortality in patients with atherosclerotic disease,therefore the combination of two antiplatelets might be useful to prevent patients received coronary artery bypass graft surgery from Saphenous vein graft disease. the aim of this study is to estimate the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy versus aspirin alone in patients after CABG.</brief_summary>
