	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to assess the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy (bevacizumab) and androgen deprivation versus androgen deprivation alone at the time of minimal systemic disease (based on rising PSA without metastases).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Deprivation Therapy +/- Bevacizumab for PSA Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Definitive Local Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants will be randomized into one of two study groups. The first group will receive Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) plus bevacizumab. The second group will receive ADT alone. - For the Androgen Deprivation therapy either (treating physician discretion)leuprolide or goserelin acetate (given as injections) every 3 months for a total of 6 months. Bicalutamide will also be taken orally daily for a total of 6 months. - Bevacizumab will be given intravenously every three weeks for a total of 8 infusions over 6 months. - Participants will be evaluated every 7-9 weeks with vitals, physical exam, PS, laboratories including PSA and testosterone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History of biopsy documented prostate cancer (any Gleason score) Past treatment with prostatectomy with or without salvage prostate/pelvic radiation or primary radiation (external beam or brachytherapy) If past prostatectomy, pathologic stage no greater than T13, N1, M0 PSA recurrence with PSAdt &lt; 18 months. There is no minimum PSA for prostatectomy patients. For patients treated with primary radiation therapy PSA should be greater than 2.0 ng/ml No evidence of recurrent disease on exam, bone scan, CT/MRI abdomen/pelvis or CXR Prior ADT allowed if &lt; 6 months and testosterone recovered to within 50 units (ng/dl) of normal range ECOG Performance status of 01 Absolute neutrophil count of &gt;1,500 Platelet count &gt; 100,000 Hg &gt; 8g/dl No history of bleeding or thromboses within the last 12 months that required medical intervention History of cancer within 5 years, other than prostate cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer Medical condition requiring concomitant corticosteroids Active infection Prior chemotherapy allowed if was &lt; 6 cycles and &gt; 6 months prior to study entry Documented local recurrence or metastatic prostate cancer Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures Life expectancy of less than 2 years Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentechsponsored bevacizumab cancer study</criteria>
