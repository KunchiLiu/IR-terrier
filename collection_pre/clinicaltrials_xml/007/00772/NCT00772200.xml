	<brief_summary>This research trial studies neuropsychological (learning, remembering or thinking) and behavioral testing in younger patients with cancer. Collecting information over time from a series of tests may help doctors develop effective tests to measure neuropsychological and behavioral function of patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropsychological and Behavioral Testing in Younger Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To utilize a standardized battery of age-appropriate neuropsychological and behavioral tests in conjunction with Children's Oncology Group (COG) Phase III clinical trials to evaluate cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral functioning over time. II. To institute procedures to ensure a consistent, streamlined, and efficient administration of the neuropsychological/behavioral tests in a cooperative group setting in order to maximize compliance with a standardized assessment battery conducted at 3 standardized timepoints. OUTLINE: Parent and child participants complete the COG Standard Neuropsychological and Behavioral Battery testing at 9, 30, and 60 months post-diagnosis in a 1-hour session conducted by a neuropsychologist or psychologist. The Battery consists of tests of intelligence, processing speed/attention, memory, language preference, general developmental progress, attention and behavior/social/emotional function, executive function, adoptive function, and quality of life. Additionally, parents complete a parent-report questionnaire to gather information about patient's function in terms of attention, memory, executive abilities, and behavioral, social, and emotional adaption.</detailed_description>
