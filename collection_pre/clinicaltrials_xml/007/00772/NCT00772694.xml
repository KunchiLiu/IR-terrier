	<brief_summary>Germ cell tumors, a relatively rare disease, but most common malignancy in young males, occur most frequently in testis. The incidence is about 1%, but is increasing in the majority of developed countries. The testicular cancer is an extremely important oncological condition due to his high rate of 80-90% of curability, which can be achieved by combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Some of 20-30% of patients will experience disease progression after first line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and salvage 2nd line conventional-dose cisplatin-based salvage chemotherapy will result in long term remissions in &lt; 50% of patients (VeIP - vinblastine, ifosfamide, cisplatin, VIP/PEI - ifosfamide, etoposide, cisplatin, TIP - paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin). In multiple relapsed patients the 3rd line chemotherapy can induce remission in up to 40% (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin), 23% RR (TG - paclitaxel, gemcitabine), 20% CR (IPO - irinotecan, paclitaxel, oxaliplatin), but only small proportion of them can be cured, usually with subsequent consolidation surgery. At that stage the disease is usually chemorefractory and there are no other chemotherapy regimens of proven benefit (7). The purpose of this study is to determine if multiple-relapsed chemorefractory pts may benefit from sorafenib monotherapy.</brief_summary>

Known or suspected hypersensitivity to sorafenib. 11. Participants in any other clinical trial using investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study entry 12. Prior use of investigational or licensed angiogenesis and RAF kinase or MEK inhibitors. 13. Patient unwilling or unable to give informed consent 14. Any condition that may in the investigator's opinion jeopardize the safety of the patient or his compliance in the study.</criteria>
