	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple once daily ascending doses of AZD3199 delivered as dry powder via the Turbuhaler inhaler in healthy male Japanese subjects by assessment of incidence and nature of adverse events (AEs), clinically significant abnormalities in ECG parameters, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, lung function parameters, body temperature and laboratory variables (clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis). The secondary objectives of the study are to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple ascending doses of AZD3199 by assessment of the degree of accumulation, dose proportionality and time linearity in healthy Japanese subjects, and to investigate systemic Î² 2- adrenoreceptor mediated effects of single and multiple ascending doses of AZD3199 by assessment of potassium and lactate concentrations, tremor and palpitations, heart rate, QTc, pulse rate, blood pressure and FEV1.</brief_summary>
