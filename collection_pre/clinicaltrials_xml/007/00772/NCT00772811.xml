	<brief_summary>Allogeneic Non-Myeloablative Stem Cell Transplantation Using Fludarabine and Melphalan Conditioning Regimen for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Fludarabine and Melphalan Conditioning Regimen for CLL,Lymphoma,Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment plan - Conditioning chemotherapy before infusion of allogeneic stem cells will include fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days (days -6 to -2) and melphalan 100 mg/m2 at day -2. - Fludarabine and Melphalan will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes in D5W 100 mL. - Melphalan will be administered following the completion of Fludarabine infusion at day -2. - In case of unrelated donor HCT, thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S 500 mL (less than 0.5 mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500 mL (less than 2 mg/mL) IV qd on days -4, -3 and -2. Infuse over 4 hrs. Premedicate with Avil 45.5 mg IVP and Tylenol 600 mg po. Methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg in D5W 100 ml will be given IV over 30 minutes before thymoglobulin (or lymphoglobuline) on days -4 to -2. - Before the administration of melphalan, prehydration will be done intravenously with 0.9% NS 1L over 3 hours. - 30 minutes before melphalan infusion, premedication with dexamethasone 10 mg and ativan 1 mg i.v. push will be given. Appropriate antiemetics such as ondansetron 8 mg i.v. push every 4-6 hours and ativan 1-2 mg i.v. push every 4-6 hours will be administered. - Hydration with 0.9% NS at 80 mL/hour will be administered for at least 7 days. Appropriate amount of KCl should be mixed. - GVHD prophylaxis will include cyclosporine A (CSA) and methotrexate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be 15 years of age or older and 65 years of age or younger Patients with CLL, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma will be included in this study No prior anticancer treatment should be done within 30 days. Informed consent should be given. Patients should have an HLAidentical or single HLAlocus mismatched donor. Karnofsky performance scale should be 50 or over (see Appendix I). Patients must not have a psychiatric disorder or mental deficiency severe as to make compliance with the stem cell transplant treatment unlike, and making informed consent impossible. Patients with high serum creatinine level will be excluded. Patients should have uncontrolled infection.
