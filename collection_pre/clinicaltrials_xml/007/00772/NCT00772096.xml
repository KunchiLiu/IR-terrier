	<brief_summary>Delirium and long-term cognitive dysfunction are important problems in intensive care patients. Patients with sepsis are at a high risk of developing delirium (septic encephalopathy), which may be an important risk factor for the development of long-term cognitive dysfunction. Working hypotheses: 1. Septic encephalopathy and cognitive dysfunction are caused by an unspecific reaction of the brain to an intense inflammatory stimulus. 2. It is possible to therapeutically influence the inflammatory response and its effects on the brain.</brief_summary>
