	<criteria>Patients who are eligible and able to participate in the study, and who give written informed consent before any assessment is performed. Male or female outpatients, 18 years of age and older. Patients with Stage 2 hypertension. Patients must have a MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg at Study Visit 5 (randomization). Patients must have a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 but ≤ 45 kg/m2. Office blood pressure measured by cuff (MSDBP ≥ 110 mmHg and/or MSSBP ≥ 200 mmHg) at any visit. Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days of enrollment, or 5 halflives, which ever is longer. Use of aliskiren and/or a fixed dose combination of aliskiren HCTZ or participation in a clinical trial that had aliskiren and/or aliskiren HCTZ as treatment within 30 days of Visit 1. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs belonging to the same therapeutic class (ACE inhibitors or renin inhibitors) as the study drugs. History or evidence of a secondary form of hypertension. Refractory hypertension, defined as, unresponsive to triple drug therapy at the maximum dose of each drug, one of which must be a diuretic, and not at blood pressure goal (140/90 mmHg). Therapy with a fixed dose combination of two active substances represent two drugs. Patients on 4 or more antihypertensive medications. Long QT syndrome or QTc &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females at screening. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
