	<brief_summary>Background and Aims: The efficacy of portal pressure reduction by beta blockers for the management of small (≤5 mm) esophageal varices in patients of cirrhosis is not clear. The present randomized controlled trial aims to address these issues. The investigators also assessed the utility of serial HVPG measurements in these patients. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients with cirrhosis with small varices, with no history of variceal bleed, were randomized to receive propranolol or placebo. These patients were further randomized to undergo no HVPG, only baseline HVPG, or serial HVPG measurement. Propranolol was titrated to reduce heart-rate to 55/min.</brief_summary>
