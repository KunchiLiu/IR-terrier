	<brief_summary>This crossover, glucose-clamp study will investigate the impact of different basal insulin infusion rates on glucose control employing insulin pumps with different insulin delivery regimen. Patients will be randomized in one of 2 groups, to receive on the first study day insulin via pumps with pulsatile or quasi-continuous delivery modes. On the second study day they will be switched to treatment with the alternative delivery regimen. The anticipated duration of the trial is 2 study days and the target sample size is 14 individuals.</brief_summary>
