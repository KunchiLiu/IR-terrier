	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is presumed to be an axonal disease which starts at the lamina cribrosa. This assumption has led to the monitoring of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness for the diagnosis and monitoring of progression of glaucoma. However, varying disc size, myopia and tilted discs affect the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This study aims to ascertain the ration of the retinal nerve fiber layer against full retina as a predictor of glaucoma diagnosis and progression.</brief_summary>
