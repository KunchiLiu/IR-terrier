	<brief_summary>This is a European multicenter study of 90Yttrium-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (90Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan) (Zevalin®) as a front line therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma grade I-IIIa and stage III-IV (as well as for selected patients with extended abdominal stage II). For patients with complete clinical remission but persistent molecular disease subsequent to 90Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan treatment a consolidation immunotherapy with Rituximab is added, to eradicate minimal residual disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Only patients requiring treatment (B-symptoms, lymphoma progression &gt; 50% within an observation period of 6 months or less, organ compression by lymphoma or bulky disease as defined by lesions above 5 cm on one axis) may enter the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient &gt; 50 years old Follicular lymphoma grade I, II, or IIIa according to REAL/WHO classification Ann Arbor stage III, or IV, or stage II with disseminated abdominal disease requiring extensive abdominal irradiation No prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or irradiation. Furthermore, when receiving therapy as part of this "Zevalin® first line in follicular lymphoma" trial and up to six months after therapy has ended, patients may not participate in another clinical trial. If patients receive consolidation therapy with Rituximab, the six months period is counted from the end of the consolidation therapy.
