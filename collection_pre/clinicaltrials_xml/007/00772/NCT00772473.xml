	<brief_title>Correlation of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Levels in Saliva With the Evolution of an Attack of Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The release of CGRP is assumed to be initiated early in the migraine process and increases as the headache intensifies. Levels of CGRP will be measured during the premonitory, mild, moderate, and severe phases of a single migraine attack and compared to the baseline value determined when the subject was headache free. Understanding of the clinical evolution of migraine CGRP release may have significant implications in acute treatment.</detailed_description>
