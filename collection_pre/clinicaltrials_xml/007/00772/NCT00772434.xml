	<brief_summary>A wide variety of individuals are at risk for bleeding, but even though bleeding symptoms are common it is difficult to compare different people's symptoms. Recent research has found that carefully designed surveys can be used to calculate a bleeding score that is useful for diagnosing bleeding disorders, but normal individuals have not been specifically studied in large numbers with a comprehensive survey. Whether factors like race, ethnicity, age, sex, aspirin use, and previous trauma and surgery influence bleeding scores is also unknown. The primary goal of this study is to use a comprehensive computerized questionnaire to record the bleeding symptoms of normal individuals and then assess the range and severity of bleeding symptoms in this normal population. Secondary goals include determining whether race, ethnicity, age, sex, aspirin use, and previous trauma and surgery correlate with bleeding symptoms.</brief_summary>
