	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of Nerispirdine (50 mg or 400 mg) and placebo given orally as a single dose once a week in crossover design on latency of Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) P100 in optic nerves. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the effect of Nerispirdine on VEP amplitude and other visual parameters including visual acuity and contrast, as well as evaluation of the safety and tolerability of Nerispirdine in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Contrast sensitivity and visual acuity examinations (in addition to Optical Coherence Tomography [OCT] and VEPs) were needed during the screening period for defining etiologic relationships (if non-MS related impairment) and for assessing the effect of treatment of age-related eye disease versus the MS-related vision impairment.</brief_summary>
