	<brief_summary>One goal of this study is to determine whether people with different amounts of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) have different responses to events that affect blood pressure and heart rate. We will also study whether increasing dietary salt improves symptoms during upright posture. Finally, we will examine whether the dietary sodium level influences serum DBH activity and whether DBH level influences the response to sodium. DBH levels and the function of the sympathetic or involuntary nervous system will be assessed in normal volunteers and in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS).</brief_summary>
