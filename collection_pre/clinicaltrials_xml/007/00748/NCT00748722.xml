	<brief_summary>Abdominal donor-site flaps, including the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) and deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps(DIEP), are standard in autologous breast reconstruction. With significant variation in the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall, preoperative imaging is essential for preoperative planning and reducing intraoperative error. The quest continues for optimal preoperative assessment. Computed tomographic angiography has recently been proposed as a noninvasive modality for this purpose. It provides the location of the perforator vessels, diameter and anatomic course in regards to the rectus muscle. In this study we will perform preoperative lower abdominal computed tomographic angiography in DIEP flap breast reconstruction patients.</brief_summary>

We plan to study 20 patients, eligible for lower abdominal-based breast reconstruction.</detailed_description>
