	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal (CASAD) may help treat and prevent diarrhea caused by irinotecan. It is not yet known whether CASAD is more effective than a placebo in treating and preventing diarrhea in patients receiving irinotecan. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying CASAD to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating and preventing diarrhea in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving irinotecan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Aluminosilicate Anti-Diarrheal in Treating and Preventing Diarrhea in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving Irinotecan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the efficacy of calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal (CASAD) versus placebo in reducing the incidence of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving an irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen. Secondary - To compare stools per day in patients treated with these drugs. - To compare chemotherapy dose reductions and delays due to diarrhea in patients treated with these drugs. - To compare quality of life of patients treated with these drugs. - To compare the safety of these drugs in these patients. - To compare the incidence of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in patients treated with these drugs. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to chemotherapy regimen (irinotecan hydrochloride in combination with fluorouracil and/or biologic therapy vs irinotecan hydrochloride alone). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal (CASAD) 4 times daily for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and are removed from the study may receive CASAD for an additional 6 weeks. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and are removed from the study may then receive CASAD for 6 weeks. Patients undergo quality-of-life assessment at baseline and at weeks 3, 5, and 6. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.</detailed_description>
