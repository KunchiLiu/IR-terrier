So that, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Ispaghula husk in the remission of metabolic syndrome in children between 10 to 16 years old.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Plantago Ovata Husk in the Remission of Metabolic Syndrome in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is increasing in the last decade as well in adult people as in children and adolescents. The early diagnosis and treatment measures could be very important in order to reduce the cardiovascular risk in such populations. Ispaghula husk could be efficacious to reach the remission of the syndrome due to its effects in several important lipidic parameters. The study will consist in the treatment with Ispaghula husk during 4 months in patients with metabolic syndrome. The main variable is the remission of the metabolic syndrome following the IDF(International Diabetes Federation) criteria specifics for children.</detailed_description>
