	<brief_summary>This study will involve the use of a new compound, SB-656933. Accumulation of inflammatory white blood cells (mostly polymorphonuclear neutrophils)in the gut (colon) may be contributing to the pathology of ulcerative colitis. It has been shown that SB-656933 reduces polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) accumulation in pre-clinical models of colitis. 99m-Tc-HMPAO scintigraphy is a imaging technique which will be used in this study to observe the effect of SB656933 on the migration of PMN to inflamed tissue.</brief_summary>
