	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term survival rate of implants and prostheses when treating totally edentulous upper jaws with Fixture MicroThread (Micro-Macro) using a one-stage surgical procedure. Clinical study recruitment was stopped in year 2000 due to a decision to modify the product under study. This was a result of feedback regarding the subjective feeling during the installation procedure. There were no safety concerns w/r to the study products. Patients already included and treated in the study were monitored for the full duration of the study in accordance with the clinical study protocol.</brief_summary>
