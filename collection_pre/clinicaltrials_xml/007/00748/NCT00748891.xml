	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out in patients with advanced solid tumours to assess which of two different types of imaging scans best measures activity of an experimental drug called Cediranib. The study compares the imaging tests: Dynamic Contrast Enhanced CT (DCE-CT) and Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). It looks at which of these scans is the most accurate and best predicts a response to the treatment. Cediranib is thought to work by stopping blood flow to cancers, and both of these scans assess blood flow. Studying the response of cancers by measuring changes in their blood flow may provide useful information that will guide the way we manage cancers in the future.</brief_summary>
