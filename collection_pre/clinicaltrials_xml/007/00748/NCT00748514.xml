	<brief_title>A Capsular Incision and Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Perineal Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathological classification of the prostate following radical prostatectomy provides important prognostic information; an accurate pathology report is the cornerstone to cancer treatment and follow-up. In addition to the preoperative serum PSA, Gleason score on pathology specimens, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node status, and a positive surgical margin with extraprostatic extension (EPE) are significant predictors of clinical and biochemical recurrence. However, the prognostic implication of a capsular incision, a tumor extending to the inked margins without a histologically documented EPE, remains to be defined.</detailed_description>
