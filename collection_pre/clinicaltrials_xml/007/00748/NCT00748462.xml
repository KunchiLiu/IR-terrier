	<detailed_description>- The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and side effects of a fractional CO2 laser for treatment of acne scar in Asians. - Study hypothesis 1. Reduction in acne scars based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant (5%). 2. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in acne scars based on before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is statistically significant (5%) 3. Reduction in fine lines based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant (5%). 4. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in fine lines based on before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is statistically significant (5%). 5. Reduction in pigmented disorders based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant (5%). 6. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in pigmented disorders based on before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is statistically significant (5%). 7. Improvements in skin texture and pore size based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant (5%). 8. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in skin texture and pore size based on before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is statistically significant (5%).</detailed_description>
