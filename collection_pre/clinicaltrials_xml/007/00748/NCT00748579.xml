	<brief_summary>The purpose for this study (CY 1124) is to evaluate the effects of CK-1827452, a cardiac myosin activator, on myocardial systolic performance, myocardial oxygen consumption, and myocardial efficiency in patients with heart failure and to confirm that the unique preclinical pharmacological profile of CK- 1827452 is substantially the same in patients with heart failure.</brief_summary>
