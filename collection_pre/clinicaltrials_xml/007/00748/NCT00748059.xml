	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the cause of low blood pressure in selective patients who have problems with their involuntary (autonomic) nervous system. These patients frequently have had symptoms throughout their life, and their disorder might have a genetic basis. The biochemical, physiological and pharmacological procedures in this study should help us define the problem and perhaps lead to more effective treatment.</brief_summary>
