	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Growth Hormone in MPS I, II, and VI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although children with MPS I, II, and VI who are treated with Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) and/or enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are living into adulthood with good cognitive development, their quality of life is significantly impacted by their skeletal abnormalities (i.e., kyphosis, scoliosis, and genu valgum), contractures, and severe short stature. Here at the University of Minnesota we have seen some promising clinical outcomes in children with MPS IH whom we have treated with human growth hormone (hGH). There are currently no reports in the literature of the impact of treating children with MPS and short stature, with hGH on their growth velocity or characteristic skeletal abnormalities. This study will advance the care of these children by providing data in this yet unexplored area of pediatric medicine with the goal of improving the quality of life for these children by improving height, mobility, and neuropsychological functioning. This is a Phase II/III randomized, single-center, 12 month clinical trial of growth hormone in male and female participants with MPS I, II, or VI, followed by 12 months open label. Participants with height ≤ -2 SDS for age and gender will be randomized for the first 12 months 1:1 to treatment or no treatment. At the conclusion of the 12 months, all subjects will be offered an additional 12 months of treatment.</detailed_description>
