History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia Unable or unwilling to abstain from caffeineor xanthinecontaining products for 24 hours prior to dosing until the final postdose assessment at each treatment level. Use of illicit drugs. Use of alcohol for 24 hours prior to dosing until final postdose assessment at each treatment level. Consumption of red wine, oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic blood samples A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening A positive test for HIV antibody Pregnant females as determined by positive urine hCG test at screening or prior to dosing Lactating females Has a fasting triglyceride level &gt;400mg/dL (4.45mmol/L) Has anemia defined by hemoglobin concentration &lt;11.0g/dL for males or &lt;10.0g/dL for females. CPK values higher than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening. Significant ECG abnormalities abnormal vital signs as defined in the History of any gastrointestinal or hepatic conditions that could impact absorption of the investigational compound. Family history (first or second degree relatives) with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Family history of torsade de pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias. Family history of unexplained sudden death. Evidence of early depolarization (e.g., WolfParkinsonWhite syndrome). Has clinically significant rhythm abnormalities identified during 24hour Screening Holter assessment. Subjects who have asthma or a history of asthma The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within a protocol defined period Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements within 7 days or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer or 5 halflives prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation Subjects who are taking lowdose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis (81mg or less) are eligible to participate in the study, but the aspirin must be discontinued from Screening to the Followup visit Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination, or screening investigations, the investigator considers the subject unfit for the study. Subject is either an immediate family member of a participating investigator, study coordinator, employee of an investigator; or is a member of the staff conducting the study.</criteria>
