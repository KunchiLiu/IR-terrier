	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a major psychotic disorder that presents an enormous burden to the patients and their relatives. Despite treatment with second generation antipsychotics, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment often persist and determine an unfavourable course including reduction in life quality. Prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a promising noninvasive biological technique, applied adjuvant to ongoing antipsychotic treatment was demonstrated to be safe and was associated with improvement in negative symptoms in the majority of the small placebo-controlled trials. The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the efficacy of high-frequency rTMS (add-on to antipsychotic therapy) in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia compared to sham stimulation (placebo).</brief_summary>
