	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria 1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age. 2. Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. 3. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible change in the electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia). 4. Subject must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. 5. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical study for a period of one year following the index procedure. Angiographic Inclusion Criteria 1. One target or two (two target or one target and one nontarget) de novo lesion(s), each in a different epicardial vessel. 2. If there are two target lesions or one target and one nontarget lesion, both lesions must satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria. 3. The target lesion(s) or nontarget lesion must be located in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated diameter stenosis of ≥50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of ≥1. 4. The target lesion(s) or nontarget lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a reference vessel diameter by visual estimation of: Target Lesion: ≥ 2.25 mm to &lt; 2.5 mm for treatment by the 2.25 mm XIENCE V® EECS. Nontarget Lesion: ≥2.5 mm to ≤4.25 mm for treatment by the commercial XIENCE V® EECS. 5. The target lesion(s) or nontarget lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a lesion length by visual estimation of ≤28 mm. General Exclusion Criteria 1. Subject has had a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) preceding the index procedure (CKMB (creatine kinase myocardialband isoenzyme) ≥2 times the upper limit of normal) and CK and CKMB levels have not returned to within normal limits at the time of procedure. 2. The subject is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset AMI, such as nitrateunresponsive prolonged chest pain with ischemic ECG changes. 3. Subject has current unstable cardiac arrhythmias associated with hemodynamic instability. 4. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% (LVEF may be obtained at the time of the index procedure if the value is unknown and if necessary). 5. Subject has received coronary brachytherapy in any epicardial vessel. 6. Subject has received any organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant. 7. Subject is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30 days prior to or within one year after the index procedure. 8. Subject is receiving or scheduled to receive planned radiation therapy to the chest or mediastinum. 9. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus etc.). 10. Subject is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, coumadin). 11. Subjects who will require Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) postprocedure. 12. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, everolimus, cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoropolymers or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated. 13. Elective surgery is planned within 12 months after the procedure that will require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel. 14. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC (white blood cell) of &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease (including laboratory evidence of hepatitis). 15. Subject has known renal insufficiency (eg, serum creatinine level ≥ 2.5 mg/dL, or on dialysis). 16. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. 17. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident/stroke or transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) within the past six months. 18. Subject has had a significant gastrointestinal or significant urinary bleed within the past six months. 19. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion. 20. Subject has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year). 21. Subject is currently participating in another clinical study that has not yet completed its primary endpoint. 22. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria 1. Target lesion(s) or nontarget lesion located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to a diseased (vessel irregularity per angiogram and &gt; 20% stenosed lesion by visual estimation) arterial or saphenous vein graft. 2. Target lesion(s) or nontarget lesion involving a bifurcation with a side branch ≥2 mm in diameter and/or ostial lesion &gt; 40% stenosed by visual estimation or side branch requiring protection guide wire, or side branch requiring dilatation. 3. Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), prior to crossing with the wire. 4. Another lesion requiring revascularization is located in the same epicardial vessel of either the target or nontarget lesion. 5. Restenotic lesion. 6. Aortoostial lesion (within 3 mm of the aorta junction). 7. Left main location. 8. Lesion located within 2 mm of the origin of the LAD (left anterior descending) or LCX (left coronary artery) 9. Extreme angulation (≥90°) or excessive tortuosity (≥ two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target or nontarget lesion. 10. Heavy calcification proximal to or within the target or nontarget lesion(s). 11. Target or nontarget vessel contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images. 12. Target lesion(s) or nontarget lesion have a high probability that a procedure other than predilatation and stenting will be required at the time of index procedure for treating the target and nontarget vessel(s) (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon). 13. Target or nontarget vessel(s) have previously been treated with percutaneous intervention (e.g. balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) &lt; 9 months prior to index procedure. 14. A vessel not intended to be treated with a 2.25 mm XIENCE V® EECS or commercial sizes of XIENCE V® EECS that was previously treated with any type of PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) &lt; 90 days prior to the index procedure. 15. Additional clinically significant lesion(s) (e.g., %DS (diameter stenosis) ≥ 50%) is present in any vessel or side branch for which PCI may be required &lt; 90 days after the index procedure.</criteria>
