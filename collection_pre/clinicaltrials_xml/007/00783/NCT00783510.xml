	<brief_summary>This is a global registry, to evaluate the long-term safety of Humira® in patients with moderate to severe polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), that are treated as recommended in the Humira® product label. Patients treated with MTX will be considered a reference group. Patients will be followed in both the Humira® and Methotrexate (MTX) arms for 10 years from the enrollment date into one of the treatment arms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This registry will assess the incidence and rate of Humira (monotherapy or combination therapy with MTX) or MTX observational and treatment-emergent SAEs, Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) and Pregnancy in patients diagnosed with moderately to severely active polyarticular or polyarticular-course JIA through Year 5. From Year 6 through Year 10 SAEs, a subset of AESI that includes congestive heart failure (CHF), malignancies, AEs at least possibly related to and/or leading to discontinuation of registry treatment and pregnancies will be collected. For JIA patients 2 to&lt; 4 years of age in countries with available local approval for this group of patients at the time of consent to the registry, emergent AESI, SAEs and pregnancy (at the age when a patient can become pregnant) will be collected for the full 10 years. The approved age range for HUMIRA in the U.S., European Union (EU) and in Australia is 4 years of age and older, and recent approval in EU for JIA patients 2 to &lt; 4 years of age. Patients who discontinue from the registry before 10 years will be offered to participate in the direct to Health Care Provider follow-up process, as allowed by local regulations.</detailed_description>

For a patient enrolling into the MTX arm; a pediatric patient diagnosed at any time with moderately to severely active polyarticular or polyarticularcourse JIA (defined as arthritis affecting &gt;= 5 joints at the time of diagnosis of polyarticular or polyarticularcourse JIA) who is prescribed MTX therapy alone or in combination with other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) according to the local product labeling (initiated treatment within 24 months of registry entry) and has received continuous therapy and the physician can available provide source documentation of SAEs, AEs of Special Interest, and dosing information since initiation of therapy. Patients who were treated in the MTX arm of this registry and prematurely discontinued from the MTX arm due to being a nonresponder, or became intolerant of MTX treatment or are in need of combination treatment with HUMIRA® therapy may be eligible to enroll into the HUMIRA® treatment arm if all ongoing AEs/SAEs have been resolved, and they meet inclusion criteria and can enroll within the registry enrollment period. In case of ongoing AEs/SAEs at the time of the treatment arm switch, the AbbVie Designated Physician should be contacted to assess the eligibility of patient to roll into Humira treatment arm.
