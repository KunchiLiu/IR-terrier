	<brief_title>Aspirin and Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is now a major health concern among persons with HIV infection. Our general hypothesis is that HIV-mediated inflammation and injury to vascular surfaces up-regulates thrombotic pathways and leads to damage of blood vessels that is promotes development of cardiovascular disease. HIV drug treatment (antiretroviral therapy; ART) may reduce inflammation and vessel injury via suppression of HIV replication, but also includes side effects or toxicity that may increase risk for cardiovascular disease in and of itself. In this context, additional anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic medications are needed. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an excellent candidate and is commonly used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population, but few studies have examined it's use in persons with HIV infection. The goal of this study is to generate pilot data regarding changes in measures of cardiovascular risk, as determined by reductions in inflammatory and thrombotic blood markers and a decrease in blood vessel injury (blood markers) and dysfunction (assessment of arterial elasticity), that occur after starting ART and aspirin among persons with HIV infection.</detailed_description>
