	<detailed_description>This study aims at the improvement of muscular function by physical exercise in prefrail elderly persons. Prefrail participants are recruited according to the frailty score of Fried. Taking into account, that vitamin D supplementation reduces falls and improves muscle strength in older people, all participants are supplemented by vitamin D. Two different training methods are tested. After a run-in period of supplementation of vitamin D for two months, participants will be randomized into three different equally sized groups (n=25): Group A will receive power training. Group B will have progressive strength training. Group C will serve as a control group. They will receive a consultation about leading a healthy life with special attention being paid to nutrition and physical activity. The intervention period lasts for 12 weeks. The 60 minutes training sessions will be held two times a week by members of the Institute of Sport Science and Sports of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Follow-up visits are scheduled three and six months after intervention period.</detailed_description>
