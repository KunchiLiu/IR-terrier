	<brief_summary>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap initiative to develop a computerized system measuring patient-reported outcomes in respondents with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics. In the first four years of its existence, the PROMIS network developed item banks for measuring patient-reported outcomes in the areas of pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical function, and social functioning. During the item banking process, the PROMIS network conducted focus groups, individual cognitive interviews, and lexile (reading level) analyses to refine the meaning, clarity, and literacy demands of all items. The item banks were administered to over 20,000 respondents and calibrated using models based on item response theory (IRT). Using these IRT calibrations, computerized adaptive test (CAT) algorithms were developed and implemented. The network has designed a series of studies using clinical populations to evaluate the item attributes, examine their utility as CATs, and validate the item banks. More information on the PROMIS network can be found at www.nihpromis.org. The purpose of this research study is to learn about the experience and impact of having congestive heart failure (CHF). In particular, we hope to develop better questionnaires that can measure heart failure patients' quality-of-life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validating PROMIS Instruments in Congestive Heart Failure Patients Receiving a Heart Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will assess the validity (including responsiveness) of selected Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in patients with severe CHF who receive heart transplants. The following is a list of goals for this project: - To estimate the responsiveness of PROMIS domain scores by comparing scores in patients with severe heart failure before and after a clinically significant event (heart transplant). The specific PROMIS domains assessed are physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with discretionary social activities, depression, and global health. - To estimate the responsiveness of a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Vitality subscale (SF-36v2), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). - To collect cross-sectional and longitudinal data on traditional clinical measures of heart failure outcome (6-minute walk test and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class) that can inform the definition of a minimally important difference (MID) for the PROMIS domains of physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with discretionary social activities, depression, and global health.</detailed_description>
