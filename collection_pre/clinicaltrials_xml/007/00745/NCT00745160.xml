	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if collecting information and blood from a group of people who never smoked but who have lung cancer, is possible across the US. The investigators will collect information on each patient's diagnosis and treatments. If the collection is successful, blood samples will be used to try to identify new genes (which are the basic elements of heredity, passed from parents to their offspring), which may explain and predict why certain patients develop lung cancer without having smoked tobacco.</brief_summary>
