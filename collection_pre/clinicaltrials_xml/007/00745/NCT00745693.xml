	<brief_title>The Effects of Diesel Exhaust Inhalation on Vascular Function - the Role of Endothelin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Air pollution is a major problem, and can be linked to around 5% of all deaths worldwide each year. There are strong associations between air pollution exposure and heart disease but we do not yet understand how these harmful effects are mediated. Understanding this mechanism is likely to have a major impact on the way we treat patients with heart disease and have the potential to shape future environmental health policy. The upregulation of Endothelin-1 provides a plausible mechanism for these harmful effects, and we plan to investigate this in more depth in the human forearm following exposure to diesel exhaust.</detailed_description>
