	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to examine a low and high dose of tapentadol extended release tablet taken orally twice a day to reduce pain in subjects suffering from chronic moderate to severe pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee during a 4-week period. Subjects steadily increased their dose up to the low (100 mg) or high (200 mg) dose. Pain relief was compared to subjects taking placebo tablets or oxycodone extended release tablet, 20 mg. The serum concentrations and safety of tapentadol and oxycodone were also examined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Tapentadol Extended Release Tablets in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Pain in Subjects With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthritis is the most common chronic debilitating disease in the United States (more than 43 million people or 1 in 6). Osteoarthritis of the knee is a very common and a major cause of disability. Pharmacological treatment includes the following analgesics: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-II) inhibitors, acetaminophen and opioids. Despite the numerous available analgesic medications, 60% to 80% of patients suffering from chronic pain are currently treated inadequately. Opioid analgesics have been shown to be efficacious in chronic non-malignant pain and can be an important therapeutic asset. The study was a 4-week randomized multicenter double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, forced-titration phase 2B study of efficacy and safety with tapentadol extended release (ER) to 233 mg BID and oxycodone PR to 20 mg BID vs placebo in subjects with moderate to severe chronic pain of knee osteoarthritis. Primary efficacy outcome was the average pain intensity 24 hours before the last evaluation time or 29 days. Safety was evaluated by reporting of adverse events, laboratory tests, vital sign measures, ECGs. This study hypothesis was that tapentadol extended release was effective in relieving chronic moderate to severe pain from knee osteoarthritis compared to treatment with placebo using 2 dosing regimens for tapentadol. tapentadol extended release white, fim-coated tablet taken orally twice a day during a 4-week period at a dose that steadily increased up to 100 mg or 200 mg; placebo tablets; or oxycodone extended release tablet, 20 mg.</detailed_description>
