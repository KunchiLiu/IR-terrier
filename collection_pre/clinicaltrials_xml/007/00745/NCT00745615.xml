	<brief_summary>This is a continuation of the LAQ/5063 study which was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two doses of laquinimod in subjects with R-R MS followed by an open label phase of laquinimod 0.6 mg daily (LAQ/5063 OL). Subjects entering this randomized, two active arms study immediately after completion of the LAQ/5062 core study. Subjects entering the open-label phase (LAQ/5063 OL) upon the termination visit of LAQ/5063 active double-blind phase Subjects previously treated with placebo in the LAQ/5062 study are equally randomized to one of the active treatment groups: 0.6 mg of laquinimod per os (p.o.) once daily 0.3 mg of laquinimod p.o. once daily Subjects previously treated with laquinimod 0.6 mg or laquinimod 0.3 mg continuing on their original treatment assignment. The LAQ/5063 study assessed the 0.3mg and the 0.6mg daily doses of laquinimod in patients who completed the LAQ/5062 study. Upon the termination visit of LAQ/5063 active double-blind phase (completion of the full 36 weeks or as requested by the Sponsor) and after meeting the eligibility criteria of the open-label phase, all subjects began treatment with laquinimod 0.6 mg once daily for 24 months In the current phase, this open-label extension is further extended in additional 36 months of treatment with laquinimod 0.6mg once daily.</brief_summary>
