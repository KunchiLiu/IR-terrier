	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Cycle Control With Norgestimate/Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol in Healthy Sexually Active Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study in healthy sexually active females to evaluate cycle control with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol versus drospireneone/ethinyl estradiol. The Open-Label Treatment Phase will last for three 28-day cycles. Approximately 300 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion according to a predetermined randomization schedule. Patients will be seen for a baseline visit (Visit 1) up to 35 days prior to dosing to obtain informed consent, have a physical examination including a breast exam, height and weight, vital signs, a Chlamydia test and a urine pregnancy test performed, and to give their medical history. Patients will be instructed to report bleeding data using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) based diary on a daily basis. Patients will be instructed to continue taking 1 pill each day for 3 cycles, record this information daily in the IVRS and to contact the study site if they have any questions or adverse events they would like to discuss. The final study visit (Visit 2) will occur on Day 8 after completing 3 cycles of study medication. Patients will be weighed, have vital signs performed, report any adverse events and or changes in concomitant medications, and complete the satisfaction questionnaire at the final visit. Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, adverse events, body weight and vital signs. Patients randomized to drospireneone/ethinyl estradiol and taking any medication that could increase serum potassium levels (as outlined in the Package Insert) will also have their potassium level checked during their first cycle of treatment (Days 15 to 28 of treatment). Three 28-day cycles of either norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol or drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol.</detailed_description>

History or presence of disorders commonly accepted as contraindications to steroid hormonal therapy Previously discontinued ORTHO TRICYCLEN LO or YAZ due to breakthrough bleeding Pregnant or lactating Body mass index (BMI) of &gt;40kg/m2 Clinical evidence of carcinoma or other malignancy (history of basal cell carcinoma of the skin is not exclusionary) History of alcohol or drug abuse in the investigator's judgment based on history and physical examination (within 12 months prior to Visit 1) Significant depression or psychiatric disease in the investigator's judgment based on history and physical examination which would result in an unreliable patient Patient deemed by the investigator to have questionable reliability in her ability to comply with the protocol and provide accurate information Have any medical condition or planned surgical procedure which, in the opinion of the investigator, may be exacerbated by treatment with study medication or a patient receiving any concurrent therapy that could be affected by treatment with study medication Disallowed therapies: currently taking therapeutic anticoagulants (e.g,. Coumadin, Heparin) or have a bleeding disorder (e.g. von Willebrand's Disease), DepoProvera or other hormonal injectables in the six months before Visit 1, currently have Norplant or other hormonal implants in place, or have had removal of Norplant within 60 days prior to Visit 1, used a steroidcontaining IUD within 3 months prior to Visit 1 Or current use of an IUD Consistently elevated blood pressure defined as sitting systolic BP&gt;140 mmHg or diastolic BP&gt;90 mmHg Have an untreated thyroid disorder in the investigator's judgment based on history and physical examination unable to swallow solid, oral dosage forms whole with the aid of water (participants may not chew, divide, dissolve, or crush the study drug) Patients who in the opinion of the investigator should not be enrolled in the study based on the product labeling for ORTHO TRICYCLEN LO and YAZ including potential drugdrug interactions Have received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 30 days before the planned start of treatment</criteria>
