	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is effective in reducing depression symptoms in individuals who have experienced a traumatic brain injury. The investigators hypothesize that participants who are given the ten-week intervention will have fewer depression symptoms than the participants in the control group, and this improvement will be maintained at the three-month follow-up assessment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Intervention to Treat Depression in Individuals With a Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression is a significant chronic problem for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and its treatment is difficult. A promising approach to treat depression is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a relatively new therapeutic approach rooted in mindfulness-based stress-reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This multi-site, randomized, controlled trial of a MBCT intervention will examine the value of this intervention in improving quality of life and decreasing depression in people with TBI. MBCT may represent a time-limited, cost-effective group intervention through which clinicians would have an opportunity to address some of the most debilitating aspects of TBI.</detailed_description>

Evidence of unusual psychological processes such as psychosis, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, or major concurrent mental illness (Beck Depression InventoryII and Symptom Checklist90R will supplement the decisionmaking process of study clinicians).</criteria>
