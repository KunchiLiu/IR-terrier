	<brief_summary>Non-invasive assessment of blood flow to organs has long challenged clinicians. Recently, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been recognized as a methodology that may achieve this goal. A commercially available NIRS monitor, marketed by Somanetics, Inc., is now in widespread use in the clinical care of pediatric cardiac patients in the operating room and in the intensive care unit post-operatively. When a patch/probe from the monitor is placed on the forehead or lower back, blood oxygen concentration data is obtained which has been found to correlate with actual blood samples taken by IV. The presence of this NIRS data would give the surgeon important feedback about blood flow to important areas like the brain and kidneys during heart surgeries on children and after the operation is completed in the intensive care unit. The investigator wishes to perform a prospective study of the NIRS monitor use with children that need heart surgeries that require heart-lung bypass and sometimes require monitoring in the ICU, post-operatively.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After patients are prospectively consented pre-operatively, standard medical care, including the use of the NIRS monitor, will be implemented during the patient's operation and post-operatively in the intensive care unit with few modifications. These modifications include: (1) the placement of an oximetric probe in the lumen of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit tubing which will output continuous blood oxygen content during bypass, (2) the addition of extra connectors to the bypass tubing to allow blood draws during surgery, (3) placement of doppler blood flow probes on the tubing to measure blood flow velocity, and (4) the addition of LFTs during the post-operative phase, if followed. Patients that receive operations that require circulatory arrest and/or selective cerebral perfusion will be followed in the ICU for 5 days. Data from the bypass machine along, data collected from the NIRS and oximetric probe monitor, and serum data will be interfaced into a data collection system. Data to be collected: Minimum patient demographic data (age, sex, ethnic origin), NIRS data, serum blood gas data, serum lactate levels, hemoglobin levels, vital signs, doppler blood flow data, LFT analysis, clinical course events/data (i.e. need for dialysis, length of stay, surgical time points, etc), diagnostic test results (EKGs, ECHOs, etc), significant medical history data, and standard of care laboratory results. The investigator wishes to evaluate the relationship of this data with the patient's diagnosis, operation performed, post-operative course, and outcome. Validation of the use of the NIRS monitor and further characterization of the NIRS monitor will also be sought.</detailed_description>
