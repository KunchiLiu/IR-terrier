	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a multi center, prospective, randomized, parallel study designed to compare septal to apical ICD lead placement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Septal Positioning of Ventricular Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Leads</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate that septal positioning of the right ventricular defibrillation lead is not inferior to the apical positioning in terms of safety and efficacy in a population of ICD recipients.</detailed_description>
