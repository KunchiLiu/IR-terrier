	<brief_title>Comparing Raltegravir Genital Tract Distribution in HIV-infected Men and Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although we have many medications to fight the HIV virus, very little is known about how much of these medications get into the genital tract. Raltegravir is a new HIV medication that blocks HIV growth and lowers the amount of virus in the blood in a way that is different than all other currently available HIV medications. Raltegravir was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in HIV infected patients, but there is very little information concerning how much raltegravir will reach the genital tract of men or women. The purpose of this research study is to determine how much raltegravir gets into the male and female genital tract.</detailed_description>
