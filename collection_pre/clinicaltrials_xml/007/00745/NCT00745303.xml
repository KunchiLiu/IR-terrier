	<brief_title>Effect of Tai Chi Chuan on Autonomic Nervous Modulation in Aged Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) is a traditional Oriental conditioning exercise or calisthenics that is believed by many people around the world to be good for the health. The frequently claimed reason for this merit of TCC is that it can improve the cardiopulmonary function and immunity of the subject who practice it continuously. TCC has been shown to delay the decline of aerobic power, improve the cardiopulmonary function, balance and strength of the subjects. One study has demonstrated that TCC could reduce tension, anxiety, and mood disturbance. However, few studies have examined the effect of TCC on the blood lipid profile and immunity of the TCC practitioners. Another study reported that 12-week programme of regular TCC exercise enhanced functional mobility, personal health expectations, and regulatory T cell function. It has also been shown that an appropriate combination of TCC exercise program with diabetic medication might improve both glucose metabolism and immunity in type 2 diabetic patients. Since TCC training has been shown to be beneficial to the cardiopulmonary function of the subject, TCC may also have an effect on the blood lipid profile and immunity of the subjects. We hypothesize that TCC might have a beneficial effect on the pulmonary function, autonomic nervous modulation, lipid profile, and cytokines production in the aged subjects. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine whether or not TCC have these effects in the aged subjects.</detailed_description>
