	<detailed_description>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at an increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Non-traditional risk factors such as inflammation and insulin resistance have important contributions to accelerated atherosclerosis in ESRD patients receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPAR-g) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Activation of the PPAR-g has been shown in both clinical and experimental studies to have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties other than insulin-sensitizing effects. Recent study also showed that PPAR-g agonists reduce plaque inflammation by inhibiting the activation of proinflammatory genes responsible for plaque development and growth. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects of PPAR-g activation on the progression of carotid plaque in diabetic ESRD patients receiving long-term PD using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</detailed_description>
