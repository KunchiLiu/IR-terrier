	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the study is to compare treatment with the ATRA TECH Implant System, OsseoSpeed™ implant in the maxilla of postmenopausal women with and without systemic osteoporosis. The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in marginal bone level alterations between the two groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision of informed consent Postmenopausal women aged 60 years and over In need of 28 implants in maxilla A history of edentulism in the area of implant treatment of at least 6 months. A BMD value suitable either for group A or group B: Group A (Osteoporosis/osteopenia): BMD at least 2 standard deviations below mean peak bone density of young adults for the spine and total hip (Tscore = 2SD or less). Absolute values (g/cm2) will be used. Group B (Control): BMD not more than 1 standard deviation below mean peak bone density of young adults for the spine and total hip (Tscore = 1SD or more). Absolute values (g/cm2) will be used. Unlikely to be able to comply with study procedures, as judged by the investigator. Untreated, uncontrolled caries and/or periodontal disease Known or suspected current malignancy History of chemotherapy within 5 years prior to surgery History of radiation in the head and neck region History of other metabolic bone diseases, e.g. Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, fibrous dysplasia or osteomalacia A medical history that makes implant insertion unfavourable Need for systemic corticosteroids Current or previous use of intravenous bisphosphonates (esp. zoledronic acid) Current or previous use of oral bisphosphonates History of bone grafting and/or sinus lift in the planned implant area Current need for bone grafting and/or sinus lift in the planned implant area Present alcohol and/or drug abuse Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both Astra Tech AB staff or staff at the study site) Previous enrolment in the present study.
