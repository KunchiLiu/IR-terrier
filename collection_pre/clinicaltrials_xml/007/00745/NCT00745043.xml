	<brief_summary>Smoking causes both smoking related lung disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease. These are very common conditions and many patients have both diseases. Beta-blocker drugs are extensively used in the treatment of angina, high blood pressure and after heart attacks to decrease symptoms and prolong life. Beta-agonists are used in COPD to decrease breathlessness and improve exercise tolerance. It used to be thought that beta-blockers cannot be used in COPD patients as they may make the breathlessness worse, but it has now been established that they can be used safely. Beta-blocker drugs and beta-agonists have 'opposite' effects on the body and the investigators do not know if they can work together or if they would cancel each other out. The investigators also do not know which of the different types of beta-blockers now available are better for COPD patients. This study will investigate what happens to the airways of people taking both of these drugs.</brief_summary>
