	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly that affects a million patients in US. Sleep dysfunction impacts up to 90% of PD patients. PD patients experience a variety of sleep disorders including parasomnias, specifically REM behavior disorder (RBD) that can precede the onset of motor manifestations of PD. RBD has negative consequences on patients' and their bed partners' quality of life mainly due to its impact on the sleep quality and day time alertness. RBD also predisposes affected individuals and their bed partners to physical injuries. There are no FDA approved treatments for RBD. Clonazepam is the most commonly used treatment but carries risks of daytime sedation, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. More recently, melatonin has been demonstrated to be effective in several small studies. Ramelteon, a selective melatonin receptor agonist with favorable safety profile, could potentially be effective for the treatment of RBD. This pilot protocol will investigate safety and efficacy of ramelteon for the treatment of RBD in subjects with parkinsonism. We plan to recruit 20 subjects with RBD diagnosed based on the clinical interview and confirmed by the polysomnographic (PSG) data. The study is designed as a prospective randomized placebo controlled 12-week study. Primary outcome measure will be change in frequency of RBD events based on the daily sleep diaries. Secondary outcome measure will be change in the amount of tonic muscle activity based on the results of the baseline and final PSG. A number of other secondary and exploratory outcome measures will be collected</brief_summary>
