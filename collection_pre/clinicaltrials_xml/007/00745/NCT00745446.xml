	<brief_title>The Effect of a Retrofit Particle Trap on the Vascular Effects of Diesel Exhaust Inhalation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18 subjects healthy male volunteers will be recruited at Ume√• University. In a randomised, double blind 3 way crossover trial, subjects will be exposed to filtered air, diesel exhaust (300mcg/m3) or filtered diesel exhaust for 1 hour during intermittent exercise. 2 hours following the exposure, thrombogenicity will be assessed using the Badimon chamber - an ex-vivo model of thrombosis formed under constant flow conditions. Forearm blood flow in response to infused intra-brachial vasodilators will be measured using venous occlusion plethysmography 6 hours after the exposure. Arterial stiffness will be measured using peripheral arterial applanation tonometry in the hour post-exposure. Blood samples will be collected at timepoints over the 24 hours after exposure.</detailed_description>
