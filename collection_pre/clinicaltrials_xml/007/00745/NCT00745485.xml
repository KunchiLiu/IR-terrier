	<brief_summary>1. The study will assess the safety and tolerability of a single-infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg administered in a private medical practice setting by a nurse provided by a nationwide infusion service. Safety data will largely be monitored by investigating changes in the patients' well-being during the study. 2. The study will pilot and test a Patient Registry and Infusion Service process, which will allow zoledronic acid to be administered to trial patients in the investigators' private rooms by a team of roving nurses.</brief_summary>
