	<brief_summary>The venous thromboembolism is one of the first causes of maternal mortality. Until 2003, only a few recommendations were available on the optimal use of antithrombotic therapy as a preventive measure against thromboembolism in pregnant women. In this study, we propose : 1. To gather the experts who took part in the French consensus conference and the local experts to create a score in accordance with the national and international consensus and to give some precise therapeutic strategies. 2. To evaluate the discriminant, feasible and useful character of this new score by a random prospective multicentric study including 2280 pregnant women with a risk of thromboembolism or placental vascular pathology who will benefit from therapeutic strategies defined by the new score.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To create a score inspired by our first experience i.e. simple, standardized and quickly usable in day-to-day practice to individualize antithrombotics prescription to women at risk.</detailed_description>
