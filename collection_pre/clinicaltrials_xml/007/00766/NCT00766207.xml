	<brief_summary>This study will use a factorial design randomized controlled trial to (1)compare multi-faceted decision support (intervention) to streamlined clinical alerts (control) and (2) evaluate whether collecting information about women's risk of pregnancy using a networked tablet computer (intervention) is superior to the way clinicians usually collect this information (control). Over the course of 1 year, we will abstract data from the electronic medical record when study clinicians prescribe teratogenic medications, conduct phone interviews with women prescribed medications by participating clinicians, and survey participating clinicians about their satisfaction with the decision support they receive. We will use this data to confirm our hypotheses that clinicians in the intervention groups will (1) prescribe fewer teratogenic medications, (2) be more likely to prescribe contraception when a teratogenic medication is prescribed, (3) have more patients report satisfaction with the counseling they received, and (4) report more satisfaction with the decision support they received.</brief_summary>
