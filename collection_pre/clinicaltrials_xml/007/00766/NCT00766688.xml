	<brief_summary>The present study is assessing the efficacy and safety of AVE5530 (25 mg and 50 mg) in add-on to ongoing treatment with high doses of statin in a double-blind manner in comparison with placebo, in the management of patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia considered as inadequately controlled despite their ongoing statin treatment. The main objective is to evaluate the effects of the association AVE5530+statin on LDL-C level reduction after 12 weeks of treatment. The effects of AVE5530 on other lipid parameters will be assessed as secondary objectives.</brief_summary>
