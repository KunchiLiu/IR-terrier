	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Lu AA34893 in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is reported to be the most common mood disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of about 15% and as high as 25% in women. MDD is characterised by the presence of one or more Major Depressive Episodes (MDEs) that presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, and poor concentration. MDD is a disabling, severe illness that tends to be chronic, and repeated episodes are common. Despite the availability of a range of effective treatments in MDD, a significant proportion of patients do not respond or achieve remission and many relapse despite continued treatment. Lu AA34893 has a novel mechanism of action and this could be of clinical relevance in addressing currently unmet needs in MDD.</detailed_description>
