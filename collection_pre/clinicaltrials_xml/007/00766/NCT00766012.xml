	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD2066 when given as multiple doses to Japanese healthy male subjects. Four (4) consecutive multiple-ascending panels are planned. Subjects will start with an initial single dose that is followed by a wash-out period of 48 hours to adequately define the single-dose pharmacokinetics. For the third and forth dose panels, the wash-out period will be extended to be 96 hours to evaluate the safety of subjects. Thereafter the subjects will be dosed once daily for 10 days. Ten (10) subjects will be allocated to each dose panel and randomized to receive either AZD2066 or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD2066 when given as multiple doses to Japanese healthy male subjects. Four (4) consecutive multiple-ascending panels are planned. Subjects will start with an initial single dose that is followed by a wash-out period of 48 hours to adequately define the single-dose pharmacokinetics. For the third and forth dose panels, the wash-out period will be extended to be 96 hours to evaluate the safety of subjects. Thereafter the subjects will be dosed once daily for 10 days. Furthermore, the study has been expanded to include two additional panels with increment of dose during the multiple dosing period (12 days) in order to obtain sufficient information on safety and tolerability of multiple dosing of AZD2066 in Japanese subjects at higher levels of exposure. Ten (10) subjects will be allocated to each dose panel and randomized to receive either AZD2066 or placebo.</detailed_description>
