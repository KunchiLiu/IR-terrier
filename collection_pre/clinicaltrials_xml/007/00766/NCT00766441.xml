	<brief_summary>This study will assess if Sitagliptin addition to metformin or glitazone is better than current sulphonylurea based treatments during Ramadan. The rationale is that Sitagliptin offers metabolic advantages primarily with the low incidence of hypoglycemia over current sulphonylurea based treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin Versus Sulphonylurea in Type 2 Diabetes During Ramadan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To define metabolic alterations during Ramadan: 1. Primary end point: Occurrence of hypoglycemia. The patients will record hypoglycaemic episodes in a self-monitoring diary together with blood glucose values. 2. Secondary endpoints: Body weight, fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)/Fructosamine, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). 3. A subgroup will undergo CGMS assessment to define glycaemic excursions during and after fasting.</detailed_description>
