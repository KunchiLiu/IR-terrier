	<brief_summary>The study investigates safety, feasibility and effectiveness of cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in prevention of cerebral arterial vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). It is postulated that 2 week long stimulation of the cervical spinal cord using an implanted epidural electrode will prevent or decrease severity of cerebral arterial vasospasm following aSAH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cervical Spinal Cord Stimulation for the Prevention of Cerebral Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous stimulation of the cervical spinal cord for 14 days after electrode implantation (within 3 days after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage). The single-arm single-institution non-randomized prospective study evaluates effects of cervical spinal cord stimulation on prevention of cerebral arterial vasospasm. The patients are followed for 12 months after completion of stimulation.</detailed_description>
