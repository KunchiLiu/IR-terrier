	<brief_summary>In this study, we are looking at blood concentrations of Kaletra in HIV positive patients during pregnancy. The patients will come in for 4 visits lasting ~24hrs. These visits take place at 20-24 weeks, 30 weeks, 32 weeks and 8 weeks post-partum. At the end of vist 2 (week 30), we will increase your dose to 2 adult Kaletra tablets, and one pediatric Kaletra tablet (total dose 500/125mg). The dose will remain increased until you are 2 weeks post partum, then it will return to the standard 2 adult tablets (400/100mg).</brief_summary>
