	<brief_summary>Drug eluting stents significantly reduced the rate of in-stent restenosis in coronary arteries. There are several kinds of DES i.e. eluting the drug either from stable or biodegradable polymer. The type of the polymer may impact the clinical outcome. The aim of our study was to compare safety and efficacy of implantation of two different types of stents eluting paclitaxel from stable vs biodegradable polymer (TAXUS stent vs LUC-CHOPIN stent) into coronary artery by-pass graft.</brief_summary>
