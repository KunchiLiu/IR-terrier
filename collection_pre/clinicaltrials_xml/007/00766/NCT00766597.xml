	<brief_title>Safety and Immune Response to Vicriviroc in Combination Regimens in HIV-Infected ART Experienced Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that includes a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) has become the standard treatment of HIV-infected adults and children. When effective, HAART decreases the viral population, increases the body's immune responses, and leads to decreased disease progression and increased survival. However, several factors including poor adherence, drug toxicities, and drug resistance complicate HIV management and allow for children and adolescents to develop resistance to multiple drug classes, leaving them with very limited therapeutic options. Fortunately, drugs with new mechanisms of action, such as HIV entry inhibitors, demonstrate activity even in people with resistance to the currently available reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of Vicriviroc (VCV), an HIV entry inhibitor. Vicriviroc targets the CCR5 chemokine receptor, which HIV uses to bind and enter CD4+ cells. This study is a two-stage, age-stratified, non-comparative study to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and antiviral activity of the investigational CCR5 inhibitor Vicriviroc in HIV-infected treatment experienced children and adolescents. In Step I participants will be screened for the co-receptor CCR5 to assess whether they can enter Step II. Only participants with CCR5-tropic virus are eligible for Step II - the main portion of the study to evaluate the study outcome measures. Those participants who continue to Step II will be assigned to one of four age-stratifies cohorts which will receive varying forms, either liquid or tablet, of Vicriviroc: Cohort I: 12 years to less than 19 years of age, to receive tablet formulation of VCV Cohort II: 6 years to less than 12 years of age, to receive tablet formulation of VCV Cohort III: 6 years to less than 12 years of age, to receive liquid formulation of VCV Cohort IV: 2 years to less than 6 years of age, to receive liquid formulation of VCV Dose strengths of 20 mg and 30 mg will be used, or in liquid formulation at a concentration of 1mg/mL. Step II is composed of Stage I and Stage II. Stage I is a dose ranging study designed to explore how the body responds to different doses of vicriviroc, including safety factors associated with dosage. After optimal dosage information and safety measures have been assessed for the different cohorts in Stage I, Stage II will open. Stage II will evaluate the long term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of vicriviroc. The study, including Steps I and II will last for approximately 48 weeks. Follow-up for all subjects exposed to vicriviroc will last for 5 years after initial exposure. Visits will be every 3 months for subjects on study provided vicriviroc and every 6 months for subjects who discontinue vicriviroc. The study was terminated shortly after the initiation, when the drug company decided to discontinue development of the study drug. As of study termination, nine participants had enrolled under Cohort I in Step I, but only 4 participants had CCR5 tropism and received the study medication under Step II. All 4 participants had limited post-baseline data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed HIV infection Treatment experienced subjects: Children or adolescents on an unchanged therapeutic regimen for at least 12 weeks and experiencing virologic failure OR participants on no treatment for 4 weeks or more but with history of virologic failure on a prior therapeutic regimen. Likely to have virus that is sensitive to at least one ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor HIV viral load greater than or equal to 1,000 copies/ml within 90 days prior to Step I entry Able to swallow study medication, in tablets or liquid form specific to ageassigned cohort Parent, legal guardian or participant able and willing to provide signed informed consent and to have the participant followed at the clinic site Willing to use effective methods of contraception Inclusion Criteria for Step II (In addition to the inclusion criteria for Step I): Participant's plasma HIV tested at Step I must be R5 tropic Genotypic sensitivity enabling the participant to take optimized background therapy (OBT) consisting of at least a ritonavirbased protease inhibitor. More information on this criterion can be found in the study protocol. Presence of any currently active AIDS defining illness or history of malignancy History of a seizure disorder that requires current antiseizure medication for control or at risk for seizures. Those with a history of febrile seizures alone are not excluded. Certain abnormal laboratory values. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.
