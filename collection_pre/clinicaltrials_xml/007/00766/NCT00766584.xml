	<brief_summary>The regulatory effects of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) concern almost all organs which permanently feed information back to this global biological vigilance system controlling allostasis. Heart rate fluctuations are highly dependent on ANS control, making the heart one of the best indicators of ANS activity. Low ANS activity level is associated with severe cardiac and cerebral events, as well as to death from any cause in the general population. It is even associated with sleep apnea/hypopnea.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main goal of this SYNAPSE study is to evaluate, on a selected prospective cohort of subjects aged 67 years upon study entry, the incidence of sleep apnea/hypopnea and the prognostic values of ANS activity levels measured at preset times and of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.</detailed_description>
