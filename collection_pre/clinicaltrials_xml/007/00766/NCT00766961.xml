	<brief_title>TAE and Surgery in Patients With Peptic Ulcer Bleeding Uncontrolled by Endoscopic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to examine the hypothesis that trans-catheter arterial embolization (TAE) is safer than and probably as effective as surgery in the control of bleeding from ulcers after failed endoscopic therapy. Patients with major arterial bleeding that cannot be stopped by endoscopic therapy will be randomly assigned to receive immediate TAE or surgery. Primary outcome will be death within 30 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes include recurrent bleeding after assigned treatment, need for additional intervention either in the form of interventional radiology or surgery, and post procedural morbidities.</detailed_description>
