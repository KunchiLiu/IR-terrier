	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A step-by-step procedure may help health care practitioners diagnose and treat cancer patients with bowel injury symptoms caused by radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the care of cancer patients with bowel injury caused by radiation therapy to the pelvis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Care of Cancer Patients With Bowel Injury Caused by Radiation Therapy to the Pelvis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To undertake a systematic review of the published effectiveness of investigations and treatments for patients with radiation-induced bowel injury after pelvic radiotherapy for cancer. - To develop a diagnostic and treatment algorithm (based on evidence [where available] or on expert opinion [where there is no evidence]) for these patients. - To examine each test in the algorithm for its usefulness in establishing precise diagnoses for these patients within the context of a randomized clinical trial. - To examine whether use of the treatment algorithm in delivering treatment specifically targeted for each diagnosis improves symptoms and quality of life of these patients. - To investigate whether the same level of care can be delivered to these patients by a nurse practitioner or by a specialist consultant gastroenterologist following the same algorithm. - To identify other symptoms and healthcare needs experienced by these patients after pelvic radiotherapy and whether there are any other unmet needs in addition to their bowel injury. - To determine the cost-effectiveness of the investigations and treatments developed for these patients. OUTLINE: This is a two-part, multicenter study. - Part 1: Researchers develop a diagnostic and treatment algorithm to guide health care practitioners in the management of patients with radiation-induced bowel injury. The algorithm, which is based on a systematic literature review or expert opinion, uses a series of simple tests to establish specific diagnoses and to target treatment for managing patient symptoms. - Part 2: Patients are stratified according to tumor site (urological vs gynecological vs gastrointestinal) and degree of bowel dysfunction as measured by IBDQ-B score &gt; 10 points above normal [&lt; 60 vs 60-70]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms. - Arm I (usual care): Patients receive an advice booklet on self-management of bowel symptoms. Patients whose symptoms continue 6 months after study enrollment may cross over to arm II. - Arm II: Patients undergo diagnostic and treatment algorithm-led management of bowel symptoms by a gastroenterologist. - Arm III: Patients undergo diagnostic and treatment algorithm-led management of bowel symptoms by a nurse practitioner. Patients complete questionnaires about bowel symptoms and other pelvic symptoms, quality of life, and anxiety and depression at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. Patients also complete questionnaires about cost effectiveness of the diagnostic and treatment algorithm or usual care.</detailed_description>
