	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to establish efficacy and safety of the GORE VIABAHN速 Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface when used to revise arteriovenous (AV) prosthetic grafts at the venous anastomosis in the maintenance or re-establishment of vascular access for hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GORE VIABAHN Endoprosthesis Versus Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) to Revise AV Grafts in Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary effectiveness hypothesis is to demonstrate that the GORE VIABAHN速 Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface will extend the period of target lesion primary patency as compared to PTA. The primary safety hypothesis is to demonstrate that the proportion of subjects remaining free from major device, procedure, and treatment site-related adverse events through 30 days post-procedure in the GORE速 VIABAHN速 Device group is not inferior to that of the PTA group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hemodialysis patient with a dysfunctional or thrombosed forearm or upper arm prosthetic vascular access graft. The target lesion starts less than or equal to 30 mm from the venous anastomosis. The target lesion has &gt; 50% stenosis as measured per protocol. The patient has a maximum of one secondary stenosis. The age of the hemodialysis access graft is less than or equal to 30 days old from the date of the study procedure. The patient has undergone an intervention (surgical or percutaneous) of the vascular access circuit less than or equal to 30 days from the date of the study procedure. The secondary lesion is an occlusion.</criteria>
