	<brief_summary>The investigators test the additional clinical value of the physiological assessment of endothelial function to the morphological assessment of coronary complexity and classical risk score in predicting cardiovascular events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Value of Endothelial Dysfunction and Coronary Complexity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators enroll consecutive, stable high risk patients for cardiovascular events. The reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index (RHI) was measured before coronary angiography and coronary lesions were assessed angiographically by SYNTAX Scoring system. The investigators all subjects and examined the occurrence of cardiovascular events (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, unstable angina pectoris, hospitalization for HF, coronary revascularization, or non-fatal aortic and peripheral vascular disease).</detailed_description>
