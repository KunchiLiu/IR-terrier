	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lenalidomide (Revlimid (R)) in subjects with mantle cell lymphoma who have relapsed, progressed or are refractory to bortezomib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Lenalidomide in Patients With Mantle Cell NHL Who Have Relapsed or Progressed After Treatment With Bortezomib or Are Refractory to Bortezomib. The "EMERGE" Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follow up phase will continue until either 100% of the patients have died, are lost to follow up or have withdrawn consent or a maximum of 4 years from the last patient enrolled, whichever comes first. All other efficacy and safety endpoints will be updated at this time. In the unlikely event that the study will be closed and patients are still responding to treatment at this time, Celgene will discuss with the treating physicians options to provide further treatment to the patient after study closure in line with local regulation. Follow up for second primary malignancies and OS will continue until 100% of the patients have died, are lost to follow up, have withdrawn consent, or a maximum of 5 years from the last patient enrolled, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>
