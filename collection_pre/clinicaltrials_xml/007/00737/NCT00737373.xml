	<brief_summary>In this trial, FLOT will be evaluated as therapy option for elderly patients (&gt;65 years) with advanced gastric cancer in comparison to the well established FLO scheme. The hypothesis is that FLOT is more effective than FLO in elderly patients with acceptable side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and 5-Fluorouracil With or Without Docetaxel in Elderly Patients (&gt;65 y) With Stomach and Esophagus Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced, potentially operable or metastatic gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction without prior therapy in the palliative setting are treated with: - Arm A: FLO - Arm B: FLOT max. 12 cycles Evaluation of quality of life by standard forms at baseline and then every 2 months until progress of disease. Pharmacogenetic analyses will be done to evaluate a risk profile for platin-based therapies. 140 patients will be treated (70 per arm) primary endpoint: - Response Rate secondary endpoints: - Prospective Validation of a pharmacogenetic risk profile for patients with advanced GC under first-line therapy with platin/docetaxel - Evaluation of quality of life - safety and tolerability - progression free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS)</detailed_description>
