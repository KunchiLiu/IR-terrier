	<brief_summary>This research study will evaluate functions of memory, thinking, behavior, and daily life activities and how these relate to the measurement of certain chemicals (acetylcholine and dopamine) in the brain using an imaging procedure called positron emission tomography (PET). You may know that in Alzheimer's dementia (dementia is a disease where persons become forgetful and confused), a reduction in the amount of acetylcholine, a "neurotransmitter" substance (a chemical messenger that nerve cells need to communicate with each other), may be responsible for some of the memory and behavioral changes. At the present time, the investigators have no clear information on the levels of acetylcholine in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease who also have memory or behavioral changes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PDD: Patients who meet the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Research Center (UKPDSBRC) clinical diagnostic criteria for PD with dementia (MMSE 1825; n=28; age 5085 years; M/F) are eligible for the study. Hoehn and Yahr stages IIII. PD. Patients with who meet the UKPDSBRC criteria for PD with a MMSE of &gt;25 (n=28; age 5085 years; M/F). Hoehn and Yahr stages IIII. Normal control subjects (n=16) (age 5085 years; M/F). No current or past history of neurologic or psychiatric illness. Any subjects on cholinergic, anticholinergic drugs will be excluded from the study. Current or past history of neurologic or psychiatric illness.</criteria>
