	<brief_title>Properties and Clinical Performance of Zirconia-based Dental Ceramics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zirconia has been used in dentistry since 2000 for constructing fixed partial denture. Its advantages are high fracture resistance, excellent biocompatibility, moderate opacity, etc. Because the increase in demand for more esthetic restoration, zirconia becomes more popular for use as a core material for all-ceramic systems. Its properties have been investigated extensively in many in vitro studies. However, clinical performance of zirconia-based restorations would require a period of time before the results can be assessed. Currently, there are not much results regarding clinical performance of zirconia-based prosthesis and more information are required for future research.</detailed_description>
