	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - To study the components of the gastroesophageal junction high-pressure zone individually and as a group, by pharmacologically eliminating or accentuating the pressure profile generated by the smooth muscle components. - To differentiate the gastric sling fibers from the clasp fibers based on the spatial orientation of these muscle groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to examine and evaluate a part of the digestive system (gastrointestinal tract). The specific part the study team will look at is called the "lower esophageal sphincter complex." This complex is located where the esophagus (food pipe) meets the top of the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter complex involves a group of muscles, and the study team hopes to better understand how they work. The study team hopes that, by studying the lower esophageal sphincter complex, it may be possible to discover how it functions and what causes it to fail. When a complex fails, this can lead to reflux and heartburn. So learning more about the lower esophageal complex may help doctors' better treat future patients with reflux problems. We plan to study these functions in normal control subjects, in patients with GERD (heartburn symptoms), and in patients with Barrett's esophagus (a change in the lining of the esophagus due to chronic reflux). The doctor performing the study procedure has previous experience with and is skilled in performing these procedures.</detailed_description>
