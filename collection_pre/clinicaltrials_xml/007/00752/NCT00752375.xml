	<brief_summary>Children who present with pyelonephritis undergo many investigations, and long term care to prevent renal damage. The focus is primarily on preventing renal failure however along the way and particularly with children, other issues arise which impact their lives, as well as their family's lives. Parents are concerned about subjecting their children to invasive procedures and long term antibiotic use, particularly if they are not sure of the benefit. This study seeks to provide information on the impact of investigation and long term antibiotic treatment in reference to long term health and quality of life in children who present with febrile urinary tract infections in the absence of anatomic abnormalities.</brief_summary>
