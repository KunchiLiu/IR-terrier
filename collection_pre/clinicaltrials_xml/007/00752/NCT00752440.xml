	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training in Patients With Autonomic Neuropathic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diabetic autonomic neuropathy (NAD) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), both of the type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) as of the type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The results of this study, would help to reveal the degree of commitment generated by NAD in respiratory muscle strength, can also enable the development of a new therapeutic approach, such non-pharmacological (respiratory muscle training), with a view to improve the respiratory muscle strength and alleviate the autonomic dysfunction in these patients.</detailed_description>
