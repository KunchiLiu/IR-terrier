	<brief_summary>Objectives: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To compare the in-stent late loss at 9 months of paclitaxel- and sirolimus- eluting stents with the late loss of bare metal control stents. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Safety: To compare the occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) at 30 days, 9 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years among the paclitaxel, sirolimus and control study arms. To compare the occurrence de Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) within 5 years among the paclitaxel, sirolimus and control study arms. To compare the occurrence of in-stent thrombosis within 5 years among the paclitaxel, sirolimus and control study arms. Efficacy: To compare the rate of angiographic success among the study groups To compare the rate of procedural success among the study groups To compare the incidence of clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 9 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years among the paclitaxel, sirolimus and control study arms. To compare the incidence of clinically driven target vessel revascularization at 9 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years among the paclitaxel, sirolimus and control study arms. To compare the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year cost-effectiveness profile of the paclitaxel, sirolimus and control study arms. To compare the 9-month in-stent late loss of paclitaxel-eluting stents to the in-stent late loss of sirolimus-eluting stents To compare the 9-month in-segment late loss among the study groups To compare the 9-month in-stent and in-segment binary restenosis rate among the study groups To compare the IVUS percent neointimal obstruction among the study groups Study Design: In the present RANDOMIZED study, the paclitaxel-eluting stent Infinnium® and the sirolimus-eluting stent Supralimus® will be compared to a metallic stent with the same structure (Milennium Matrix®) but without drug elution for the treatment of de novo lesions in native coronaries. The study will be a multicenter clinical trial and will include patients for the treatment with one of the three study stents. In total, 275 patients will be enrolled, randomly allocated for the Infinnium®, Supralimus®, or Milennium Matrix® stents in a 2:2:1 proportion. Patients will be followed-up for 12 months after the index procedure. All patients will undergo a follow-up angiography at 9 months. A subgroup of 55 patients will be evaluated at 9 months with IVUS examination. Treatment: Patients will be treated, according to the randomization groups, with Infinnium®, Supralimus®, or Milennium Matrix® stents of 19 mm, 23 mm, or 29 mm and nominal diameters of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm.</brief_summary>
