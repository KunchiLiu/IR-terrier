	<brief_title>Stereotactic Aspiration and Thrombolysis of Intracerebral Hemorrhage: a Prospective Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stereotactic computed tomographic-guided aspiration and drainage is one of the best choices in the treatment of a large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral hematoma. It uses hardware access technology, in a relatively short time to enter the hematoma center, with suction liquefaction technology. It has the advantage of a higher clearance rate of the hematoma, simple convenience, small trauma and low-cost. We carry on the suitable improvement in this technology's foundation in view of its deficiency, the introduction of the concept of the individual, will further reduce the rate of bleeding and mortality, improve survival, such as long-term quality of life. We will adopt scales such as the rate of rebleeding, mortality, complication,NIHSS, MRS, BI, GOS scale to analysis and evaluating efficacy and safety of this technology and conservative treatment in the treatment of HICH.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>CT diagnosis of spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, the amount of bleeding more than 50 ml, and had neurological signs All income groups the incidence of medical records to be random, the time should be &lt; 69 hours to ensure that within 72 hours of the onset of the operation To be random, former GCS score &gt; = 5 points Systolic blood pressure &lt;= 200 mmHg, mean arterial pressure &lt;= 150 mmHg (if higher than this value, but as corresponding to this standard can be dealt with the group, and only reached the standard before they can ask for random) Fasting plasma glucose &lt;= 11.1 mmol / L (if higher than this value, but as corresponding to this standard can be dealt with the group, and only reached the standard before they can ask for random) Patients aged 18 to 80yearold. Based on China's relevant laws, the patient himself or family members (only in patients with the loss of his ability to judge the acts of circumstances) agreed to participate in this study, a good compliance, to fully comply with random, in accordance with the decision by the treatment, patients himself Or family members must sign informed consent moreover. Patients themselves or their families (only in patients with the loss of his ability to judge the acts of circumstances) have willingness and ability to follow the research program, data collection and preservation of history and followup process of informed consent. Patients clotting mechanisms are obstacles or having the experience of the use of anticoagulant drug (PT&gt; 15s, APTT&gt; 40s, INR&gt; 1.4, platelet count &lt;100 Ã— 10 9 / L). Cerebral hernia formed more than two hours The merger of other serious system failure (heart, liver and kidney, etc.) or a variety of endstage disease with cerebral hematoma (such as renal failure late cerebral hemorrhage, blood disease with cerebral hemorrhage) Prior to the onset of a variety of reasons for the defect or neurological movement disorder A clear cause of cerebral hemorrhage such as intracranial aneurysm, or dynamic such as a venous malformation Intracranial or serious systemic infection Marked cognitive impairment or mental abnormality Other such as pregnancy, cancer</criteria>
