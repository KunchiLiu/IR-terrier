	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Determine the Effect of Mifepristone on the Pharmacokinetics of Fluvastatin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers lasting up to a total of 9 weeks: up to 4 weeks screening, approximately 2 weeks for dosing (including a 1-week washout between periods), and approximately 3 weeks of a drug-free interval until termination. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of single and multiple oral doses of CORLUX on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of fluvastatin administered to healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
