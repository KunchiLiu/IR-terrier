	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to assess whether a locally-administered rhBMP-2/CPM injection can rapidly increase bone mass in subjects at high risk for osteoporotic fractures of the hip. All subjects will receive standard treatment for low bone mass, consisting of bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D (all taken by mouth). Subjects that are randomly selected to receive treatment with rhBMP-2 will receive an injection directly into the hip. The injection is given in a surgery room using a light anesthesia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Communitydwelling, ambulatory (with or without assistive device), postmenopausal females, age greater than 65 years. BMD Tscore (total hip or femoral neck) of 2.5 or less in at least 1 hip. Subjects with BMD Tscores of 2.0 or less may be enrolled if at least one of the following risk factors is also present: Age greater than 75 years Family (maternal) history of fragility fracture Previous fragility fracture (self) after age 45 Subjects may either be treatment na√Øve or on a previouslyestablished regimen ( greater than 1year, but less than 5 years duration) of bisphosphonate therapy. Subjects must be willing to comply with 1of the 3 protocoldesignated oral bisphosphonates (risedronate, alendronate, or ibandronate sodium) with risedronate considered as firstline therapy. Metabolic bone disorder or disease affecting bone and mineral metabolism (eg, Paget's disease, vitamin D deficiency [ less than 20 ng/mL], hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia). Coagulopathy and/or history of venous thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, retinal vein thrombosis) within the past 12 months. Inflammatory arthritis including rheumatoid, psoriatic, or crystalinduced (gouty) arthritis, or those associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), spondyloarthropathy, Reiters syndrome, or Crohns disease.</criteria>
