	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled Study of Saracatinib (AZD0530) in Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma Localized to the Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Further details provided by SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration): After complete surgical removal of their cancer, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Saracatinib or placebo (a sugar pill) throughout the study. Patients will take Saracatinib (or placebo) once daily by mouth for a total of 364 days. The duration of treatment is divided into 13 cycles, 28 days each cycle with no breaks in between. Patients will be seen for interim medical history, physical exam and laboratory studies prior to each cycle. To monitor for recurrence of tumor, patients will undergo thoracic CT scans at 3-4 weeks, 6-8 weeks, at 3 months, at 6 months, at 9 months, at 12 months, then every 6 months up to 2 years, and then every year up to 5 years after starting treatment. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be taken at 3 months, and a bone scan will be performed at 12 months. Patients who recur in the lung while on-study and who are thought to be amenable to complete surgical resection will be able to find out if they were receiving placebo or saracatinib. Those patients who were receiving placebo may then have the option of undergoing surgical resection. If fully resected of all recurrent disease,they will be given the option of receiving oral therapy with saracatinib. Saracatinib will be administered as a once daily, oral dose of 175 mg, for a 28-day cycle, with no breaks between cycles. The duration of treatment with saracatinib will be thirteen 28-day cycles (364 days total). If complete resection of all lung nodules is not achieved, the patient will be removed from the study. Patients who recur in locations other than the lung while on-study will be taken off study at that time. Blood and tumor samples for research purposes will be collected at the time the tumor is removed. After completing all 13 cycles, patients will be followed for approximately every 3 months until 2 years from starting treatment, then approximately every 6 months until 4 years from starting treatment, and once at year 5.</detailed_description>

Patient had histological confirmed diagnosis of osteosarcoma of the recurrent sample. Patient had recurrence of osteosarcoma in the lung following standard therapy including: adriamycin, cisplatin, ifosfamide and methotrexate. Patient is ≥ 15 and &lt; 75 years of age. Weight ≥ 34 kg. ECOG performance score of 02. Adequate bone marrow function. Adequate renal function. Adequate hepatic function. Adequate cardiac function. Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) ≤ 7 days prior to enrollment, and willingness to use an acceptable method of contraception during participation in the study and for 3 months after the last dose. Randomization must occur ≤ 6 weeks after complete surgical resection. Patient or legal guardian has signed informed consent. Presence of metastatic disease in other locations in addition to the lung. Disruption of the lung pleura by tumor. Paget's disease. Patient currently using, or has previously used CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors within 2 to 14 days prior to the initiation of oral therapy. Known hypersensitivity to other Src/Abl nonreceptor kinase inhibitors. Evidence of interstitial lung disease. Any concurrent condition which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol. Myocardial infarction within one year prior to study entry. Bleeding diathesis, resulting in symptomatic bleeding. Patient is pregnant or nursing/breastfeeding. Patient received chemotherapy, biological or investigational agent ≤ 28 days prior to enrollment. Patient experiencing unresolved toxicity ≥ CTCAE grade 2 (except alopecia) from previous agents.</criteria>
