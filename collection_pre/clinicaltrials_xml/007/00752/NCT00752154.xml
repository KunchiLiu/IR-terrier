	<brief_summary>Curcuma longa or turmeric is a tropical plant native to south and southeast tropical Asia. Perhaps the most active component in turmeric is curcumin which may make up 2-5% of the total spice in turmeric. The study drug being tested in this study is curcumin. This study is called a cross-over study because all subjects will receive the study drug for a certain amount of time and then switch to placebo (an inactive substance) for a certain time or vice versa. The subject's participation may last up to 8 months. The subject will be randomized (by chance; like flipping a coin) to receive either the study drug, curcumin, or placebo for 4 months. After 4 months, if the subject was taking curcumin they will stop taking it and begin to take placebo and if the subject was taking placebo they will stop taking it and begin taking curcumin for the remaining 4 months. By completion of the study, all 40 subjects will have taken curcumin and placebo for 4 months each. Curcumin/placebo will be provided in capsule form and the subject will take it by mouth. The dose dose will be increased every week for up to a total of 4 grams per day. Subjects will have blood tests, complete questionnaires, and be seen by the study doctor.</brief_summary>
