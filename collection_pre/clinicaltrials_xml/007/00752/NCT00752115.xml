	<brief_summary>A comparison of combination chemotherapy of sildenafil plus carboplatin and weekly taxol with carboplatin and weekly taxol in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study hypothesis is that sildenafil may improve the distribution and efficacy of cytotoxic anticancer agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Sildenafil Plus Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sildenafil is one of selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. It is used to block the degradative action of phosphodiesterase type 5 on cyclic GMP in the smooth muscle cells lining the blood vessels, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels and increases blood flow. Because phosphodiesterase type 5 is also present in the arterial wall smooth muscle within the lungs, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors is also used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.</detailed_description>
