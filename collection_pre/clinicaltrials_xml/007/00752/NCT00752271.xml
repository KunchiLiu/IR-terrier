	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between muscle activation and heart rate on joint generalized inflammation and arthritis development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMS Study: Inflammatory and Biomechanical Contributors to Arthritis Development Following Arthroscopic Meniscectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test the hypothesis that knee trauma (as exemplified by the arthroscopy procedure) causes inflammation that alters muscle activation patterns locally and also disrupts the balance between parasympathetic-sympathetic reflexes. It is hypothesized that these factors contribute to development and progression of knee osteoarthritis.</detailed_description>
