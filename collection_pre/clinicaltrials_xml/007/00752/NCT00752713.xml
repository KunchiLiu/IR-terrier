	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate whether myocardial deformation imaging performed by SENC allows for quantification of regional left ventricular function and is related to transmurality states of infarcted tissue in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CMR was performed in 38 consecutive patients with AMI 3Â±1 days after successful reperfusion using a clinical 1.5 Tesla MR-scanner. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. SENC is a technique that directly measures peak circumferential strain from long-axis views and peak longitudinal strain from short axis views. Measurements were obtained for each segment in a modified 17 segment model. Wall motion and infarcted tissue were evaluated semi-quantitatively from SSFP cine sequences and contrast-enhanced-MR-images and were then related to myocardial strain. Comparison of peak circumferential strain assessed by SENC and MR-tagging was performed.</detailed_description>
