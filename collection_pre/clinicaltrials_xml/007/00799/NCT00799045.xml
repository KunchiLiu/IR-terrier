	<brief_title>Clopidogrel For the Prevention of New Onset Migraine Headache Following Transcatheter Closure of Atrial Septal Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to evaluate the incidence and severity of new-onset migraine headache episodes following transcatheter ASD closure in patients treated with aspirin alone compared to those on aspirin + clopidogrel therapy as antithrombotic treatment after the procedure. This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, multicenter study, including patients with no previous history of migraine attacks who have been diagnosed with an ASD and for whom transcatheter ASD closure has been clinically indicated. Patients will be randomized either to aspirin (80 mg/day) or aspirin (80 mg/day) + clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 3 months following ASD closure. The occurrence and severity of migraine headaches will be evaluated by a neurologist using a structured headache questionnaire at 1 month and 3 months following ASD closure. An additional 6 month and 1 year follow-up evaluation will be exploratory according to local feasibility.</detailed_description>
