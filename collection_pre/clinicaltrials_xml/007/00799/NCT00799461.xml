	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A personalized Internet-based program may help improve fatigue, depression, and quality of life in long-term survivors of stem cell transplant. It is not yet known whether an Internet-based program is more effective with or without telephone-based problem-solving training. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well an Internet-based program works with or without telephone-based problem-solving training in helping long-term survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplant cope with late complications</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet-Based Program With or Without Telephone-Based Problem-Solving Training in Helping Long-Term Survivors of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Cope With Late Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the efficacy of a randomized controlled trial to improve long term fatigue/physical dysfunction, depression/distress and health surveillance behaviors in adult 3 to 25-year hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors using an internet only or internet and phone-based problem-solving and activation training compared with survivors randomized to a delayed internet access control. II. To determine the reach, utilization, and implementation costs of a web-based, individually tailored intervention, disseminated through widely used patient information websites, targeting a national cohort of adult 2-25 year HSCT survivors. (Phase III/IV) III. To determine, in a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of a nationally disseminated, internet-based, individually tailored intervention to improve long-term fatigue, distress and health promotion behaviors in HSCT survivors, compared with survivors randomized to a delayed internet access control. (Phase III/IV) OUTLINE: Patients with elevated fatigue, depression, and/or distress at baseline are randomized to 1 of 3 arms (ARMS I, II, or III). Patients without elevated fatigue, depression or distress at baseline are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (ARMS II or III). ARM I (FULL WEBSITE ACCESS WITH PROBLEM-SOLVING TRAINING [PST]; FIRST STUDY ONLY; CLOSED TO ACCRUAL): Patients receive full access to INSPIRE website for 6 months, which offers an individually tailored greeting home page with links to information on each of the target areas identified as being elevated on baseline assessment and how to manage the complications; a bulletin board with input from other survivors that is solicited, edited, and posted weekly; resource pages; and an opportunity to send secure messages with questions or comments. Patients also undergo 4-8 phone-based PST sessions with a behavioral health specialist. ARM II (FULL WEBSITE ACCESS WITHOUT PST): Patients receive full access to INSPIRE website for 6 months as in ARM I. ARM III (DELAYED WEBSITE ACCESS): Patients do not have access to INSPIRE website for 6 months. After 6 months, patients receive full access to INSPIRE website for 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient between 325 years since last transplant Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient &gt; = 2 years since last transplant (second, phase III/IV study only) Any type of transplant (autologous, allogeneic, myeloablative, nonmyeloablative, marrow or peripheral blood stem cells) Able to communicate in English as indicated by ability to communicate adequately with study staff to participate in the clinical phone calls and to complete patientreported outcomes (PRO) assessments in English Has internet and email access (indicated by logon to site for consent and assessment) Does not complete the baseline assessment through the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) Does not complete required assessments in the background and medical history forms required to determine whether meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, stratification, sample description, or primary outcomes (includes age, gender, ethnicity, race, transplant site, and medical information about transplant if not FHCRC or SCCA patient, education, work, height and weight, current medications Survivors who score 3.0 or above on the SCL depression measure (indicating severe depression) or who report moderate to severe suicidal ideation will be ineligible for randomization; these survivors will, however, have full access to the website if they have completed the required baseline assessment; they will be asked to also complete followup assessments Survivors who report to us that they have been in active treatment for relapse of their original disease, or for a second cancer, in the past 2 years will be ineligible for randomization, unless the second cancer was treated only with surgical removal (e.g., basal, squamous or localized melanoma skin cancer, or breast ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) These survivors will, however, have full access to the website if they have completed the required baseline assessment; they will be asked to also complete followup assessments</criteria>
