	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate the effects of a motivational and problem-solving smoking cessation (MAPS) and a motivational and problem solving approach on at-risk alcohol use and smoking cessation (MAPS+) among Puerto Rican at-risk drinkers/smokers who call the Puerto Rico Quitline (PRQ). - To assess effects of MAPS and MAPS+ on treatment mechanisms and the role of those mechanisms in mediating these effects on at-risk drinking and smoking cessation. - To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MAPS and MAPS+ in the reduction of at-risk drinking and smoking cessation. OUTLINE: Minimization randomization is applied using the following variables: age, gender, cigarettes/day, number of drinks/day, and depression (score on the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I (MAPS): Patients receive culturally sensitive self-help materials tailored for alcohol and tobacco users and 7 telephone counseling calls. The MAPS approach includes motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral/problem-solving that focus on smoking cessation. - Arm II (MAPS+): Patients receive culturally sensitive self-help materials tailored for alcohol and tobacco users and 7 telephone counseling calls. The MAPS+ approach includes motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral/problems solving that focus on smoking cessation and the reduction of at-risk alcohol use. In both arms, patients receive counseling calls over 15-30 minutes the week before quit date (QD), on QD, 3-5 days after QD, 7-10 days after QD, 15-30 days after QD, 45-60 days after QD, and on day 90 after QD. Patients complete questionnaires for alcohol- and smoking-related measures, self efficacy, stress/negative affects/depression, social support, and physical activity at baseline and weeks 12, 26 and 52 after QD.</detailed_description>
