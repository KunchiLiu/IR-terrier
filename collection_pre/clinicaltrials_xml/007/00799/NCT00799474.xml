	<brief_title>Men's Beliefs About Associations Between HPV, Cancers, and HPV Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little research has examined men's understanding of what causes anal and oral cancers and whether HPV vaccination can play a potential protective role. This research focuses on men who have sex with men (MSM) who are at notably elevated risk of anal cancer, and seeks to characterize their beliefs about anal and oral cancer, knowledge about the etiological role of HPV infection in these cancers, as well as their knowledge of HPV vaccination and anal Pap smears. We will also study heterosexual men.</detailed_description>
