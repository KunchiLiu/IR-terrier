	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the ocular signs and symptoms of subjects' eyes using Xalatan® 0.005% versus Travatan Z® 0.004% based on the outcome of subject assessment and clinical assessment in patients with Ocular Hypertension or Glaucoma with mild to moderate dry eye at baseline in accordance with the Oxford Grading Scale.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or Female 18 years of age or older Only patients who satisfy all informed consent requirements may be included in the study Be likely to complete the entire course of study and comply with study drop regimen, guidelines and visits Able to understand drop instructions and instill study drops Patients must be on monotherapy for Ocular Hypertension or Glaucoma and agree to a washout period, as according to Appendix E Patient has Ocular Hypertension, chronic OpenAngle Glaucoma, chronic AngleClosure Glaucoma with patent iridotomy/iridectomy, Pseudo Exfoliate Glaucoma, or Pigmentary Glaucoma in each eye at screening visit. Patients using systemic nonglaucoma medications known to lower IOP may be included, if on stable dose &gt;30 days prior to screening visit and agree to maintain the regimen throughout the course of the study. Patients using nonprescription eye drops or prescription topical eye drops for dry eye may be included, if on stable dose 30 days prior to screening visit and agree to maintain the regimen throughout the course of the study. Patients who wear contact lenses with a maintained wearing pattern for the duration of the study Best Corrected LogMar VA of ≤0.70 =(20/100 Snellen equivalent) Hyperemia Grading ≤2 IOP ≤ 30 mmHg Shirmers 3mm 9.75mm Tear breakup time (TBUT) 4 seconds 9seconds Must meet the Biomicroscopic Criteria for both eyes as defined by the Oxford Grading Scale Generally good and stable overall health Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or defined as oneyear postmenopausal) are excluded from participation in the study if they meet any one of the following conditions:They are currently pregnant,They have a positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening Visit,They intend to become pregnant during the study period,They are breastfeeding,or They are not using highly effective birth control measures: Hormonaloral, implanted, transdermal or injected contraceptives; Mechanicalspermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or diaphragm or IUD Note: All females of childbearing potential must consent to a urine pregnancy test at Screening. Females of childbearing potential are to be instructed to inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study. Should this occur, the Investigator shall immediately contact the Sponsor. For nonsexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the patient becomes sexually active during the study, she must agree to use adequate birth control methods as defined above for the remainder of the study. Patients who are currently on an investigational agent or discontinued within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit Uncontrolled systemic disease Patients who have a known medical history of allergy or sensitivity to prostaglandin drugs (topical and/or systemic) Patient with any history of refractive surgery History of ocular trauma within the past six months in either eye History of ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past three months in either eye History of clinically relevant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment in either eye based on the assessment of the Investigator History of any severe ocular pathology according to the Oxford Grading Scale greater than Grade 4 dry eye) in either eye Intraocular surgery within the past six months as determined by patient history and/or examination in either eye. Ocular laser surgery or Punctal Cautery within the past three months as determined by patient history and/or examination in either eye Punctal Plugs insertion ≤ 7 days prior to (Visit 1) Screening Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye. Contraindication to pupil dilation or patients with cycloplegia Patients with bestcorrected visual acuity score worse than 0.70 LogMar (20/100) score in either eye Patients with ≤30 days stable dosing regimen before the Screening Visit of any medications or substances administered by any route and used on a chronic basis History of StevensJohnson Syndrome or Ocular Pemphigoid History of liver disease Severe clinical vitamin deficiencies or history of vitamin overdose Highly variable selfadministration of overthecounter vitamin/herbal products Any steroid use within the past 30 days Corneal pathology, which could, and of itself, cause an ocular surface disorder Visual Field loss which in the opinion of the Investigator is functionally significant or evidence of progress visual field loss within the last year prior to the (Visit 2) Baseline/Randomization Patient has a condition or is in a situation which, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at a significant risk, may confound study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study.</criteria>
