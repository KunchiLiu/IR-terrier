	<criteria>Key Inclusion criteria 1. Written informed consent before any study related procedure 2. Children, male or female, between 5 and 17 years of age at Visit 1 of the study 3. Confirmed diagnosis of a chronic inflammatory condition including rheumatic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) nonmalignant conditions requiring treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (including but not limited to rheumatic conditions, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Nephrotic syndrome), requiring treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (i.v. or oral) within the 12 months preceding enrollment in the study (any duration) 4. LSBMD Zscore of 0.5 or worse confirmed by the central imaging vendor 5. Evidence of at least 1 vertebral compression fracture (at least Genant Grade 1 vertebral compression or radiographic signs of vertebral compression) confirmed by central reading OR At least one lower OR 2 upper extremity longbone, lowtrauma, fracture which occurred sometime within the 2 years or preceding enrollment in the study, confirmed by central reading or radiological report. (Low trauma fracture is defined as falling from standing height or less). Key Exclusion criteria 1. History of primary bone disease (osteogenesis imperfecta, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, rickets/osteomalacia). 2. Prior use of bisphosphonates or sodium fluoride (doses for osteoporosis not for dental hygiene). 3. Any medical condition that might interfere with the evaluation of LSBMD, such as severe scoliosis or spinal fusion. 4. Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia: any value (agematched) below the normal range at screening 5. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25hydroxy vitamin D concentrations of &lt; 20 ng/mL or &lt; 50 nmol/L) at screening 6. Renal impairment defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening based on the Schwartz formula; a serum creatinine increase between Visit 1 and Visit 2 greater than 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 Î¼mol/L) 7. Female patients of child bearing potential are eligible only if they are not pregnant/nonlactating. Females of child bearing potential must be practicing a medically acceptable form of birth control for greater than 2 months prior to screening visit and consent to pregnancy tests during the study.</criteria>
