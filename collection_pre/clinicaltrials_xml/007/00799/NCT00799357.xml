	<brief_summary>A variety of pre-intubation clinical screening tests have been advocated to predict difficult laryngoscopy, but their usefulness is limited in emergency department, intensive care unit, pre-hospital and combat settings. Patients in these settings are often confused, lethargic, obtunded, uncooperative and common screening tests for difficult laryngoscopy cannot be applied in a large number of emergency intubations. In the recent past, there has been growing interest in upper airway ultrasound. The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of bedside ultrasound to predict difficult airway in patients requiring emergency intubation.</brief_summary>
