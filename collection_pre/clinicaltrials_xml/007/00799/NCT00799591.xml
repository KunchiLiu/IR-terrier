	<detailed_description>Healthcare visit. Extension Rationale: In order to perform the necessary corrective actions required and to secure database consistency, we request an extension for posting of Basic Results due 26-May-2011 for protocol 3074A1-4448 (B1811030), NCT00799591. Our proposed submission date is 14-Sept-2011. Pfizer acquired Wyeth on October 16, 2009. With regard to this study, our reconciliation of data identified some discrepancies in data listed in the Project database (managed by the CRO) and the Safety Database (managed by Pfizer). We are taking corrective action which involves: sending queries to investigators, collecting corrective signed forms, and implementing changes within the database. We are requesting this extension to complete that work so that the data can be treated as final and the CSR can be completed.</detailed_description>
