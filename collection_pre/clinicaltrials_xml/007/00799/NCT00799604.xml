	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of a bolus dosing regimen of clevidipine, a vascular-selective L-type calcium channel antagonist, for the management of blood pressure in cardiac surgery patients, as well as to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of clevidipine after bolus administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clevidipine Bolus Administration in the Treatment of Hypertensive Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery (SPRINT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants were screened up to 14 days prior to their elective cardiac surgery. For the purpose of this study, hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg immediately prior to initiation of study drug. On the day of surgery, an IV bolus dose of clevidipine (Bolus 1 - pre-anesthesia) was administered to each eligible study participant during Treatment Period 1 to decrease BP before induction of general anesthesia. The dose (either 125 μg, 250 μg or 500 μg) given was based on the assigned cohort for each participant, listed in the 'Arms' section below. At the discretion of the investigator, a second IV bolus dose of clevidipine (Bolus 2 - with anesthesia) could have been administered during Treatment Period 2 at either 125 μg, 250 μg or 500 μg, based upon the earlier observed response to Bolus 1. This dose was administered after the induction of anesthesia, to decrease BP prior to cannulation of the ascending aorta for initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Assessment of safety was performed throughout Treatment Periods 1 and 2 with Adverse Events (AEs) followed 6 hours post final bolus dose and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) followed 24 hours post final bolus dose.</detailed_description>
