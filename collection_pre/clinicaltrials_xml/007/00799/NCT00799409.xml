	<brief_title>Lab School Day Study for CONCERTA of Older Children With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) is safe and effective in improving academic performance and behavior in children with ADHD, when compared to placebo as demonstrated using specified study measures. This is a double-blind (neither participant nor investigator knows the name of the assigned study drug), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the academic, behavioral, and cognitive effects of CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) on older children with ADHD. This means that all eligible children will receive treatment with methylphenidate HCl throughout the study (the titration and assessment periods) and inactive pill (placebo) on one of the two laboratory classroom days. On the other laboratory classroom day they will receive their regular dose of methylphenidate HCl. The primary efficacy variable in this study is the Permanent Product Math Test (PERMP) attempted score. Secondary Measures include: SKAMP (Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham), tests of inattention, reading fluency and comprehension, and memory. Assessments will be completed during each of the laboratory assessment days (12.5 hours). Participants will be assessed for adverse events throughout the study. Patients will initiate treatment with oral CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) 18 mg at baseline and continue morning dosing with increases every 3 to 7 days until an optimal dose is achieved, up to the maximum of 54 mg/day. Eligible patients will remain in the study for a maximum of 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
