	<brief_summary>Exercise has numerous health benefits. Nevertheless, when exercise duration is ~45 min or longer and intensity moderate to intense, it may induce different troubles, for example: hypoglycemia, peripheral and central fatigue, muscle damages, osteoarticular injuries, inflammation, cardiovascular dysfunctions. Nutritional loading during exercise may prevent and and/or reduce some of these troubles. In regard of recent data, we proposed a novel energy drink (NUTRAPERF®) to limit deleterious effects of long time exercise in neutral environment (outside temperature between 4 and 25°C) and to improve performance. If performance may be increased by this energy drink during long time exercise, we proposed that it consumption may also improve performance in short and sub-maximal exercise. So, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the consumption of this novel energy drink on performance during long and short time exercise. Moreover, we studied the effects of this consumption on different metabolic parameters (heart rate, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient, ventilation, glycemia, lactatemia), on central and peripheral fatigue and on cognitive parameters.</brief_summary>
