	<brief_summary>The study analyzes the consequences of weight bearing after an HTO in a population of young patient with medial osteoarthritis (immediate weight bearing versus two month weight bearing). The two options are usually used so the protocol belongs to the intermediate care evaluation category. The IKS (International Knee Society) score at one year follow up is the first outcome. The aim of the study is to highlight that the option early weight bearing (immediately in postoperative) is equal to the option delayed weight bearing.</brief_summary>
