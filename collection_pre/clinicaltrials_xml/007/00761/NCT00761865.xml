	<brief_title>Lateral Ankle Sprain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 patients with Grade II-III lateral ankle sprains requiring crutches will be invited to participate. Patients will randomly be assigned to be treated with either the Air Cast Stirrup Brace (n=50) or the High Tide Fracture Boot (n=50). All patients will be given instructions to use the fracture boot or air cell brace at all times of ambulatory activity until follow-up and to use NSAIDS as needed. At their 2 week post-sprain follow-up the following outcomes measures will be assessed: Modified Karlsson score (disease specific survey) Pain VAS Patient satisfaction with treatment VAS SMFA (general health measure) Ability to walk without crutches</detailed_description>
