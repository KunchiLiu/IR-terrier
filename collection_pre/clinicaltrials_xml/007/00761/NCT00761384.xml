One of these treatments must have contained chemotherapy and rituximab, the latter either together with chemotherapy or as maintenance. The lymphoma must require treatment, Mantle cell lymphoma, failing first line treatment,treatment required Measurable disease and the tumor burden must be acceptable according to the investigator Radiological studies must be performed and a unilateral bone marrow biopsy within 4 weeks before start of treatment Bone marrow reserve likely to give a harvest of at least 2x10 6 peripheral CD34+ stemcells or the existence of such a harvest or a corresponding central harvest Total bilirubin should not exceed 40 micromole/L A GFR as measured by Cystatin C of 50 ml/min HIV, Hepatitis B and C status known Life expectancy of at least 3 months.
