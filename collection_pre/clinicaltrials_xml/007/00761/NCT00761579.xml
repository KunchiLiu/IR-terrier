	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, prospective (study following participants forward in time), single arm, and non-comparative study of paliperidone Extended Release(ER) in participants with schizophrenia (after switching from the existing drug to paliperidone ER). The total study duration will be approximately of 48 weeks per participant. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is, 14 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (single-oral dose of paliperidone for 48 weeks, dose ranging from 3 to 12 milligram). Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
