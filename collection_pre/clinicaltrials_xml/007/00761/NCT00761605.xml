	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone extended-release (mechanism to dissolve a drug over time in order to be released slower and steadier into the blood stream) in improving or maintaining the subjective symptoms of the participants in three participants' groups (that is, by the reason to switch: lack of efficacy group, lack of tolerability group, and lack of compliance group) who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone extended-release tablets at flexible doses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 4 Study to Evaluate Efficacy of Paliperidone Extended-Release(ER) in Schizophrenic Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study following participants forward in time), single arm, and non-comparative study of paliperidone Extended-release (ER) in participants switching from the previous oral antipsychotic to flexibly dosed paliperidone ER. The total study duration will be approximately of 24 weeks per participant. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is, 14 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (24 weeks). Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by change from baseline in symptom checklist 90-R (SCL90-R) at Week 24. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
