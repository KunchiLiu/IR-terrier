	<brief_summary>The Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression Observational (CARGO) II Study is designed to provide independent evidence of the clinical performance of the non-invasive AlloMap test. Sensitive detection of cardiac allograft rejection and dysfunction is the basis for successful recipient management. The CARGO II Study will assess the correlation between the presence or absence of acute cellular rejection as determined by examination of endomyocardial biopsy specimens with results from the AlloMap Test. Of 17 participating transplant centers, 4 are in North America and 13 are in Europe.</brief_summary>
