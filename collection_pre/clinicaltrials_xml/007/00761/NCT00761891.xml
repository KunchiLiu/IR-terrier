	<brief_title>Validation of an Assay to Measure Cyclooxygenase-1 Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspirin has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in at-risk individuals, but some aspirin-treated patients fail to exhibit expected changes in bleeding time and platelet aggregation. Recent evidence has correlated aspirin "non-response" to poor cardiovascular outcomes. In order to study the mechanisms of aspirin resistance, an assay is needed to measure the catalytic activity of platelet cyclooxygenase (which should be inhibited by aspirin). A common assay in general use is the measurement of thromboxane B2 production in clotting whole blood. This measure, however, is influenced by genetic and environmental variations in the glass-activated coagulation pathway, albumin binding capacity, platelet activation pathways, arachidonic acid pools, and phospholipase activity. Our laboratory has developed a direct assay of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX-1) activity that is not influenced by these variations. This study will generate a reference range in normal volunteers taking a routine clinical dose of aspirin (81mg daily) for this assay. In addition, by using two aspirin formulations (enteric-coated and chewable), the study design additionally allows the secondary comparison of the effects of these two formulations on COX-1 inhibition.</detailed_description>
