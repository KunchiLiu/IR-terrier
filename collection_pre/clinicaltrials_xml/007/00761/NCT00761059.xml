	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal suctioning is a painful procedure that often becomes necessary in the care of preterm infants under CPAP therapy several times a day. Since the use of analgetic and sedative drugs is accompanied with multiple side effects these are usually being avoided. Glucose 20% has been shown to have an analgesic effect when administered to preterm infants previous to some painful procedures (i.e blood sampling). In this clinical trial the efficacy of orally administered Glucose 20% for relieving the procedural pain of nasopharyngeal suctioning is tested. The investigators' study has a cross-over design and is to include 40 patients.</brief_summary>
