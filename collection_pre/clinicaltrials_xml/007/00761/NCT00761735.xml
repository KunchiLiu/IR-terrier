	<brief_summary>Study P02538 Part 2 is a 5-year long term follow-up (LTFU) study in pediatric participants who were treated with at least one dose of peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) and who completed the follow-up in the P02538 Part 1 study (NCT00104052). No study drug therapy will be administered during the P02538 Part 2 study. Durability of virologic response will be assessed for participants who attained sustained virologic response (SVR) in Part I of this study by performing annual Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) testing. In addition, this study will characterize long-term safety in all participants who received PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment.</brief_summary>
