	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to find out what effects (good and bad) that a combination of treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery has on you and your pancreatic cancer. The chemotherapy drugs to be used: Gemcitabine, Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin, 5-FU and alpha-interferon. The goal is to decrease the size of the tumor, so that removal by surgery can be performed. Current treatments for this stage of pancreas cancer offer less than ideal results, with little opportunity for treatment with curative intent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: Gemcitabine/Docetaxel and Oxaliplatin Based Chemo/RT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects must have biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which is bidimensionally measurable on CT. Cancer must be considered locally advanced (not able to be treated surgically). Subjects must not have received prior treatment for pancreatic cancer. Subjects must not have received prior radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis (for any reason). Subjects cannot be receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. prednisone, methotrexate). Eligible subjects will receive initial chemotherapy regimen to include eight cycles of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel. All subjects will be re-evaluated for surgery - if tumor has shrunk enough, subject will undergo surgery, followed by additional chemotherapy of Oxaliplatin, 5FU and Alpha-interferon and radiation therapy; once subject has recovered from side effects of the chemo/radiation therapy, they will receive a final chemotherapy regimen of four cycles of Gemcitabine and docetaxel. Subjects who are not surgical candidates after eight cycles of chemotherapy will undergo an additional four cycles of Gemcitabine and docetaxel followed by reassessment for surgery. If they are a surgical candidate, they will undergo surgery followed by chemo/radiation therapy regimen. If they are not a surgical candidate, they will undergo the chemo/radiation therapy regimen. Subjects may be removed from the study treatment for the following reasons: - The investigator feels the subject is not benefitting from treatment - The subject chooses to discontinue for any reason - The subject experiences side effects which are considered to be unacceptable - The subject has an increase in the size of their tumor</detailed_description>
