	<brief_title>Signaling Mechanisms and Vascular Function in Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C impairs vascular reactivity in patients with diabetes. A major cause of death and disability in patients with diabetes mellitus is atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction is an important, if not primary, factor in atherogenesis. Nitric oxide is an important substance made and released by the endothelium. Many prior studies in animals and humans have shown that the ability of the blood vessel to dilate is impaired in diabetes. This process of vasodilation is mediated by a substance, nitric oxide, which is thought to be highly susceptible to destruction by oxidant molecules. In previous studies, we found that acute administration of the antioxidant, vitamin C, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in blood vessels of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This suggests that by scavenging oxidants, such as superoxide, vitamin C may reduce the destruction of nitric oxide and thereby preserve endothelial function. Additional mechanisms, including activation of a substance called protein kinase C, and oxidant stress from excess soluble peroxides may be present in diabetes and interact with oxidant stress to cause endothelial dysfunction in patients with diabetes. Accordingly, we would like to study both of these mechanisms to determine their contribution to endothelial dysfunction.</detailed_description>
