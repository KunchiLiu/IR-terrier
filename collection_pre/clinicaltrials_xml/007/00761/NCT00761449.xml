	<brief_title>Lenalidomide in High-risk MDS and AML With Del(5q) or Monosomy 5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide is effective in the treatment of low risk MDS with del(5q). Treatment of this subgroup of MDS patients resulted in 67% major erythroid responses and 45% complete cytogenetic responses. We therefore intend to test the efficacy of lenalidomide in a group of high-risk patients who are ineligible for conventional chemotherapy and who have a dismal prognosis. The patients must have a karyotype including del(5q) but patients with a karyotype including monosomy 5 are also eligible. We hypothesize that hight risk MDS or AML patients with other chromosomal aberrations than del(5q) can be affected by the lenalidomide effect.</detailed_description>

Subject has signed the informed consent document. Women of childbearing potential, WCBP, must agree to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or to use two methods of contraception beginning 4 weeks prior to the start of the study medication, while on study medication and 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication.
