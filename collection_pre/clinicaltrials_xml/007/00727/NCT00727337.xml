	<brief_summary>The study is designed to examine the effectiveness of a computer-based auditory training program to improve the benefits received by individuals who wear hearing aids. The study will involve 3 groups - a computer-based training group, an active listening group which will involve listening to books on CD, and a placebo group that receives no additional treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplementing Hearing Aids With Computerized Auditory Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposed study is a multi-site, single-masked (blinded), randomized controlled, parallel group clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of an at home PC-based auditory training as a supplement to standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention in veterans treated for hearing loss, with or without previous hearing-aid experience. The participants will be assigned randomly to one of three groups, with hearing-aid use stratified within the groups: (1) Group 1, HA+AT, in which the participants will receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention (HA) and complete the four-week LACE auditory training program (AT); (2) Group 2, HA, with the participants receiving only standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention (HA); and (3) Group 3, HA+DL, in which the participants will receive standard-of-care hearing-aid intervention (HA) and complete four-weeks of placebo auditory training, consisting of directed listening (DL) to books-on-tape. The participants in each group will attend four test sessions. During Session 1 the informed consent process will be completed, baseline assessments will be made to ensure that the participants meet the study inclusion criteria (page 52), testing of predictor variables (page 57-58) will be completed, and all hearing aids will be assessed for correct functionality (page 53). The participants then will be assigned randomly to a study group. Session 2 will occur four weeks after Session 1. During Session 2, baseline performance on the outcome measures will be assessed (page 54-57), as will performance on the predictor variables. Following testing, the participants in Groups 1 and 3 will receive training in the use of the AT or DL programs. Session 3 will occur at the end of the 4-week experimental training period. During Session 3 all participants will be retested on the outcome measures to assess short-term intervention outcomes. During Session 4, which will occur at seven-months post-study enrollment (i.e., six-months post training completion for Groups 1 and 3), all participants will be retested on all outcome measures to examine the long-term outcomes. In Sessions 2-4, the stability of hearing-aid function will be assessed through electroacoustic measures.</detailed_description>
