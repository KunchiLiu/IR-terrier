	<criteria>Healthy men and women aged 18 to 55 years.

History of being a nonsmoker for at least 1 year. Subjects have to be either extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with a normal complement of 1 or 2 fully active enzyme gene alleles or poor CYP2D6 metabolizers (lack of active enzyme gene alleles) via genetic testing of a blood sample. Presence or history of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease or any severe conditions of the ears, eyes or throat (such as glaucoma or increased intraocular pressure).
