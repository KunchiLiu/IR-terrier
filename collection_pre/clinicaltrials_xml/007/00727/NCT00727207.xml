	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating older patients with mantle cell lymphoma who received previous first-line or second-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus in Treating Older Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Previously Treated With First-Line or Second-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the progression-free survival of older patients with mantle cell lymphoma receiving everolimus and who were previously treated with first- or second-line chemotherapy. Secondary - Determine the toxicity and feasibility of treatment with this drug. - Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients. - Compare the duration of remission after first- vs second-line chemotherapy. - Determine the rate of objective remission. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral everolimus once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.</detailed_description>
