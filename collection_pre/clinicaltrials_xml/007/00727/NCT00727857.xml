	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Pioglitazone and Metformin Combination Therapy in Treating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pioglitazone hydrochloride (ACTOSÂ®) is a member of a class of oral antidiabetic agents known as thiazolidinediones, which act by reducing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a key feature of dysmetabolic syndrome and has been suggested to be the common pathophysiologic basis of both atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. Pioglitazone binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, an effect that is associated with altered transcription of genes capable of influencing carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Metformin hydrochloride is an oral antihyperglycemic drug not chemically or pharmacologically related to thiazolidinediones. Metformin is a biguanide, which has been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control in diabetic patients. Metformin inhibits hepatic glucose production, most likely through an inhibition of gluconeogenesis, and its use is associated with an improvement in tissue sensitivity to insulin. In accordance with published algorithms for the use of combination therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, physicians have traditionally combined metformin with other antidiabetic agents. This study will determine the effect of a fixed-dose combination of metformin with pioglitazone, compared to metformin monotherapy and pioglitazone monotherapy. Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 6.5 months.</detailed_description>
