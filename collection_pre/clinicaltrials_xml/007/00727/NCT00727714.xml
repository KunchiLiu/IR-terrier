	<brief_title>Lung Function and Inflammatory Markers in Cement Dust Exposed Workers: A Cross-shifts Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: Cement dust is suspected to be one of the main factors causing increased mortality among workers not only in the cement production industry, but also in the construction industry worldwide. Our aim is to examine possible changes in lung function, nitric oxide levels and systemic inflammatory markers in cement dust exposed workers, during one shift (6-8 hours). METHODS: All employees from Norwegian cement plants, are invited to participate. The workers will perform spirometry, single-breath determination of carbon monoxide uptake, blood samples before and after a working shift of 6-8 hours, and again after 24 hours. Information on respiratory symptoms, allergy and former respiratory disease as well as exposure information will be given on a self-reported questionnaire. Changes in lung function indices, nitric oxide levels and serum inflammatory markers will be calculated. Nitric oxide will only be measured in non-smokers. We will compare cement dust exposed workers with low-level or non-exposed workers (controls).</detailed_description>
