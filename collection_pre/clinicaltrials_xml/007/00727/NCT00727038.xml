	<brief_summary>Neovascular glaucoma is a potentially debilitating disease of the eye. Vascular eye disease such as diabetes and vein occlusions can cause the retina to release factors that promote the growth of abnormal blood vessels. These abnormal vessels can grow in the drainage mechanism of the eye causing pressure in the eye to markedly increase. This can potentially cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve from glaucoma leading to permanent blindness and painful eyes. Conventional treatments including laser and freezing therapy take weeks to cause regression in abnormal blood vessel growth. This delay often results in permanent vision loss and pain. New medications targeted at more immediately reducing blood vessel growth may aid in the treatment of this disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lucentis for New Onset Neovascular Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Intravitreal injection of Lucentis prior to conventional treatment for neovascular glaucoma improves overall outcome compared to conventional treatment alone. Specific Aims: To determine if pre-treatment with a single intravitreal injection of Lucentis prior to conventional treatment prevents severe vision loss and improves intraocular pressure control compared to conventional treatment alone. Neovascular glaucoma is a potentially devastating consequence of fibrovascular proliferation of the anterior chamber angle with subsequent obstruction of the trabecular meshwork. The production of peripheral anterior synechiae along the trabecular meshwork leads to progressive angle closure. The subsequent elevation in intraocular pressure is difficult to manage, often leading to rapid progression of glaucoma and significant loss of vision. Enucleation for blind, painful eyes secondary to neovascular glaucoma is not an uncommon sequelae. Neovascular glaucoma has many etiologic causes, the vast majority resulting from retinal ischemia secondary to relatively common diseases such as central retinal vein occlusion, proliferative diabetic retinopathy and ocular ischemic syndrome (carotid stenosis). (Sivac-Callcott et al., 2001) Vascular endothelial growth factor is likely a major contributor to the development of angle and iris neovascularization. (Ferrara, 2004) Although panretinal photocoagulation and/or cryoablation are mainstays of conventional treatment for neovascular glaucoma, the delayed therapeutic effect of these interventions often results in the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae and permanent angle closure. Recent limited case series have demonstrated a role for bevacizumab (Avastin) in reducing rubeosis iridis and as an adjunct for neovascular glaucoma. (Grisanti et al., 2006; Davidorf et al., 2006; Iliev et al., 2006; Kahook, Schuman, Noecker, 2006) However, no prospective studies have examined the potential utility of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma. Intravitreal Lucentis is the standard of care for the treatment of exudative macular degeneration. Pharmacologic agents such as Lucentis, which selectively inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor may provide an important therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of neovascular glaucoma by more immediately causing regression of angle neovascularization and thereby providing a window for permanent treatment with laser or cryotherapy.</detailed_description>
