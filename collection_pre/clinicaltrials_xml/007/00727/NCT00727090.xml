	<brief_summary>Conivaptan (Vaprisol) is FDA-Approved for the treatment of low serum sodium (hyponatremia), but there are few data in patients with neurologic disease. Very low serum sodium in patients with brain injury can be life-threatening and is associated with cerebral edema (swelling of brain tissue). This can be important in patients with brain hemorrhage, brain tumors, or stroke (cerebral infarction). This is a pilot study to test the hypothesis that conivaptan (Vaprisol) leads to a greater increase in sodium than usual care. Patients will be randomly assigned to usual care or the lower FDA-approved dose of conivaptan (Vaprisol). We will track the use of other interventions, such as the use of hypertonic saline (concentrated salt solution), diuretics and salt tablets. A blinded co-investigator will record neurologic examination results (NIH Stroke Scale and Glasgow Coma Scale).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>severe hyponatremia (Na &lt; 130 mmol/L) or symptomatic hyponatremia Na &lt; 135 mmol/L for at least six hours with Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 15 Enrollment in the NMH highrisk spine protocol. These patients receive large amounts of fluids, have rapid changes in electrolytes, and are typically corrected in 48 hours Expected death from any cause Known sensitivity or allergy to conivaptan Renal failure (baseline creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL) Clinical diagnosis of hypovolemia, or by central venous pressure (CVP) &lt; 5 mm Hg if a central venous catheter is in place Concomitant use of potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir). These agents are not commonly used in the NeuroICU Clinical diagnosis of liver failure or insufficiency Pregnancy (must be excluded before entry) Lack of informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative (LAR) Use of intraarterial vasodilators (e.g. verapamil, nicardipine) within 24 hours (e.g. for vasospasm after SAH) Concern by the NeuroICU pharmacist of a drugdrug interaction that would meaningfully impact care (the NeuroICU pharmacist will review the medication regimen before recruitment) Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus or treated with vasopressin, since these patients are already treated for abnormal free water balance Patients with congestive heart failure, since this is an approved use of the drug (these patients are typically not cared for in the NeuroICU) Age&lt;18 years (these patients are not cared for at NMH) Inclusion declined by the attending physician or consulting study nephrologist</criteria>
