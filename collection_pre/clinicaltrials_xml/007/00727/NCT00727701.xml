	<brief_title>Study of Individualized Wound Prevention Instruction to Prevent Venous Ulcer Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous ulcer disease is the most common form of lower extremity ulcer, and treatment requires months to years of costly intervention. Preventing venous ulcers from recurring is ideal, however, healing time is variable, possibly due to inadequate patient/clinician communication and surveillance. An aftercare summary is a detailed set of self-care instructions designed to help patients understand and influence preventative factors under their control. They have successfully been used in patients with cardiac disease and are currently being tested to help prevent diabetic foot ulcers. We propose the use of an aftercare summary to help prevent ulcer recurrence in veterans with recently healed venous ulcers.</detailed_description>
