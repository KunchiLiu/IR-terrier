	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of an IACD i.e. Apple iPod-shuffle, on freezing and gait speed in people with a diagnosis of PD through the implementation of a randomised controlled trial. A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of such a device on the quality of life of people with stroke through the administration of a self-report questionnaire. The IACD will be pre-loaded with an individualised auditory cueing frequency (metronome sound) matched to the walking speed of the individual with PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to Evaluate Use of an Individual Auditory Cueing Device's (IACD's) on Freezing and Gait in People With Parkinson's Disease (PD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators calculated and pre-loaded 100 baseline frequencies (less 10%) in the sound of a metronome beat in an MP3 format (30 - 130 BPM) [38] onto a DVD-Rom. A user manual was created with a set of instructions that gives each physiotherapist a step-by-step guide on how to calculate the correct beat for their participants and how to successfully upload this beat onto the iPod. In addition physiotherapists in participating centres attended a training session on how to complete the tasks. A pack including the DVD-Rom, user manual, information leaflet and consent was sent to participating centres. Recruitment is due to commence in September 2008.</detailed_description>
