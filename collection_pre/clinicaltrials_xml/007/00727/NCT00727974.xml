	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis of Children With Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) and Migraines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if there are genetic variations that can explain a genetic basis for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), various phenotypes of CVS (e.g. menstrual, Sato, calendar-tied) and migraine headaches (e.g. with aura, without aura, hemiplegic migraine). This information will allow physicians to improve care for patients who have been diagnosed with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete information regarding the cause of this disease. This research is being done because many unanswered questions remain regarding children with CVS.</detailed_description>
