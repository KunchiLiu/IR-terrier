	<brief_summary>In recent years, vitamin D has been shown not only to be important for bone and calcium metabolism but also for homeostasis of critical tissues involved in vascular disease in patients with diabetes. Epidemiological studies indicated the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Type 2 DM patients and suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension with low vitamin D levels. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the effects of vitamin D replacement on blood pressure control and vascular disease in vitamin D deficient hypertensive patients with diabetes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a double blinded, placebo controlled trial. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to placebo or 25(OH)D3, 4,000 IU/d orally for 16 weeks. Enrolled patients will be tested for 24h-blood pressure, brachial arterial blood flow, vascular inflammatory markers and macrophage inflammatory response to modified-lipoproteins at baseline, middle and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
