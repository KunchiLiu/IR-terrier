	<brief_title>A Study to Determine if Carbon Dioxide Lavage During Total Knee Surgery Reduces Intraoperative Embolic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly patients undergoing major, orthopedic surgery are at risk of developing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) or memory impairment following surgery. Transcranial doppler (TCD) monitoring of blood flow to the brain has detected cerebral emboli in 60% of patients following release of the thigh tourniquet during total knee replacement or arthroplasty (TKA). These cerebral embolic events may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for postoperative cognitive problems. The standard surgical technique for TKA involves cleaning the bone surfaces with pulsed saline lavage prior to cementation and prosthesis insertion. The CarboJet Assisted technique utilizes carbon dioxide lavage to clean and dry the femur canal and bone surfaces prior to cementation and implantation. Because it removes fat globules and marrow particulates from the bone surfaces, it is hypothesized that the use of a carbon dioxide lavage technique in TKA will result in fewer thromboembolic events and increased cement penetration compared with the standard technique using pulsed saline lavage. Cement penetration affects the strength of the bone-cement interface and, therefore, contributes to implant longevity.</detailed_description>
