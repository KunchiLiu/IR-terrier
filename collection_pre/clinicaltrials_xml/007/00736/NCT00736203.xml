	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain a database of brain function from a sample of non-smokers while they do tasks in an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine. Our hypothesis is that among nonsmokers, reactivity to smoking cues will be highly similar to control cues but may vary as a function of attitudes toward smoking and/or family history of smoking. We also hypothesize that brain activity during the n-back task will be more similar to data collected during this task when smokers are not abstinent.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thirty six non-smokers will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. During scanning participants will complete the n-back task-a measure of working memory-and the cue-reactivity task-a measure of responses to smoking cues. Before scanning, participants will complete a training session where they will be familiarized with the tasks. All participants will have to pass a screening visit in order to be included in the study.</detailed_description>
