	<brief_summary>PATH is a member of a consortium that is developing a Diagnostic Enterics Card (DEC) which will allow clinicians to diagnose a group of diarrheagenic pathogens linked to morbidity and mortality. The pathogens detected on DEC include Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella species, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. This study will evaluate the performance of the assays and the platform in clinical conditions with non-expert users. It will provide important data on the performance of DEC for at least one target pathogen, an understanding of the potential impact of different sample types on device performance, and human factors associated with instrument interface in the field.</brief_summary>
