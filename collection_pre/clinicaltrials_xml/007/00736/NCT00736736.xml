	<brief_summary>The first purpose was to compare the difference between leg press exercise(LPE) and additional hip abductor and external rotator muscle strength training to leg press exercise(LPE+HAE) in muscle strength, hip kinematics during step down, pain severity and function for patients diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The second one was to discover the relationship between the change in muscle strength performance and the difference of hip joint kinematics post treatment.</brief_summary>
