	<brief_summary>The objective of the current study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 1356 (5 mg / once daily) given for 78 weeks in different modalities of treatment. The treatment modalities are determined by the treatment in the blinded trial in which every patient was included previously as BI 1356 in monotherapy (patients in 1218.16 trial), BI 1356 in combination with pioglitazone (patients in 1218.15 trial), BI 1356 added to metformin background (patients in 1218.17 trial) or BI 1356 added to a background therapy of metformin in combination with a sulphonylurea (patients in 1218.18 study)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with the GCP and local legislation. 2. Patients completing the entire treatment period as a double blind trial whether or not they have been treated with rescue medication. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients who meet one or more of the withdrawal criteria of the treatment period of the previous trial. 2. Premenopausal women (last menstruation =&lt; 1 year prior to signing informed consent) who: are nursing or pregnant, or are of childbearing potential and are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or do not plan to continue using this method throughout the study and do not agree to submit to periodic pregnancy testing during participation in the trial. Acceptable methods of birth control include transdermal patch, intra uterine devices/systems (IUDs/IUSs), oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of birth control) and vasectomised partners. No exception will be made. 3. Alcohol abuse within the 3 months prior to informed consent that would interfere with trial participation. 4. Drug abuse which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with trial participation. 5. Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of the trial medication.</criteria>
