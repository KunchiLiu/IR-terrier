	<brief_summary>Nexagon™ is a novel compound that promotes wound healing by temporarily disrupting cellular communication at the wound site, thereby promoting accelerated healing, reducing inflammation and pain. This randomized double-blind study will assess the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of Nexagon™ when applied to skin wounds created by punch biopsy in healthy volunteers. 43 healthy, fair-skinned males and females between ages 18-40 will be enrolled. Subjects will be reviewed again at 3 months and 9 months for follow-up safety assessments and wound appearance evaluation.</brief_summary>

Subjects who are known hypertrophic or keloid scar formers. 3. Subjects who smoke. 4. Subjects with a body mass index of greater than 30 kg/m2. 5. Subjects with bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulants. 6. Subjects with any other skin lesion sites or a chronic or currently active skin disorder, which would adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or which involve the areas to be examined in this study. 7. Subjects taking or who have taken prescribed drugs in the 30 days prior to Day 0, in particular, topical or systemic steroids, antiinflammatories, anticoagulants, antiproliferative drugs, or antibiotics. 8. Subjects who regularly take aspirin, ginseng, gilboa, Alka Seltzer or any other overthecounter medicine or complimentary health product that can affect the blood clotting process. 9. Subjects with a history of clinically relevant allergies. 10. Subjects with tattoos, scars or abrasions at the site to be studied. 11. Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality following review of prestudy laboratory data and physical examination. 12. Subjects showing evidence of drug abuse. 13. Subjects with any clinically significant mental illness in the opinion of the Investigator. 14. Females who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Females of childbearing potential must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control, as defined the protocol. 15. Subjects who have a past or present disease, which as judged by the Investigator may affect the safety of the subject or the outcome of the study. 16. Subjects who have participated in a clinical study within the 30 days prior to Day 0.</criteria>
