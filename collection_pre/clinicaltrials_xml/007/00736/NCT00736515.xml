	<brief_summary>In recent years, with the further research of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and the mechanism of oral antidiabetes drugs, the early combination therapy of oral antidiabetes drugs and insulin is getting paid more and more attention. A lot of studies have confirmed that Gliclazide MRs have excellent reducing blood glucose efficacy and vascular protection. Based on these theory and practice, this study is designed to demonstrate whether the combination therapy of Gliclazide MR and basal insulin can control the blood glycemia effectively and reduce the dosage of insulin and the hypoglycemia events compared to the premix insulin monotherapy.</brief_summary>
