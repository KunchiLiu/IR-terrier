	<brief_summary>BDNF has been linked to the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma. In this trial, the impact of a treatment with salmeterol and salmeterol / fluticasone on BDNF concentrations will be assessed in patients with asthma. The investigators hypothesize that salmeterol impacts on BDNF concentrations in patients with asthma.</brief_summary>
