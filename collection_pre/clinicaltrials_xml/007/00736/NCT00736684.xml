	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare rates of any fracture fixation complication and revision rates after intramedullary fixation of unstable trochanteric fractures between the Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation™ (PFNA)(Investigational Group) and Gamma Nail 3™ (Gamma3) (Control Group).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation™ (PFNA) Versus Gamma Nail 3™ (Gamma3) for Intramedullary Nailing of Unstable Trochanteric Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intramedullary nailing of unstable per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures is a standard procedure in trauma and orthopaedic surgery. Unstable fractures treated with intramedullary nailing carry the risk of fracture fixation complications. The PFNA (Synthes) has evolved from the original PFN design, featuring a novel antirotation screw. Apart from the prevention of excess rotational forces, this supporting element may enhance the overall stability of the construct, thus potentially reducing fracture fixation complications. Empirical information about the fracture fixation complication rates of the PFNA device is not available. The primary objective of this study is to compare the 1-year fracture fixation rates between the PFNA and Gamma Nail 3™ (Stryker). Secondary objectives of the study are to compare differences in functional outcomes, quality of life outcomes, safety, radiological outcomes, handling and perceived effectiveness between the devices.</detailed_description>
