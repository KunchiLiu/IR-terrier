	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will study the use of ridaforolimus in metastatic breast cancer subjects whose tumors have shown a resistance to trastuzumab (herceptin). The goal of this study is to find out if subjects treated with ridaforolimus in combination with trastuzumab have a positive response to the treatment, and if treatment with ridaforolimus in combination with trastuzumab prolongs survival.</brief_summary>
