	<brief_summary>The objective of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN alfa-2b) and ribavirin (RBV) administered to participants coinfected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Participants were treated by general practitioners in clinical practice as part of the post-marketing surveillance study. The study assessed the rates of eradication of the HCV and the rates of serious adverse events reported with PEG-IFN alfa-2b (1.5 ug/kg/week) and RBV (800-1200 mg/day) in common medical practice in Germany.</brief_summary>
