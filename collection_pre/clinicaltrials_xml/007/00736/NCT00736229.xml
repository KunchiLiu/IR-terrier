	<brief_title>Intravenous Exenatide in Coronary Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have particularly poor outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes call for treatment to achieve preprandial glucose &lt;110 mg/dL, a maximum daily target &lt;180 mg/dL, and a post-discharge hemoglobin A1c &lt;7%. Initiation of aggressive insulin therapy is also warranted to achieve blood glucose &lt;150 mg/dL during days 0-3 and 80-110 mg/dL when possible thereafter. To date, no studies have been conducted assessing the efficacy of intravenous exenatide administration on achieving glucose lowering in hyperglycemic coronary ICU patients.</detailed_description>
