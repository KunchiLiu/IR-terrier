	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-response effect of a yogurt containing a combination of bifidobacterium Lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus Acidophilus (LA-5) and green tea extract on markers of the immune system and gut health in healthy subjects. We hypothesize that the response of the immune function will be dose-dependent of the probiotics found in the fermented yogurt.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Response Study of a Fermented Yogurt on the Immune System and Gut Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is an increasing list of food containing probiotics on the market. Several studies have emphasized the health benefits of single probiotics, particularly on the immune system. However, it is unclear how a combination of two different probiotics complemented with green tea extract can beneficially modify markers of the immune. The aim of this study is to determine the dose-response effect of a yogurt containing a combination of bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus Acidophilus LA-5 and green tea extract on immune system in healthy subjects. More specifically, this randomized, parallel placebo controlled study will investigate the impact of increasing doses (109 and 1010) of these probiotics on phagocytosis activity, oxidative metabolism and on the antipneumococcics antibody specific serotype response S. pneumoniae vaccination. Finally, this study will also examine the effect of increasing dose of these probiotics on intestinal microflora and blood lipids.</detailed_description>
