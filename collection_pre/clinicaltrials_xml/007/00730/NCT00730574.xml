	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the commonness of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene in subjects with B12 deficiency. Also, we'd like to investigate the effect of B12 deficiency combined with the C677T mutation on endothelial function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining B12 Deficiency Associated With C677T Mutation on MTHFR Gene in Terms of Commonness and Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>we showed that patiebts with B12 deficiency have higher than expected frequency of MTHFR mutation and patients with both abnormalities havean abnormal endothelial function</detailed_description>
