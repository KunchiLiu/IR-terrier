	<brief_title>Effects of 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate and Vitamin B12 Supplemetation on Red Cell Membrane in Children With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common fatal autosomal recessive disorders in the Caucasian population caused by mutations of gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). New experimental therapeutic strategies for CF propose a diet supplementation to affect the plasma membrane fluidity and to modulate the cellular amplified inflammatory response in CF target organs. Red blood cells (RBCs) were used to investigate plasma membrane, because RBCs share lipid, protein composition and organization with other cell types.</detailed_description>
