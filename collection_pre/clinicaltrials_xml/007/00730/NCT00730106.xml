	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic reflux symptoms (i.e. troublesome heartburn and/or acid regurgitation). Empirical therapy without diagnostic endoscopy is suggested for those GERD patients presenting without alarm symptoms in Western countries. Whether such "treating instead of testing" strategy should be applied in Asia, an area with higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer, remains uninvestigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Findings in Patients With Typical Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study amis to investigate upper endoscopic findings of typical acid reflux patients with and without alarm symptoms in Taiwan During the period from May 2008 to December 2009, consecutive adult outpatients, who receive upper endoscopy for characteristic reflux symptoms of heartburn or acid regurgitation, are invited to participate. All study participants are evaluated for presence of pre-defined alarm symptoms including odynophagia or dysphagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, involuntary body weight loss and anemia. Upper endoscopic procedures are performed with standard electronic videoendoscope (GIF-Q240 or GIF-Q260; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by experienced endoscopists; each of them had previously performed a minimum of 2,000 upper endoscopy exams. Representative images are taken and stored as electronic files in a digital image system for later analysis. The following five significant endoscopic findings are pre-defined endpoints of this study: 1) any malignant lesion in the upper digestive tract, 2) Barrett esophagus, 3) severe erosive esophagitis (LA grade C or D), 4) peptic stricture, 5) peptic ulcer.</detailed_description>
