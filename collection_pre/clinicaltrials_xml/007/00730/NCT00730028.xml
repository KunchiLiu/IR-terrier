	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate 2 different antibiotics, drugs that fight bacteria, [clindamycin (CLINDA) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)] and wound care for the outpatient management of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTIs) in children and adults. The study will occur in areas where community associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (S.) aureus are common. S. aureus is a type of bacteria. A total of 1310 volunteers, greater than or equal to 6 months of age and adults 85 years or younger, non-immunocompromised, with uSSTIs (in particular abscess and/or cellulitis) will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be treated with one of the following: CLINDA, TMP-SMX, or placebo (contains no medication). Volunteers will be grouped based on the presence of cellulitis or abscess, whether the abscess can be surgically drained, and its size. The subject participation duration for this study is about 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uncomplicated Skin and Soft Tissue Infections Caused by Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical practice in the treatment of community-onset skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) has not kept pace with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. This clinical trial will evaluate clindamycin (CLINDA) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and wound care for the outpatient management of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection (uSSTI) in 3 metropolitan areas, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, cities with high prevalence of community acquired (CA)-MRSA. This is a phase IIb multicenter, stratified, randomized, double-blind trial in which enrolled subjects with abscess or cellulitis will be treated with CLINDA, TMP-SMX, or placebo. Participants will include 1310 non-immunocompromised out-patients age 6 months to 85 years with SSTIs not requiring hospital admission. Subjects will undergo a screening/baseline evaluation, including determination of presence and size of abscess and/or presence of cellulitis. Subjects will then be randomized to receive treatment with either CLINDA, TMP-SMX, or placebo depending on whether they have: a larger drainable abscess, defined as greater than 5 cm in diameter in adults and as greater than 3 cm in diameter for ages 6-11 months, greater than 4 cm for ages 1-8 years, and greater than 5 cm for age 9 years and older; a limited drainable abscess, defined as less than or equal to 5 cm for adults and as less than or equal to 3 cm for ages 6-11 months, less than or equal to 4 cm for ages 1-8 years, and less than or equal to 5 cm for age 9 years and older; or cellulitis or erysipelas only. If the diameter of the abscess greater than 5 cm (smaller for children depending on age) or 2 or more sites of skin infection are present the subject will be randomized (1:1) to 10 days of therapy with TMP-SMX or CLINDA. If the diameter of the abscess less than or equal to 5 cm (smaller for children depending on age) then the subject will be randomized (1:1:1) to TMP-SMX, CLINDA or placebo for 10 days. Subjects with cellulitis or erysipelas only will be randomized (1:1) to TMP-SMX or CLINDA for 10 days. Subjects will be provided study drug, instructed in its use, and scheduled for 4 follow-up visits including: wound check (24-48 hours after enrollment); end of therapy (48 hours after completion of therapy); test of cure (7-10 days after completion of therapy); and a final visit at one month after completion of therapy. The primary objectives of this study are: to compare the cure rate of CLINDA to that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of patients with cellulitis or larger abscess at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit and to compare the cure rate of CLINDA, TMP-SMX, and placebo, each in conjunction with surgical drainage for the treatment of subjects with limited abscess at the TOC visit.</detailed_description>

Able to complete the informed consent process or, if a minor, a parent or guardian who is able to complete the informed consent process; an assent form also will be completed for children age 7 and older. Willing and able to complete the study protocol, studyrelated activities, and visits. Diagnosis of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection (uSSTI), either cellulitis (defined as an inflammation of skin and associated skin structures) or abscess (defined as a circumscribed collection of pus), evidenced by at least 2 of the following localized signs or symptoms on the skin for at least 24 hours: 1.
