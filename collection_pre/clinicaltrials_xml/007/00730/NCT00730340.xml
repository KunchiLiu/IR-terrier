	<brief_title>Closure Method Study Following Tonsillectomy in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a children's study. Patients experience significant postoperative pain, activity limitation and sometimes other significant postoperative complications. We are going to compare the effects of closing the tonsil wound versus non-closure. A daily journal will be kept (by the patient's parent or legal guardian)to log in measures of morbidity. Postoperative telephone calls will be made and scripted questions will be asked regarding any tonsillar hemorrhage requiring medical re-evaluation, and dehydration requiring medical re-evaluation. The patients will also be examined in the clinic at 10-14 days postoperatively to determine if the fossa remained closed or dehisced.</detailed_description>
