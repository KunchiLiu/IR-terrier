	<brief_summary>During pregnancy the woman uses more vitamin B12, but we do not know, whether it is through increased absorption or it eats into the womans vitamin B12 deposit . Sufficient B-vitamin is crucial for the normal development af foetus during pregnancy. In Denmark the National Board of Health recommend an intake of Folic Acid, from the day the woman wishes to be pregnant and to the 12. week of gestation, but there is no recommendation for vitamin B12. We will measure the vitamin B12 absorption with a new non-radioactive test, CobaSorb.</brief_summary>
