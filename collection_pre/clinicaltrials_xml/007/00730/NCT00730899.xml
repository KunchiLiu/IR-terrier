	<brief_title>Association Study of Gene Polymorphisms With Cardiac Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>G Protein pathways plays a pivotal role in mediating positive inotropy and cardiac hypertrophy by transducing signals of neurohormones in cardiomyocytes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the G protein subunits Galphas and Galphaq have been shown to result in altered protein expression. We now want to examine whether G Protein polymorphisms alter NYHA functional class, and hemodynamic variables in patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting .</detailed_description>
