	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the MTD of the combination of BIBW 2992/BIBF 1120 therapy administered concomitantly in a 28-day cycle schedule. Secondary objectives are the collection of antitumor efficacy data, the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992, and if data allow the determination of the pharmacokinetic influence of BIBW 2992 on BIBF 1120 and vice versa.</brief_summary>

Pregnancy or breastfeeding. 13. Treatment with other investigational drugs; chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone therapy (including LHRH agonists, megestrol acetate, or other hormones taken for breast cancer or prostate cancer); participation in another clinical study within the past 4 weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with this study. Treatment with bisphosphonates is allowed. 14. Treatment with an EGFR or HER2 inhibiting drug within the past 4 weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with this study (2 weeks for trastuzumab). 15. Patients unable to comply with the protocol. 16. Active alcohol or drug abuse. 17. Patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy [except treatment with Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)]. 18.
