	<brief_summary>This is a Phase IV, prospective, randomized, multi-center study to find risk factors of OAB symptoms relapse in patients who showed therapeutic benefits after 1, 3, or 6 months of treatment with Tolterodine SR and who then discontinued these antimuscarinics for 3 month. Patients who have OAB symptoms for 6 or more than 6 months and who show successful treatment response to 1 month of treatment with Tolterodine SR 4mg will be enrolled and randomized to 1, 3 or 6 months of treatment group. After completion of the treatment, subjects will be evaluated for changes in OAB symptoms and retreatment rate will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Predictors of Symptoms Relapse After Discontinuation of Treatment in Overactive Bladder (OAB) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: - To investigate the risk factors of OAB symptom relapse and retreatment in patients who showed therapeutic benefits after 1, 3 or 6 months of treatment with Tolterodine SR and who then discontinued these antimuscarinics for 3 month. Secondary Objective: - To investigate the change of the patient perception and quality of life after antimuscarinic discontinuation - To find the rate of patients who have OAB symptom relapse. - To find the risk factors of patients who want retreatment. - To find the rate of patients who want retreatment.</detailed_description>

An average volume voided of &gt; 200 ml per micturition as verified on the baseline micturition diary 3. Total daily urine volume of &gt; 3000 ml as verified on the baseline micturition diary 4. Significant hepatic or renal disease, defined as having twice the upper limit of the reference ranges for serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]), alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT]), alkaline phosphatase or creatinine 5. Any condition that is a contraindication for anticholinergic treatment, including uncontrolled narrowangled glaucoma, urinary retention or gastric retention 6. Symptomatic acute urinary tract infection (UTI) during the runin period 7. Recurrent UTIs defined as having been treated for symptomatic UTIs &gt; 4 times in the last year 8. Diagnosed or suspected interstitial cystitis 9. Uninvestigated hematuria or hematuria secondary to malignant disease. 10. Clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction defined by clinical symptoms and investigator's opinion according to local standard of care 11. Patients with marked cystocele or other clinically significant pelvic prolapse. 12. On an unstable dosage of any drug with anticholinergic side effects, or expected to start such treatment during the study 13. Receipt of any electrostimulation or bladder training within the 14 days before the start of tolterodine SR, or expected to start such treatment during the study 14. Use of any other drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder (e.g. anticholinergics except tolterodine) within the 14 days before the start of tolterodine SR, or expected to start such treatment during the study 15.
