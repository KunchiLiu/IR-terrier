	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of AEGR-733 to Treat Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a serious life-threatening genetic disease. Total plasma cholesterol levels are generally over 500 mg/dl and markedly premature cardiovascular disease is the major consequence. Untreated, most patients develop atherosclerosis before age 20 and generally do not survive past age 30. The primary goal of therapy involves reducing cholesterol (specifically, LDL cholesterol) and preventing coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, patients with homozygous FH are minimally responsive or unresponsive to available drug therapy and thus there are limited treatment options. The current standard of care is LDL apheresis, a physical method of removing the plasma of LDL cholesterol which can transiently reduce cholesterol by more than 50%. However, there is rapid re-accumulation of LDL cholesterol in plasma, and therefore apheresis has to be repeated frequently (every 1-2 weeks) and requires 2 separate sites for IV access. Although anecdotally this procedure may delay the onset of atherosclerosis, it is laborious, expensive, and not readily available. Furthermore, although it is a procedure that is generally well tolerated, the fact that it needs frequent repetition and IV access can be challenging for many of these young patients. Therefore, there is a tremendous unmet medical need for new medical therapies for this orphan disease. AEGR-733 is a novel oral therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia. Its mechanism involves inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, resulting in a reduction of LDL cholesterol. Earlier studies in patients with homozygous FH reveal AEGR-733 is highly effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, yet long term safety and efficacy need to be established.</detailed_description>
