	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show if a new delivery system with a modified stent is safe in treating occluded iliac arteries in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The modified Complete SE delivery system is hypothesized to assist physicians with more accurate stent placement reducing the likelihood of stent 'jumping' seen with the use of many self-expanding stent systems.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is being conducted to collect the 30-day safety data on the stent delivery system for all subjects enrolled into the study (with a minimum of 50 subjects enrolled) as well as the long-term 9-month safety and efficacy data on all subjects enrolled (with a minimum of 10 subjects enrolled into the study having the 120mm length stent implanted).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The lesion(s) is either denovo or restenotic in nature, located in either the common iliac artery or the external iliac artery and is &gt;50% stenosed Target vessel reference diameter ≥ 4.5 mm and ≤ 9.5 and can accommodate stent diameters of 6.0 10.0mm Subject is either asymptomatic with a lesion stenosis ≥70% or symptomatic with a lesion stenosis ≥50% with an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) &lt; 0.90 or Toe Brachial Index (TBI) &lt;0.80 or an abnormal Pulse Volume Recording (PVR); Total lesion length is &lt; 110 mm; Excessive Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), unresolved fresh thrombus or tortuosity or a target lesion/vessel that is heavily calcified ; Tissue loss in the extremity: category 5 or 6 on the Rutherford scale; Target lesion has a previous stent, or is within a prosthetic vascular bypass graft or within 1 cm of a graft anastomosis; Target lesion is within an aneurysm or associated with an aneurysm in the vessel segment proximal or distal to the target lesion; Lesion requires treatment with a nonstandard device associated with Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) prior to stent placement; Inadequate distal runoff; Planned interventional procedure or vascular surgery to target vessel within 30 days pre or postindex iliac procedure; History of bleeding diatheses or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions; Platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or White Blood Count (WBC) &lt;3,000 cells/mm3; Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl; Participation in another investigational device or drug study and has not completed the primary endpoint(s) followup phase of that study at least 30 days prior to enrollment in this trial or the subject has previously been enrolled in this Registry;</criteria>
