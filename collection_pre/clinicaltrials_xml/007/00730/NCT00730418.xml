	<brief_summary>In this study, we investigate the changes of the expression of alpha adrenergic receptor in the prostate tissue during 2-yr medication period in the man with benign prostatic hyperplasia. And we also evaluate the efficacy and safety of 24 mo-treatment with doxazosin (4mg, 8mg)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To compare the expression of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, we will use various methodologies such as - Real-time RT-PCR - Radioligand receptor binding - Western blot - Immunohistochemistry</detailed_description>
