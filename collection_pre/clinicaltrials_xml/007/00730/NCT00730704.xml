	<brief_summary>Worldwide cervical cancer remains a major cause mortality among women. It is estimated that each year over 490,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 270,000 die from the disease. While the implementation of widespread screening programs has reduced the burden of cervical cancer, a large percentage of the population still remains unscreened or is underscreened. It is now recognized that human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary precursor for the development of cervical cancer. The first vaccine to prevent HPV was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is now available at doctors offices. Despite the availability of a safe and effective means for the prevention of cervical cancer, widespread implementation of vaccination has been extremely difficult. Several potential issues have limited the development of widespread HPV vaccination programs, including cultural and religious beliefs, and limitations in the practicality of administering the vaccine. The overall goals of our work are to improve access to preventive strategies for cervical cancer. In this proposal we will examine the strategy of HPV vaccination for women who have just given birth. We believe that HPV vaccination of these women will be associated with a high level of patient satisfaction and acceptance. If successful, this strategy could play a major role in advancing the acceptance and implementation of HPV vaccination in the United States.</brief_summary>
