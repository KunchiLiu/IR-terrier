	<brief_summary>This study is being performed to evaluate what variants of lipid-lowering therapy are used in Russian clinical practice in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with hypercholesterolemia in whom the initial statin therapy did not achieve low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of all variants of modified lipid-lowering therapy are to be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study of Approaches to Lipid-Lowering Therapy in Russian Patients With Coronary Heart Disease &lt;&lt;Treat to Goal&gt;&gt; (Study P05464)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the observational nature of this study and that the assessment of a specific hypothesis is not foreseen, statistical assumption is not planned and the sample size calculation was not performed. Taking into consideration the available data on the established safety profile of the therapy with statins and combination of ezetimibe with statins it has been suggested that a sample size of 750 patients will be sufficient to identify adverse events profile. The treatment effects will be characterized by descriptive and frequency parameters.</detailed_description>
