	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Fosfomycin/Tobramycin for Inhalation in Cystic Fibrosis Patients With Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Lung Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gilead is developing a broad spectrum combination antibiotic (FTI) consisting of fosfomycin (an antibiotic with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) and tobramycin (an aminoglycoside antibiotic with potent gram-negative activity) for treatment of patients with CF. FTI offers a potential option for treatment of CF lung infections. It is important to note that the concentration of tobramycin in FTI is lower than that of the approved dose of inhaled tobramycin alone, thereby demonstrating the potential of FTI to minimize long-term toxicity from repeated exposure to aminoglycosides like tobramycin. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 dose combinations of fosfomycin/tobramycin for inhalation (FTI), following a 28-day course of Aztreonam for Inhalation (AZLI) in patients with cystic fibrosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection.</detailed_description>
