	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, multi-national, open study to assess the pharmacokinetics of NRL972 in patients with hepatic cirrhosis CTP-classes A, B, and C (histologically confirmed by liver biopsy). The pharmacokinetics of NRL972 will be referenced to a Clinical Staging Matrix obtained during a clinical work-up of patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Patients to be studied will have histologically established hepatic cirrhosis or confirmed hepatic cirrhosis by an objective imaging study without confounding end-stage co-morbidity. Within 14 days of confirming eligibility, the investigations will be conducted over 2-5 days with the test procedures (clinical laboratory tests, ultrasound (US)-investigations, gastroscopy, NRL972- and MEGX'-test). Up to one week after the NRL972-test, a follow-up telephone call will be made.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects meeting the following conditions will be eligible for enrolment: Patient has given his or her written informed consent to the study participation, prior to study specific procedures Male and female (nonchildbearing potential = postmenopausal or medically adequate contraception) Ethnicity: any Age: 18 to 80 years of age Patients with histologically established diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis and available histological material for review by the central histopathologist or a CTP score greater than or equal to 10 points plus an objective imaging study (CT or NMR scan) within 3 months of the screening visit with a confirmation of hepatic cirrhosis (scans are collected and reviewed), but excluding patients with the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and cystic fibrosisassociated liver disease Present CTPclass A, B or C Medically fit to undergo the protocoldefined procedures without undue risk and discomfort Predicted lifeexpectancy greater than or equal to 6 months by clinical judgement Subjects of any of the following categories will be excluded from enrolment: Previous participation in this trial (except for scheduled retesting in relation to technical difficulties with initial test) Participant in any other trial during the last 90 days Donation of blood during the last 60 days or a history of blood loss exceeding 300 mL within the last 3 months Any donation of germ cells, blood, organs, or bone marrow during the course of the study History of any clinically relevant allergy (including hypersensitivity to the trial medications) Presence of clinical relevant acute or chronic infection (other than chronic viral hepatitis, if applicable) Use of confounding concomitant medication Presence or history of any endstage (co)morbidity (excluding the effects of hepatic cirrhosis) such as: malignancy and clinically relevant systemic diseases Suspicion or evidence that the subject is not trustworthy and reliable Suspicion or evidence that the subject is not able to make a free consent or to understand the information in this regard Primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis Cystic fibrosis Previous liver transplantation or intended liver transplantation within 6 months after enrolment Patients having undergone previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or portocaval anastomosis (PCA) Patients who are employees at the investigational site, relatives or spouses of the investigator Current drug, or medication abuse Special restrictions for female patients: Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means, unless they meet the following definition of postmenopausal: 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels greater than 40 mIU/m or 6 weeks post surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or hysterectomy or are using one or more of the following acceptable methods of contraception: surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy), hormonal contraception (implantable, patch, oral), and doublebarrier methods (any double combination of: IUD, male or female condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap)</criteria>
