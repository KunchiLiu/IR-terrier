	<brief_summary>The principal objective of the study is to investigate the effect of sorafenib on progression free survival (time until the cancer begins to grow again,) in patients with malignant mesothelioma who have had prior treatment with chemotherapy. Effectiveness of the drug will also be explored with PET scans before and during treatment.</brief_summary>
