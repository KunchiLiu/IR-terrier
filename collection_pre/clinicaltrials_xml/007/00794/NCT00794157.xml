	<criteria>Diagnosis of moderatetosevere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as classified by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines and: 1. Smoking history of at least 20 packyears. 2. Postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 80% and ≥ 30% of the predicted normal value. 3. Postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) &lt; 70%. Patients who have been hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to screening or during the 14 day runin period prior to randomization. Patients requiring longterm oxygen therapy (&gt; 15 hours a day) for chronic hypoxemia. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to screening. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease. Patients with a history of asthma. Patients with diabetes Type I or uncontrolled diabetes Type II. Any patient with lung cancer or a history of lung cancer. Any patient with active cancer or a history of cancer with less than 5 years diseasefree survival time. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc interval (Bazett's) measured at screening or randomization is prolonged. Patients who have been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to screening or during the runin period. Patients unable to successfully use a dry powder inhaler device or perform spirometry measurements. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to the study.</criteria>
