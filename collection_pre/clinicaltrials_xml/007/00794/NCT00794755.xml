	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of low dose Vitamin K1 (200 micrograms per day) at improving anticoagulation control in unstable patients on warfarin. This study will also aim to look at effectiveness in the context of genes known to influence warfarin metabolism, variability in the consumption of Vitamin K rich foods, and patient knowledge about warfarin anticoagulation -- factors which have been associated with anticoagulation control and which can influence the effectiveness of this intervention in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Supplementation to Improve Anticoagulation Control With Oral Vitamin K as an Adjuvant to Warfarin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blinded placebo controlled pilot RCT assessing the effectiveness of daily supplementation with low dose Vitamin K1 (200 micrograms per day) against placebo at improving anticoagulation control. Previous studies assessing the efficacy of this intervention have been small and further trials are required to evaluate the true effectiveness and safety profile. Furthermore the impact of genetic polymorphisms, known to impact warfarin metabolism, on the effectiveness/safety of this intervention will also be assessed in this study. Demographic and clinical variables as well as potential confounding variables such as variable dietary Vitamin K intake, concomitant interacting medications, and anticoagulation knowledge will be assessed in this study. Given that this is a pilot study we will be looking at recruitment numbers and necessary parameter estimates to determine the number of patients available at our institution for the study. Power analysis will be performed to evaluate the treatment effect size between the placebo and intervention groups.</detailed_description>
