	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the predictive value of NRL972 pharmacokinetics in the diagnosis of steatohepatitis using fatty liver disease as the comparator group. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of NRL972 pharmacokinetics as a diagnostic tool will be compared to results from the standard laboratory tests, elastography, tests of metabolic markers and serum fibrosis markers frequently used in the evaluation of clinically predicted NAFLD patients. Patients will be included if they have clinical evidence of fatty liver disease and have been referred to the clinic for a diagnostic work-up, including a liver biopsy, blood tests and scans of the liver.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects meeting the following conditions will be eligible for enrollment: Males or females (females of nonchildbearing potential or of childbearing potential while taking medically appropriate contraception) Any ethnicity Age: 18 to 80 years of age Clinical evidence of nonalcoholic liver disease requiring the conduct of a liver biopsy for the diagnosis of NAFLD and/or staging of disease severity Willing and able to provide informed consent Subjects fulfilling any of the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment: General all subjects Presence of acute or chronic viral hepatitis confirmed by serology Clinical signs of significant cholestasis Liver impairment due to spaceoccupying processes (e.g. carcinoma) Liver transplant recipient or patient scheduled for liver transplantation Clinically evident rapidly deteriorating hepatic function Significant bleeding diathesis Esophageal bleeding within the 8 weeks prior to study entry Presence of any contraindications for the conduct of the planned liver biopsy (e.g. allergy to lidocaine, coagulopathy with &lt;100 x109/L thrombocytes and/or INR &gt;1.3 History of any allergic reaction to fluorescein Presence of any acute infection Previous participation in this trial Having received any investigational drug or treatment within 30 days prior to study entry or requiring a concurrent treatment with any other experimental drug or treatment Uncontrolled hypo or hypertension (treated or untreated) with resting systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or &lt; 90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 or &lt; 50 mmHg Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values indicating endstage renal, pulmonary or cardiac disease Known HIV infection Concurrent alcohol use of more than 14 drinks (140g ethanol) for men and 7 drinks (70g ethanol) for women per week (each drink is counted as 10g ethanol) History of drug or alcohol abuse within 2 months prior to dosing Use of prohibited medication (section 4.8) Donation of blood during the last 60 days or a history of blood loss exceeding 300 mL within the last 3 months Suspicion or evidence that the subject is not trustworthy and reliable Suspicion or evidence that the subject is not able to make a free consent or to understand the information in this regard Significant side effects prior to the liver biopsy (e.g. anxiety requiring premedication) or after the biopsy (e.g. pain requiring i.v. pain medication, bleeding requiring medical intervention) General all females Positive pregnancy test Premenopausal women not using appropriate contraception</criteria>
