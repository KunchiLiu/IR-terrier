	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Mipomersen in Patients With Severe Hypercholesterolemia on a Maximally Tolerated Lipid-Lowering Regimen and Who Are Not on Apheresis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL). Elevated LDL is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Mipomersen is an antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called apolipoprotein B (Apo-B). Apo-B plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (the "bad" cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream. High LDL-C is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other diseases of blood vessels. It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart attacks and other major adverse cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study is to determine whether mipomersen safely and effectively lowers LDL-C in severely hypercholesterolemic patients who are on a maximally tolerated lipid-lowering regimen and who are not on apheresis.</detailed_description>
