	<brief_summary>There is very little data available on compliance with self-injected low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), but what there is, definitely shows that compliance represents a significant problem. We therefore aim to a) record drug use problems of patients including compliance, b) develop a "SOP" for first instruction by a pharmacist and for subsequent pharmaceutical care and c) to compare intensive pharmaceutical care (intervention) vs. standard care (control) provided in the pharmacy to patients with a prescription for a LMWH as an outpatient treatment. Hypothesis: Intensive pharmaceutical care in ambulatory patients who self-inject low molecular weight heparins results in improved compliance, more safety and satisfaction as well as in fewer complications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient recruitment in community pharmacies enables the testing of the feasibility of the interventions under daily-practice conditions and facilitates the recruitment of a larger number of patients. Data collection: - telephone interviews with structured questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the therapy - monitored self-injection in the study center or at patient's home (direct observation technique [DOT]) - compliance measurement: answers from patient interviews, comparing number of used syringes vs. number of prescribed syringes (analogue "pill count"), measuring residual volume in recycled syringes - recording of the fine motor skills by the adapted "Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand" questionnaire (DASH questionnaire)</detailed_description>
