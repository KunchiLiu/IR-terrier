	<brief_title>Effects of Ezetimibe on the Absorption of Oxidized Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are a number of cholesterol-lowering drugs available that can lower blood cholesterol to a healthier level. Zetia™ (ezetimibe) 10 mg is available by prescription for the treatment of high cholesterol. While Zetia has been shown to inhibit the absorption of dietary cholesterol into the bloodstream, its effects on oxysterol absorption from the diet have not been completely evaluated.</detailed_description>
