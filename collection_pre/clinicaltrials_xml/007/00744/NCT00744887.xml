	<brief_summary>The objectives are to determine the effect of different ritonavir doses on darunavir (DRV) oral exposure following once-daily oral dosing of DRV/rtv for 7 days, in order to establish an optimal ritonavir boosting dose for DRV and to evaluate short-term safety and tolerability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC114-TiDP3-C181: Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of Darunavir (DRV) With Different Doses of Ritonavir in Healthy Volunteers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 3-way crossover trial in healthy volunteers to assess the pharmacokinetics of darunavir (DRV), co-administered with different doses of ritonavir. The trial population will consist of 18 healthy adult volunteers. During 3 subsequent sessions, each volunteer will receive in a randomized way: Treatments A, B and C. In Treatment A, 800 mg DRV once-daily and 100 mg ritonavir once-daily will be administered. In Treatment B, 800 mg DRV once-daily and 50 mg ritonavir once-daily will be administered. In Treatment C, 800 mg DRV once-daily and 20 mg ritonavir once-daily will be administered. All treatments will be administered for 7 days and intake of DRV and ritonavir will be under fed conditions. DRV will be formulated as a 400 mg tablet; ritonavir will be formulated as an oral solution containing 80mg/mL ritonavir. In each treatment session, full pharmacokinetic profiles of DRV and ritonavir will be determined up to 24 hours after administration on Day 1 and up to 72 hours after administration on Day 7. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between subsequent treatments. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated continuously throughout the trial. During 3 subsequent sessions, each volunteer will receive in a randomized way Treatments A, B and C. In Treatment A, 800/100 mg DRV/rtv once-daily will be administered. In Treatment B, 800/50 mg DRV/rtv once-daily will be administered. In Treatment C, 800/20 mg DRV/rtv once-daily will be administered. All treatments will be administered for 7 days. DRV will be formulated as a 400 mg tablet; ritonavir will be formulated as an oral solution containing 80mg/mL ritonavir.</detailed_description>
