	<brief_title>Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify aspects of survivorship experience that differ by clinical risk (low risk vs high risk) in patients with non-invasive bladder cancer. - To collect and examine data on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom management. - To analyze differences in outcomes between genders, stage and grade of disease, and recency of diagnosis (new diagnosis vs â‰¥ 6 month diagnosis). OUTLINE: Patients undergo a 45-minute telephone interview to assess their current medical condition and psychological functioning (i.e., bladder cancer treatment history, levels of depression and anxiety, quality of life, self-efficacy, and perceived social support). Patients complete a series of questionnaires including the Lepore social constraint measure; REACH social support measure; self-report inventories assessing patient communication, relationship style, illness intrusiveness, fear of recurrence, and social constraint; Impact of Events scale; Brief Symptom Index-18 and Global Severity Index; EORTC QLQ-C30 (general health-related quality of life); and EORTC QLC-BLS24 (disease-specific health-related quality of life).</detailed_description>
