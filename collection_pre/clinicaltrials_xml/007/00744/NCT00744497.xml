	<criteria>History of histologically diagnosed prostate cancer Evidence of metastatic disease by any 1 of the following: computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scan, or skeletal survey Evidence of progression, as defined by 1 of the following: rising prostate specific antigen levels at least 1 week apart with the final value being &gt;=2 ng/mL; progression of measurable nodal or visceral disease, with nodal lesions &gt;=20 mm and visceral lesions measurable per response evaluation criteria for solid tumors (Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors, version 1); 2 or more lesions appearing on bone scan compared with previous scan; or local recurrence in the prostate or prostate bed Maintaining castrate status: Participants who have not undergone surgical orchiectomy should have received and continue on medical therapies, such as gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs, to maintain castrate levels of serum testosterone &lt;=50 ng/dL Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 to 2 At least 4 weeks since an investigational agent prior to starting study therapy At least 8 weeks since radioisotope therapy prior to starting study therapy Recovery from any local therapy including surgery or radiation/radiotherapy for a minimum of 7 days prior to starting study therapy Required initial laboratory values: white blood cell count &gt;=3,000/mm^3; absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,500/mm^3; platelet count &gt;=100,000/mm^3; creatinine level &lt;=1.5*upper limit of normal (ULN); bilirubin &lt;=ULN; aspartate aminotransferase &lt;=2.5*ULN; alanine aminotransferase &lt;=2.5*ULN. Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction; ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months; prolonged QTc &gt;450 msec; ejection fraction &lt;40%; or major conduction abnormality, unless a cardiac pacemaker is present Pleural or pericardial effusion of any Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade Peripheral neuropathy CTC Grade &gt;=2 Currently active second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers. Participants are not considered to have a currently active malignancy if they have completed therapy and are now considered (by their physician) to be at less than 30% risk for relapse Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements HIV infectionpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the investigational agents Receipt of any other investigational agents for the treatment of prostate cancer Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, with the exception of estramustine Patients may continue on a daily multivitamin but must discontinue all other herbal, alternative, and food supplements before enrollment Ketoconazole must be discontinued 4 weeks prior to starting study therapy Antiandrogens must be discontinued prior to starting study therapy. Patients with a history of response to an antiandrogen and subsequent progression while on that antiandrogen should be assessed for antiandrogen withdrawal response for 4 weeks. Observation for antiandrogen withdrawal response is not necessary for those who have never responded to antiandrogens Bisphosphonates must not be initiated within 28 days prior to starting study therapy QT prolonging agents strongly associated with torsade de pointes.</criteria>
