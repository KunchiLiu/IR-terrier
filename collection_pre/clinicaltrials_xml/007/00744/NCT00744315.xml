	<brief_summary>Human Vascular Endothelial Grown Factor 165 (hVEGF165) administration is promising therapy induces a new vessels, arterioles and capillaries in regions whose revascularization surgery is not possible by direct or by percutaneous angioplasty. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effects and safety of gene therapy with hVEGF165 in patients with advanced coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
