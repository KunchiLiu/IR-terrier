	<brief_title>Lymphoma Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intent of this protocol is to accrue up to 800 volunteers who are interested in participating in NIA research studies as part of follow-up for previous cancer treatment at NIH. Participants will be asked to answer questions regarding their general health status, diagnoses, and admissions to hospital, and to provide possible documentation. They may be asked to come to the NIA Clinical Research Unit at Harbor Hospital to participate in a follow-up evaluation. They will have the opportunity to obtain additional information about studies in which they may wish to participate and to discuss eligibility issues with NIA staff members. Any identified clinical problems in need of care will also be discussed. Volunteers may be referred, with their permission, to their private medical doctor for follow-up. They may be re-evaluated within a year for further follow-up. The follow-up evaluation may include history and physical, blood and urine tests, questionnaire, MRI or CT.</detailed_description>
