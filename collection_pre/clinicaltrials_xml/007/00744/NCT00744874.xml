	<detailed_description>This trial was a non-randomized, multi-center, prospective study of subjects with symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The purpose of this study was to investigate and confirm the safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Medtronic Ablation Frontiers® Cardiac Ablation System when used for the treatment of paroxysmal AF. The trial was conducted over a 2 year period with enrollment occurring between 4 October 2007 and 1 December 2008.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation defined as: Self terminating AF lasting no more than 7 days AF events demostrating spontaneous conversion back to sinus rhythm Documentation of one or more events with PAF tracings by ECG, event recordings, pacemaker strips or monitor rhythm strips within the past year AF symptoms defined as the manisfestation of any of the following: Palpitations, Fatigue, Exertional dyspnea, effort intolerance Age between 18 and 70 Willingness, ability and commitment to participate in baseline and followup evaluations for the full length of the study Structural heart disease of clinical significance Prior ablation for arrhythmias other than AF within the past three months Prior left sided AF ablation Enrollment in any other ongoing arrhythmia study protocol Any ventricular tachyarrhythmias currently being treated where the arrhythmia or the management may interfere with this study Active infection or sepsis Any history of cerebral vascular disease including stroke or TIAs Pregnancy or lactation Untreatable allergy to contrast media Any diagnosis of atrial fibrillation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or any other reversible or noncardiovascular causes History of blood clotting (bleeding or thrombotic) abnormalities Known sensitivities to heparin or warfarin Severe COPD (identified by an FEV1 &lt; 1) Severe co morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the investigator, will not allow the patient to be a good study candidate (i.e. other disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, shortened life expectance, etc.)</criteria>
