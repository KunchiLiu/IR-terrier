	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison of Immunological Benefit of Laparoscopic Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with clinical stage â…¢ left colon and upper rectal cancer were prospectively assigned to undergo LC (n=35) or OC (n=39). Factors related to cellular immunity of host (total lymphocyte count, CD4 lymphocyte, CD8 lymphocyte, CD4/CD8 ratio, HLA-DR expression on monocyte (mHLA-DR)) were examined preoperatively, on the 1st day of operation (POD1) and the 5th day of operation (POD5).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Biopsy proven of colon cancer Preoperatively suspected as clinical stage III colon cancer Lesion located Descending colon, sigmoid colon and upper rectal cancer Could not perform curative resection Intestinal obstruction, perforation, intraabdominal abscess Severe medical illness Immunopathy</criteria>
