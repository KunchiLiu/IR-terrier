	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Renal dysfunction defined as estimated eGFR of 2080 mL/min; history of systolic or diastolic chronic heart failure of at least 14 days duration for which loop diuretic therapy has been prescribed; clinical evidence for volume overload; BNP â‰¥ 500 pg/mL or NTproBNP &gt; 2000 pg/mL; hospitalization. Exclusion Criteria Have low output syndrome, defined as having the need for treatment with I.V. inotropes or vasopressors; Need mechanical ventilation; Have significant stenotic valvular disease (severe aortic or mitral stenosis); Have myocardial infarction or hemodynamically destabilizing significant arrythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradyarrythmias with slow ventricular rate [&lt;45 bpm] or atrial fibrillation/flutter with a rapid ventricular response of &gt;120 bpm), or electrocardiographic evidence of 2nd degree heart block (Mobitz Type II) or 3rd degree AVblock in the absence of a pacemaker, within 30 days of screening; Have acute myocarditis or hypertrophic obstructive, restrictive, or constrictive cardiomyopathy</criteria>
