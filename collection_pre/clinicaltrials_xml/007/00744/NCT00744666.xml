	<brief_summary>Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) is a commonly employed treatment for various vitreoretinal disorders. However, approximately 23% to 50% of patients who receive IVTA develop ocular hypertension after the drug is injected into the eye. Similar to IVTA, topically administered corticosteroids eye drops result in ocular hypertension in approximately 33% of the population. It is unknown whether identifying patients who develop ocular hypertension from topical corticosteroids could be used to identify patients who are at risk for injectable IVTA. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical prednisolone 1% four times daily for one month as a screening test to reduce the incidence and severity of ocular hypertension after IVTA injection.</brief_summary>
