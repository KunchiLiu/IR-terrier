	<brief_summary>Aims: This prospective trial seeks to investigate the efficacy of a financial incentive in increasing the uptake and completion of the HBV vaccine series among people who inject drugs (PWID). Using a randomised controlled trial design, the investigators will offer the 3 dose, accelerated HBV schedule to eligible PWID allocated to either a standard of care or incentive condition. Participants allocated to the incentive condition will receive a small incentive payment after the second and third dose of the vaccine. It is hypothesized that the proportion of participants who complete the vaccine series in the incentive payment arm will be higher compared to the non-incentive payment arm (standard of care).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatitis B Acceptability and Vaccination Incentive Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injecting drug use is the leading exposure category for notifications of newly acquired hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Australia. Despite the existence of a safe and efficacious vaccine, hepatitis B coverage remains low among Australian people who inject drugs (PWID) and little is known about attitudes to immunisation, barriers to uptake and willingness to participate in vaccine trials among this group. Candidate vaccines for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV are currently in development and HBV immunisation provides a surrogate for examining strategies to deliver vaccines to this group. Secondary objectives of this trial are to (i) assess the cost effectiveness of the interventions; (ii) identify the correlates of immunity in this group; (iii) assess the acceptability of vaccines, including HBV vaccines, barriers to immunisation uptake and willingness to participate in vaccine trials among PWID; and (iv) assess hepatitis Bâˆ’related knowledge in this group. Research Design: A total of 200 eligible PWID or people at risk of initiating injecting (those with no history of exposure to or receipt of more than one vaccination against HBV) will be recruited and interviewed prior to randomisation on a 1:1 basis (100 per arm) to either the (1) control (standard of care) or (2) incentive conditions. All participants will be offered the 3 dose accelerated vaccine schedule (20ug at 0, 7 and 21 days) and will be followed up at week 12.</detailed_description>
