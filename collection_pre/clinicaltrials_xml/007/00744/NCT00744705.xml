	<brief_summary>The normal range of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness might be different between Asians and Caucasians. However, the recently developed imaging device such as the Cirrus HD OCT includes only the Caucasian data. So, the investigators want to find its normal range of in Asians.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normative Database of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness Measured by the Cirrus HD OCT in Asians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Characteristics of various ocular parameters are influenced by race. Because the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness is crucial in detecting early glaucomatous changes, its normal range is also important. Even though the normal range of RNFL thickness might be different according to race, the recently developed imaging device such as the Cirrus HD OCT includes only the Caucasian data. In the present study, we want to measure the RNFL thickness using the Cirrus HD OCT in normal Asian eyes and to determine its normal range in Asians.</detailed_description>
