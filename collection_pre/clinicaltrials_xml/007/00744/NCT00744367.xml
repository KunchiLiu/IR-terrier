	<brief_summary>This 3 arm study will assess the efficacy of taspoglutide on glycemic control (as assessed by HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin plus pioglitazone, compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. Patients will be randomized to one of 3 treatment arms: taspoglutide 10mg once weekly, taspoglutide 20 mg once weekly (after 4 weeks of taspoglutide 10 mg once weekly) or placebo, in addition to their continued stable metformin plus pioglitazone treatment. After the first 24 weeks patients on placebo will be switched to taspoglutide 10mg once weekly or taspoglutide 20mg once weekly (after 4 weeks of taspoglutide 10mg once weekly. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
