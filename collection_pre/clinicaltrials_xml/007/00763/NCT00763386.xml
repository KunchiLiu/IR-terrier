	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test for significant differences in functional outcomes obtained by using a NexGen LPS versus a NexGen LPS-Flex knee implant. Specifically, it is predicted that an increase in postoperative range of motion will be experienced by patients treated with the NexGen LPS-Flex knee implant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare the NexGen LPS and LPS-Flex Knee Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the clinical results of the NexGen LPS femoral component with the higher flexion potential of the NexGen LPS-Flex femoral component in all patients with degenerative joint disease that require total knee arthroplasty. The primary variable of interest is postoperative range of motion achieved with the two devices, which are implanted with slightly different surgical techniques in patients who may also be subjected to different rehabilitation programs depending on the device they are assigned.</detailed_description>
