	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to compare ocular movements abnormalities between males with pre-mutation on FRM1 gene (symptomatic or asymptomatic on the motor plan and/or on the cognitive plan), males without the pre-mutation and males with multi-systematized atrophy, in order to identify the neuronal structures implicated in this pathology.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient will be followed at the Nantes hospital during half a day for : - examination of ocular movements - performing Neuro-psychological test (MATTIS) - performing tests with scales of motricity (UPDRS, CRST, ICARS).</detailed_description>
