	<brief_title>Self-Management to Prevent Ulcers in Veterans With SCI (Spinal Cord Injury)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Pressure ulcers (PrUs) are the most frequent significant medical complication after spinal cord injury (SCI). PrU prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates are high, and most persons with SCI will have at least one serious PrU during their lifetime. VA costs of treating the almost 3,500 unique Veterans with SCI and a severe ulcer at an SCI Center in 2010 was just under $400 million. Objectives: The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to determine whether a multi-component self-management (SM) intervention increases the use of skin-protective behaviors and reduces skin worsening in Veterans with SCI, compared to an education control (ED) intervention. Secondary outcomes included PrU knowledge, self-management skills, communication with providers, self-efficacy, community integration and days on bedrest. Another objective was to conduct focus group interviews with patients and providers and to analyze transcripts of SM group sessions to determine barriers and facilitators with regard to spinal cord injury and pressure ulcer prevention. Methods: This was a multi-site efficacy intervention study with a single blind prospective randomized design. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and key variables. Supplemental focus group interviews were conducted with patients with SCI (n=35) and SCI providers (n=39). Focus group interviews and SM group calls were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative techniques. Study participants included Veterans hospitalized for Stage III/IV PrUs at or below the level of injury, from six VA SCI Centers around the country (Long Beach, Houston, Milwaukee, Augusta, Hines and St. Louis). Prior to discharge, PrU risk factors were identified and 1:1 PrU education was provided. Randomization and the behavioral interventions began at discharge. The number of randomized subjects were 72 in the ED group and 72 in the SM group (n=144). The analytic sample included subjects with complete data (n=92). The intervention included 8 site coordinator-initiated calls using didactic (ED) or Motivational Interviewing (MI) strategies to address PrU risk factors. The second component included telephone group calls that included either didactic information about SCI or SM skills including: 1) knowledge about the medical condition; 2) self-monitoring; 3) problem-solving skills; 4) skill for managing the effects of the condition; 5) adherence to necessary health behaviors; and 6) self-advocacy with health care providers. ED subjects received general health information and were not instructed in any specific problem solving, self-monitoring or SM techniques. The ED intervention was comparable to the SM with respect to natural history/ time, dosing, measurement processes, attention, therapeutic alliance, social support, and in receiving a manualized treatment with specific therapist procedures. Self-reported outcome data were obtained by phone at 3 and 6 months, and from mailed photos of study ulcers. Status: Study is complete. Additional analyses are ongoing and future manuscripts are planned.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>over 18 years of age, SCI of at least six month's duration, hospitalized for a Stage III or IV PrU, cognitively intact, available for telephone followup, and discharged to a community setting or able to direct own care. We excluded patients with a terminal diagnosis, severe psychiatric comorbidities (eg, current psychosis), cognitive impairments that limited their ability to consent or participate, severe hearing loss, and wounds not expected to heal. People discharged to nursing homes unable to direct their own care were also excluded.</criteria>
