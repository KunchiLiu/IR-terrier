	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing two treatments for patients with comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) conducted within two different routine clinical settings for the treatment of SUD, namely (a) a day-care and inpatient setting and (b) an outpatient setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to either (1) a combination of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for SUD and trauma-focused structured writing therapy, or (2) CBT for SUD alone. Randomization will take place separately for each setting. It is expected that the combined treatment is significantly more effective in reducing symptoms of SUD as well as PTSD than CBT for SUD alone. Outcome measures will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment as well as 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up.</brief_summary>
