	<brief_title>A Phase I Study to Assess Novel Cream in a Psoriasis Plaque Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be performed in 12 male subjects with stable psoriatic plaques. The study preparations and the comparator will be tested observer-blind. Treatments will be randomly assigned to the test fields. All subjects will receive all treatments, with intraindividual comparison of the treatments. Altogether six test fields will be examined per subject (four active AN2728 creams of different concentrations: 2 %, 1 %, 0.3 %, 0.03 %, the active ingredient-free vehicle, and a marketed corticoid preparation). The test fields will be treated occlusively over a study period of 12 days. Topical application of approximately 200 uL of each assigned intervention is administered per treatment, for a total of 10 treatments over a 12-day treatment period.</detailed_description>
