	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to understand why different people respond differently to the medication Persantine. The effects of Persantine will be evaluated by performing echocardiograms, blood tests and by measuring the flow of blood in the arteries of the heart in patients undergoing a clinically indicated percutaneous coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persantine: Variation in Response Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will receive three doses of Persantine intravenously for the research study. Before and after receiving the Persantine doses, patients will have an echocardiogram and coronary artery blood flow will be measured. Blood tests,measure the function of the adenosine transporter. In addition variations in the gene for the adenosine transporter will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
