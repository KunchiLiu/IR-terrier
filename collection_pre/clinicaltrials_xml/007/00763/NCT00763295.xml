	<brief_summary>HIV infection highly increases the risk of progression of latent tuberculosis (TB) to active disease that therapy is recommended for all PPD-positive, HIV-infected patients, regardless of age. Sensitivity of the PPD testing is, however, dependent on a normal T cell function. Therefore, an accurate and reliable method for detection of latent tuberculosis in patients with HIV is urgently needed. This prospective study will examine the utility of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) based assay, T-SPOT.TB,for detection of TB in HIV-infected individuals.</brief_summary>
