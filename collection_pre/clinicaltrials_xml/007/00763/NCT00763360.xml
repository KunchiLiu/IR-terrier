	<criteria>Patients able to understand and sign a document of informed consent; Patients aged ≥49 years with agerelated cataract formation; Patients planning to undergo surgical removal of cataract by phacoemulsification with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens; Patients that have healthy eyes excluding the formation of cataract. pseudoexfoliation syndrome with glaucoma or zonular compromise in the operative eye; A congenital ocular anomaly (e.g., aniridia, congenital cataract) in the operative eye; Iris atrophy in the operative eye; Glaucoma (including pseudoexfoliation or pigmentary) or any causes of compromised outflow in the operative eye; Any abnormality which prevents reliable Goldmann applanation tonometry in the operative eye; Ocular hypertension (lntraocular Pressure (IOP) &gt; 21 mmHg) in the operative eye at the baseline exam; Corneal abnormality that results in a poor endothelial cell photograph and prevents reliable endothelial cell density measurement; Baseline endothelial cell density &lt; 1500 cells/mm2, in the operative eye; Planned multiple procedures during cataract/Intraocular Lens (IOL) implantation surgery (e.g., trabeculoplasty, corneal transplant). NOTE: A minor relaxing keratotomy Patients 48 years of age or younger; Proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the operative eye; Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus; Marfan's Syndrome; An ocular disease and/or condition that may compromise results; A history of chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease (e.g. iritis, scleritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis, rubeosis iritis) in the operative eye; Lens for the correction of astigmatism may be performed; Previous ocular trauma to the operative eye (this includes previous intraocular surgery and traumatic cataract). NOTE: history of noninvasive laser surgery (with the exception of laser treatment for PDR) is acceptable for inclusion; A nonfunctional fellow eye; Participation in any other clinical study within the 30 days before surgery</criteria>
