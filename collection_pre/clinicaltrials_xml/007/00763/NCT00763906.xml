	<brief_summary>The weaning rate of vasopressors drugs is usually chosen empirically by the clinician in critically patients. The investigators applied fuzzy logic principles to modify intravenous norepinephrine infusion rates during norepinephrine infusion in septic patients in order to reduce the duration of shock. The investigators goal was to reduce the duration of poorly controlled hemodynamic status.</brief_summary>
