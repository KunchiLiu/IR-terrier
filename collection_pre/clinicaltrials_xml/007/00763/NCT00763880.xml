	<brief_summary>The purpose of our study is to determine if the use of a hematoma block together with intravenous sedation and analgesia is an effective means of managing forearm fractures in the Emergency Department. To determine this, we have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of hematoma block versus saline for the manipulation of forearm fractures under conscious sedation with ketamine and midazolam. Our hypotheses are two-fold: First, the use of a hematoma block together with conscious sedation will allow for improved pain control. Second, the use of a hematoma block together with conscious sedation will allow us to use less sedation, therefore promoting faster recovery from sedation and more efficient patient turnover in the Emergency Department.</brief_summary>
