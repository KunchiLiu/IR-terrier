	<brief_summary>This project aims to validate a predictive model of diabetic retinopathy progression to clinically significant macular edema (CSME) needing photocoagulation and/or vision loss. The Coimbra Predictive Model (CPM), based on retinal thickness, microaneurysms number, HbA1C and LDL levels, established on a set of 52 diabetic patients, will be tested on a population of 400 patients/eyes to be enrolled into the study. These patients will perform 2 visits at 6-month interval (V0 and V6) to classify each patient into one of the 3 previously established phenotypes. Two years after (V24) patients will be reexamined. The occurrence of end-points, achieved by the patients, are expected to validate our predictive model.</brief_summary>
