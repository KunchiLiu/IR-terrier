	<detailed_description>This study sought to enroll opioid dependent women under supervision in the criminal justice system and in a controlled environment (substance abuse treatment)but at at high risk for opioid relapse and engaging in HIV risk behaviors when returning to the community. Initially, 9 women were enrolled and received buprenorphine medication. After the first 9 participants, women were randomized to either buprenorphine or placebo. Women received the buprenorphine medication for 12 weeks in the community and at the end of the 12 weeks were transitioned either to another buprenorphine provider, methadone provider, or tapered off buprenorphine based on the participant's preferences. One additional follow-up at 3 months after treatment was conducted. The primary outcome was opioid positive urines at all time points.</detailed_description>
