	<brief_summary>Dipyrone is suggested to inhibit the platelet aggregation comparable to th effect of traditional analgetic substances like Ibuprofen. To verify this hypothesis the investigators conducted the study in comparing patients undergoing traumatologic, visceral or plastic surgical procedures. The investigators randomized them to four groups receiving common analgetic doses of either dipyrone, acetaminophen (paracetamol) or valdecoxib/parecoxib. The investigators took blood samples before initiation of the study drug, 1h, 4hs and 24hs after first intake. The investigators compared the aggregation via aggregometry of platelet rich plasma.</brief_summary>
