	<brief_title>Safety Study of an Antipsychotic, Sertindole, to Treat Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is a disabling and often chronic disorder that may require long-term treatment. This protocol is an extension study of a randomised study comparing the safety of Sertindole versus Risperidone. Patients who were randomised to Sertindole and who completed the previous study have the possibility to receive continued Sertindole treatment in this open one-arm study. Sertindole is generally well tolerated and is approved in the EU, but not yet marketed in France. The follow-up of the patients will be similar to that in the previous study and requires quarterly visits. Patient management reflects routine clinical practice in accordance with the Sertindole label. Any severe safety issue is reported to the company.</detailed_description>
