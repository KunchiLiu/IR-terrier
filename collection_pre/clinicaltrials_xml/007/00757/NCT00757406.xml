	<brief_title>Assessment of Unilateral Lymphoedema of the Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When Lymphoedema is present, lymph and other fluids build up in the interstitial spaces of the tissues. This results in an overall increase in the total amount of extracellular fluid (ECF) in the limb, causing swelling. This can be documented by measuring the impedance (opposition) to a low frequency current that has been passed into the limb. Low frequency current travels predominantly through the ECF, where the Lymphoedema manifests. As the fluid builds up in the limb, the impedance to the current decreases and it is in this way that low frequency bioimpedance is able to assess Lymphoedema. Multi-frequency bio-impedance analysis otherwise known as Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) has been reported to be effective for the measurement of ECF and sub clinical changes in ECF to predict the onset of Lymphoedema in the arms in studies conducted by Cornish et al. It has been reported by Warren et al that BIS can be used as a reliable and accurate tool for documenting presence of lymphoedema in patients with wither upper- or lower-extremity swelling. The L-Dex U400 device uses an "impedance ratio" methodology to assess unilateral Lymphoedema of the arm. By this method the unaffected arm acts as an internal and subject specific control. The strategy of this study is to show that the L-Dex U400 can use this methodology to assess unilateral leg Lymphoedema.</detailed_description>
