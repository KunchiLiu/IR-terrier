	<brief_summary>Studies demonstrate that sleep disturbances are associated with cognitive dysfunction and attention deficit. However the correlation between the severity of obstructive sleep apnea and the degree of cognitive dysfunction was not demonstrated. Our hypothesis is that patients suffering from a more severe sleep apnea will demonstrate a greater degree of cognitive dysfunction.</brief_summary>
