	<brief_summary>A crossover, randomized, single-masked study which compares the short-term (3 months) 24-hour IOP control and safety of travoprost/timolol fixed combination given once in the evening, versus that of latanoprost/timolol fixed combination given once in the evening in patients with exfoliative glaucoma. The primary objective of this trial is to compare the quality of 24-hour IOP control after 3 months of chronic therapy with these two medications.</brief_summary>
