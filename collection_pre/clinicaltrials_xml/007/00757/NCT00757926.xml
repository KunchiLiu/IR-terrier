	<brief_summary>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, staged dosage escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 3-dose series of Live Attenuated Tetravalent (G1-G4) Bovine-Human Reassortant Rotavirus Vaccine [BRV-TV] administered to healthy Indian infants concurrently with other standard EPI vaccines would be undertaken to evaluate the study hypothesis that a 3-dose series of BRV-TV (containing the VP7 serotypes G1, G2, G3, and G4) administered orally to healthy Indian infants at 6-8, 10-12, and 14-16 weeks of age concurrently with other standard EPI vaccines would be generally well tolerated and immunogenic.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy infants 68 weeks of age of either sex; Born after a gestational period of 3642 weeks with birth weight &gt;2 kg; Father, mother or other legally acceptable representative (guardian) properly informed about the study and having signed the informed consent form (ICF); Parent or guardian available for the entire period of the study and reachable by study staff for postvaccination followup. History of congenital abdominal disorders, intussusception, or abdominal surgery; Known or suspected impairment of immunological function; Known hypersensitivity to any component of the rotavirus vaccine; Prior receipt of any rotavirus vaccine; Fever, with an oral temperature ≥38.1oC (≥100.5oF); presumably measured by study staff? History of known rotavirus disease, chronic diarrhea, or failure to thrive; Baseline level of ALT or AST &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal; Clinical evidence of active gastrointestinal illness (infants with GERD can participate in the study so long as this condition is well controlled with or without medication); Receipt of any IM, oral, or IV corticosteroid treatment (infants on inhaled steroids may be permitted to participate in the study); Infants residing in a household with an immunocompromised person (e.g., individuals with a congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, organ or bone marrow transplantation, or those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy including longterm systemic corticosteroids); Infants testing positive for HBV, HCV, or HIV infection; Prior receipt of a blood transfusion or blood products, including immunoglobulins; Any infants who can not be adequately followed for safety by telephone and/or a home visit; Any conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.</criteria>
