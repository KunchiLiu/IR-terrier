	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to explore the maintained efficacy, tolerability, and safety of flexibly dosed paliperidone extended-release (ER) in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) previously unsuccessfully treated with other oral atypical antipsychotic medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy, Safety And Tolerability Study of Flexibly Dosed Paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) in Participants With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized (the study drug is not assigned by chance), single arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), 24-week study. Participants can be transitioned to an effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral antipsychotic medication without the need for titration due to lack of efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance or other reason. A transition period of maximum 4 weeks will be allowed. Throughout the study, participants will receive flexible dose of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) of paliperidone once daily orally for 24 weeks. Dose adjustment will be done as per Investigator's discretion based upon participant's clinical response to and tolerability of the study drug. Assessments of efficacy will be performed at screening and after 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by means of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will also be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
