	<brief_summary>Lavage fluid (BAL) is inserted into a lung lobe using a flexible bronchoscope. The fluid is aspirated out to remove any remaining TI. It's performed twice at specific time points in 12 healthy volunteers. BAL fluid will be analyzed for insulin and FDKP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Determine How Long Insulin and FDKP (the Molecule That Forms Technosphere Particles) Stays in the Lungs of Healthy Individuals After Inhalation of TechnosphereÂ® Insulin (TI) Powder Using Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Informed consent and eligibility occur at Screening. Dosing is at Visit 2. Blood glucose levels are monitored and adjusted using IV infusion of glucose. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed at 30 minutes and 6 hours for Cohort 1 and at 4 and 8 hours for Cohort 2, post TI dose. A series of blood samples are taken at specified timepoints. Cohort 3 will proceed with dosing if deemed necessary once analysis of BAL from Cohorts 1 &amp; 2 is performed. Visit 3 is the follow-up safety visit.</detailed_description>
