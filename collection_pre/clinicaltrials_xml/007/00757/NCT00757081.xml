	<brief_summary>The combination of phosphatidylcholine (PPC) and deoxycholate (DC) injected into subcutaneous fat is often popularly referred to as "Lipodissolve" therapy. Despite its attractiveness as an easy and noninvasive cosmetic treatment, the safety, effectiveness, and how the injections might work remain unclear. This study will investigate the hypothesis that injections of PPC/DC will reduce the amount body fat in the treated area. If so, the mechanisms responsible for the fat loss will be explored to find out whether fat cells die from toxic effects or are broken apart by the PPC/DC. Patients will receive at least 2 (no more than 4) treatments with PPC/DC injections every 2 months. Several methods of measuring fat loss will be used in the study, including photography and measurement of patients, tissue biopsy, blood tests, and MRI. The study will also record side effects of the treatments as well as patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
