	<brief_summary>Emphysema, a common type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a long-term lung disease that is usually caused by cigarette smoking. This study will examine both current smokers and former smokers who have emphysema, as well as current and former smokers who do not have emphysema, to determine if certain factors found in the blood are related to the risk of developing emphysema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers and Genetic Factors Related to Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD is a disease in which the lung is damaged and breathing passages become partly obstructed, making it difficult to breathe. Millions of people in the United States have COPD, and it is the fourth leading cause of death in the country. Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness of breath and wheezing. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are illnesses associated with COPD. Emphysema is usually the result of many years of cigarette smoking, but it remains unknown exactly how cigarette smoking causes emphysema. The purpose of this study is to examine current and former smokers who have emphysema and those who do not have emphysema to determine if certain biomarkers or genetic factors are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. Specifically, study researchers will examine various genes and two proteins, membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), to determine the role they play in the development of emphysema. Participants will attend one study visit, which will include a medical history review, a blood collection, lung function testing, a 6-minute walk test, and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. A portion of blood will be stored for current and future genetic research. Participants will also complete questionnaires to collect information on activities, health, and quality of life. Some participants will be invited to return for a bronchoscopy, which is a procedure that allows a doctor to sample the inside of the lungs. Study researchers will contact all participants at the end of the study to collect follow-up medical information.</detailed_description>
