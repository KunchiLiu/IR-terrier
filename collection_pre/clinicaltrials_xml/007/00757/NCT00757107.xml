	<brief_summary>This evaluation is conducted to evaluate the safety and performance of two different stem lengths of the Taperloc Total Hip System. Per implant bone loss and migration of the stem are compared between the two groups with Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and radiostereomektric analysis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taperloc Versus Taplerloc Microplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients between 50 - 70 years diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the hip and eligible for total hip arthroplasty will be asked to participate in the study. Periprosthetic bone loss, migration of the components and clinical scores will be recorded prospectively at 3,6,12 and 24 months.</detailed_description>
