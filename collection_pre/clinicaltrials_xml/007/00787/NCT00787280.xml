	<brief_summary>To evaluate whether changes in macronutrient consumption (i.e., switching to a diet low in carbohydrates) can change brain responses to cues depicting foods representing that macronutrient. In addition to answering specific questions regarding the effects of an LCKD, the study will provide general information about relations between brain responses to food cues and a broad arrive of factors including typical diet, food preferences, weight control history and genes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet, Imaging and Energy Balance Trial (DIET)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a parallel arm randomized clinical trial of two diets—a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and a low fat diet (LFD). Following screening, eligible participants will undergo a six week dietary intervention that will include 7 clinic visits at the Duke Lifestyle Medicine Clinic (Director: Dr. Westman). In addition to the dietary intervention, participants will undergo fMRI scanning on two occasions: once in the week prior to randomization to a diet (Baseline Scan) and after three weeks of following a diet (Post-Diet Scan). During scanning participants will view food cues in order to assess the effects of diet on brain responses to different macronutrient content categories (e.g., High vs. Low Complex Carbohydrate). In addition to scanning measures, we will also record information regarding dietary intake, food preferences, weight, mood, and diet adherence.</detailed_description>
