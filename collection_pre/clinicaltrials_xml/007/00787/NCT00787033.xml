	<brief_summary>Phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics trial of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor PF-04554878 in patients with advanced non-hematologic malignancies, including patients with malignancies appropriate for serial biopsy. Screening consists of medical history, physical examination ECOG performance status, blood draws, a pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential, a FDG-PET and tumor imaging. Treatment consists of PF-04554878 pills continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request. Evaluations for bioactivity are measured by serial FDG-PET and blood tests for biomarkers related to FAK and Pyk2 activities.</brief_summary>
