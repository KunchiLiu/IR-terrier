	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well giving sunitinib malate together with capecitabine works in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic liver cancer. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sunitinib malate together with capecitabine may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sunitinib and capecitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall survival, response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RESIST) criteria, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) response, survival at one year, and safety and tolerability. OUTLINE: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence or disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
