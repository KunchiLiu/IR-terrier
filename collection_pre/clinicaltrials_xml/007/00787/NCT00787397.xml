	<detailed_description>This study is one of two interlinking protocols developed to investigate neural, affective, behavioral and social predictors of improvement as a critical next step in advancing the understanding of processes involved in the treatment response of anxiety disorders in youth. This protocol will offer a six to eight session sleep intervention (Sleeping Tigers)children ages 9-13 who currently have a DSM-IV anxiety disorder and who endorse some level of impairment in their ability to sleep. Participants will have completed a 16 session intervention for anxiety (IRB submission, Child Anxiety Treatment Study CATS). We hope to assess whether improving sleep will further enhance affective, clinical, and social functioning.</detailed_description>
