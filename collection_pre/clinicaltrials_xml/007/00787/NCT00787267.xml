	<brief_summary>On this study patients will receive dasatinib, a targeted therapy, for advanced NSCLC that has progressed after previous therapy. Safety and response to dasatinib will be assessed. Fresh frozen tumor tissue must be available for genomics analysis prior to initiating dasatinib therapy. A biopsy must be obtained after any prior chemotherapy. If fresh frozen tumor tissue is not available, a biopsy will be required to participate in this trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Dasatinib in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Twenty to seventy-five percent of patients initially treated with surgery or radiotherapy recur and become candidates for systemic therapy. Src expression has been identified in a majority of NSCLC cell lines and may be important in hypoxic growth and angiogenesis of NSCLC. This phase II trial will investigate the activity of the oral Src inhibitor dasatinib in advanced stage NSCLC. We hypothesize that the inhibition of Src pathway with dasatinib will show anti-tumor activity in advanced NSCLC, with a tolerable safety profile. Fresh frozen tissue is needed for the genomics analysis, thus a biopsy will be required to participate in this trial. The genomic analysis will determine if the tumor is Src-active or Src-inactive and responses to dasatinib compared. In stage I, 40 patients will be treated without prior knowledge of their tumoral Src-activity. If all stage I responses are observed in the Src-active patients, the second stage will only accrue that cohort. If all responses are observed in the Src-inactive cohort, the activity of dasatinib and genomic determination of dasatinib response will be re-evaluated. Otherwise, if during Stage I, responses are observed in both cohorts, they will be accrued separately and evaluated in a two-stage manner. Dasatinib will be give orally twice daily and continue until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Imaging studies will be done pre-treatment then every 6 weeks to assess radiologic response to therapy. Patients will be followed for 30 days after the last dose of dasatinib to assess toxicity.</detailed_description>
