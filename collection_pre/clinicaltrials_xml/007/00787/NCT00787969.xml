	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given together with cladribine and rituximab and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving temsirolimus together with cladribine and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of rituximab, cladribine, and temsirolimus for newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temsirolimus combined with a fixed dose and schedule of rituximab and cladribine. (Phase I) III. To assess the efficacy of the combination of rituximab, cladribine, and temsirolimus for newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma with the proportion of complete responses as the primary endpoint. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess other measures of efficacy of the regimen including progression free survival, duration of response, and overall survival. II. To assess the toxicity profile of the combination of rituximab, cladribine, and temsirolimus. III. To assess efficacy using traditional lymphoma parameters and absolute lymphocyte count. IV. To assess metabolic markers (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia) as markers of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition using the glucose and lipid measurements being performed in the clinical laboratory as part of routine care. V. To correlate response with serum free light chains, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in host immune genes, vitamin D metabolites, and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway member expression. VI. As part of ongoing research for North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) lymphoma studies, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides and blood products will be banked for future studies. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus followed by a phase II study. Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Patients then receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 6-15 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 4 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
