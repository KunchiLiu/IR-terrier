	<brief_summary>The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown, and whether or not COPD is adequately diagnosed and treated in these patients has not been investigated before. We hypothesized that the prevalence of COPD would be significantly higher (30%) in patients with CVD than in the general population. Besides, we anticipated that COPD, a potentially treatable CV risk factor, would be undiagnosed in more than 80% of CVD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COPD and Cardiovascular Risk in the Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim to compare clinical and spirometric data in three groups of individuals. Two of them are participants in an ongoing population-based study (CORSAIB) aimed at investigating the distribution of CVD risk factors in the general population of the Balearic Islands, Spain. The design and full methodological details of the CORSAIB study have been published elsewhere (Rigo F, et al. Rev Clin Espa 2005). A third group will include patients with stable CVD regularly visited at the referral hospital of our community. Inclusion criteria for the study are male and female individuals, aged 40 to 81 years, residents of the Balearic Islands, and who are willing to participate in this research.</detailed_description>
