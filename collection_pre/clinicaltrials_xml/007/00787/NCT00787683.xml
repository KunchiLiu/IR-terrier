	<brief_title>Home-Monitoring in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) are an important and effective treatment in patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. In order to allow for a more continuous follow-up and reduced complication rates of patients with ICD, new devices including remote-monitoring (home-monitoring) features of patients with ICD have been developed. BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring service enables the doctors to safely follow up their patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators in a remote fashion, with fewer in-clinic consultations. This may result in a more efficient follow-up and cost-savings for the health care payer. The objective of the current study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of home-monitoring compared to standard care.</detailed_description>
