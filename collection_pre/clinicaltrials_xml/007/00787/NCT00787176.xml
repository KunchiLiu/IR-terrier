	<brief_summary>Fetal heart rate patterns are an important parameter in the diagnosis of non-reassuring fetal status. Combined-spinal epidural analgesia is a method of initiating labor analgesia used by approximately 90% of the parturients at Prentice Women's Hospital. Optimizing the variables which could affect fetal heart rate patterns at the time of initiation of analgesia, such as fluid administration and oxytocin management, could help us provide better care for our patients and their fetuses. Hypotheses: The combination of fluid administration and lower doses of oxytocin administration will have fewer adverse fetal heart rate changes in the first 60 minutes following initiation of labor analgesia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining informed, written consent, candidates were randomized to one of four groups at the time of request for labor analgesia. All subjects received a maintenance infusion of Lactated Ringers(LR). For candidates in Groups A or B, an intravenous bolus of 1000 mL of LR was initiated. Candidates in Groups C and D did not receive any additional fluid. If randomized to group A or C, the oxytocin management was continued as per the normal active management of labor protocal (AMOL). If randomized to groups B or D, the dose of oxytocin that was being administered was halved and not increased until 60 minutes after the initiation of epidural analgesia. Fetal heart rate monitoring and frequency of uterine contractions were recorded by external tocodynamometry.</detailed_description>
