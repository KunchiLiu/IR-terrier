	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a community health worker intervention at helping to control diabetes among Latinos with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: Compared to those in Enhanced usual care group, patients randomized to the intervention will, at 12 months, have greater reductions in: (1) HgA1C; (2) low density lipoprotein (LDL); and (3) systolic and diastolic BP.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this project is to examine the effectiveness of a community health worker (CHW) intervention at addressing glycemic control among Latinos with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. Our group has worked with a promising model of intervention that utilizes CHW's based at one of our major community partners. Pilot data from this program has shown clinically significant prepost test improvements in HgA1C. Using the Chronic Care Model as an overarching framework, the study design of NOCHOP is a randomized controlled trial of 360 Latinos, mostly of Caribbean descent, aged 35-70 years with HgA1C &gt;=8.0. At a minimum, subjects in the intervention group will receive four home visits, ten group level visits and monthly phone calls by CHWs based at Alianza. The control groups will receive three separate mailings of bilingual diabetes health education materials. The primary outcome is glycemic control at 12month follow up, as measured by HgA1c. The secondary outcomes are changes in cholesterol and blood pressure (BP). We will also collect exploratory data on potential mechanisms through which our intervention resulted in hypothesized improvements including medication adherence, medication Intensification, diet and exercise. If successful, our project will make an important contribution to ongoing national and local debates about the sustainability of CHW programs. In particular, data from this study would be extremely useful for local Medicaid managed care plans who have expressed strong interests in data from rigorously designed clinical trials addressing the role of CHWs in delivering culturally appropriate and effective diabetes care.</detailed_description>
