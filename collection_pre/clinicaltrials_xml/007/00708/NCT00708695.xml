	<brief_summary>This study is a longitudinal follow-up of 670 primarily African-American women and their 17-year-old firstborn children enrolled since 1990 in a highly significant randomized controlled trial (RCT) of prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses. Nurses in this program are charged with improving pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and maternal economic self-sufficiency. This follow-up examines whether earlier program effects on maternal and child functioning lead to less violent antisocial behavior, psychopathology, substance use and use-disorders, and risk for HIV; whether these effects are greater for those at both genetic and environmental risk; and whether program effects replicate those found with whites in an earlier trial.</brief_summary>
