	<mesh_term>Cataract</mesh_term>
	<criteria>The patient is in good general and ocular health, having a visionreducing cataract in the intended operative eye The patient is willing and able to complete all required postoperative visits. The patient is willing to sign a statement of informed consent. Preoperative The patient is under the age of 18 The patient has had prior intraocular surgery in the operative eye. The patient has systemic diseases with ocular manifestations (e.g. diabetes, complications of immune deficiency syndrome), which may contribute to postoperative confounding of data interpretation. The patient's worst seeing eye is 20/70 or worse. The patient has multiple surgical procedures at the time of implant. The patient has chronic use of steroids, immunosuppressive and/or antineoplastic agents. The patient has acute infection, inflammation of the eye. Iris atrophy Proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Chronic, medically uncontrolled glaucoma Chronic uveitis, iritis, iridocyclitis or rubeosis of the lids Rubella, traumatic or congenital/developmental cataract. Severe retinal pathology (e.g. retinal tear, detachment, etc). Operative Patient Exclusion Criteria Capsular rupture Vitreous loss Hyphema Zonular disinsertion Surgical Complications In the event of a complication during surgery, the surgeon should decide whether the stability of the hydrophilic acrylic lens would be compromised by the complication, e.g. in the event of zonular damage of major capsule rupture. If the lens stability would be compromised, the hydrophilic acrylic lens should not be implanted and the surgeon should make arrangements to implant an alternative lens.</criteria>
