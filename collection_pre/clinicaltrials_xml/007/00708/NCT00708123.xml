	<brief_title>In Situ Caries of Fluoride Toothpastes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical fluorides have been proven to be clinically effective in the prevention of dental caries. It is generally agreed that anti-caries effect of fluoride (F) is mainly by decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the rate of enamel remineralization. An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness (SMH) test is widely used to evaluate enamel demineralization and remineralization during the caries process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of toothpaste formulations containing fluoride from different sources [sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium monofluorophosphate (NaMFP)] using an in situ caries model.</detailed_description>

General Health:Good general health with (in the opinion of the investigator) no clinically significant and/or relevant abnormalities of medical history or oral examination that could interfere with subject safety during the study period. 5. Diagnosis: Oral i. Currently living in the Indianapolis area which is a fluoridated community (1 ppm F). ii. Currently wearing a removable mandibular partial denture with sufficient room in the posterior buccal flange area to accommodate two enamel specimens (required dimensions 12 x 7 millimeters (mm). iii. Willing and capable of wearing their removable partial dentures 24 hours per day during each two week treatment period. iv.All restorations in a good state of repair. 6. Salivary Flow:Have a salivary flow rate in the range of normal values (unstimulated whole saliva flow rate = 0.2 ml/minute; gum base stimulated whole saliva flow rate = 0.8 ml/minute). Exclusion Criteria 1. Pregnancy:Women who are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. No pregnancy test will be required. 2. Breastfeeding:Women who are breastfeeding. 3. Allergy/Intolerance: Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. 4. Clinical Study/Experimental Medication:Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the first treatment visit, with the exception of study T3157495 where the wash in period prior to treatment is sufficient. 5. Antibiotics:Currently taking antibiotics or have taken antibiotics in the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit. 6. Fluoride:Taking fluoride supplements for medical reasons. 7. Dental Health: Current active caries or periodontal disease that may compromise the study or health of the subjects. 8. Personnel: a) A member of the site study staff, b) An employee of the sponsor, c) Any employee of any toothpaste manufacturer or their spouse or family member.</criteria>
