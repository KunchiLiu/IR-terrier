	<brief_title>Comparison of the Efficacy for Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis Between the Patients Received Lansoprazole OD and Control Group Weaning From Mechanical Ventilator in Respiratory Care Center: a Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although stress ulcer is a complication that can cause mortality and morbidity in critical patients, there is still lack of consensus about its prophylaxis. There is also few data available from Taiwan. H2 blockers are commonly used due to convenience. Some prefer sucralfate (a mucosal protective agent) for the sake of less associated nosocomial pneumonia. Recently, proton pump inhibitors were shown to have good prophylactic effects for stress ulcer. Lansoprazole has good acid suppression effect and the tablets are soluble for the use of tube feeding. There was no data about the prophylaxis of stress ulcer development during the program of weaning from the mechanical ventilators. Therefore, we conduct a study of the comparison of lansoprazole administered nasogastrically and control group for stress ulcer prophylaxis in respiratory intensive care unit.</detailed_description>
