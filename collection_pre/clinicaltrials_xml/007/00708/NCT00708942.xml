	<brief_title>Hexaminolevulinate (HAL) Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1) is caused by persistent HPV infection and may worse case develop into cancer. In most cases both the virus infection and lesions (CIN1) regress spontaneously, but must be followed up with gynecological examinations to ensure normalization. If further persistent disease and worsening to precancerous lesions (CIN2-3), the usual treatment is surgery, where one removes the tissue in the cervix where the CIN lesions are. In this research study we will evaluate a new non-surgical treatment for CIN1 using hexaminolevulinate (HAL) photodynamic therapy (PDT). HAL PDT is the combination of a medication and a specific type of light to activate the drug. HAL PDT selectively removes CIN lesions while preserving normal tissue, thus this may be an alternative to frequent gynecological consultations and local surgery that may have undesirable side effects.</detailed_description>
