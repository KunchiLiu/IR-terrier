	<brief_title>NB-UVB Phototherapy With and Without Topical LCD Treatment: a Bilateral Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of coal tar with narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) light (the Goeckermen regimen) is an effective treatment for plaque psoriasis that has become impractical in outpatient care mainly due to the inconvenience and aesthetic concerns of coal tar. This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and convenience of adding a novel liquor carbonis distillate (LCD) (coal tar) solution to standard NB_UVB phototherapy in adults with chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients will apply LCD solution to half the body, twice daily at home and receive outpatient full-body NB-UVB light therapy 3 times a week for up to 12 weeks. A blinded investigator will grade psoriasis severity of body halves and bilateral target lesions and monitor adverse reactions. Patients will rate their psoriasis symptoms and LCD solution aesthetics. Incorporating an at-home regimen with a novel LCD solution into outpatient NB-UVB light therapy is safe, convenient, and effective and can improve psoriasis more quickly than NB-UVB light therapy alone.</detailed_description>
