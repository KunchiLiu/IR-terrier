	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study including acute ischemic stroke patients aged 18 to 90. Multidetector raw CT is performed in acute ischemic stroke patients. Heart, neck vessels and brain arteries are studied during the same acquisition. Results are compared with the standard methods including transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), Doppler ultrasound (DUS) and MR angiography (MRA) of neck vessels. The main criteria is the ability of CT to classify the stroke etiology correctly according to the TOAST classification in comparison with the standard methods.</brief_summary>
