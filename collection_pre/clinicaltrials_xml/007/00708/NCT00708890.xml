	<brief_summary>The Twelve Step groups are the most available and widespread self-help groups for patients with alcohol or drug related disorders. In a public health perspective, self-help groups (SHGs) may be considered as a supplement to professional treatment and provide aftercare soon as professional treatment has ended. There is a need to investigate if U.S. findings and procedures concerning referrals from the health services to Twelve Step Groups (TSGs) can be replicated and accommodated to a cultural setting which is unfamiliar with these groups. There is also a particular need in the Norwegian treatment system to develop alternative treatment strategies for patients undergoing detoxification to improve their chances of long-term recovery, due to deficient formal follow-up alternatives. We plan to carry out a RCT-study. One hundred and sixty patients entering a detoxification treatment center (Addiction Unit, SÃ¸rlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, Norway) will be assigned to two different groups: One given standard information about TSGs (brief advice) and one given intensive referral (motivational sessions and contact with TSG volunteers). A follow up assessment is planned at 6 months to determine whether intensive referral results in more TSG attendance, and if this mediates less substance use and better functioning outcomes. This study introduces a new concept in the Norwegian health care system and relies on a systematic cooperation with user organizations (SHGs) and user volunteers. Thus the study focuses strongly on user resources.</brief_summary>
