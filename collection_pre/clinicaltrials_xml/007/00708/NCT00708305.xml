	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of different sodium fluoride (NaF) containing toothpastes in prevention of dental caries. Change from baseline fluoride data at various time points up to four hours after a single brushing with NaF containing toothpastes will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Plaque Fluid Fluoride Retention From Fluoride Toothpastes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical fluorides in a wide variety of delivery systems have been proven to be clinically effective in the prevention of dental caries. It is generally agreed that fluoride has its anti-caries effect mainly by decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the rate of enamel remineralization. There is a general consensus that level of fluoride in plaque fluid, may be directly related to the anti caries effects of fluoride. Also, fluoride levels in the oral fluids decrease rapidly after topical fluoride application, mainly due to the diluting and washing effect of saliva followed by periodic swallowing. To evaluate fluoride content, plaque samples will be collected from the interproximal surfaces of the posterior teeth of participants using a standardized approach. Plaque fluid fluoride will be calculated using a micro analytical method and in comparison to a standard fluoride curve constructed on the same day of the analysis.</detailed_description>

Participants natural teeth must have at least one surface free of restoration in each interproximal embrasure. d) Produce at least 6mg of plaque at Screening Visit 2. 1. Pregnancy:Women who are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. No pregnancy test will be required. 2. Breastfeeding:Women who are breastfeeding. 3. Medical History:Current or relevant history of any serious, severe or unstable physical or psychiatric illness that would make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study or any that increases the risk to the subject. 4. Allergy/Intolerance: Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. 5. Clinical Study/Experimental Medication:Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit 1 at the start of the study with the exception of those participating in GSKCH study Z3170476. 6. Medication: a) Currently taking antibiotics or have taken antibiotics in the two weeks prior to any treatment visit or during the study. b) Has a medical condition that would require prophylactic antibiotics prior to a dental cleaning. 7. Dental: a) Current active caries or moderate to severe periodontal disease that may compromise the health of the participants or the study. b) Current use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse. 8. Personnel: An employee of the sponsor or the study site who is directly involved in the conduct of the study.</criteria>
