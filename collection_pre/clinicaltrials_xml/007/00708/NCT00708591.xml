	<criteria>Histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective. Patients with hematologic malignancies (lymphoma, multiple myeloma and CLL only) are eligible to participate in the phase Ib portion of the trial only At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (6 weeks if the last regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C). Age &gt;18 years. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 Life expectancy of more than 3 months. Normal organ and marrow function as defined below: Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/µL o WBC ≥ 1,500/µL for patients with hematologic malignancies Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/µL (≥ 1,000/µL for patients with hematologic malignancies) Absolute lymphocyte count ≥1000/µL Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL (≥ 50,000/µL for patients with hematologic malignancies) Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times institutional ULN Serum triglycerides ≤ 500 mg/dl Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Able to understand and the willing to sign a written informed consent document. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Receiving any other investigational agents. Uncontrolled brain metastases or malignancy. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to rapamycin. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Severe immunodeficient state (as judged by the treating physician) Pregnancy (breastfeeding must be discontinued) HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with rapamycin. Concurrent use of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and rifampin, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, rosiglitazone or pioglitazone due to possible interactions with the study drugs. Ketoconazole cannot be taken within 2 hours of an antacid.</criteria>
