	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the effect of providing additional information about possible mild side effects of the yellow fever vaccination on the reporting of physical symptoms. Additionally, the project aims to investigate the relationship between individual characteristics (trait anxiety and perceived sensitivity to medication) and the reporting of physical symptoms, as well as possible interactions between the level of information provided and individual characteristics. We hypothesize that more information about mild symptoms provided to participants will increase the number of reported symptoms after vaccination.</brief_summary>
