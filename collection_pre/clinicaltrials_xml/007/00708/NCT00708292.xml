	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I-Ib/II, open-label, multicenter study of AUY922 administered intravenously in patients with multiple myeloma to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The Phase II part will investigate the efficacy of AUY922 in patients with multiple myeloma. Additionally, the study includes a Phase Ib combination part of AUY922 administered in combination with bortezomib, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination drugs in patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
