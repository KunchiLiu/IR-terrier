	<brief_summary>This was a pilot, phase I, two-period, fasting, bioavailability, safety,and pharmacokinetic study evaluating single dose of i.v. fentanyl (200 µg) and single doses of 2 mL or 3 mL inhaled AeroLEF (500 µg/mL) delivered by nebulization with the AeroEclipse BAN device administered in normal healthy non-smoking subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Inhaled AeroLEF (Liposome-Encapsulated Fentanyl)in Normal Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Period I, subjects received an intravenous dose of fentanyl (200 µg) administered over 1 minute (Treatment A). Subjects then crossed over to Period II. In Period II, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mL (1000 µg fentanyl; Treatment B) or 3mL (1500 µg fentanyl; Treatment C) of AeroLEF delivered by nebulization with the AeroEclipse BAN. Subjects were instructed to continue inhalation of AeroLEF for approximately 1 minute beyond the point of nebulizer sputter to ensure that all aerosolized medication was delivered. There was at least a 1 week washout period between study periods.</detailed_description>
