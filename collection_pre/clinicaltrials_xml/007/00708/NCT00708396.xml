	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate tolerability and efficacy of escitalopram (Cipralex) treatment in doses beyond 20mg (20-40 mg/d) in patients with OCD and schizophrenia, non responsive or partially responsive to recommended doses (evaluation according to Y-BOCS). An open label, prospective study. The study will include 20 patients recruited from the inpatient wards and from the outpatient clinic who have a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and OCD. Before entering the study all patients will be interviewed by 2 senior board certified psychiatrists in order to confirm the diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and OCD according to DSM-IV criteria. After confirming the diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and OCD each patient will be evaluated by PANSS, Y-BOCS and GCI-S scales. Those patients who score above 12 points on the Y-BOCS will be eligible for the study. Rating scales (PANSS, Y-BOCS, CGI-S, CGI-I) will be completed on a weekly basis during the whole 13 weeks period. In addition patients will be asked to report medication side effects and will also be clinically evaluated for side effects by the physician. Special attention will be paid to worsening of psychosis or OC symptoms. All patients whose mental status will deteriorate or those who cannot tolerate the drug will be dropped-out and intent to treat analysis will be made.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients will be men and women over 18 years of age who meet DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder and OCD. Previous to entering the study all patients should be stabilized on antipsychotic medication for at least 3 months. Patients should score above 12 points on Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) (Cut off point of YBOCS total score &gt; or =7 is the common practice in similar studies) (Kayahan et al 2005). All patients who are under antidepressant treatment (including SSRIs and clomipramine). In patients who were on clomipramine or SSRI in the past are included, at least 2 weeks must have been elapsed since stopping the medication. In case the patient has received an antidepressant which is not an SSRI or clomipramine, there will be a washout period of one week before entering the study. If the patient received a MAOinhibitors there will be a washout period of at least 2 weeks except for fluoxetine for which a washout period of 5 weeks is required due to its long halflife. Known contraindication for the use of citalopram or escitalopram. Abnormal ECG findings at baseline Unable to understand and give informed consent.</criteria>
