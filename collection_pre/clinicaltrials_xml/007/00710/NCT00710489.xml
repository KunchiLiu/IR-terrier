	<brief_title>Potential Research Study Participant Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Subjects will self identify themselves via the UCDMC Dermatology website to complete a survey regarding their interest in learning about future dermatology clinical research projects. Subjects provide contact information and check of a list of potential topics of interest. Procedures: Potential participants will find a link on the UCDMC Dermatology website to our registry. The potential participant will read information about the registry. If they wish additional information, they can follow a link to the potential research registry consent form. At this stage, the potential participant may answer, "no" to the consent form and they will be redirected back to the Clinical trials website. If they answer, "yes" then they will be linked to the registry questionnaire. The potential subject would then decide if they want to participate in the registry and if so what information they want to provide. The Clinical Research Coordinators would contact potential study participants to see if they meet the eligibility criteria for any of our current studies.</detailed_description>
