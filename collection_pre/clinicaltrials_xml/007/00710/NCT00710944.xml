	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate survival for ASTRA TECH Implant System, OsseoSpeed™ implants following immediate loading in extraction sockets versus immediate loading in healed ridges. Patients in need of single standing implants replacing teeth in the maxilla within zone 15-25 will be included and followed for 5 years. Primary objective is implant survival rate at 12 months.</brief_summary>
