	<brief_title>Device Based Therapy in Hypertension Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DEBuT-HT trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of Rheos Baroreflex Hypertension Therapy(TM) in patients with refractory hypertension despite full pharmacologic therapy. Enrolled patients will be carefully assessed prior to receiving a permanently implanted Rheos System. Once the system is implanted, these patients will be followed closely for 1 month to establish baseline information. The Rheos System will be programmed "ON" at the 1 month follow-up and incrementally increased at 2 and 3-month follow-up evaluations. An assessment of safety and efficacy will be made at the 4-month follow-up. Enrolled patients will be followed annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
