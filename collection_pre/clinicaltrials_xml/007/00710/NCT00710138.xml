	<brief_summary>During fetal life and infancy, an adequate cobalamin status is important for normal growth and central nervous system development. During the last years we have detected cobalamin deficiency in a number of infants admitted to the Pediatric Department with various symptoms, including neurological symptoms and feeding problems. Cobalamin treatment is given to the infants with biochemical cobalamin deficiency, and leads to loss of symptoms and in improved physical condition. In this study we want to establish the prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in infants with developmental delay and regression and other vague neurological symptoms. Cobalamin status will be investigated in all children aged 8 months and younger, admitted to the Pediatric Department with these symptoms. In a randomised intervention trial we will evaluate the effect of cobalamin supplementation in children with these symptoms and metabolic evidence of impaired cobalamin status. Study hypothesis: Cobalamin treatment given to the infants with biochemical cobalamin deficiency, will lead to loss of symptoms and in improved physical condition.</brief_summary>
