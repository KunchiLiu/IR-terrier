	<brief_summary>This research is being conducted to help us better understand what causes exercise induced asthma. The investigators hypothesize that two types of chemicals, cysteinyl leukotrienes and adenosine, play an important role. The investigators will be measuring these chemicals in the exhaled breath of volunteers with exercise induced asthma as they undergo a test to mimic exercise induced asthma. The investigators will determine how the levels of these chemicals change in association with how lung function changes before, during and after an episode of exercise induced asthma.</brief_summary>
