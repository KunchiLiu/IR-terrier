	<brief_summary>For the primary goals, we hypothesize that 1) the oral tobacco product will be more efficacious than the medicinal nicotine product in substituting for smoking cigarettes; 2) among non-abstainers, the oral tobacco product will lead to greater reduction in cigarette smoking than medicinal nicotine; and 3) a higher rate of oral tobacco compared to medicinal nicotine use will be observed during and beyond the treatment period. For the secondary goals, we hypothesize that 1) both products will equally reduce withdrawal symptoms and negative affect from cigarette abstinence, but smokers who are assigned to the oral tobacco product will be more likely to report liking the effects from their assigned product compared to those smokers assigned to medicinal nicotine; 2) greater physiological effects (e.g., vitals) will be observed for the oral tobacco product compared to medicinal nicotine; 3) the toxicant exposure and toxicity will be reduced dramatically when smokers switch from cigarettes to each of these products; however, this reduction will be greater with the use of medicinal nicotine; 4) although the abstinence rates will be higher for oral tobacco products, and initial product costs will be lower, relative to the medicinal nicotine intervention, the likelihood of longer duration of oral tobacco use will increase the oral tobacco cost over time for the user; and 5) switching to low-nitrosamine oral tobacco will reduce life-years lost compared to continuing smoking and will be a cost-effective (in terms of life-years saved) substitution strategy compared to medicinal nicotine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This second study under "Oral Tobacco as a Harm Reduction Product" grant is a clinical trial. Subjects will be randomized to the brand of smokeless tobacco that is determined to be most effective in Study 1 or to nicotine gum for 12 weeks to compare complete substitution for smoking. The secondary aims are to determine the effects of the products on biomarkers of exposure and toxicity. If the sample size is sufficient, then comparisons will be made across products on these measures while controlling for amount of tobacco use. Other secondary aims include examining the reliability of our biological measures in a control group that continues to smoke, the extent of constituent extraction after oral pouch tobacco use, the relationship between extent of constituent extraction and biomarkers of exposure, and finally, withdrawal symptoms from the oral tobacco products. Two sites will be used for these studies: University of Minnesota and Oregon Research Institute (ORI).</detailed_description>
