	<criteria>Prospective subjects should be 21 years of age and older, be of any race and gender and meet study entry criteria. Subject must require extraction of cataracts followed by implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL). Subjects must be candidates for bilateral removal of the natural crystalline lens followed by implantation of a multifocal IOL and be willing and able to complete all followup visits. Subjects with preexisting conditions that could skew the results or are contraindications for the AcrySof® ReSTOR® IOL should be excluded from the study. Please consult the AcrySof® ReSTOR® Aspheric product inserts under "Precautions" for subject groups that should be excluded from this study. All subjects must have ≤ 0.75 diopters of astigmatism preoperatively as measured by Keratometry (K) readings. If the surgeon determines that a correction of cylinder is necessary postoperatively, this may be performed after the three month evaluations are completed.</criteria>
