	<brief_summary>The study medication CYT006-AngQb is a vaccine, consisting of angiotensin II (Ang II), the naturally occurring octapeptide coupled onto the surface of virus-like particles (VLP). This form of presenting Ang II to the immune system induces a B-cell mediated immune response characterized by the generation of specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) against Ang II. The CYT006-AngQb vaccine is administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. Immunization against angiotensin II may offer a valuable alternative to conventional drugs for the treatment of hypertension.</brief_summary>
