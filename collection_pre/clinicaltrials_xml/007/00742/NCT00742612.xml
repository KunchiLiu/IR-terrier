	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine, in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the effect of ARC1779 Injection on the number of microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler immediately after surgery. This study will also evaluate the safety of ARC1779 Injection with respect to bleeding risk in patients in the peri-operative (during surgery) period.</brief_summary>
