	<brief_summary>Smoking has been identified as a key risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It was found that a persistent increase in levels of oxidative stress and prolonged inflammation play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of smoking associated CVD. Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) are widely known for their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, in vitro and in vivo. However, there are hardly any studies available that systematically investigated their acute and long-term effects on vascular function as well as on established biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in an "at risk" population such as smokers. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of an eight-week supplementation with OPCs on vascular function as well as biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in blood of smokers.</brief_summary>
