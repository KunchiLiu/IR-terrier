	<brief_summary>In this study we will examine if the insulin-induced microvascular effects will occur after a physiological stimulus (i.e. a oral glucose tolerance test). With that the physiological importance of the insulin-induced microvascular dilatation can be elucidated. In this study we hypothesize that oral glucose intake and consequently the endogenous induced hyperinsulinemia will lead to insulin-induced microvascular dilatation in healthy normotensive subjects. Furthermore, we suggest that the insulin-mediated microvascular dilatation, resulting from this physiological induced hyperinsulinemia, will be less in hypertensive and obese subjects compared to healthy controls.</brief_summary>
