Presence of an axillary temperature &gt;= 37.5 Â°C, or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month of study enrolment, or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrolment. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with Coumadin derivatives or heparin. Administration of any registered vaccine within 30 days before study enrolment or planned administration within the first vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 42 and within 30 days prior to blood sampling at Day 182. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days prior to study enrolment or planned use during the study period. History of previous H5N1 vaccination, or history of H5N1 influenza infection. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 6 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or component used in the manufacturing process of the study vaccine, a history of anaphylactictype reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine. Known pregnancy or a positive urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin test result prior to the time of first vaccination. Lactating or nursing.
