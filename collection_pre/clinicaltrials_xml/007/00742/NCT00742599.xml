	<brief_summary>Patients who require gastric endoscopy will receive an intragastric single dose of NPO-11 20 mL. The superiority of NPO-11 to placebo as a premedication for endoscopy will be verified in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-assignment design based on the percentage of patients having no gastric peristalsis at both 2 minutes post-dose and the end of endoscopy (primary outcome measure). The safety of NPO-11 will be evaluated based on adverse events and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed between administration and seven days after administration in comparison with the placebo group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Controlled Clinical Study of NPO-11 in Patients Undergoing Gastric Endoscopy</brief_title>

Patients who are older than 20 years at the time of consent Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study. The criteria (2) to (5) will be confirmed during endoscopy. Patients who meet any of these criteria will be withdrawn from the study at the time of confirmation. 1. Patients with a history of surgery to the upper gastrointestinal tract 2. Patients with severe gastric stenosis or deformation which makes observation of gastric peristalsis difficult 3. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding which requires hemostasis 4. Patients with reflux esophagitis (Los Angeles classification: B, C or D) 5. Patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers in active stage 6. Patients on cancer treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) 7.
