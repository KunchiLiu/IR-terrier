	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether aspirin and clopidogrel resistance measured with Multiplate function analyser has a good correlation with incidence of major adverse cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our plan is to enroll 180 patients with diagnosed CAD who electively undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Blood samples will be taken just before the procedure and one day after the procedure and analysed on Multiplate function analyser. Assessing aspirin and clopidogrel resistance incidence using Multiplate platelet function analyzer we will also try to find resistance correlation with the incidence of major adverse cardiac events in a one year follow up.</detailed_description>
