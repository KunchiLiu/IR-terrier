	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to see how much an osteopathic lymphatic treatment (OLT) causes an increase in plasma volume, total plasma protein concentration, and albumin concentration. This is an important step in understanding the effects of OLT, specifically its effects on fluid in the body. The primary role of the lymph system is the return of fluid and proteins lost from the blood vessels. Despite this, no research has been done to see what effects an OLT has on fluid and protein levels in the blood.</brief_summary>
