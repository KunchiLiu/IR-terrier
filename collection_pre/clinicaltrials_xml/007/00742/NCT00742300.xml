	<brief_summary>While glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants ameliorate manifestations of autoimmune diseases in many patients, current therapies are insufficient to control the disease in a subset of patients, and their clinical prognosis remains poor due to the development of vital organ failure, cumulative drug toxicity and to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Immunoablative chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has recently emerged as a promising experimental therapy for severely affected patients, providing them the potential to achieve treatment-free, long-term remission. The rationale for applying ASCT to autoimmune diseases has been the hope that immunoablation could eliminate inflammation-driving pathogenic cells from the immune system, and that regeneration of the patients' immune system from hematopoietic precursors could re-establish immunological tolerance.</brief_summary>
