	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given together with daunorubicin and cytarabine and to see how well it works in treating older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib, Daunorubicin, and Cytarabine in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the remission induction response rate (complete response [CR] and CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) in older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia treated with induction therapy comprising bortezomib in combination with daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine. II. To define the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered in combination with intermediate-dose cytarabine after induction therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. II. To describe the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. III. To evaluate the treatment-related toxicities in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib. Doses of bortezomib are escalated during remission consolidation therapy. REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY: Remission induction course 1: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3; and cytarabine IV continuously over 168 hours on days 1-7. After completion of remission induction course 1, patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for evaluation of response. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) proceed to remission consolidation therapy. Patients achieving a CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) proceed to remission consolidation therapy after platelet counts recover. Patients with persistent leukemia (&gt;= 20% bone marrow cellularity and &gt;= 5% bone marrow myeloblasts) proceed to remission induction course 2. REMISSION INDUCTION COURSE 2: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 4; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2; and cytarabine IV continuously over 120 hours on days 1-5. After completion of remission induction course 2, patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for evaluation of response. Patients achieving a CR or PR proceed to remission consolidation therapy. Patients achieving a CRp proceed to remission consolidation therapy after platelet counts recover. Patients with residual leukemia who do not meet the criteria for PR are removed from the study. REMISSION CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and intermediate-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours on days 1-5. Patients then undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for evaluation of response. Patients achieving a CR or who demonstrate continuing CR receive a second course of remission consolidation therapy beginning 2-4 weeks after blood counts recover. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually for up to 10 years.</detailed_description>
