	<brief_title>A European Study on Medical Management Versus TAG Device + Medical Management for Acute Uncomplicated Type B Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dissection of the aorta is a medical emergency requiring immediate surgery. Type B dissections are typically treated with surgery or endoluminal therapy when complications such as uncontrollable pain, organ ischemia, or aortic rupture are present. However, the treatment of patients with uncomplicated, acute type B dissections is controversial. Best medical therapy (BMT) is the standard of care in these cases since surgical repair offers no additional survival advantage. However, Endoluminal stent graft therapy with the GORE TAG Thoracic Endoprosthesis (GORE TAG device) may offer distinct advantages as an adjunct to medical therapy for uncomplicated acute type B dissection. The goal of endoluminal stent grafting is to cover the primary entry tear of the dissection to isolate the false lumen from blood flow and induce aortic remodeling.</detailed_description>
