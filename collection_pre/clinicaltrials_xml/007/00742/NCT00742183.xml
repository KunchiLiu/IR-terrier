	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the incremental costs (direct and indirect) and benefits (healing outcomes, quality of life) of using foam silver dressing (Mepilex® Ag) to a Silver sulfadiazine 1% cream (Silvadene®) from the perspective of the health care provider. The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety, the tolerance and the performance on burn status including pain.</brief_summary>
