	<brief_summary>From 1999, several studies have showed that the use of vasoconstrictors in association with albumin are effective in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The rationale of the use of vasoconstrictors together with albumin in the treatment of this severe complication of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis is to correct the reduction of the effective circulating volume due to the splanchnic arterial vasodilatation.In most of these studies terlipressin, a derivate of vasopressin, has been used as vasoconstrictor as intravenous boluses moving from an initial dose of 0.5-1 mg/4 hr. In some studies midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, given by mouth has been used as vasoconstrictor at a dose ranging from 2.5 up to 12.5 tid together with octreotide, an inhibitor of the release of glucagon, given subcutaneously at a dose ranging from 10 µg upt to 200 µg tid. To the day, there isn't a study comparing terlipressin + albumin versus midodrine + octreotide + albumin in the treatment of HRS in patients with cirrhosis.Thus, the aim of the study is to compare terlipressin + albumin vs midodrine + octreotide + albumin in the treatment of the HRS in patients with cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
