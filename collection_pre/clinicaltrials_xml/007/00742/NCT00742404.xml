	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving bortezomib together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome together with bortezomib and dexamethasone works in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the response rate (i.e., complete response, very good partial response , partial response, and minimal response) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. Secondary - To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - To determine the time to disease progression, time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30-90 minutes, dexamethasone IV, and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for M-protein analysis by electrophoresis and immunofixation. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
