	<brief_summary>From previous studies it appeared that menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is the most effective form of vitamin K. The Japanese soya product natto is one of the richest food sources of MK-7. However, the taste of natto is not appreciated by the western society. For this reason the active biological compound is produced as a capsule. Different techniques of encapsulation the vitamin can lead to different absorption profiles with intake. Therefore it is important to study influence of type of encapsulation technique on absorption of menaquinone-7. This study is undertaken to compare absorption of menaquinones between two different encapsulation techniques. Absorption profiles of menaquinone-4 and menaquinone-7 of conventional softgel capsules and newly developed GellpelTM capsules are compared between each other.</brief_summary>
