	<brief_summary>Purpose of the study is to evaluate dose response relationship, efficacy, safety and tolerability of target doses of GSK1838262 compared to placebo in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. Once subjects complete the baseline and meet the randomization criteria, they will complete a 5-wk flexible titration period and then enter the 12 week maintenance period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Study in Adult Patients Suffering From Migraine Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MPX111381 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, flexible-dose evaluation of GSK1838262 1200 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and 3000 mg/day compared with placebo in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. Subjects 18 years of age must have experienced at least three migraine headache attacks (with or without aura according to 2004 International Headache Society [IHS] criteria 1.1 and 1.2.1) per month during the 3 months prior to screening and at least four migraine headache days but less than 15 total headache days (migraine or non-migraine) per month during the 3 months prior to screening and must maintain this requirement throughout the last 4 weeks of the baseline period. Approximately 528 subjects from approximately 53 centers in North America will be randomized in a 2:1:2:2:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: placebo, GSK1838262 1200 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and 3000 mg/day. Investigational product will be administered twice daily (morning and evening) with food (e.g., meal or snack). The study will consist of six study periods for a total study duration of up to 30 weeks: Screening (2 weeks), baseline (including randomization, 6 weeks), flexible titration (5 weeks), maintenance (12 weeks), taper (3 weeks) and post-treatment (2 weeks). The flexible titration administration of investigational product is designed to allow subjects to reach the target dose for maintenance treatment or, if unable to reach this target dose, to achieve a maximum tolerated dose for maintenance treatment. Subjects will have the opportunity to undergo a single dose (600 mg/day) downward adjustment during the flexible titration period if intolerability at the current dose occurs. Subsequently, if a single dose downward adjustment has occurred, no further dose adjustments in the study (upward or downward) will be permitted.</detailed_description>

Subject has had a history of migraine headache for at least one year, and the age of onset was prior to 50 years. Subject has consistent migraine headache over time (i.e., incidence and severity). Subject has had at least three migraine headache attacks per month during the 3 months prior to screening and maintains this requirement during the last 4 weeks of the baseline period Subject has had at least four migraine headache days but less than 15 total headache days (migraine or nonmigraine) per month during the 3 months prior to screening and maintains this requirement during the last 4 weeks of the baseline period. Subject is able to distinguish migraine headache attacks as discrete from other headaches (i.e., tensiontype headaches). Subject has the ability to read, comprehend and legibly and reliably record information in paper and electronic format as required by the protocol. Subject must be able to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the study. The contents and process of obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.

Subject has failed more than 2 adequate treatments of migraine prophylaxis where failure is defined as a lack of efficacy with treatment duration of at least 8 weeks. Subject has history of simple analgesic use on &gt;/=15 days per month for &gt;/=3months. Subject is unable to discontinue prohibited medications during the 2week screening period and throughout the duration of the study including betablockers, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic drugs, bupropion or serotonergic noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Subjects who have taken gabapentin or pregabalin previously for the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. Subjects who have taken gabapentin or pregabalin for treatment of conditions other than migraine are eligible provided, (1) their total exposure to gabapentin and pregabalin is less than 3 months during the preceding 12 months, and (2) the subject stopped taking gabapentin or pregabalin for at least 3 months prior to baseline. Subject has a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches. Subject has a current or past history of seizure disorder.
