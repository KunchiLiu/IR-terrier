	<brief_summary>There is an urgent need to control our current national outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). The purpose of this study is to eradicate CRKP gastrointestinal carriage using selective digestive decontamination (SDD); with buccal and oral gentamicin and polymyxin E administration. This will reduce infections and hopefully mortality caused by CRKP.</brief_summary>
