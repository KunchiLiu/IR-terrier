	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate possible mechanisms of aspirin resistance at a molecular level in aspirin-treated patients with coronary artery disease. We hypothesize that certain patient characteristics associate with aspirin resistance. In addition, we will compare the effects of enteric-coated aspirin and chewable aspirin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin Resistance in Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspirin is commonly used for its antithrombotic effects in patients at risk for cardiovascular events. Its primary mechanism of action is the irreversible acetylation of platelet cyclooxygenase-1, thereby inhibiting platelet production of thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and activator of platelets. Previous studies have demonstrated that many patients have recurrent events despite treatment with aspirin, which has been termed "aspirin resistance" or "aspirin nonresponse." This study addresses some of the possible mechanisms for aspirin nonresponse; specifically, we will test the hypothesis that aspirin nonresponse results from states that produce high peroxide concentrations ("oxidative stress") in platelets. In addition, we will evaluate the effect of enteric coating on the pharmacologic efficacy of aspirin in patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
