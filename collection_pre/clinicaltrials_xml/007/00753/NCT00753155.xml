	<brief_summary>A prospective, interventional rehabilitation program was initiated to improve exercise capacity and psychosocial functioning in patients after lung transplantation (LTx) and to evaluate long-term effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Study subjects were randomized to either intervention or to control group and were followed with regular cardiopulmonary exercise testings and HRQoL measurements (SF-36) for 36±3 months after LTx. Patient characteristics did not differ concerning age, gender, and diagnosis at study entry. IG patients received regular psychosocial support and performed a home-based supervised ergometer training program. CG patients were recommended to perform regular exercising.</brief_summary>
