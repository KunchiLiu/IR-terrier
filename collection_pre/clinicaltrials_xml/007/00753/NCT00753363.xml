	<brief_summary>Persistent low-grade inflammation and impaired fibrinolysis, are independent predictors of several chronic diseases highly prevalent in the older Veteran population including cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and diabetes. Inflammation is likely to be a causative underlying mechanism of insulin resistance. Lifestyle changes such as weight loss and physical activity are advocated for the treatment of these chronic diseases and endpoints, and data are emerging which suggest that these treatments may be beneficial, in part, due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Identification of effective therapies that reduce chronic inflammation for Veterans is important given the widespread adverse health effects of a chronically elevated inflammatory state.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will compare the effects of 6 month trial of aerobic exercise (AEX) vs. weight loss (WL) in older individuals on: 1. adipokine secretion and expression (tumor necrosis factor alpha, adiponectin); 2. adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inflammatory proximal receptor expression (adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression) and signaling pathways; and 3. whether the changes in signal transduction are associated with changes in peripheral whole body insulin sensitivity by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The prevention and treatment of insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and their CVD complications through exercise and weight loss could improve Veterans' health and reduce health care costs. Knowledge of their effectiveness has important implications for the cardiovascular health of Veterans given the widespread adverse health effects of chronic inflammation on vascular biology, skeletal muscle function and insulin action.</detailed_description>
