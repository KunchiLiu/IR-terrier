	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of GSK Biologicals' Influenza Vaccine GSK2186877A in Adults 65 Year of Age and Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Protocol Posting has been updated according to Protocol Amendment 3, Sep 2009. After the analyses for this study were completed, questions arose regarding the integrity of study data from a single study site in Romania, which enrolled 102 subjects in the trial. Because evaluation of data from this site did not reveal irregularities when compared with overall study data and because GSK has no current plans to use the data from the study in support of any regulatory filings, they were not excluded from the analyses reflected in this results summary.</detailed_description>
