	<brief_title>Anti-Cytokine Therapy for Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. Current treatment regimes using corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide have improved patient survival but are associated with treatment associated morbidity and mortality. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitis. Anti-TNF therapies have been used successfully in the management of other inflammatory autoimmune diseases. This phase II cohort study has been designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (Infliximab) therapy for patients with ANCA associated vasculitis when used in addition to standard immunosuppressive therapy.</detailed_description>
