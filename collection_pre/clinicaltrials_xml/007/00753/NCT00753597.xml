	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study of B lymphocyte depletion therapy in an attempt to salvage adrenal steroidogenic capacity in ten subjects with early autoimmune Addison's disease. During the first twelve weeks of treatment, additional glucocorticoid therapy (prednisolone) will be given to ensure wellbeing and to rest the steroidogenic apparatus that is the target of the autoimmune attack. Glucocorticoids will be gradually withdrawn, in a controlled fashion, and adrenal function re-evaluated at 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. The primary endpoint will be restoration of steroidogenic function as judged by conventional endocrine indices of adrenocortical function. B cell depletion may ameliorate the autoimmune attack against adrenal cells, potentially allowing a state of immune tolerance to be restored with subsequent recovery of adrenal steroidogenic capacity.</brief_summary>
