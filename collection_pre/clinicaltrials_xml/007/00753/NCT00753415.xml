	<brief_summary>This is a two-part study to test the safety, tolerability, and immune response for V934/V935 vaccine using a new prime-boost regimen in participants with selected solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of V934/V935 Vaccine in Cancer Participants With Selected Solid Tumors (V934-002)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two vaccines will be administered: V934-electroporation (EP) either low dose (LD) or high dose (HD), and V935 either LD or HD. In Part A, participants will be assigned to V935 vaccine alone or in combination with V934-EP. Part B will be an optional part of the study, offering V934-EP vaccine booster to participants who were enrolled in Part A.</detailed_description>

Participant has developed any significant cardiac conditions since enrollment in Part A including cardiac arrhythmias which have not been controlled within the last 3 months, unstable angina, myocardial infarction (within the last 3 months), or NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure. Participant has undergone a splenectomy, or has developed any autoimmune disorders, since enrollment in Part A. Participant has received immunosuppressive treatment within 1 month prior to enrollment in Part B Participant has developed any acquired, inherited, or idiopathic thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction or coagulopathy that would contraindicate IM injections Participant has an acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal agents within 2 weeks of entry to Part B.</criteria>
