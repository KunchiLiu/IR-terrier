	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Carboplatin Plus Bevacizumab in Pretreated, Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the 1st line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provided a survival benefit. There are patients with NSCLC who have not received bevacizumab and have relapsed after 1st and/or 2nd line therapy. The evaluation of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in such patients is justified. The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, administered every two weeks, has a favorable toxicity profile. This study will evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to a biweekly regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin as 2nd or 3rd line therapy for NSCLC</detailed_description>
