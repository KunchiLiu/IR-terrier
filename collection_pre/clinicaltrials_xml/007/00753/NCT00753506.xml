	<brief_title>Artemisinin to Reduce The Symptoms of Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of the current study are: 1. To evaluate the efficacy and side effects of artemisinin as an add-on compound for patients with schizophrenia who have residual psychotic symptoms of at least moderate severity. 2. To evaluate the effect of artemisinin on cognitive impairments and associated functional skills. 3. To investigate whether treatment with artemisinin produces a significant effect on the levels of antibodies to Toxoplasma. 4. To examine whether changes in cognitive impairment or psychiatric symptoms are correlated with changes in antibodies to Toxoplasma before and during the treatment with artemisinin.</detailed_description>
