	<brief_title>Efficacy of Aurosling in Frontalis Sling Suspension Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silicon rod is an effective and safe material used in frontalis suspension in treating ptosis with poor levator function.The elasticity and ease of adjustment of silicon rod are ideal characteristics for suspension material used to treat severe ptosis in patients with poor bells phenomenon. In the present study , we attend to study the efficacy of aurosling silicon material as a suspension material for frontalis sling surgery</detailed_description>
