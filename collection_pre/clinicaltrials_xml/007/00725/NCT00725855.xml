	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of nicotinic alpha-7 MEM 3454 on P50 sensory gating in patients with Schizophrenia. The hypothesis is that MEM 3454 will normalize the P50 ratio. Data produced in this study will provide useful information regarding the value of P50 as an efficacy biomarker, and provide evidence for the optimal dosing of MEM 3454 for additional P50 studies.</brief_summary>
