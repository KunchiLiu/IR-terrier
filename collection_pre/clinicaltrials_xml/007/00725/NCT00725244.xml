	<brief_summary>Aim: To compare the efficacy, safety and number of sessions of bipolar eletrocoagulation (BEC) and argon plasma coagulation (APC) in the management of the bleeding telangiectasias from chronic radiation coloproctopathy (CRCP). Methods: Thirty patients with active bleeding from telangiectasias were enrolled in two groups (15 BEC and 15 APC) and classified according of Saunders score. BEC settings were 50 W and APC settings were 40 W and 1.0 l/min. Colonoscopy was the first exam to rule out synchronous lesions and follow-up was performed with sigmoidoscopies. Clinical cure was defined as cessation of bleeding and endoscopic cure was determined by absence of telangiectasias. Failure was defined whenever more than 7 sessions or other therapy was necessary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Endoscopy Bipolar and Argon of Chronic Rectal Bleeding From Radiation Telangiectasias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patients with active and chronic hematochezia from radiation telangiectasias were randomized in two groups : - fifteen patients in group 1- bipolar eletrocoagulation (BE) and - fifteen in group 2 - argon plasma coagulation(APC). For inclusion in the study, all patients were required to have active (at least one episode last week) and chronic (persist or appear 6 months after the conclusion of radiotherapy) rectal bleeding. Between May 2005 and April 2008, patients were treated and followed at the Endoscopy Unit in the SÃ£o Paulo Hospital (UNIFESP).</detailed_description>
