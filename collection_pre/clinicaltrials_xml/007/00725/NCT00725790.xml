	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vardenafil in Men With Erectile Dysfunction Caused by Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, erectile dysfunction (ED) is estimated as affecting approximately 30 million American men and 100 million men worldwide. The study also reported that approximately 52% of males aged 40-70 experience some degree of ED. Prevalence has been shown to increase with age, with an estimated 40% of the responders experiencing ED at age 40, whereas, 67% had difficulties by age 75. Considerable advances have been made since the NIH Consensus statement that defined ED as the persistent inability to achieve and maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. However, one thing remains the same, sexuality continues to be a driving force in our society today. Many men with erectile dysfunction suffer from issues of self esteem, self worth, the creation and maintenance of interpersonal relationships and in general, wrestle with an overall altered sense of wellbeing. Damage to personal relationships can ensue; and the anger, depression, and anxiety engendered spill over into all aspects of life. VIAGRA(sildenafil), administered as a flexible-dose regimen, has demonstrated to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in spinal cord injury sufferers.This is a multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vardenafil in men with erectile dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury.</detailed_description>
