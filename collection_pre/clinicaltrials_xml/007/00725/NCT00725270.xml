	<brief_title>Treatment of Schizoaffective Disorder Using Mifepristone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You are invited to participate in a research study which evaluates the effectiveness of mifepristone (RU 486) in rapidly reducing the symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder. Our group believes that the cognitive deficits (a decline in the ability to think clearly) and psychosis (hallucinations or delusions) exhibited in some affective disorders are driven by an excess of stress hormone effects (hypercortisolemia). Often the origin of this hormonal imbalance is unknown. Current treatment for schizoaffective disorder (characterized by mood swings and hallucinations and/or delusions) involves using a combination of antidepressant medication (for mood elevation), mood stabilizing medications (to prevent extreme high and low moods) and antipsychotic medication (for the correction of altered thinking). While these therapies are often effective, they can take several weeks or longer to work. We hope to uncover a quick, effective, safe therapy for the treatment of individuals with your condition.</detailed_description>
