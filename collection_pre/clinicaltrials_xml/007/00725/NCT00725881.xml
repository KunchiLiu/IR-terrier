	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple, once-daily, intravenous doses of trans sodium crocetinate (TSC). The effectiveness of TSC in alleviating the symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) in Patients With Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, and patients with PAD commonly manifest symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) such as cramping, aching, or fatigue in the calf muscles provoked by activity. In PAD, arterial occlusions lead to decreased leg blood flow during exercise or walking and the pain associated with this ischemia is IC. The diffusion of oxygen from blood to muscle could be a component of the overall decreased delivery or deficit of oxygen (hypoxia) to skeletal muscle resulting in symptoms in PAD patients. The overall goal of the development of TSC as a treatment for PAD is to allow for enhanced diffusion of oxygen through the plasma to alleviate the symptoms caused by the hypoxia in the tissues. This double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial will randomize up to 48 patients at up to 8 clinical research sites in the US. In addition to safety and pharmacokinetic assessments conducted during the trial, the primary endpoint of the study will be demonstrated from standardized, graded exercise treadmill tests conducted throughout the study. The clearly measurable parameters will be peak walking time (PWT) and claudication onset time (COT) comparing baseline and after TSC or placebo and are well-established endpoints accepted by the medical community and regulatory authorities for IC clinical trials.</detailed_description>
