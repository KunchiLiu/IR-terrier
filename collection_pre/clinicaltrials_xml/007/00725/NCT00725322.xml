	<brief_summary>Superficial injection of Botulinum toxin has been advocated for cosmetic purposes but has also been reported to be helpful for some pain conditions. The investigators have observed prolonged profound analgesia following subcutaneous superficial injection of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTA) in patients with certain types of neuropathic pain. The investigators propose to study if addition of BTA extends pain relief compared to placebo when injected subcutaneously into areas of cutaneous allodynia (the property that a normally non-noxious stimulus is perceived as painful).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Botulinum Toxin for Cutaneous Allodynia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-surgical neuromatous pain patients have marked cutaneous allodynia. Touching their skin with normally non-painful stimuli results in pain. Injected local anesthetics are often effective in providing temporary relief. In the course of clinical practice the investigators have observed that a number of patients with cutaneous allodynia have had marked persistent benefit from subcutaneous injection of Botulinum toxin Type A. Rather than killing targeted neurons, Botulinum toxin type A inhibits release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals in a prolonged but ultimately reversible manner. Neuropathic pain and its hallmark allodynia are classically difficult to treat. Standard treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs, opiates and spinal cord stimulation is frequently disappointing leaving patients with refractory pain. Surgical or percutaneous ablation of involved nerves has fallen out of favor among many due to disappointing results. A pilot study is needed to assess the efficacy of superficially injected Botulinum Toxin type A for treatment of cutaneous allodynia and spontaneous pain among patients with neuropathic pain.</detailed_description>
