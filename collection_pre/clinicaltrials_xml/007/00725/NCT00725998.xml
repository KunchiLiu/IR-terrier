	<brief_summary>Introduction: In Cochlear Implant (CI) users, the recording of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) of the auditory nerve represents an option to assess changes in auditory nerve responses and the interaction between the electrode and the neural tissue over time. Aim: To study ECAP in children during the first year of CI use. Material and methods: The ECAP characteristics have been analyzed in 13 children implanted younger than three years old. SERIES STUDY.
