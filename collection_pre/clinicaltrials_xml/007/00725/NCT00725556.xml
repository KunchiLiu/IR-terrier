	<brief_title>The Development of Autistic Children Based on Mothers´Response in Autism Behavior Checklist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: We evaluated the process of development of autistic children, in a direct and indirect intervention context from mother´s response in Autism Behavior Checklist. Method: The sample were composed of 11 mothers of children diagnosed with Autism (6) and Asperger Syndrome (5), according to the criteria established by the DSM IVtr (APA, 2002). These children were randomly divided into two groups: Six were receiving both direct and indirect intervention (Therapy Group -TG), and five were receiving exclusively indirect intervention (Orientation Group - OG). We used the Autism Behavior Checklist (Krug et al., 1993), adapted to Portuguese on three occasions: at the beginning, six months later and 12 months later. This is a list of nonadaptive behaviors (57), in the areas: Sensorial, Body and Object Use, Language, Social and Relating.</detailed_description>
