	<criteria>Patient is ≥ 50 years old and in general good health. Patients with medically controlled chronic disease such as HTN, AODM, and hyperlipidemia may be included. Patient is capable of giving consent. Patient is willing and able to comply with the visit schedule and study procedures including followup visits. Patient has documented CNV secondary to AMD with evidence of active disease characterized by blood vessel leakage or evidence of hemorrhage. Patient has clear ocular media and adequate pupil dilation to allow good quality imaging by fundus photography. Patient's intraocular pressure is ≤ 25 mmHg Patient is of childbearing potential. Every female patient is considered of childbearing potential unless she has had sterilization surgery or is postmenopausal and has not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months. Patient has CNV due to causes other than AMD, including ocular or periocular infections. Patient has lesions not easily imaged and quantified. Patient has underlying systemic disease such as cardiac, neurological, infectious disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitis, or disease of the eye other than AMD. Patient may have medically controlled glaucoma. Patient is participating in any concurrent interventional study.</criteria>
