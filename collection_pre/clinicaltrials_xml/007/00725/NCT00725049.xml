	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study will evaluate the integration success while supporting a prosthesis for short implants placed into maxillary sites having minimal bone height that would otherwise need sinus augmentation. The resources utilized during treatment will be assessed. Study (null) hypothesis: the overall benefit of using short length implants to avoid sinus augmentation procedures will offset differences in the cumulative implant survival rates observed between treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Integration Success and Maintenance of Short Implants in Maxillas Needing Sinus Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized study, patients needing restorations in the posterior maxilla will be randomly assigned to the short implant group (test) or the standard length and augmentation group (control). All implants will be placed using a two-stage approach with healing abutments placed at three months and temporary prosthesis at four months following implant and/ or sinus augmentation surgery. Time, materials, and efforts associated with treating test and control cases will be documented to allow an assessment of the costs incurred with each approach.</detailed_description>
