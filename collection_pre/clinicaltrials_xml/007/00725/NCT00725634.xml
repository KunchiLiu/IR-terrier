Disease that is currently not amenable to curative surgical intervention. ECOG performance status of 01. Subjects with performance status of 2 will be considered only after discussion between the investigator and medical monitor. 18 years or older, of either sex, and of any race. Subject (and/or parent/guardian for subject who otherwise is unable to provide independent consent, if acceptable to and approved by the site and/or site's IRB) must be willing to give written informed consent and be able to adhere to dose and visit schedules. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 5 days prior to first dose of study drug. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects whose sexual partners are of childbearing potential must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use an effective method of contraception during the study and for 60 days after the last dose of AV299 (formerly SCH 900105). Examples of effective methods of contraception include, but are not limited to, oral contraceptives or double barrier methods such as condom plus spermicide or condom plus diaphragm. Adequate hematologic function as evidenced by Hg ≥ 9g/dL, WBC ≥ 3000 per mm3, ANC ≥ 1500 per mm3 and platelet count ≥ 100,000 per mm3. Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by a serum bilirubin level ≤1.5 × ULN (except with known Gilbert's Syndrome) and For subjects in the doseescalation cohorts and the Phase 1b evaluation of AV299 (formerly SCH 900105) in combination with erlotinib: Serum AST/ALT levels ≤3 × ULN for the reference laboratory For subjects in the RP2D safety expansion cohort: Without known hepatic metastasis serum AST/ALT levels ≤3 × ULN for the reference laboratory With known hepatic metastasis serum AST/ALT levels ≤5 × ULN. Adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 × ULN or a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min. Adequate coagulation function as evidenced by PTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN and INR ≤ 1.5 × ULN Recovery from the effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic antineoplastic therapy. Subjects with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) who have not been screened for Hepatitis B or C within the past 6 months prior to study enrollment, will need to be screened for Hepatitis B and C and can only be enrolled if the screening is negative. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion for the Multiple Myeloma Exploratory Cohort Subjects to be Included Diagnosis of symptomatic relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Note: For relapsed disease, subject must have PD after having achieved at least stable disease for ≥ 1 cycle of treatment to ≥ 1 prior regimen. For refractory disease, subject must have documented evidence of PD during or within 60 days (measured from the end of the last cycle) of completing treatment with the last antimyeloma drug regimen used just prior to study entry. Measurable disease assessed by one of the following: Serum monoclonal protein ≥ 1.0 g/dL by protein electrophoresis; &gt; 200 mg of monoclonal protein in the urine on 24 hour electrophoresis; Serum immunoglobulin free light chain ≥ 10 mg/dL AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio; or, Monoclonal bone marrow plasmacytosis ≥ 30% (evaluable disease). Note: All above evaluations, for which there are measurable results at screening, will be repeated as indicated in the visit schedule and the schedule of assessments, with the exception of bone marrow plasmacytosis. Bone marrow plasmacytosis will be repeated for disease/response assessment according to the visit schedule and the schedule of assessments if it is the only measurable result at screening. If both serum and urine Mproteins are present, both must be followed in order to evaluate response.

Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 5 days prior to first dose of study drug. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects whose sexual partners are of childbearing potential must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use an effective method of contraception during the study and for 60 days after the last dose of AV299 (formerly SCH 900105).
