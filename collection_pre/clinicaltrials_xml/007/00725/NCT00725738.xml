	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ejection fraction (EF) increase at 6 months follow up and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after intracoronary autologous stem cell transplantation in ST elevation myocardial infarction patients versus a control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intracoronary Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: TRACIA STUDY.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental trials with bone marrow cell have suggested that adult stem cell can contribute to regeneration of infarcted myocardial muscle and increase the neovascularization of the ischemic tissue. Post-myocardial infarction heart failure secondary to ventricular remodelation it's an increasing problem. A novel therapeutic approach for decrease this consequence is to induce the angiogeneses and regeneration of myocardial cells. Many trials have shown benefits through the intracoronary injection of stem cell, however the clinical benefit is still controversial. The present trial is a randomized single blinded controlled trial designed to evaluate the improvement on EF and survival in post ST elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing to intracoronary autologous stem cell transplantation.</detailed_description>
