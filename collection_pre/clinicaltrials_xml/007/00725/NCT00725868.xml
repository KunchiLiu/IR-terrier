	<brief_summary>In stent restenosis and myocardial infarction are have been linked the balance between injury and healing of the endothelium These processes can be measured respectively using the number of circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells. We therefore aimed to evaluate the relationship between the balance of injury and healing of the endothelium at the time of PCI and major adverse cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization at 6 and 12 months follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stents, the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization is high ranging between 20 and 25%.</detailed_description>
