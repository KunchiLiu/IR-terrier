	<brief_summary>Peripheral T cell lymphomas comprise 10-15% of all malignant lymphomas. The prognosis is significantly worse than that of aggressive B cell lymphomas. The prospects of elderly patients are especially poor, with an estimated disease free survival of only 25% after three years. Previous phase II trials have demonstrated a significant activity of the monoclonal anti CD52 antibody alemtuzumab in primary and relapsed T cell lymphoma. The investigators thus propose to investigate the value of adjuvant alemtuzumab in combination with dose dense CHOP-14 in patients with previously untreated peripheral T cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
