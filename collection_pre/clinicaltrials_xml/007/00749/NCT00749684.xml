	<brief_summary>The aim of this observational study is to document the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose interferon therapy in adult participants with malignant melanoma at high risk of relapse and to compare them with the survival times and relapse rates in previous studies (historical control).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of High-dose Interferon Alfa-2b (Intron A®) for the Adjuvant Treatment of Malignant Melanoma (Study P04083)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy (vs historical controls) of a high-dose therapy scheme with interferon-α-2b (IntronA®): Adjuvant treatment with interferon-α-2 has been demonstrated in a number of studies to have an antiproliferative effect on malignant melanoma. In these cases a response rate of up to 20% could be achieved with a dose of 10 million IU or more 3x/week or daily. Kirkwood et al. showed in a study carried out in ECOG (the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, study no. 1684) that there was a clear and significant survival advantage versus the observation group with the following dose: 20 mio IU/m² interferon-α-2b (IntronA®) 5x/week iv over the course of one month followed by 11 months with 10 mio IU/m² 3x/week sc.</detailed_description>
