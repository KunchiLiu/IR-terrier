	<brief_summary>Patients suffering from femoral neck or pertrochanteric fractures have a high rate of mortality and morbidity associated mainly with deconditioning and immobilization. Surgical management including open reduction and internaql fixation has been shown to reduce complication and improve outcome in such patients. Delay of surgery produces less optimal results and is associated with higher morbidity even after 24-48 hours of fracture event. Patients treated with platelet antiaggregants are exposed to higher blood loss during surgery and related complications, as demonstrated in patients treated with Aspirin. However, cessation of antiaggregant therapy before surgery may be associated with complications of a hypercoagulable state and surgery delay. Clpopidogrel is a fairly new approved antiaggregant drug indicated in cases of failed aspirin treatment in ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease patients as well as in primary prevention of stent restenosis. No data regarding complications of hip surgery in patients treated with Clpopidogrel is available. Study hypothesis: Definitive surgical treatment of patients treated with clopidogrel undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of pertrochnteric and femoral neck fractures is safe although associated with more extensive blood loss during surgery and postoperative wound complications.</brief_summary>
