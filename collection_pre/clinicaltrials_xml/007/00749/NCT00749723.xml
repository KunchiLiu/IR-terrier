	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve overall survival while maintaining a good quality of life in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent brain tumors (medulloblastomas, supratentorial PNETs, ependymomas WHO grade II and III). Response to different chemotherapy options (intravenous versus oral chemotherapy, intraventricular chemotherapy) as part of a multimodal therapy will be assessed. Progression-free, overall survival and toxicity will be evaluated additionally.</brief_summary>
