	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this randomized placebo controlled trial is that targeted nebulized gentamicin to the airways will reduce bacterial burden and limit neutrophil airways inflammation. If given long term this will improve symptoms, pulmonary physiology, exercise capacity and health related quality of life with a reduction in exacerbation frequency and health care utilization.</brief_summary>
