	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect data around the period of the conversion from plasma-derived Factor IX (pdFIX) to BeneFIX. The main information collected will be: a retrospective history of the bleedings in the 3-month period before the conversion, the recovery with pdFIX just before the conversion and with BeneFIX just after the conversion, and a prospective history of the bleedings in the 3 month period following the conversion.</brief_summary>
