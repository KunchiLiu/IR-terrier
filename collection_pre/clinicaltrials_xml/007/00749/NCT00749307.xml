	<brief_title>Effects of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) on Heart Rate Variability in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In western countries, sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents the most common form of cardiovascular death. SCD is often caused by ventricular arrhythmias in patients with a known history of ischemic heart disease but it may also occurs in healthy persons. In the last years has been extensively studied the protective role of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) against SCD both in healthy persons and in patients affected by coronary artery disease. The hypothesis that these evidences could be ascribed to an antiarrhythmic effect of n-3 LCPUFA, has been corroborated by the observation of a direct relationship between the dietary intake of these nutrients and a better cardiac autonomic control. This pathway, in particular, has been confirmed by the analysis of changes in heart rate variability. Most studies in this field used n-3 LCPUFA derived from fish oil, composed by a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). At our knowledge there are few studies available evaluating the isolated role of DHA, derived from alternative sources of n-3 LCPUFA, as the microalgae, in the prevention of fatal arrhythmias.</detailed_description>
