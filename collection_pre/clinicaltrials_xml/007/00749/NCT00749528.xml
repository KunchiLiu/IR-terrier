	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate hair trace elements and toxic metals and plasma total antioxidant activity in children with recurrent wheezing and to evaluate whether these toxic metals and trace elements have any impact on serum cytokine levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Toxic Metals, Trace Elements and Total Antioxidant Activity in Children With Recurrent Wheezing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context: In many studies it was demonstrated that children are much more susceptible than adults for environmental toxic metal exposure. Hair analysis is a promising tool for routine clinical screening and diagnosis of heavy metal exposure and essential trace element states in the human body. Additionally it was demonstrated that oxidants and antioxidants play a central role in the pathogenesis of many pulmonary diseases including asthma. Furthermore, toxic metals, trace elements and oxidative stress have many pivotal role on immune system. Objective: To evaluate and compare hair toxic metals, hair essential trace elements levels and plasma total antioxidant activity between children with recurrent wheezing and age and sex matched healthy children. Intervention: Hair samples will be collected for the analysis of the toxic metals, trace elements. Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of the cytokine levels and plasma antioxidant activity. Study Measures: Differences in hair toxic metals, hair trace elements, plasma cytokine levels and plasma total antioxidant activity will be compared between children with recurrent wheezing and age-sex matched healthy children</detailed_description>
