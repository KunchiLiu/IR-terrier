	<brief_summary>A known risk of red blood cell transfusions is that it puts excess iron into the patient's body. Researchers are continually seeking the most effective method of measuring iron concentration. The purpose of this study is to determine how much iron has been deposited in a patient's heart and liver as a result of having received red blood cell transfusions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</brief_summary>
