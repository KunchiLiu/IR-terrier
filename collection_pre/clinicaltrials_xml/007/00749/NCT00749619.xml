	<brief_summary>Addition of Heparin to the Catheter Lock Solution (CLS): Taurolock-TM will improve the vascular patency compared to Taurolock-TM alone , in hemodialysis patients with Tunneled Cuffed Catheter(TCC) as vascular access.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition of Heparin to Taurolock-TM CLS in HD Patients With TCC Dose it Improve Catheter Patency Problems ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacteremia and thrombosis are the major complications of TCC used for hemodialysis.Instilation of CLS containing antibiotic-anticoagulant solution in the end of each dialysis session till the next dialysis ,can prevent Catheter related bacteremia (CRB).In previous study in our department, Taurolock-TM decreased the rate of CRB but increased the incidence of catheter malfunction. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of of Heparin addition to CLS-Taurolock- TM ( Taurolidine &amp;citrate 4%) in prevention of catheter patency problems in HD patients with TCC, in addition to CRB prevention. Methods : Patients with newly inserted TCC for HD enrolled and randomized to receive one of three CLS types : group 1- Taurolock-TM, Group 2 - Taurolock-TM and Heparin , Group 3- Heparin .Patients were followed for 6 monthes. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of Taurolock TM with heparin on the rate of CRB and vascular patency.</detailed_description>
