	<detailed_description>Obesity is related to the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes. Cost-effective interventions leading to sustained weight loss are needed to improve the public health and reverse the alarming rise in diabetes, its cardiovascular complications and other obesity-related illnesses. The Diabetes Prevention Program is identified as a model for a successful weight loss intervention. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of 2 active telephone-based interventions based on the Diabetes Prevention Model that will be delivered at primary care sites.</detailed_description>
