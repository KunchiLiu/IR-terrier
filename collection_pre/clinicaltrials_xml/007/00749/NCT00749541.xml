	<brief_summary>decreased vitamin d levels are associated with increased inflammatory markers,and renin angiotensin levels. decreased levels were also found to be connected to increased cardiovascular mortality. we therefore hypothesise that in patients with pathological results of coronary catheterization we will find decreased levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d. we will examine patients undergoing elective coronary catheterization and compare two groups: those with normal results and those with pathological results.</brief_summary>
