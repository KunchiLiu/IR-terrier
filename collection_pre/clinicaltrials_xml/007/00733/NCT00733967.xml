	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with Varenicline in methamphetamine-dependent volunteers. The investigators also seek to determine the effects of treatment with Varenicline, as compared to placebo, on craving for methamphetamine or cigarettes following exposure to methamphetamine and smoking cues, respectively. The effects of treatment with Varenicline, as compared to placebo, on subjective effects produced by administration of methamphetamine or placebo will be attempted to be determined. Lastly, the investigators hope to determine the effects of treatment with Varenicline, as compared to placebo, on reinforcing effects produced by administration of methamphetamine or placebo.</brief_summary>

Other females must either be unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or postmenopausal) or be using a reliable form of contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine device, condoms, or spermicide). All females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests before study entry, upon hospital admission, and at the end of study participation Have asthma or currently use alpha or beta agonists, theophylline, or other sympathomimetics Have any other illness, condition, or use of psychotropic medications, which in the opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician or nurse practitioner would preclude safe and/or successful completion of the study</criteria>
