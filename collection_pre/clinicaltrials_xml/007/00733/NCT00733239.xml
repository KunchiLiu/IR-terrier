Participation in the UAMS Substance Abuse Treatment Clinic Methadone Maintenance Program or the Catar Clinic Little Rock with maintenance on a stable dose of methadone (+ or 10 mg) for at least 1 month prior to study entry. 3. Subjects would have to be in "good standing" in the methadone maintenance program in order to participate; i.e., compliance with scheduled medication and group therapy session hours. This would be defined as &lt; 3 missed methadone medications and missed &lt; 3 group or &lt;3 individual therapy sessions in the month prior to study participation 4. Subjects must submit a urine sample negative for illicit drugs prior to study entry. 5. Subjects must be able to read and understand English. 1.

Pregnancy, plans to become pregnant or inadequate birth control. 5. Present or recent (&lt; 1 week) use of overthecounter psychoactive drug, prescription psychoactive drug or drug that would have major interaction with drugs to be tested. Recent use will be defined based upon the pharmacokinetics of the drug and dosing schedule. Thus, a shortacting antihistamine taken as needed (e.g., once the night before) will not necessarily rule out a participant; however, 6. History of severe reaction to Narcan challenge, which may have been given as part of admission into the Methadone Maintenance Program or to reverse overdose. 7. Liver function tests (ALT, AST) greater than 3 times normal, BUN and Creatinine outside normal range, or thyroid function tests outside normal range. 8. ECG abnormalities including but not limited to: bradycardia (&lt;60 bpm); WolffParkinson White syndrome; wide complex tachycardia; 2nd degree, Mobitz type II heart block; 3rd degree heart block; left or right bundle branch block.</criteria>
