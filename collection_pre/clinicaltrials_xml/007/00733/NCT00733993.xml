	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if medicines that affect a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) in the brain called adenosine improve behavioral problems that are related to drug abuse. Another purpose of the study is to find out how genes related to adenosine change how people respond to these medicines. More information about how these medicines change behaviors may be helpful to come up with new treatments for drug abuse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caffeine and Cocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: Aim 1. To characterize the behavioral and subjective effects of acute caffeine administration in cocaine-dependent subjects, using laboratory measures of impulse control, drug discrimination (with d-amphetamine as the training dose), and subjective effects. Hypotheses related to Aim 1: 1. Subjects will show decreases in impulsivity (delay to reward and response inhibition) after acute oral doses of caffeine compared to placebo. 2. Subjects will show some stimulant-like subjective effects following acute oral doses of caffeine, but not the euphoric effects that would predict abuse potential.</detailed_description>
