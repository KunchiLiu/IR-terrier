	<brief_summary>Anesthesia during uterine curettage is a problem. Paracervical block is used in general for such an operation, though, the anesthetic efficacy is incomplete. Propofol is the short-lasting intravenous anesthetic administrated popularly. Sevoflurane is a new inhalational anesthetic well-known for it's "easy come, easy go" property. The investigators hypothesized that propofol, sevoflurane and paracervical block had different anesthetic efficacy during uterine curettage. Which one is the optimal selection for such operation needed to be evaluated.</brief_summary>
