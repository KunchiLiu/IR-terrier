	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between cervical multifidi thickness, cervical spine proprioception and possible reflex activation of cervical multifidi through stimulation of joint mechanoreceptors. Cervical mechanoreceptors will be activated with an innocuous, nonspecific stimulation. Participants will have cervical spine proprioception assessed through joint position sense testing. The multifidus muscle thickness and activation state is to be assessed by sonography. These measures are done pre &amp; post to the innocuous stimulation. There is no specific hypothesis.</brief_summary>
