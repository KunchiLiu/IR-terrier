	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study To Evaluate Effect of Food and Diurnal Variation on ABT-869</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a pharmacokinetic study designed to evaluate the effect of food on the oral bioavailability and effect of diurnal variation on the pharmacokinetics of ABT-869. Triplicate ECG performed to determine the effect of ABT-869 on QT prolongation . Subjects may continue receiving linifanib after completion of the study.</detailed_description>
