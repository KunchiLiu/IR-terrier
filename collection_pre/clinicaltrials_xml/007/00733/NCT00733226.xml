	<brief_title>Effect of OM-85 BV on Wheezing Related Morbidity in Children With Recurrent Wheezing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context: Respiratory infections are the major cause of wheezing attacks in children with recurrent wheezing or asthma in preschool age. OM-85 BV is an bacteria lysate which has been proven to prevent respiratory infections about 40 percent in children. Objective: To determine if using OM-85 BV diminish the number and duration of the respiratory infections and respiratory infection related wheezing attacks,beta-2 agonist and steroid use, and number and duration of hospitalizations in children with recurrent wheezing and asthma. And also to determine if OM-85 BV has any effect on serum cytokine levels after 6 months. Study Design/Setting/Participants: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of OM-85 BV versus placebo for children 6 months to 6 years of age who have respiratory tract infection related recurrent wheezing attacks. Intervention: Participants will receive either active Broncho-Vaxom or placebo for 3 months. Study Measures: They follow up for 1 year for number and duration of wheezing attacks, number, type and duration of respiratory infections, number and duration of beta-2 agonist use, number and duration of steroid use and number and duration of hospitalizations. Serum cytokine levels will measure to determine if Broncho-Vaxom has any effect on serum cytokine levels (at the beginning of the trial and sixth months of the trial).</detailed_description>
