	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as optical coherence tomography, may help find and diagnose lung cancer or precancerous cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well optical coherence tomography of the airway works in detecting abnormal cells in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer or lung disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography of the Airway for Lung Cancer or Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Correlate optical coherence tomography images of the airway with airway histology. - Develop an imaging technique to detect premalignant airway epithelial changes (carcinoma in situ, dysplasia) to study the transformation process as well as intervene and prevent the development of lung cancer. OUTLINE: Bronchoscopic imaging and optical coherence tomography are performed on lung tissue samples collected during surgery. All imaged areas are marked. The marked areas are then excised and fixed in formalin for histopathologic analysis.</detailed_description>
