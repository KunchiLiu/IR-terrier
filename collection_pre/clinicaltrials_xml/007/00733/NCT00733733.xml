	<brief_summary>One of the greatest problems in renal transplantation is the shortage of donor kidneys. Kidneys of non-heart-beating donors (NHB) are a possible solution, but transplantation is accompanied with a high percentage of acute renal failure, caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury. The increased ischemia-reperfusion injury results in an increased immune activation, which can lead to more injury of the kidney and additional acute rejections. The hypothesis of this trial is that ischemia-reperfusion injury can be diminished by ATG. ATG could have additional favourable effects. To investigate this half of the patients is treated with additional ATG to the standard immunosuppressive treatment. Calcineurin inhibitors are not diminished during the first days after transplantation to investigate whether ATG has special effects on ischemia-reperfusion injury.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Nonheartbeatingdonors (Maastricht III/IV) Female patients of childbearing age agree to maintain effective birth control practice during the study. Pregnant or lactating women at the time of randomization. Patients and donors are ABO incompatible. Women having had &gt;3 pregnancies (including abortions if no consistent data on PRA or antidonor antibodies are available). Patients with hypersensibility to rabbit proteins, previous treatment with rabbit IgG, or known intolerance to any component of basal immunosuppression. Patients with leukocytes &lt;3,000/mm3 and/or platelets &lt;50,000/mm3 before initiation of transplant. Patients, who are HIV positive. Patients subjected to previous transplants or candidates for multiple transplants (e.g. SKP). Patients, who are unlikely to comply with the visit schedule in the protocol and patients who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator. Patients with pulmonary oedema or with other signs of overhydration.</criteria>
