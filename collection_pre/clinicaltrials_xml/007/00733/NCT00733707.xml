	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is increased oral contraceptive pill (OCP) adherence in women receiving daily text messaging reminders to take their OCP, compared to women who do not receive reminders. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive daily text messaging reminders to take their OCP will have increased pill adherence compared to women who do not receive reminders. The investigators also hope to determine whether there is a difference in OCP adherence as measured by electronic monitoring device and wireless real-time data collection versus traditional patient pill diaries. The investigators hypothesize that electronic monitoring device and wireless real-time data collection will demonstrate lower adherence compared to traditional patient pill diaries.</brief_summary>
