	<detailed_description>Women will be enrolled in this study during late prenatal care. Consent for placement of the IUD will be verified prior to elective C-section. After removal of the placenta, the copper IUD will be placed through the incision at the fundus and the tail strings will be delivered through the cervix. Data will be collected about patient bleeding and possible infection during the immediate postoperative period. The visibility of the strings will be verified at discharge and at 2 and 6 weeks postpartum. Fundal placement of the IUD will be verified by ultrasound at the patient's last visit.</detailed_description>
