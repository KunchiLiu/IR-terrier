	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous AMD3100 added to a standard G-CSF mobilization regimen of patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation for lymphoma. The investigators hypothesize that after stem cell mobilization with G-CSF plus IV AMD3100, a significantly higher proportion of lymphoma patients will collect ≥ 2 x 10E6 CD34+ cells/kg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous AMD3100 for Collection of Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cells in Patients With Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is indicated for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who have primary progressive disease or who relapse after a chemotherapy-induced complete remission. For these patients, as for other patients undergoing autologous transplantation, the number of CD34+ cells collected is a reliable predictor of neutrophil and platelet (PLT) engraftment after transplantation. AMD3100 (plerixafor) is a promising new mobilizing agent that has demonstrated efficacy in patients with NHL, HL, and multiple myeloma (MM). Although efficacious, the subcutaneous dosing of AMD3100 requires that patients receive the drug in the evening prior to apheresis, which can present logistical problems. Intravenous dosing of AMD3100 may result in a faster rise in peripheral CD34+ cell count, so that the drug can be administered the same day as apheresis. Intravenous dosing may also increase the peak CD34+ cell count, improving the number of CD34+ cells collected via apheresis. This Phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous AMD3100 added to the standard G-CSF mobilization regimen of patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.</detailed_description>

Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at the time of enrollment. Acceptable methods of birth control include oral contraceptive, intrauterine device (IUD), transdermal/implanted or injected contraceptives and abstinence. Males must agree to abstain from sexual activity or agree to utilize a medically approved contraception method during and for 3 months after the treatment period A comorbid condition which, in the view of the investigator, renders the patient at high risk for treatment complications Patients who have failed previous collections A residual acute medical condition resulting from prior chemotherapy Acute infection Fever (temp &gt;38C/100.4F) on the day of start of treatment Positive pregnancy test in female patients Lactating females Patients of child bearing potential unwilling to implement adequate birth control Patients whose actual body weight exceeds 150% of their ideal body weight History of ventricular arrhythmias Patients who previously received experimental therapy within 4 weeks of enrolling in this study or who are currently enrolled in another experimental study during the mobilization phase Patients who have deterioration of their clinical status or laboratory parameters between the time of enrollment and transplantation such that they no longer meet entry criteria may be removed from study at the discretion of the treating physician, principal investigator, or sponsor</criteria>
