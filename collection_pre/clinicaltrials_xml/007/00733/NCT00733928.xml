	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate &amp; compare the performance of the P.F.C. Sigma Knee Cruciate-retaining all-polyethylene and metal-backed tibia components using RSA. The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate the clinical and patient outcomes and survivorship associated with the P.F.C. Sigma Knee Cruciate-retaining all-polyethylene and metal-backed tibia components.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Press Fit Condylar (P.F.C.) Sigma Metal-backed Versus All-poly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using RSA, is it possible to evaluate the performance of both the all polyethylene and metal backed tibia components to determine whether there are differences in migration, if present, across the tibial components. The original protocol intended to perform clinical assessment using the Nottingham Knee Score and the Knee Society Clinical rating system pre-and post-operatively, at six months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. Per Protocol Amendment 01 (effective June 18, 1999) clinical data would also be collected via the SF-12 questionnaire. Radiological evaluation would also use the Knee Society scoring system at the same time points. However, data collected included only the SF-12 and Oxford Knee Scores, comparing change from baseline at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
