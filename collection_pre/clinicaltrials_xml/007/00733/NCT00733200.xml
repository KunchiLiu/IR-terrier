	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma: Minor or Major Liver Resection?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of minor and major hepatectomy selected by predetermined criteria in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC). Summary Background Data: For HC treated with hepatectomy, the extent of liver resection remains controversial despite extensive studies. Methods: From January 2000 to December 2007, we prospectively studied patients who received surgical treatment for HC. Of the 187 patients who were surgically treated, 138 (73.8%) underwent resection with a curative intent. Minor hepatectomy was carried out in 93 patients who had Bismuth-Corlette types I, II and III HC without hepatic artery/portal vein invasion; and major hepatectomy in 45 patients who had type III HC with hepatic artery/portal vein invasion, or type IV HC.</detailed_description>
