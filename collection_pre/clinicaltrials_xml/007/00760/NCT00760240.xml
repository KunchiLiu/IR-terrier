	<brief_summary>The investigators are interested in seeing how people with low vision (decreased visual acuity or restricted visual fields) instill eye drops into their own eyes. The investigators hypothesis is that this population will have more difficulty with self-instillation of drops than a better-seeing population. The investigators aim to explore whatever factors may be involved in preventing this population from getting prescribed eyedrops into their eyes, whether it is more related to visual field or visual acuity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ability of Patients With Low Vision to Properly Instill Eye Drops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study that involves a questionnaire that a study participant fills out, detailing their experience with eyedrops (if any), followed by a video recording of them instilling artificial tears into their worse-seeing eye, with their dominant hand. Patients must have visual acuity worse than 20/60 in at least one eye, and/or have a recent visual field that demonstrated Hodapp criteria for Moderate or Severe visual field damage. This is an observational study of how patients with low vision due to either glaucoma or retinal disease instill eyedrops. Each video will be "graded" by the principal investigator for "success" at instilling eyedrops, and patients will be stratified by their visual acuity or visual field, and whether they have a primary diagnosis of glaucoma or retinal disease.</detailed_description>
