	<brief_summary>This 4 arm study in patients with advanced Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) who failed at least one standard chemotherapy regimen will determine the proportion of patients with progression-free survival at 12 weeks following combination therapy with R1507 and Tarceva or placebo and Tarceva. Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms to receive R1507 (9mg/kg iv) or placebo weekly or R1507 (16mg/kg iv) or placebo every 3 weeks. Tarceva (150mg oral daily) will be administered in all treatment arms. Other disease-related endpoints including overall survival, objective response rate, time to response, time to progressive disease and duration of response will also be evaluated. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is &lt;500 individuals.</brief_summary>
