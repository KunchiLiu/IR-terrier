	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) are correlated with PBMN pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, as well as with the development of severe infectious events in cirrhotic patients with ascites. As a secondary purpose, the study will evaluate the effect of a prophylactic administration of ciprofloxacin on LBP, cytokines and infections in the same patients.</brief_summary>
