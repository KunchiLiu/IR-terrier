	<brief_summary>In this phase II clinical trial, the pharmacokinetics, safety and (short-term) efficacy of higher than standard doses rifampicin will be studied during the intensive phase of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Patients enrolled in this study will either get the standard TB regimen (including 600 mg rifampicin; first study arm), or 900 mg rifampicin plus isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide in standard dosages (second study arm), or 1200 mg rifampicin plus the other drugs in standard dosages (third study arm). All patients will get the standard TB regimen during the continuation phase of treatment.</brief_summary>

Participant is at least 18, but not more than 65 years of age at the day of the first dosing of study medication. Participant is admitted to KNTH or KCMC during the intensive phase of TB treatment.

Participant has been treated with antituberculosis drugs during the past three years. Participant's body weight is less than 50 kg. Participant has abnormal liver function test or serum creatinine (defined as levels higher than the upper limit of normal). Participant has a relevant medical history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion (i.e. chronic gastrointestinal disease, Diabetes Mellitus, renal or hepatic disease, use of concomitant drugs that interfere with the pharmacokinetics of antiTB drugs). Participant is on antiretroviral treatment at inclusion. Participant has a CD4 count less than 350 cells/mm3. Participant has a Karnofsky score of less than 40. Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding. Participant has a Multi Drug Resistant (MDR)TB for which another than the standard treatment regimen is needed.</criteria>
