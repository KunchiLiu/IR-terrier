	<brief_summary>Inflammation in the adipose (fat) tissue is an important condition leading to metabolic derangements and cardiovascular disease in obese patients. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory effects and prevent adipose tissue inflammation in rodent obesity. This study tests the hypothesis that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ameliorate adipose tissue inflammation in morbidly obese patients.</brief_summary>
