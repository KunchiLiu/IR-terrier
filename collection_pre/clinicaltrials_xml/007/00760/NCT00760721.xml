	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to design an intervention to increase hepatitis B (HBV) screening among Korean Americans. The investigators will design a culturally specific intervention (educational sessions) and test the effect of the intervention on 1200 Korean Americans. All subjects will be interviewed before the intervention/control sessions and 6 months after the sessions to assess HBV screening levels in the two groups. Self-reported HBV screening will be verified by a review of subjects' medical records. The primary study hypothesis is that the intervention group will have a higher rate of HBV serologic testing at follow-up compared to the control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to design an intervention to increase hepatitis B (HBV) screening among Korean Americans. The investigators will design a culturally specific intervention; an educational small group discussion led by a trained Korean leader. The effect of the intervention will be tested on 1200 Korean Americans. Subjects will be recruited at Korean churches and invited to join a one-hour discussion of health issues with other members of their church. One half of the subjects will participate in the intervention group. These subjects will discuss HBV and will receive resources related to HBV and where to obtain screening. The other half of the subjects will participate in the control group. These subjects will discuss nutrition and physical activity and will receive resources related to these topics, but not related to HBV and where to obtain screening. All subjects will be interviewed before the sessions and 6 months after the sessions to assess HBV screening levels in the two groups. Self-reported HBV screening will be verified by a review of subjects' medical records. The primary study hypothesis is that the intervention group will have a higher rate of HBV serologic testing at follow-up compared to the control group. Secondary hypotheses are: The intervention group will have a higher level of knowledge of hepatitis B and liver cancer at follow-up compared to the control group. The effect of the intervention on hepatitis B serologic testing will be mediated by knowledge of hepatitis B and liver cancer.</detailed_description>
