	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of TAK-583 in Subjects With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic polyneuropathy is a frequent complication in individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, and can result in progressive functional and structural deficits in both somatic and autonomic nerves. Diabetic polyneuropathy is characterized by degenerative changes in nerve fibers resulting in progressive functional and structural deficits in both somatic and autonomic nerves. TAK-583 is a synthetic compound currently under development for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAK-583 for the treatment of mild to moderate diabetic polyneuropathy in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study participation is anticipated to be about 8 months.</detailed_description>
