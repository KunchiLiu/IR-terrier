	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect that placement and power of the AcrySof Toric has on post-operative visual acuity and spectacle independence for distance vision. This will be determined by comparing manifest refraction pre-operatively and post-operatively and by evaluating the rotational stability of the lens over time.</brief_summary>
