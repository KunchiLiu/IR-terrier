	<brief_title>Trial of Decitabine in Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of this trial are: - To generate additional information about the overall safety profile, - To generate safety information of hepatically or renally impaired patients, as appropriate, and - To generate safety information when patients are also taking concomitant medications and/or therapies without trial restrictions when decitabine is administered at a dose of 20 mg/m² over a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks in patients with MDS or AML (≥ 30% blasts). The purpose of this open-label, expanded-access trial is to provide decitabine to patients with AML or MDS who have completed participation per protocol in the DACO-018 study and for whom continuation of treatment with decitabine is indicated, per the opinion of the investigator. In order to continue treatment with decitabine, at a minimum, there must be no disease progression while the patient was participating in the DACO-018 trial and during the period after the patient discontinued from the DACO-018 study and before entering this trial. Patients must enroll in this trial within 8 weeks of discontinuing from the DACO-018 study and not have received any other chemotherapy for their disease during this interim period. Decitabine will be administered at a dose of 20 mg/m² over a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

Must not have received in the period after discontinuation from DACO018 and enrollment into this trial any other chemotherapy agent, including investigational agents, for their disease. 3.
