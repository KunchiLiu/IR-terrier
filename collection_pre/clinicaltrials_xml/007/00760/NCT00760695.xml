	<detailed_description>The goals of this study are to reveal through a pilot trial if treatment of patients with severe chronic AN with Marinol® (dronabinol, a CB1 agonist) has significant effect on: - Weight - Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) scale - Motor and inner restlessness (estimated by accelerometry) - Endocrine parameters (see below, paragraph 4.4) This study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled cross over study. 24 patients with chronic AN meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized either to receive Marinol® or placebo. After four weeks the two groups will undergo a wash-out period and after that will receive the opposite therapeutic regime for another four weeks.</detailed_description>
