	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study was to determine the rate of confirmed best cumulative complete molecular response (CMR) within the first year of study therapy with imatinib or nilotinib. The study also explored the impact and significance of the achieved CMR on patient outcomes (progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), characterized the kinetics of CMR achieved in both treatment arms and after the cross-over.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia associated with BCRABL quantifiable by RQPCR Documented CCyR by bone marrow or BCRABL&lt;1% IS in the past 12 months Persistent disease demonstrated by two PCR positive tests 3 months apart both during the past 6 months. Treatment with imatinib for at least 2 years with 400 mg or 600 mg and a stable dose No other current or planned antileukemia therapies Patient has evidence of rising PCR (a confirmed &gt;1 log increase in previous 6 months) Patient has received another investigational agent within last 6 months or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) other than imatinib Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation Impaired cardiac function including any one of the following: Inability to monitor the QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) Long QT syndrome or a known family history of long QT syndrome. Clinically significant resting brachycardia (&lt;50 beats per minute) QTc &gt; 450 msec on baseline ECG (using the QTcF formula). If QTcF &gt;450 msec and electrolytes are not within normal ranges, electrolytes should be corrected and then the patient rescreened for QTc Myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to starting study Other clinically significant uncontrolled heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension) History of or presence of clinically significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmias Administration of cytokine therapy (e.g. GCSF, GMCSF or SCF) within 4 weeks prior to study entry</criteria>
