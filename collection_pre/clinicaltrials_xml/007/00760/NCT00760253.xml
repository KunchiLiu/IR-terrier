	<brief_title>Compare the Side Effects and Difference Awake Level of Three TCI Propofol Formula in TVOR Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transvaginal oocyte retrieval (TVOR) is a procedure often used in infertility women . During the procedure, sedation, analgesia or anesthesia are often required. Propofol and alfentanyl are used for these patients for years, but these drugs are used in intravenous form and can be found in follicular fluid. Although further investigation needs to be undertaken to investigate any potential influence on fertilization and implantation rates, we anesthesiologist want to lower the use of drugs in these women. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps can estimate and calculate the target and plasma concentration of propofol. By using these pumps , we can estimate the stable concentration of drugs. Besides, Bispectral index (BIS) monitor can help us to evaluate awareness or unarousable amnesia when we turn lower the drug use and keep patients amnesia during the procedure. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor (tcCO2) can mimic the level of CO2 in patients by using noninvasive method. During anesthesia, CO2 will retain and may induce CO2 nacrosis, so we use these noninvasive method to help us to detect CO2 level preventing CO2 nacrosis and to see if there are any relationship with BIS.</detailed_description>
