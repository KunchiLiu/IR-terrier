	<brief_summary>Newly developed diagnostic parameters have potential to differentiate between epicardial disease and microvascular dysfunction with the help of anatomical details and physiological endpoints and can be used in present clinical settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurements to Assess Severity of Epicardial Stenoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pressure drop coefficient (CDP) is a functional index based on hyperemic dp and u measurements. The lesion flow coefficient (LFC) combines the functional index CDP with an atomic measure (percentage area stenosis) as a single parameter.</detailed_description>
