	<brief_summary>This study is a global, multicenter, open-label phase 1b and randomized, double-blinded, 2 part, phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rilotumumab or ganitumab in combination with panitumumab versus panitumumab alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors are wild-type KRAS status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab Combination Study With Rilotumumab or Ganitumab in Wild-type Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 3 parts: Part 1: determination of the tolerable dose of rilotumumab in combination with panitumumab to be administered in Part 2. Part 2: Comparison of the safety and efficacy of rilotumumab or ganitumab in combination with panitumumab versus that of panitumumab alone. In Part 2, participants were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 cohorts: 6 mg/kg panitumumab plus 10 mg/kg rilotumumab, 6 mg/kg panitumumab plus 12 mg/kg ganitumab, or 6 mg/kg panitumumab and placebo (panitumumab alone cohort). Panitumumab was administered open-label, and rilotumumab and ganitumab were double-blinded. Part 3: Exploratory evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the rilotumumab and ganitumab monotherapy following treatment with panitumumab in Part 2. In Part 3, eligible participants who terminated panitumumab treatment in the Panitumumab Alone arm of Part 2 due to disease progression or intolerability could be randomized 1:1 into 2 double-blind cohorts: 10 mg/kg rilotumumab or 12 mg/kg ganitumab. Participants who permanently discontinued all the investigational products completed a safety follow-up visit 30 days and a follow-up visit 60 days after the last dose of investigational product. Participants were followed for radiographic disease progression and survival every 3 months after the 30-day safety follow-up visit for up to 2 years after the last participant was enrolled in Part 2.</detailed_description>
