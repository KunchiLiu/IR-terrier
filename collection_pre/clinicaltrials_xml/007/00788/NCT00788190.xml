	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to create and test a treatment algorithm to guide the treatment of distal radius fractures in patients 65 and older and to obtain level-one evidence to determine the best method of treating distal radius fractures in this growing population demographic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Distal radius fractures with borderline alignment will be randomized to surgical intervention or conservative treatment. - Patients will fill out subjective questionnaires at 0, 6weeks, 3months, 6 months, and 1 year. - Patients will perform objective strength tests, dexterity tests and have their range of motion tested at 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.</detailed_description>
