	<brief_summary>Objectives: 1. To explore current lifestyle practices, health status, and quality of life among childhood cancer survivors and parent/guardians who are identified as "primary caregivers." 2. To explore childhood cancer survivors' and "primary caregivers'" awareness of future health risks. 3. To explore interest in various lifestyle interventions and delivery channels among childhood cancer survivors and their "primary caregivers." 4. To explore factors which may serve as mediators or moderators of future lifestyle interventions that target childhood cancer survivors and their "primary caregivers," e.g., strength of the caregiver-child bond, geographic distance from one another, and level of education.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Childhood Cancer Survivor Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A mailed survey will be conducted that will assess the health behaviors (diet, exercise, and tobacco-use) of childhood cancer survivors, and the behaviors of identified "primary caregivers" (see definition under inclusion criteria). In addition, these surveys will assess awareness of longterm health risks, quality of life (QOL), strength of the child-caregiver bond, body image, body weight status, functional status, barriers to lifestyle change, and interest in various lifestyle interventions and potential channels for delivery. Mailed surveys (with telephone follow-up) will be sent to MDACC childhood cancer survivors diagnosed from 1998 - 2007 who are survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, sarcomas, lymphoma or leukemia.</detailed_description>
