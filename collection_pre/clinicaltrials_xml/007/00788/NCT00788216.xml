	<brief_summary>Purposes of this study: 1) To define comprehensive set of descriptive health states related to treatment of cervical cancer (e.g. radical hysterectomy, whole pelvic radiation, brachytherapy, chemoradiation) 2) To define set of descriptive health states related to adverse events associated w treatment of cervical cancer (i.e. bladder dysfunction, pain, enteritis, fistula formation) &amp; 3) To derive, using a validated method, a set of QoL related utility scores corresponding to these health states.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development &amp; Validation of Utilities for Health States Relevant to Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will valuate cervical cancer-related health states using the visual analog score (VAS) and TTO (TTO) methods. The subject will be asked to read a pertinent health state description and listen while it is read aloud. She will first be asked to place the state on a continuum (VAS) from zero to 100, with 100 presenting perfect health and zero presenting death. The TTO interview will then be administered. The subject will be asked to assume a remaining life expectancy of 30 years, and to choose between 30 years in the health state described or 29 years in a state of perfect health. The utility of the health state, a number between zero and one, is calculated as the minimum number of years the patient would accept divided by 30. Each subject will be asked to review and valuate 20 health states over the course of 60-90 minutes.</detailed_description>
