	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to rigorously test the incremental impact of simple, generalizable interventions to improve healthcare among older women at high risk for osteoporosis. Building on the experience of our University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) interdisciplinary team we have designed an innovative, scientifically rigorous, and highly feasible implementation research project in partnership with two Kaiser Permanente (KP) research centers. Kaiser Permanente, one of the Nation's largest Healthcare Organizations, uses an integrated electronic medical record (EMR), with full capture of pharmacy, clinical (including BMD results), and claims data, and cares for a racially/ethnically, socio-economically, and geographically diverse population. To address innovative questions in implementation research, we will perform a multi-modal group randomized trial involving over 18,000 patients seen by over 330 primary care providers (PCPs) at 25 KP facilities in the Northwest and Southeast. If proven effective, our system-centered and patient-centered approach will advance the state of implementation science and be applicable to evidence implementation in other musculoskeletal disorders and to other health care settings.</brief_summary>
