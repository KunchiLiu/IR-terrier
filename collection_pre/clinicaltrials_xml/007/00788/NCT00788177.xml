	<criteria>Adults aged 50 years and older with neovascular AMD proven by FA Patients who at baseline Have a BCVA letter score in the study eye between 20/40 to 20/320 using an ETDRS chart measured at 4 meters or Snellen equivalent Have a CNV lesion of any type in the study eye with the following characteristics as determined by fluorescein angiography: Evidence that CNV extends under the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone. Previous stateoftheart therapy for the disease is deemed ineffective with following characteristics are given: Loss of visual acuity (2 or more Snellen lines) in the previous 3 months defined as either OR ≥10% increase in the lesion diameter as assessed by fluorescein angiography in the previous 3 months Ability of subject to understand character and individual consequences of clinical trial.

History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any drug with similar chemical structure or to any excipient present in the pharmaceutical form of the investigational medicinal product. Participation in other clinical trials during the present clinical trial or within the last 3 months.
