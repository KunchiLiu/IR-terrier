	<brief_title>A Comparison of Beclomethasone Aqueous Spray and Aerosol Delivery Systems in Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aqueous and aerosol delivery of intranasal corticosteroids has never been directly compared previously in patients with nasal polyps and it is unknown whether one is superior. This objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal beclomethasone by two different delivery systems, aerosol and aqueous spray in patients with nasal polyps. Primary endpoint is the difference in the overall quality of life as measured by the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire. The secondary endpoint is the change in Nasal Airflow Resistance as measured by rhinomanometry.</detailed_description>
