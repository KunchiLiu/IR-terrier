	<brief_summary>Open fracture wounds are a constant challenge to orthopaedic surgeons, with infections a common complication. There is currently little evidence as to which is the most effective way to wash out these wounds. This study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study. The infection rates will be compared between irrigation using high pressure versus low pressure versus gravity flow, and also saline versus a soap solution as the irrigation solution. The results from this study will help to determine the best method of washing out open fractures wounds. In this study, all open wounds will be washed out using methods commonly used by orthopaedic surgeons</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Men or women who are skeletally mature. 2. Fracture of any extremity with complete radiographs. 3. Open fractures (GustiloAnderson Types IIIIB) (Table 2)*. 4. Fracture requiring operative fixation. 5. Provision of informed consent. 1. Open fractures with an associated vascular deficit (GustiloAnderson Type IIIC). 2. Known allergy to detergents or castile soap ingredients. 3. Previous wound infection or history of osteomyelitis in the injured extremity. 4. Previous fracture with retained hardware in injured extremity that will interfere with new implant fixation. 5. Surgical delay to operative wound management greater than 24 hours from hospital admission. 6. Use of immunosuppressive medication within 6 months. 7. Immunological deficient disease conditions (e.g. HIV). 8. Fracture of the hand (metacarpals and phalanges). 9. Fracture of the toes (phalanges). 10. Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigators, with maintaining followup. We will, for example, exclude patients with no fixed address, those who report a plan to move out of town in the next year, or intellectually challenged patients without adequate family support. 11. Previous randomization in this study or a competing study.</criteria>
