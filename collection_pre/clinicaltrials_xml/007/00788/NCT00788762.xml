	<brief_summary>Taxiarchis, a small village in Northern Greece with 1060 inhabitants, was considered to have a surprisingly high incidence of glaucoma. This isolated population located on Mount Holomondas appeared to be enriched for familial glaucoma. Based upon the high reported incidence of glaucoma in Taxiarchis and previous findings of the Thr377Met myocilin mutation in the Greek population,the investigators undertook a community-based study to determine if this variant was present in this village.</brief_summary>
