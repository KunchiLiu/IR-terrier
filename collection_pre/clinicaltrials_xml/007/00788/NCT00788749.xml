	<brief_summary>This is the first randomized parallel group clinical trial looking at oral prednisolone induced medical nasal polypectomy followed by maintenance on topical steroid therapy in patients with nasal polyposis. This study also looks at the effect of aspirin sensitivity and the factors linking nasal polyps with asthma. We have also taken baseline measurements of a variety of blood, surface and biopsy markers to assess for potential to predict steroid response. Finally, the still unchartered link between nasal polyps and asthma will be explored by measuring Staphylococcal superantigens in serum before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
