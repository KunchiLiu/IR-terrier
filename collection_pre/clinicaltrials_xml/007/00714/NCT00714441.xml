	<brief_summary>To date, there have been few practical, evidenced based interventions that are directed at patients with Type II Diabetes who are experiencing depressed and/or emotional distress in primary care settings. This study will (1) combine two existing, evidenced-based, interventions (a computer automated, diabetes specific self-management program (CASM) vs. a self-care program plus a live problem solving distress-reduction program (CAPS) vs. a lifestyle and activities education program (LEAP-AHEAD)) into a practical, 3-arm clinical trial with a highly distressed multi-ethnic patient sample, and (2) evaluate the intervention using the RE-AIM framework, sharing the results through a comprehensive dissemination package. Hypothesis 1: The combined CASM and CAPS arms will be superior to the LEAP-AHEAD group on the primary outcomes at follow-up. Hypothesis 2: The CAPS arm will be superior to the CASM arm on primary outcomes at follow-up.</brief_summary>
