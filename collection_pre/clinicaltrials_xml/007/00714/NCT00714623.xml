	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label registry of consecutive patients with CAD treated by stent-assisted PCI using at least one CypherTM stent. Up to 1000 pts will be included in the registry. The registry is conducted for the evaluation of the impact of CypherTM Sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in the "real world" of interventional cardiology. Informed consent will be obtained from patients meeting the inclusion criteria before the initiation of any study specific procedures. Consecutive patients treated with the use of the CypherTM stent will be included in the registry. Baseline and post-procedure blood samples will be used to perform platelet function analysis using the Accumetrics Ultegra RPFA (Rapid Platelet Function Assay). All patients will be followed from enrollment through the hospital discharge for any clinically significant event (death, myocardial infarction, TLR, TVR, major or minor bleeding). A follow-up telephone assessment of death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and medical treatment will be conducted by experienced research personnel at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year and at least 2 years. All site reported deaths, myocardial infarctions and revascularizations will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee for all 1000 patients enrolled in the trial. An interim analysis of the first 750 patients will be conducted and data forwarded to FDA.</brief_summary>
