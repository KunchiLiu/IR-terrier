	<brief_summary>The object of this research study is to test a standardized set of acupuncture points on migraine patients to reduce frequency and intensity of headaches. Acupuncture has been studied in prior research but the treatment points have varied between subjects, making it difficult to replicate studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Set Point Acupuncture for Migraines Using a Digital Assistant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be recording daily headache activity on personal digital assistants (PDA's) for 12 weeks before and 12 weeks after 8 weeks of acupuncture intervention. MIDAS, HIT-6 and BDI-II measurements will be done at the beginning of the study (12 weeks pre-intervention), directly before the intervention, directly after, and 12 weeks post-intervention. Measurements will be compared before and after intervention. This is a follow-up to a successful earlier study when these same acupuncture points were used on subjects with chronic daily headache, the majority being migraine.</detailed_description>
