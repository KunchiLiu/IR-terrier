	<brief_summary>Two investigational chemical tracers, 62Cu-ethylglyoxal bis(thiosemicarbazone) (62Cu-ETS) and 15O-water, will be used in this study to look at how blood moves through the kidneys. The purpose of the study is to see if 62Cu-ETS is effective in showing the blood supply to the kidneys compared to 15O-water. The tracer mixes with the blood and moves through the body. Using positron emission tomography (PET scan) the researchers can see the tracer and can learn more about how the blood moves through the kidneys. The study invites participants who are healthy, without any heart or kidney disease, patients who have kidney disease that require dialysis, and patients who may have a blockage in one of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys.</brief_summary>
