	<brief_summary>Our objective is to develop intuitive, meaningful and ergonomically efficient informative displays specific to the user's domain. Specifically we aim to enhance and refine the display prototype of ABG information to include gas-exchange, acid-base balance, lung mechanics, ventilation, oxygenation, and metabolism information.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To create an intuitive and meaningful visualization of Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) variables, it is necessary to address usability, ergonomics, domain specific, and expertise specific issues and concerns. Our objective is to develop intuitive, meaningful and ergonomically efficient informative displays specific to the user's domain. Specifically we aim to enhance and refine the display prototype of ABG information to include gas-exchange, acid-base balance, lung mechanics, ventilation, oxygenation, and metabolism information.</detailed_description>
