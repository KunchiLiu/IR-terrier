	<brief_title>Treatment of Adolescent Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition associated with irregular menstrual cycles, (due to lack of regular ovulation), and evidence of elevated androgen (male hormone) levels, such as unwanted hair growth or acne. This condition often becomes recognized at the time of puberty. The standard treatment for this condition is oral contraceptive pills, which are used not for contraception, but to cause a regular, monthly bleeding pattern. Many adolescents with PCOS have increased levels of insulin, a hormone that controls the body's sugar balance. These increased insulin levels may play a role in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome. There are several medications now available, which can decrease the insulin levels by improving the action of insulin in the body. Metformin is one of these drugs. Metformin is a drug currently used in the management of diabetes to control blood sugar. It is hoped that by lowering the insulin levels some of the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as the lack of regular periods and unwanted hair growth, can be reversed or diminished.</detailed_description>
