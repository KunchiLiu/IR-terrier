	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of once daily [q.d] subcutaneous [s.c.] injections of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) with q.d. s.c. injections of Enoxaparin for the primary prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events [VTE] in patients hospitalized for acute medical illness. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of AVE5026 and to document AVE5026 exposure in this population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomization had to take place just prior to the first study drug injection. The total duration of observation per participant was 35-42 days from randomization broken down as follows: - 10 to 14-day double-blind treatment period; - 25 to 32-day follow-up period. Mandatory bilateral compression ultrasound [CUS] had to be performed between 10 to 15 days after randomization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with an acute medical condition requiring bed rest for at least 3 days, and hospitalized for at least one of the following medical conditions: Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III/IV); Acute respiratory failure (not requiring mechanical ventilation); Acute infection (without septic shock)*; Acute rheumatic disorder*; Acute episode of inflammatory bowel disease*. Patient with one of these conditions should have at least one additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) among the following: Age â‰¥ 75 years; Active cancer or myeloproliferative disorders (having received treatment for cancer within the last 6 months); Previous VTE; Obesity; Oral hormone therapy (antiandrogen or estrogen); Chronic heart failure; Chronic respiratory failure. Previous surgery with general anesthesia within 30 days before inclusion in the study; Patient requiring a curative anticoagulant or thrombolytic treatment; Patient at risk of bleeding; Stroke; Known hypersensitivity to heparin or enoxaparin sodium; End stage renal disease or patient on dialysis. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
