	<brief_title>Evaluation of Information Displays-A Paper, Computer and Simulator Based Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typically information monitors present numeric values, waveforms, alarms and informative sounds in a single sensor single indicator manner (5). In an effort to improve the situational awareness of the end user (6), we design and develop various visual metaphors and audible representations of information to communicate the past, present, and future status of a complex system. Our studies will identify the visual and auditory elements that optimize the presentation of critical domain specific information in an intuitive, meaningful manner as well as communicate critical events efficiently and saliently as they arise.</detailed_description>
