	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of internal radiation therapy when given with or without external-beam radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy With or Without External-Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the tolerability of 2 radiotherapeutic regimens (high dose-rate brachytherapy [HDR] with or without image-guided intensity-modulated hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy [EBRT]), as measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0), in patients with localized prostate cancer. Secondary - Identify any associations between dose-volume parameters for organs at risk and the rate and severity of genitourinary or gastrointestinal adverse events. - Evaluate patient preference with regard to selection of a second treatment (a second HDR brachytherapy session or an EBRT session). - Evaluate patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by validated HRQOL instruments for 5 years. - Describe the probability of freedom from biochemical and clinical failure. - Describe the probability of freedom from salvage androgen suppression. OUTLINE: Patients undergo high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (2 fractions ≥ 5 hours apart). Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of the first HDR brachytherapy session, patients undergo either a second session of HDR brachytherapy (2 fractions ≥ 5 hours apart) OR image-guided intensity-modulated hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to the second treatment session, at 1 and 6 months after completion of treatment, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2 years. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2 years.</detailed_description>
