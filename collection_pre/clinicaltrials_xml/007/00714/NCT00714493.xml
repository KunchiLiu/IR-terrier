	<brief_title>RESTART C0168Z05 Rheumatoid Arthritis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 4, multi center, open-label, assessor blinded, switch study of infliximab in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are receiving methotrexate and are having an inadequate response to their current treatment with etanercept or adalimumab. The last dose of etanercept must have been at least 1 week but not more than 2 weeks prior to the first infliximab study infusion. The last dose of adalimumab must have been administered at least 2 weeks but not more than 4 weeks prior to the first infliximab study infusion. The study will be conducted for 30 weeks and will include 200 patients. All eligible patients will receive 3 mg/kg infliximab infusions (drug given into a vein) at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter, if they achieve a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response on their current dose of infliximab. Patients who do not achieve a EULAR response will increase their dose from 3mg/kg to 5 mg/kg at week 14. Patients who do not achieve a EULAR response at week 22 will increase from either 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg or from 5mg/kg to 7 mg/kg. The last study infusion will take place at week 22. The last study visit for effectiveness evaluations will take place at week 26. A week 30 follow-up visit will be performed for adverse events and tuberculosis evaluations, health economics assessments, and review of concomitant medications. All patients who end the study early will be required to complete all assessments. Patients will receive 3 mg/kg infliximab infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 6. If patients achieve European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, they will remain on their current dose. Patients who do not demonstrate a EULAR response will increase their infliximab dose from 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg at week 14. At week 22, patients will also increase their infliximab dose from 3 mg/kg to 5mg/kg or from 5 mg/kg to 7mg/kg if they do not demonstrate a EULAR response.</detailed_description>
