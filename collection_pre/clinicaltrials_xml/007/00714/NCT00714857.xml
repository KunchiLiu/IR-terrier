	<brief_summary>Dexmedetomidine is a new, highly selective and potent alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist registered for sedation of patients in intensive care units. Although the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine have been studied previously also in an ICU setting, there is no information on the pharmacokinetics of long-lasting (&gt;48 hours) dexmedetomidine infusions in humans. The aim of this study is to study the pharmacokinetics of long-lasting dexmedetomidine infusions in ICU patients using the population pharmacokinetics approach.</brief_summary>
