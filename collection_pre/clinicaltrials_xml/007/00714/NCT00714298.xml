	<brief_summary>Early diagnostic of non ST elevation coronary syndrome in patients admitted to the emergency room is difficult. Two news biochemical markers have been assessed and studies have suggested that heart fatty binding protein and ischemia modified albumin are early markers of myocardial necrosis and myocardial ischemia. The aim of the study is to analyse the predictive value of association of heart fatty binding protein and ischemia modified albumin for non ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome diagnosis in the first hour of management in the emergency room.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early diagnostic of non ST elevation coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients admitted to the emergency room is difficult. Two news biochemical markers have been assessed and studies have suggested that heart fatty binding protein and ischemia modified albumin are early markers of myocardial necrosis and myocardial ischemia. Study objective: The aim of the study is to analyse the predictive value of association of heart fatty binding protein and ischemia modified albumin for non ST segment elevation ACS diagnosis in the first hour of management in emergency room. Methods: In a prospective double blind study, initial heart fatty binding protein and ischemia modified albumin levels will be measured in consecutive patients admitted in the emergency room with chest pain and suspected non-ST elevation ACS. Data including history, physical examination, serial 12-lead ECG and troponin-I measurement at 0 and 6 hours after admission will be collected by the treating physician blinded to the result of the markers. Based on hospital diagnosis algorithm (troponin repeated measurements, treadmill test or other ischemia detection, coronarography if necessary) and follow-up at one month, patients will be classified as having or no non-ST elevation ACS by two independent physicians blinded to the results of markers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values will be determined for each marker and in combined analyses.</detailed_description>
