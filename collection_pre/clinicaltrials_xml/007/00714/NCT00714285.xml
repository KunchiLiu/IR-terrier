	<criteria>Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. A male or female between, and including, 18 and 60 years of age at the time of the vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential, if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the administration of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 3 months prior to administration of the vaccine. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen in the study protocol from 30 days before vaccination up to 21 days post vaccination. Confirmed influenza infection within a year preceding the study start. Administration of an influenza vaccine during Northern Hemisphere season 20072008. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). History of hypersensitivity to a previous dose of influenza vaccine Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study. History of administration of experimental/licensed vaccine.</criteria>
