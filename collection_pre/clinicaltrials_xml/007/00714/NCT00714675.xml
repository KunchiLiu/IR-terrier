	<brief_title>Citrulline and Protein Metabolism in the Malnourished Elderly People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malnutrition in the elderly causes an important public health problem because their response to re nutrition is highly decreased. Several experimental studies have shown that an amino acid named citrulline could avoid this, by restoring protein synthesis. The treated group will receive each morning for three weeks a supplementation of 10 g of citrulline and the control group, non essential amino acids in iso-nitrogenous quantity to the 10g of citrulline. During the three weeks of supplementation, clinical tolerance and physical exercise will be evaluated regularly. On the 21st day, whole body protein synthesis rate in the post-absorptive state will be measured by the isotopic dilution of L-leucine (1-13C expressed in g / kg of lean mass / 24h) as well as other parameters of the protein turn-over in the post-absorptive and post-prandial state.</detailed_description>
