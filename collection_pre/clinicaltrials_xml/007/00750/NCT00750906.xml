	<detailed_description>Patients will receive the anesthetic that is traditionally given which includes appropriate doses of succinylcholine. Serum potassium and creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels will be determined pre and post anesthesia; serum and urine myoglobin will be determined post anesthesia.

In addition patients will be asked about the presence of muscle pain (myalgia) 1 hour before discharge from the recovery room and the following day post ECT.</detailed_description>
