	<brief_title>A Comparison of Two Different Surgical Techniques for Total Hip Resurfacing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Theoretical considerations of RECAP procedures through anterolateral trochanteric osteotomy: - Less bone resection, less complicated revision surgery. - Reduced stress shielding of the femur. - Lower incidence of hip dislocations. - Walking function improved by change in mobilisation regime and operative technique. - Risk of femoral neck fracture is reduced by preoperative measurement of bone density. - Risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head is reduced with the anterolateral approach preserving femoral head blood supply and preventing later failure of the implant.</detailed_description>
