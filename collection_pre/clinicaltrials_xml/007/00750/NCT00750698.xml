	<brief_summary>Preclinical studies have shown that SNDX-275 is able to reactivate the expression of EGFR, E-cadherin and ErbB3 expression. The combination of SNDX-275 with erlotinib (an EGFRi) in patients who are progressing on erlotinib will show measurable activity as evidenced by the disease control rate and with an acceptable safety profile.</brief_summary>

Paraffinembedded tumor specimen available for correlative studies 7. Male or female over 18 years of age 8. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; platelets ≥ 75 x 10⁹/L; ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10⁹/L without the use of hematopoietic growth factors 9. Coagulation tests within the normal range 10. Bilirubin and creatinine less than 2 times the upper limit of normal for the institution 11. AST and ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of normal for the institution 12. Potassium, magnesium and phosphorus within the normal range for the institution (supplementation is permissible) 13. Willing to use accepted and effective methods of contraception during the study (both men and women as appropriate) and for 3 months after the last dose of SNDX275 14. Patient or legally acceptable representative has granted written informed consent before any studyspecific procedure (including special screening tests) is performed EXCLUSION: 1. Prior stem cell transplant 2. Symptomatic CNS involvement 3. Prior treatment with an HDAC inhibitor 4. Concurrent anticancer therapy, with the exception of radiotherapy for a nontarget study lesion 5. Currently taking medication(s) on the prohibited medication list 6. Systemic chemotherapy or treatment with an investigational agent within 28 days before enrollment 7. Current use of valproic acid 8. Untreated or unstable brain metastases, or taken steroids for this condition within 4 weeks of study drug administration 9. Currently active second malignancy, or any malignancy within the last 5 years other than cured basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ, or superficial bladder cancer 10. Inability to swallow oral medications or a gastrointestinal malabsorption condition 11. Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, known HIV infection, or active hepatitis B or C infection 12. Abnormal cardiac function as defined as clinically significant findings on ECG (multifocal PVCs, STT wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction or acute ischemia, QTc greater than 500 milliseconds), tachycardia, or left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% on MUGA scan 13. Another serious or uncontrolled medical condition within 3 months of enrollment such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or suppressed immune system 14. Known hypersensitivity to benzamides 15. Morbid obesity 16. Women who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding 17. Patient is currently enrolled in (or completed within 28 days) another investigational drug study 18. Patient unavailable for onstudy or followup assessments 19. Patient has any kind of medical, psychiatric, or behavioral disorder that places the patient at increased risk for study participation or compromises the ability of the patient to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures and requirements</criteria>
