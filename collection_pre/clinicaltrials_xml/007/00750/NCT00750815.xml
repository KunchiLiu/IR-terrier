	<brief_summary>Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapy agent with known activity in myeloma. The new regimen that we will test in this study is called CVDD and contains Cyclophosphamide with Bortezomib (VELCADE), Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (DOXIL®, PLD), and Dexamethasone (VDD). The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of another type of chemotherapy agent, Cyclophosphamide, to the regimen VDD (CVDD) is well tolerated and improves response rates in myeloma. We will also find the highest safe dose of the study drugs taken together that a patient can tolerate, and how long it takes for multiple myeloma patients to respond after they have taken the study drugs and how long the response lasts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide, VELCADE, DOXIL, and Dexamethasone, (CVDD) in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Multiple Myeloma (MM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first cohort of 3 participants enrolled into Phase I of the study will receive dose level 1. A full safety evaluation will be conducted when these participants have completed one cycle (21 days) of combination therapy. Further patient accrual will be suspended while the safety data is evaluated at each dose level. Dose escalation for subsequent patients will proceed through dose levels 2, 3 and 4 as follows: - If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is reported in the first 3 participants at a dose level, that dose level will be considered safe and 3 participants will be enrolled at the next dose level. If 1/3 participants in a cohort at a dose level has a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to obtain 6 evaluable participants. - If &gt; 1 of 3 participants in a cohort experience DLT, that dose level will not be considered safe. No further dose escalation will take place, and the immediate lower dose level will be considered the maximum planned dose (MPD) if 6 patients had been enrolled at that dose level. Otherwise, expand the immediate lower dose level to 6 evaluable patients*. - If there are &lt; 2 participants with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable participants, a cohort of 3 participants will be enrolled in the next higher dose level. - If there are 2 or more participants with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable participants, that dose level will not be considered safe. No further dose escalation will take place, and the immediate lower dose level will be considered the MPD if 6 patients had been enrolled at that dose level. Otherwise, expand the immediate lower dose level to 6 evaluable patients*. - * If DLT occurs in no more than 1 patient in the expanded dose cohort, then that dose level will be considered MPD. Otherwise, the dose will be further de-escalated in a similar fashion until the MPD is reached.</detailed_description>

In the presence of liver metastases, AST / ALT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin must not exceed 3x upper limit of normal (i.e.: must be ≤ 3x ULN). Adequate bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm³ (1.0 x 10^9/L). Patients with bone marrow &gt;50% plasma cells are permitted to have a neutrophil count of &lt; 1,000 cells/mm³. Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm³.

A MUGA scan or 2 d Echocardiogram may be used, but the same test must be used throughout study) to evaluate LVEF. Women of childbearing potential(WCBP)† must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test 10 to 14 days prior to starting therapy. Patients with reproductive potential must use an adequate contraceptive method during treatment and for 3 months after completing treatment. In addition, sexually active WCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods per the requirements outlined in protocol document. Patients treated with local radiotherapy with or without concomitant exposure to steroids, for pain control or management of cord/nerve root compression, are eligible. 4 weeks must have lapsed since last date of radiotherapy. Patients who require concurrent radiotherapy should have entry to the protocol deferred until radiotherapy is completed and 4 weeks have passed since last date of therapy. Ongoing severe infection requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment Life expectancy &lt; 3 months Prior malignancy, except; adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, insitu cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the participant has been diseasefree for at least 5 years. Concurrent prostate cancer for which patient is receiving therapy will not be considered an exclusion if prostatic specific antigen (PSA) has been stable for 3 years.

Lactating females must agree not to breastfeed. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the participant at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
