	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically inoperable patients with centrally located stage I non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I) - To determine the efficacy of SBRT when administered at the MTD in these patients. (Phase I) - To estimate the local control rate of SBRT at the MTD in these patients. (Phase II) Secondary - To estimate the rates of adverse events (other than dose-limiting toxicity) of ≥ grade 3 that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment and that occurs within 1 year after the start of SBRT in these patients. - To estimate the rates of late adverse events (i.e., occurs &gt; 1 year after the start of SBRT) in these patients. - To estimate the local control and progression-free and overall survival rates in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy every 2 days over 1½-2 weeks (total of 5 fractions) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Stage T12, N0, M0 disease Tumor size ≤ 5 cm Tumor must be within or touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree, defined as a volume of 2 cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree (i.e., carina, right and left main bronchi, right and left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius bronchus, right middle lobe bronchus, lingular bronchus right, and left lower lobe bronchi) OR immediately adjacent to the mediastinal or pericardial pleura (PTV touching the pleura) Hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes ≤ 1 cm AND no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET scan are considered N0 Mediastinal lymph node sampling by any technique is allowed but not required Patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT scan or abnormal PET scan (including suspicious but nondiagnostic uptake) are eligible provided directed tissue biopsies of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer Tumor deemed technically resectable, in the opinion of an experienced thoracic cancer surgeon, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a gross total resection with negative margins, defined as a potentially curative resection (PCR) Patient deemed "medically inoperable" due to severe underlying physiological medical problems that would prohibit a PCR, including any of the following: Baseline forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) &lt; 40% predicted Postoperative FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted Severely reduced diffusion capacity Baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia Exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50% predicted Severe pulmonary hypertension Diabetes mellitus with severe endstage organ damage Severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease Severe chronic heart disease Measurable disease as documented by CT scan or wholebody PET scan within the past 8 weeks Patients with lesions that cannot be visualized by CT scan are not eligible Pleural effusion allowed provided it is deemed too small to tap under CT guidance and is not evident on chest xray Pleural effusion that appears on chest xray is allowed only after thoracotomy or other invasive procedure PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Zubrod performance status 02 Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for ≥ 60 days after completion of study therapy No other invasive malignancy within the past 2 years except nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix Prior lung cancer allowed provided the patient has been diseasefree for ≥ 2 years PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiotherapy fields No prior chemotherapy for the study cancer No other concurrent local therapy (including standardfractionated radiotherapy and/or surgery) or systemic therapy (including standard chemotherapy or biologic targeted agents) specifically intended as treatment for study cancer Local or systemic therapy at the time of disease progression allowed</criteria>
