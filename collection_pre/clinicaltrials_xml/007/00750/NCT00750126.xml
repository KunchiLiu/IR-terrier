	<brief_summary>To assess the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells following reduced-intensity conditioning in children presenting with solid tumors or hematological malignancy by evaluating post-transplantation chimerism and hematological reconstitution. To study acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host reaction (incidence and severity) and immune reconstitution, post-transplantation To study the effectiveness of the protocol on tumor response. To study overall survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary criterion - Hematological reconstitution and chimerism post-transplantation Secondary criteria - Adverse effects, graft-related mortality at D90 and at 12 months, incidence and severity of acute and/or chronic GVH reactions - Analysis of variations in post-transplantation immunological function profiles - Median duration of response in therapy-responsive patients and median duration of stability in stabilized patients</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged less than 20 years old Lansky score &gt; 60% Life expectancy greater than 2 months Diagnoses: 3 Solid tumor or hematological malignancy remaining unresponsive to the reference strategies according to French best practices in pediatrics. 4 Malignancies for which allografting is the recognized indication but is contraindicated with myeloablative conditioning. Usual criteria for allogeneic grafting (pregraft profile) Having a HLAidentical sibling donor for HLAA, HLAB and HLADR antigens or a HLA mismatch on only one antigen, or having a 10/10 phenoidentical donor, or compatible cord blood. Signed informed consent Patient presenting rapidlyprogressive malignancy In cases where the potential donor is related, sibling presenting contraindication against hematopoietic stem cell donation Unable to sufficiently understand the treatment and its consequences, even after explanation</criteria>
