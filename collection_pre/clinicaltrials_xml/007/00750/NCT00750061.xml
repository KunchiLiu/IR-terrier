	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. Forty patients will be randomized into two groups. The subjects in the Treatment Group will be administered with lithium carbonate, while the Control Group will receive placebo. Each subject will receive oral lithium carbonate or placebo for six weeks. In the treatment group, the dose will be adjusted according to the serum lithium level while in the control group there will be a sham adjustment. The outcomes will be assessed 6 weeks and 6 months after the onset of the medication. The outcomes will be compared with baseline pre-treatment data to obtain "neurological change scores." The efficacy and safety will be analyzed comparing the results of the treatment group with those of the control group.</brief_summary>
