	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Becker Expander/Breast Implant in women who are undergoing primary breast reconstruction. Safety information on the rate of complications, such as infection will be collected, and used to help determine device safety. These implants are investigational devices. Approximately 300 patients at centers across the United States will be enrolled in this research study, by up to 30 sites. These patients will be implanted with Becker Expander/Breast Implant and monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Mentor Becker Expander/Breast Implant in Subjects Who Are Undergoing Primary Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval Applications (PMA) and in April 1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date. A pre-market approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November 1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants. In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information. In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision subjects. Every subject implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, in addition to being offered participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects. In order to be implanted with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in an IDE clinical trial. A PMA for Mentor's MemoryGelâ„¢ Silicone Gel-Filled breast implants (which did not include the Becker Expander/Breast Implants) was subsequently filed with FDA in December 2003, and approved in November 2006 (P030053). As a condition of approval of P030053, new enrollment in Mentor's Adjunct Study has ceased, and women no longer have access to the Becker Expander/Breast Implants. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Becker Expander/Breast Implants for primary breast reconstruction</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients will be allowed to enter the study if the following inclusion criteria are met: Subject is genetic female, 18 years of age or older A candidate for primary breast reconstruction for cancer, trauma, surgical loss of breast tissue due to mastectomy, malignancy, contralateral postreconstruction symmetry, or congenital deformity, including asymmetry Signs the Informed Consent Agrees to return device to Mentor if explant necessary Agrees to comply with followup procedures, including returning for all followup visits Patients will not be allowed to enter the study if they have any of the following exclusion criteria: Subject is pregnant Has nursed a child within three months of study enrollment Been implanted with any silicone implant other than breast implants (e.g. silicone artificial joints or facial implants) Confirmed diagnosis of the following rheumatic diseases or syndromes: SLE, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, or any connective tissue disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, crystalline arthritis, infectious arthritis, spondylarthropathies, any other inflammatory arthritis, fibromyalgia, or chronic fatigue syndrome Currently has a condition that could compromise or complicate wound healing (except reconstruction subjects) Infection or abscess anywhere in the body Demonstrates tissue characteristics which are clinically incompatible with implant (e.g. tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, or compromised vascularity) Possesses any condition, or is under treatment for any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or consulting physicians(s), may constitute an unwarranted surgical risk Anatomic or physiologic abnormality which could lead to significant postoperative adverse events Demonstrates characteristics that are unrealistic/unreasonable with the risks involved with the surgical procedure Premalignant breast disease without a subcutaneous mastectomy Untreated or inappropriately treated breast malignancy, without mastectomy Are HIV positive Work for Mentor or the study doctor or are directlyrelated to anyone that works for Mentor or the study doctor Implanted metal or metal devices, history of claustrophobia or other condition that would make a MRI scan prohibitive Surgeon intending to use the device for tissue expansion only</criteria>
