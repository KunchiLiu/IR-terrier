Methods The investigators conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing total and subtotal abdominal hysterectomy in 279 women referred for hysterectomy because of benign disease; most of the women were premenopausal. The main outcomes were measures of bladder, bowel, and sexual function at 12 months. The investigators also evaluated postoperative complications.</brief_summary>
