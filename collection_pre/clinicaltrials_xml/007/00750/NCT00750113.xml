	<brief_summary>Patients having uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension are at risk of experiencing cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. To reduce this risk an appropriate antihypertensive therapy should allow to reach a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg in order to maximise cardiovascular protection.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy in blood pressure control when anti-hypertensive therapy is initiated with a combination of low dose Nifedipine GITS and Telmisartan compared to a regimen starting with monotherapy before adding the other drug.The primary efficacy parameter will be the 24 hour mean systolic Blood Pressure on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) at 16 weeks of treatment compared to baseline</brief_summary>

Concomitant treatment with any other antihypertensive medication that cannot be safely withdrawn at entry (i.e taken on a stable regimen for &gt;/= 4 week) and that won't possibly be kept stable over the whole duration of the study. Concomitant treatment with known cytochrome P4503A4 inhibitors (e.g cimetidine, antiHIV protease inhibitors e.g. ritonavir, azole antimycotics eg. Ketoconazole, digoxin, quinidine, tacrolimus) or inducers such as antiepileptic drugs (eg. phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone) or rifampicin Concomitant treatment with potassium sparingdiuretics. Malignant, severe or labile essential hypertension, orthostatic hypotension Cardiovascular shock Evidence of secondary form of hypertension, including coarctation of the aorta, hyperaldosteronism, renal artery stenosis or pheochromocytoma Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 12 months Severe cardiac valve disease Severe rhythm or conduction disorder: Cerebrovascular ischaemic event (stroke, transient ischaemic attack) within the previous 12 months History of intracerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage within the previous 12 months Type 1 diabetes mellitus Proteinuria (determined by uristix) BMI &gt; 34 Uncorrected hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, potassium outside the range 3.0 to 5.5 mmol/l Sodium depletion and/or hypovolemia Gastrointestinal disease resulting in the potential for malabsorption) Liver disease or transaminase (AST, ALT) levels &gt; 3 x the upper limit of normal range. Renal failure, creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl General any malignant disease that has required treatment within the last five years, dementia or psychosis, history of noncompliance, alcoholism or drug abuse, treatment with any other investigational drug in the 30 days prior to entering the study, pregnancy and lactation, known state of allergy or hypersensitivity to nifedipine or any other dihydropyridine or to telmisartan, any surgical or medical condition which at the discretion of the investigator place the subject at higher risk from his/her participation in the study or are likely to prevent the subject from complying with the requirements of the study or completing the trial period, history of non compliance to medical regimens or subjects unwilling to comply with the study protocol.</criteria>
