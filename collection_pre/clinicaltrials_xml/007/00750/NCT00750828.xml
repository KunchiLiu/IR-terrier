	<brief_summary>The investigators questioned whether patients with dry mouth complaints display any reduction in residual saliva coating the gingiva and other selected mucosal surfaces. We further intended to test the hypothesis that Gingival Crevicular Fluid volume in patients with dry mouth could be different from that of control subjects. Correlations between gingival/mucosal wetness; and unstimulated whole salivary flow rate or minor salivary gland secretion rates and the correlations between clinical periodontal status and salivary measures were also attempted.</brief_summary>
