	<brief_title>Pilot Study of the Efficacy &amp; Safety of Natural Eggshell Membrane (NEM) for Joint &amp; Connective Tissue Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is estimated that 140 million adults in the U.S. suffer from some form of joint or connective tissue (JCT) disorder (i.e. arthritis, lupus, gout, fibromyalgia, neck or back pain, etc.). As the population ages, this estimate is expected to grow rapidly. Traditional treatments for most of these disorders attempt to address only the symptoms (pain, inflammation, and discomfort) associated with the diseases. This usually involves the use of analgesics (i.e. acetaminophen, oxycodone, propoxyphene) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (i.e. ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib), alone or in combination. Most of these treatments have shown limited effectiveness in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or are known to have significant and sometimes severe side effects. To avoid the cardiac risks, gastrointestinal issues , and dependency issues associated with traditional JCT treatments (particularly with long-term use), many patients have turned to complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) such as dietary supplements. Glucosamine, chondroitin, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) alone and in combination, are widely marketed as dietary supplements to treat joint pain due to osteoarthritis (OA). Other vitamins, minerals, and botanicals such as kava, pine bark extract, capsicum, boswellia root extract, turmeric/curcumin, etc. are also marketed for various JCT pain maladies. We present here the use of eggshell membrane as a possible new natural therapeutic for JCT disorders. A single center, open label human clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NEMÂ® as a treatment for pain and inflexibility associated with joint and connective tissue disorders. Subjects were to take NEM, 500mg, once daily for 30 days. Subjects were then evaluated for pain and range of motion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients seeking relief of mild to moderate pain due to joint or connective tissue (JCT)disorders. subjects must have had persistent pain associated with a JCT disorder. subjects were required to suspend all current pain relief medications. Subjects that were currently taking analgesic medications were eligible to participate in the studies following a 14 day washout period for NSAIDs, a 7 day washout for narcotics, and a 90 day washout for injected steroids. subjects currently taking glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate or MSM were only eligible after a 3month washout period. Patients were excluded if they were currently receiving remissioninducing drugs such as methotrexate or immunosuppressive medications or had received them within the past 3 months. body weight 250 pounds or greater. a known allergy to eggs or egg products. pregnant or breastfeeding women. subjects previously enrolled in a study to evaluate pain relief within the past 6 months or currently involved in any other research study involving an investigational product (drug, device, or biologic) or a new application of an approved product, within 30 days of screening.</criteria>
