	<brief_summary>Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a progressive sporadic neurodegenerative disorder leading to widespread loss of brain cells that results in parkinsonian, cerebellar and autonomic dysfunction. The cause of the MSA remains unclear. Available treatment is symptomatic only and does not alter the course of disease. Although the cause of MSA remains unclear, there is evidence of presence of common neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the MSA brains including activation of microglia and production of toxic cytokines. This research protocol is based on hypothesis that the MSA progression can be altered by blocking the neuroinflammatory activity. This protocol includes administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg contains antibodies derived from human plasma which can block the inflammatory responses in the brain that can lead to loss of brain cells.</brief_summary>
