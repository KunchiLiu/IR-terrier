	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of AOE based on clinical observation and of presumed bacterial origin A minimum combined score of â‰¥4 in at least 1 affected ear at the Day 1 exam for tenderness, erythema, and edema Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply Duration of pretherapy signs or symptoms of AOE greater than four (4) weeks Presence of a tympanostomy tube or perforated tympanic membrane in the treated ear(s). Patients with a history of tympanic membrane perforation should not be enrolled unless the absence of a current perforation can be confirmed at Visit 1 prior to enrollment Clinically diagnosed chronic suppurative otitis media, acute otitis media, acute otorrhea in patients with tympanostomy tubes, or malignant otitis externa Known or suspected ear infection of fungal or mycobacterial origin Prior otologic surgery within 6 months of study entry Seborrheic dermatitis or other skin conditions of the external auditory canal Current or prior history of an immunosuppressive disorder (e.g., HIV positive) or current immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., cancer chemotherapy) or known acute or chronic renal disorders or active hepatitis Diabetic patients (controlled or uncontrolled) based upon assessment by Investigator Any systemic disease or disorder, complicating factor or structural abnormality that would negatively affect the conduct or outcome of the study [e.g., cleft palate (including repairs), Downs Syndrome, and cranial facial reconstruction] Any current known or suspected infection (other than AOE) requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy Use of prohibited medications or inadequate washout of any medication listed in protocol Concomitant use of topical or oral analgesics (i.e., NSAIDs and aspirin products) which may have anti inflammatory effects. Patients on low dose aspirin therapy (81 mg per day) at the time of enrollment may be enrolled and continue the low dose aspirin during the study. Use of acetaminophen ("Tylenol") is permitted during the trial Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
