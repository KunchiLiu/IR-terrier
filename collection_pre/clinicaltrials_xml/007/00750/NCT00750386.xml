	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Carboplatin Combination as 1st Line Treatment in Ovarian Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose dense chemotherapy has been proven beneficial in various oncological settings. It is proposed that this concept be tested in ovarian cancer, with the support of growth factors. It is hypothesized that, if feasible, dose-dense chemotherapy may be more effective.</detailed_description>
