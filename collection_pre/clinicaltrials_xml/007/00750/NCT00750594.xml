	<brief_summary>This study will be the first to provide data about the relationship between PFO and migraine in children. By establishing the actual prevalence, we will better understand if PFO plays a role in the occurence of pediatric migraine and, thus, provide the incentive to perform additional studies evaluating whether PFO closure is an effective treatment option for pediatric migraine. For children with migraine headaches, discovering novel and effective treatments would be life altering.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 Using contrast transthoracic echocardiography, compare the prevalence of a PFO in children with migraine headache with the established incidence of PFO published for the general population. Specific Aim 2 Using contrast transcranial Doppler, examine the relationship between the degree of right to left atrial shunting with the presence or absence of aura in children with migraine.</detailed_description>
