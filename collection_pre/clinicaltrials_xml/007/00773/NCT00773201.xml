	<brief_summary>The main objective is to research for genetic factors involved in the extreme modifications of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in answer to a pharmacological stimulation (sotalol) and physiological stimulation in the apparently normal general population. The phenotypic characterization, based on the ventricular repolarisation dynamics will be used aiming at term of the predictive genetic factors of the acquired long QT syndrome</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study of 1000 apparently healthy subjects which will receive an unique dose of Sotalol and will have an effort test on ergonomic bicycle, an auditive stimulation and a taking of DNA.</detailed_description>
