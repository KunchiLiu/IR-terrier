	<brief_title>Placebo-Controlled Pilot Trial of Mecamylamine for Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial of a nicotinic agent based on evidence that a disturbance occurs in nicotinic cholinergic transmission in the brain of autistic children. This pharmacotherapeutic trial will be conducted as a direct result of findings of a nicotinic receptor abnormality in autopsied brain tissue from individuals who suffered from autism. A pharmacological agent, mecamylamine, with specificity for the nicotinic receptors implicated in autism, will be tested in children with autism spectrum disorder. Twenty children who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 2:3 ratio to 14 weeks of either matched placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12). Children randomized to placebo who do not respond will be given the opportunity to enroll in a ten week open label extension. The trial has been completed and published in J. of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychopharmacology.</detailed_description>
