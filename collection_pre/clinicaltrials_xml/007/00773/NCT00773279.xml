	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this clinical trial is to assess and compare the effect on blood sugar control of insulin detemir and insulin aspart or insulin detemir alone administered by a insulin pen PDS290 (FlexTouch®) versus a Novo Nordisk marketed insulin pen (FlexPen®) in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the subject's preference of the devices will be investigated by the use of questionnaires.</brief_summary>
