	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, serum proteomics study of men who are to undergo prostate biopsy. The purpose is to determine if proteomic profiles can be used to distinguish between men with prostate cancer on biopsy from men with no cancer on biopsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination of Serum Measurements of Molecular Biomarkers and Serum Protein Profiling Can be Used to Predict Which Patients Undergoing Prostatic Biopsy Will be Diagnosed With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Men aged 18 years or older Have a PSA level between 2 and 10 ng/ml May or may not have an abnormal digital rectal examination Scheduled for transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided systematic prostate biopsy as part of routine medical care.
