	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Mud Packs Therapy in Osteoarthritis of the Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of joint disease and a major contributor of disability in older people. Current treatment of OA include pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities. Spa therapy has a long history in the treatment of OA, but few articles have evaluated the effectiveness of thermal treatment in patients with primary OA of the hands. The aim of this study is to assess the duration of the clinical effectiveness of mud-packs application and mineral bath in patients with primary OA of the hands in a single blind, controlled, randomized trial. Our study will follow the patients for a longer period of time (12 months) than was done in previous studies. 60 outpatients will be enrolled; 30 patients will be treated with a combination of daily local mud packs and mineral bath water from the spa centre of Fonteverde Natural Spa Resort (San Casciano Terme, Siena, Italy) for two weeks; 30 patients will continue regular, routine ambulatory care. Patients will be assessed at baseline time, after 2 weeks, after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following the beginning of the study and will be evaluated by VAS for spontaneous pain, Dreiser Algofunctional index, HAQ, AIMS1 and symptomatic drugs consumption.</detailed_description>
