	<brief_summary>This single arm study in patients with advanced Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who have progressive disease after deriving clinical benefit (defined as response or stable disease after 12 weeks) from second or third line Tarceva monotherapy will determine the proportion of patients with progression-free survival at 12 weeks following combination therapy with R1507 and Tarceva. Patients will receive R1507 (9mg/kg iv) weekly in combination with Tarceva (150mg oral daily) for up to a maximum of 24 months. Other disease-related endpoints including overall survival, objective response rate, time to response, time to progressive disease and duration of response will also be evaluated. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
