	<brief_summary>Randomized (1:1 ratio) study of SC versus IV fluid rehydration in mildly to moderately dehydrated pediatric patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Rehydration Compared to Intravenous Rehydration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), open-label, parallel group, multicenter, multi-national, study of SC versus IV fluid rehydration in mildly to moderately dehydrated pediatric patients treated in the Emergency Department (ED), inpatient pediatric unit, and/or outpatient urgent care facility. It is expected that up to 186 patients, in order to achieve 148 evaluable patients, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive isotonic fluid rehydration by either SC administration with hylenex (150 Units) or IV without hylenex.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children of either gender from one month to &lt;3 years of age. Patients with mild or moderate dehydration Healthy child except for the underlying etiology for dehydration Predehydration body weight â‰¥ 5th percentile for age Parents or legal guardian(s) available to provide informed consent. Severe dehydration Shock or lifethreatening situation (life expectancy &lt; 10 days). Requirement for IV access for any indication other than for treatment of dehydration. Indwelling IV catheter, except for one intended only for collection of clinical laboratory specimens. Any condition precluding SC infusion or infusion site evaluation Any reason (prior to study enrollment) for a hospital admission or an extended stay in the ED for other than dehydration. Known hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or hylenex. Known hyponatremia (&lt; 130 mEg/L) or hypernatremia (&gt; 155 mEq/L). Known hypokalemia (&lt; 3.0 mEq/L). Any medical condition likely to interfere with the patient's ability to fully complete all protocolspecified interventions, the ability to undergo all protocolspecified assessments, or likely to prolong the patient's need for medical attention beyond that required for treatment of dehydration. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study.</criteria>
