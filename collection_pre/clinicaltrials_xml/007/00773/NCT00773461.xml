	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the safety and efficacy, with regard to reduction of signs and symptoms, of tocilizumab versus placebo, both in combination with DMARDs, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who currently have an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive tocilizumab 8mg/kg iv or placebo iv every 4 weeks, in conjunction with stable DMARD therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
