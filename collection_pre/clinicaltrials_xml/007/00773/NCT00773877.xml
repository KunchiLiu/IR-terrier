	<brief_summary>Measurement of RNFL thickness by OCT is at a cornerstone for the correct diagnosis and monitoring of progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Spectral domain technology has enabled better reproducibility with better axial resolution in the measurement of RNFL thickness. A comparative study among Stratus, Cirrus and RT-View will enable clinicians to determine differences among various instruments.</brief_summary>
