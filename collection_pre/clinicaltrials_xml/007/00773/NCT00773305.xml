	<brief_title>Efficacy of Prostate Seed Implantation for Local Control of Early Stage Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Charts of early stage prostate cancer patients receiving prostate seed implants with or without external beam radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy will be reviewed and abstracted. The abstracted data will include pathology reports including Gleason score and T stage, PSA, treatment assignment and dosimetry parameters including dose and percent compliant with established criteria based on guidelines established by the American Brachytherapy Society. A database will be developed for capture of the abstracted data. Outcomes will be determined based on PSA levels at 2 and 5 years after prostate seed implantation. The role of hormonal therapy with prostate seed implantation and outcomes will be evaluated. The outcomes will be compared to national statistics.</detailed_description>
