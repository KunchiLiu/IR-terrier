	<brief_summary>A published phase 2 study reported that lonafarnib was administered as a single agent via continuous or intermittent oral dosing to 76 women with advanced breast cancer who were previously treated with chemotherapy and/or with endocrine therapy. Objective response rates of approximately 10% were observed. This study will determine the rate of progression-free survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive lonafarnib.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study Patients will be treated with lonafarnib 200 mg PO BID daily on days 1-21 of every 21-day cycle until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator's discretion. 1 Cycle = 21 days of lonafarnib (plus the time required to recover from toxicity if encountered). ECOG Performance Status 0-1 Life Expectancy: Not Specified Hematopoietic: - Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm3 - Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt; 1.2 K/mm3 - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl - Serum potassium ≥ 3.3 mmol/L Hepatic: - Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 5.0 x ULN - Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 5.0 x ULN - Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Renal: - Calculated creatinine clearance (using Cockcroft-Gault formula) &gt; 45 cc/min Cardiovascular: - No history of Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular flutter</detailed_description>
