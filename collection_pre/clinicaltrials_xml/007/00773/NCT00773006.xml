	<brief_summary>Advances in mechanical intervention (PCI) and anticoagulation therapy have been the cornerstone of treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. However, the large diversity of approaches to anticoagulation during PCI introduces gaps in knowledge regarding management of cardiac patients. As such, we have initiated a national PCI registry to elucidate anticoagulant choice, dosing strategies, case selection dynamics, and clinical outcomes in the Canadian health care environment.</brief_summary>
