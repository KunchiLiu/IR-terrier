	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to understand the metabolic changes occurring in fat tissue both during controlled weight loss that lead to the improvement of type 2 diabetes and other obesity associated metabolic disorders. The novelty of the study is the analysis of preadipocytes, a poorly characterized subfraction of the adipose tissue, which provides adipocyte precursors and thereby strongly influences adipose tissue mass changes. Knowledge of pathways involved in controlling adipose tissue composition will help to design novel intervention strategies for the treatment of obesity associated metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
