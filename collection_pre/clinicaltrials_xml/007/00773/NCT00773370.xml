	<brief_summary>This study will compare the Adaptive Physical Activity program (APA) to a less vigorous group exercise program, (Sittercise) to see if APA leads to greater improvements in walking endurance, quality of life, and participation in social activities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adaptive Physical Activity for Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to translate the Italian APA exercise model into a sustainable, evidence-based VA community program of exercise for older adults with chronic stroke. The investigators' short-term objectives are to test study hypotheses using a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) with an Attention Control (also referred to as the "Sittercise" exercise program). The investigators will also explore factors related to exercise adherence in a community program for chronic stroke survivors. The investigators' longer term objective is to disseminate this model to facilitate the development of a network of community-based exercise programs for older adults with chronic stroke. In the RCT the investigators propose to offer courses in Office of Aging (OoA) Senior Centers and National Rehabilitation Hospital. At the conclusion of the research study, the OoA plans to continue offering APA-stroke courses. Through partnership, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the Administration of Aging (AoA) can potentially replicate this model at the community throughout the U.S. using local OoA Senior Centers and other facilities that would increase community access for Veterans.</detailed_description>
