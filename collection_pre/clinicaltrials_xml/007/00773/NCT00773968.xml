	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the long term maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels, safety and tolerability of once monthly subcutaneous methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (CERA) in predialysis participants with chronic renal anemia. Participants currently receiving subcutaneous darbopoetin alfa maintenance treatment will receive subcutaneous methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta for a maximum of 32 weeks at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms every 4 weeks according to the dose of darbopoetin alfa administered in Week -1. Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter (g/dL).</brief_summary>
