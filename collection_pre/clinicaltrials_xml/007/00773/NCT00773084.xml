	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to compare the effects that 2 different combinations of heart failure medications have on the levels of certain blood markers which cause and/or worsen heart failure. Additionally, the investigators will investigate any differences that may exist between Hispanics and Non-Hispanics. The investigators hope to find that Hispanic Americans will have a greater response to this new regimen compared to non-Hispanic Americans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aliskiren and Renin Inhibition in Diastolic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our main hypothesis is that in contrast to non Hispanic whites, the degree of RAAS system activation is more pronounced in Mexican Americans with diastolic HF and consequently their response to RAAS inhibition therapy is greater. Blocking the RAAS with renin inhibitor plus aldosterone receptor blocker should produce measurable changes in biomarkers as well as physiologic improvement that could therefore translate into improved clinical outcomes. These changes should be greater appreciated in Mexican Americans if the central pathophysiologic influence of HF in this population was RAAS maladaptation.</detailed_description>
