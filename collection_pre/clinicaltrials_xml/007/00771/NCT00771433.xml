	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: G-CSF may prevent or reduce febrile neutropenia in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. It is not yet known which G-CSF regimen is more effective in preventing neutropenia. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well G-CSF works in preventing neutropenia in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>G-CSF in Preventing Neutropenia in Women Receiving Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) in preventing hematological toxicity in women with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary - Compare actual vs theoretical dose intensity. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (&lt; 65 years vs â‰¥ 65 years) and prior chemotherapy (adjuvant vs neoadjuvant). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. - Group 1: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 6-11 of each course of chemotherapy as primary prophylaxis. Chemotherapy courses repeat every three weeks for 3-6 courses. - Group 2: Patients receive G-CSF SC once daily on days 6-11 of each course of chemotherapy as primary prophylaxis. Chemotherapy courses repeat every three weeks for 3-6 courses. Patients may also receive secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF if they experience an episode of neutropenia.</detailed_description>
