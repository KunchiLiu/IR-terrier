	<brief_summary>Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (T1DM and T2DM) develop when there is impaired insulin production. The amount of insulin that can be produced, the amount of insulin producing beta cells in thepancreas and level of insulin and glucose in the blood are, however, imperfectly correlated. The development of a reliable method to noninvasively quantitate the beta cell mass (BCM) would be of great benefit by providing an important endpoint for the development of new treatments of T1DM and T2DM. We have previously identified a specific marker on islet cells called VMAT2 that we now propose to use in positron emission tomography (P.E.T.) scanning to determine islet cell mass. This radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, has been used previously in human subjects in clinical trials evaluating P.E.T scanning of the brain in patients with bipolar illness and schizophrenia compared to healthy control subjects. We hypothesize that P.E.T scans will be able to differentiate between normal, reduced or increased BCM in human subjects. Subjects with normal BCM will be recruited from among normal weight nondiabetic people with plasma insulin levels within the normal range. Subjects with predicted reduced BCM will be recruited from among patients with T1DM who have with low or not measurable insulin levels. If results from the nondiabetic subjects and the subjects with T1DM are found to differ significantly, subjects with increased BCM will be recruited from among patients with hyperinsulinemia including those with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. PET scan measurements of the pancreas will be obtained and compared in people predicted, on the basis of biochemical testing, to have normal or reduced, or increased BCM.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An important determinant of progression to diabetes is beta cell mass (BCM). Measurement of plasma insulin has been used as a surrogate marker but insulin levels often do not correlate well with beta cell mass and development of means to assess BCM would provide an important endpoint. For example, highrisk individuals could be monitored prior to onset of diabetes or patients could be monitored prospectively to determine the progression of their disease and response to therapy. We have previously identified a specific marker on beta cells called VMAT2. We propose to use a radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, that binds to VMAT2 in positron emission tomography (P.E.T.) scanning to assess whether P.E.T. can measure beta cell masses. This radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, has been used previously in human subjects in clinical trials evaluating P.E.T scanning of the brain in patients with bipolar illness and schizophrenia compared to healthy control subjects. We hypothesize that P.E.T. with [11C]DTBZ will differentiate between normal, reduced or increased beta cell mass in human subjects. Subjects with predicted normal beta cell mass will be recruited from among normal weight nondiabetic people with plasma insulin levels within the normal range. Subjects with predicted reduced beta cell mass will be recruited from among patients with Type 1 diabetes who have low or not measurable insulin levels. Subjects with predicted increased beta cell mass will be recruited from among obese nondiabetic patients with hyperinsulinemia. Measurements of [11C]DTBZ uptake in the pancreas will be obtained and compared in the study population.</detailed_description>
