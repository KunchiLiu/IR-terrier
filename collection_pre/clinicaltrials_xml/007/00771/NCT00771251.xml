	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of golimumab in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite DMARD (Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) therapy. Another objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of golimumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Golimumab (CNTO148) in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a placebo-controlled study of golimumab monotherapy for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of golimumab, a new, fully human anti-TNF (Tumor necrosis factor) a monoclonal antibody produced by mean of HuMab mouse technology. Other reasons for using the study design are as follows: the effects of golimumab given alone must be confirmed as in the case of other drugs; and golimumab may be used even in patients not on the treatment with methotrexate (MTX). There will be 3 treatment groups in the study as follows: CNTO148 50 mg group, CNTO 148 100 mg group, and Placebo group.</detailed_description>
