	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if putting local anesthetic through one or two percutaneous catheters placed next to the nerves that go to an amputated limb will decrease long-term pain in the amputated limb.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Phantom Limb and Stump Pain Using Ambulatory Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition of multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks decrease the incidence and severity of post-amputation phantom limb and stump pain. Hypothesis 1: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, the incidence of phantom limb and/or stump pain will be significantly decreased four weeks following multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment. Hypothesis 2: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, the severity of phantom limb and/or stump pain will be significantly decreased four weeks following multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (as measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).</detailed_description>
