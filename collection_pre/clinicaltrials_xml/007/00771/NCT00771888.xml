	<brief_summary>Positive data originating from two polycystic liver patients treated with somatostatin analogues, showed a volume reduction of 38.3% and 14.9%. These two patients had complicated polycystic livers and no other therapeutic options were available. Patients who participated in LOCKCYST trial are able to benefit from active treatment. Participants will be actively treated for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
