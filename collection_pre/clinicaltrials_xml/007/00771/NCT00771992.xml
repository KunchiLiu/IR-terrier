	<brief_summary>The effect of surfactant protein D under native and altered conditions will be investigated in immune cells that are derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with allergic asthma following segmental allergen challenge. The goal of this study is to elucidate the pro- versus anti-inflammatory function of SP-D molecules and to identify motifs of SP-D that have treatment potential in allergic asthma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following a baseline BAL, allergen (3×) and saline (1×) will be instilled into four different lung segments during a first bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second bronchoscopy BAL will be collected in these challenged segments to harvest invaded cells for in-vitro experimentation. In addition, bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushes will be taken to assess the degree of local inflammation in bronchial mucosa and to study the activation of airway epithelium following allergen challenge.</detailed_description>

These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological disease, neurological disease, psychiatric disease, endocrine disease, infectious disease, inflammatory disease, or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis). Clinically significant pathological findings in safety laboratory tests Regular intake of any medication other than short acting inhaled beta agonists, paracetamol for pain relief, birth control medication, hormonal replacement therapy, dietary and vitamin supplements Specific Immunotherapy (SIT) within two years prior to the study Use of antiinflammatory medication including systemic or inhaled corticosteroid within the last four weeks Any history of lifethreatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures. Suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the medication in line with bronchoscopy (bronchodilators, sedatives and local anesthetics) Conditions or factors, which would make the subject unlikely to be able to undergo bronchoscopy or incremental allergen challenge History of drug or alcohol abuse Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and studyrelated restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. Participation in a clinical trial 30 days prior to enrolment Segmental allergen challenge three months prior to treatment Risk of noncompliance with study procedures</criteria>
