	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to evaluate the findings of the Reflectance Confocal Microscopy when performed in cutaneous pigmentary disorders, such as vitiligo, melasma, post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation and hypo-pigmentation. Confocal Microscopy is a recent diagnostic technique that has been used for observation of skin conditions that affect the superficial layers of the skin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects 2070 years of age. 2. Clinical diagnosis of vitiligo, melasma, postinflammatory hypo or depigmentation or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. 3. Willing and able to understand and sign informed consent. 4. Able to complete study and comply with study procedures. 1. Use of topical therapies such as corticosteroids, protopic, hydroquinone and azelaic acid within the past 2 months. 2. Use of light therapy such as narrowbandUVB, PUVA or laser within the past 2 months. 3. Intake of medications that can cause pigmentary changes within the past year. Examples are: Antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) Chemotherapeutics (bleomycin, busulfan, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and carmustine) Heavy metals (gold, silver, bismuth, and mercury) Tetracyclines (including minocycline, doxycycline) Amiodarone Azidothymidine Clofazimine 4. Clinically significant abnormal findings or conditions (other than the pigmentary disorder), which might, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, interfere with study evaluations or pose a risk to subject safety during the study. 5. Subjects who are known to be pregnant or planning a pregnancy.</criteria>
