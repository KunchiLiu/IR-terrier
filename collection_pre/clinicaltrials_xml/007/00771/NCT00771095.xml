	<brief_title>Pounds Off Digitally Study: A Podcasting Weight Loss Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will conduct a weight loss intervention study among adults. Using the weight loss podcast that receives the highest rating from a previous content analysis, we will conduct an intervention comparing the best existing weight loss podcast to an enhanced podcast. The enhanced podcast will be based on theoretical constructs that have been shown to be effective in producing weight loss in other research studies. We will then evaluate the effectiveness of podcasting to promote weight loss in adults. Weight change from baseline to 12-weeks and changes in psychosocial measures will be used to assess differences between the existing podcast, enhanced podcast, and control conditions. In conclusion, this research study aims to find innovative and inexpensive ways to help people lose weight. Podcasting has the possibility of reaching a wide range of age and ethnic groups and will allow people to receive weight loss information when and where it is convenient for them.</detailed_description>
