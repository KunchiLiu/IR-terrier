	<brief_title>Open Label Pharmacokinetic in Adult Patients With Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive a intravenous dose of ceftobiprole infused over 4 hours. Multiple blood samples will be obtained to determine the concentration of Ceftobiprole in the blood. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples will be collected to determine the concentration of ceftobiprole in the BAL fluid. The penetration of the drug into the lung will be calculated. Four 1000mg administered every 8 hours</detailed_description>
