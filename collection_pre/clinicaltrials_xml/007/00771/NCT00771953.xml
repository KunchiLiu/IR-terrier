	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the anti-tumor activity of the combination of apricoxib + either docetaxel (AP/DC) or pemetrexed (AP/PE) compared with placebo + either docetaxel (P/DC) or pemetrexed (P/PE) as measured by progression free survival in patients with Stage IIIb (pleural effusion)or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>0822GCC: Phase 2 Study of Efficacy and Safety of Apricoxib/Placebo With Docetaxel or Pemetrexed in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer that has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy are eligible to particvpate in this study. Current standard treatments for this type of lung cancer are generally not effective in preventing the cancer from growing. The purpose of this study is to see if adding the drug apricoxib to standard chemotherapy is effective in treting NSCLC. Apricoxib is an investigational drug. Investigational means that it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Laboratory studies suggest that apricoxib may be useful in the treatment of cancer . This is seen particularly when it is combined with chemotherapy drugs. However, this has not been proven in humans. Laboratory evidence indicates that apricoxib may benefit patients whose disease over-produces a substance called COX-2. COX-2 can be detected in the urine as a substance called PGE-M (prostaglandin E metabolite). It is thought that patients who have a PGE-M level in the urine that decreases by at least half after taking apricoxib may benefit more than patients whose urine PGE-M decreases by less than half after apricoxib. This study evaluated whether adding apricoxib to standard chemotherapy treatment will improve outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose urine PGE-M decreases at least 50% after taking apricoxib. Apricoxib or placebo was added to either docetaxel or pemetrexed treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically determined stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including stage IIIb (pleural effusion) (histology or cytology acceptable). Documented progression after 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy. No more than one prior chemotherapy regimen is permitted. Patients may have also received erlotinib (before, after or concurrently with platinum based therapy). Measurable disease by RECIST criteria Age at least 18 years. ECOG performance status of 02. Required Laboratory Values (within 28 days before randomization) : Hb ≥ 9.0gm/dL; transfusions permitted ANC ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 INR ≤ 1.5 Serum creatinine (Cr) within normal limits for laboratory OR Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 45 ml/min. 24 hour measured CCr is also acceptable (calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault equation). SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2 X the ULN; if liver metastases are present then must be &lt; 5 X the ULN Bilirubin ≤ Institutional ULN Albumin ≥ or equal to 2.5 mg/dl May have been treated with antiEGFR kinase therapy in addition to a platinum based therapy or concurrently with platinum therapy. Provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization and agree to abide by the study restrictions and return for the required assessments. Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test (serum BHCG) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/L within 7 days prior to the initiation of treatment and must have used effective contraception (recommended to be two reliable forms of contraception used simultaneously) or must have been sexually abstinent for at least 4 weeks prior to the negative pregnancy test through entry in the study. Female patients and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to sexual abstinence or to practice effective contraception (recommended to be two reliable forms of contraception used simultaneously). At least one nonhormonal method strongly recommended. Male patients with female sexual partners who are pregnant, or of childbearing potential must agree to use condoms during and for at least 1 month after the last dose of apricoxib. Pregnant or breast feeding Known hypersensitivity to apricoxib, docetaxel, other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80, pemetrexed, sulfonamides, aspirin, or other NSAIDs. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks or chemotherapy within 3 weeks or noncytotoxic investigational agents within 3 weeks of initiating study treatment or patients who have not recovered from adverse effects due to agents administered &gt; 3 weeks prior to initiating study treatment. Screening for urinary PGEM suppression may begin during this time period. Evidence of New York Heart Association class III or greater cardiac disease. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or symptomatic conduction abnormality within 12 months. Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease that could compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the ability of the patient to complete the study. Known HIV infection or AIDS. Testing not required. Symptomatic central nervous system metastases; the patient must be stable after radiotherapy for ≥ 2 weeks. Patients must be off all steroid or antiseizure medications for this indication for ≥ 2 weeks. Patients with CNS metastases that are untreated are eligible if there is no evidence of midline shift, requirement for steroids or antiseizure medications or neurologic symptoms. History of upper GI bleeding, ulceration, or perforation within the past 5 years. Concurrent use of COX2 inhibitors or other NSAIDs for 2 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and during study, including aspirin for 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and during study. Previous COX2 inhibitor therapy for this diagnosis.</criteria>
