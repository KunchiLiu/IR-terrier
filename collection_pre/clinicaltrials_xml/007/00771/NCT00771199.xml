	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety/tolerability and clinical utility of low-dose transdermal therapeutic system (TTS [medicated adhesive pad that is placed on the skin to deliver a timed-release dose of medication through the skin into the bloodstream]) - fentanyl in Taiwan participants with cancer pain. Secondly, to demonstrate the dropout rate that will be decreased by initiating therapy with12 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) instead of with 25 mcg/h.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Low-dose Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS)-Fentanyl D-Trans in Taiwan Participants With Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), single-arm, non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose TTS-fentanyl in Taiwan participants with cancer pain. Eligible participants will be enrolled and scheduled to return at Day 0, 7, 14 and 28. Participants will receive TTS-fentanyl for 28 days at a starting dose of 12 micrograms per hour (mcg/h) (one patch). Dose of fentanyl can increased or decreased as per Investigator's discretion to maintain participant's pain score at 2 or less on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) question 6 (that tells how much pain you have right now). Safety will primarily be evaluated by measuring participant's dropout rate due to adverse events. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants diagnosed with cancer; histologically (examination of tissue specimens under a microscope) confirmed malignancy (term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues) Participants who are able to communicate effectively with study personnel Participants who have intolerable cancer pain (pain score greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 4) Participants who have an estimated life expectancy of at least 30 days Participants who have given written dated informed consent to participate in the study Participants who have already received regular treatment with an strong opioid (morphinelike synthetic narcotic that produces the same effects as drugs derived from the opium poppy [opiates]), for their pain before entering the study Participants who have already received tramadol (a narcoticlike pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain) treatment over 200 milligram (mg) for their pain before entering the study Participants with significant abnormalities in hepatic or renal function which would, in the opinion of the Investigator, prevent the participants involvement in the study Participants with significant clinical abnormalities in central nervous system (CNS), respiratory or cardiovascular function, which in the investigators judgment prevents participation in the study Pregnant or lactating females or females of child bearing potential not currently practicing documented, adequate contraception</criteria>
