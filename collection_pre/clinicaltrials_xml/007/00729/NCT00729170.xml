	<brief_title>Milk Supplementation and Energy Balance.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcium deficiency is related to a higher risk of obesity. Some studies showed a lost of weight by elevating the calcium consumption to reach the recommended level. Milk supplementation could be a good alternative to reach this objective, but its impact on weight loss and on appetite sensations has not been verified. Furthermore, losing weight leads to some negative consequences like a decrease of bone mineral content. Considering the benefits of milk on bone health, a higher intake of this food product during weight loss could represent a healthy strategy.</detailed_description>
