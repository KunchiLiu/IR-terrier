	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well aflibercept works in treating patients with recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer that has not responded to radioactive iodine therapy. Aflibercept may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by carrying tumor-killing substances directly to thyroid cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aflibercept in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond to Radioactive Iodine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the radiographic response rate (by RECIST criteria) of IV VEGF Trap after four cycles (approximately 8 weeks) of therapy, as well as the 6-month progression-free-survival (PFS) rate (as part of a composite primary outcome measure), in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma of follicular cell origin (D-TC-FCO; comprising papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell, and respective variants) not amenable to RAI or curative surgery. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of IV VEGF Trap in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic TC-FCO. Please see the adverse event table for the specifics for this protocol. II. To determine the biologic effect of IV VEGF Trap on FDG avidity after four cycles (approximately 8 weeks) of therapy through pre- and post-treatment FDG-PET scans in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic D-TC-FCO. III. To determine if changes in thyroglobulin concentration after four cycles (approximately 8 weeks) of IV VEGF-Trap therapy correlate with radiographic response after four cycles (approximately 8 weeks) and progression-free-survival at 6 months after start of therapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic D-TC-FCO. IV. To determine if pre-treatment serum VEGF concentration correlates with clinical outcomes after IV VEGF Trap therapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic D-TC-FCO. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine population pharmacokinetics of IV VEGF Trap for patients with thyroid cancer. II. To determine whether antibodies to VEGF Trap develop in patients with thyroid cancer. OUTLINE: Patients receive aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing clear clinical benefit with aflibercept may continue treatment beyond 12 months, at the discretion of the study sponsor. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET scans at baseline and after 8 weeks of study therapy to evaluate changes in FDG avidity on FDG-PET scan. Blood samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during study for laboratory correlative studies. Samples are examined for pretreatment serum VEGF concentration, thyroglobulin levels (when elevated), serum pharmacokinetics of aflibercept by ELISA, and anti-aflibercept antibodies. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 2-4 months.</detailed_description>
