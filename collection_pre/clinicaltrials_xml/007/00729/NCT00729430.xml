	<brief_title>Evaluating a Heart Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedure and the Effect of Fish Oil Supplementation in People Who Have Recently Had a Heart Attack (The PROSPECT-CMR Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new MRI technique to examine the heart was recently developed. In this study, researchers will use this new technique to evaluate the heart in people who have recently had a heart attack to determine whether a specific pattern of heart muscle damage is related to sudden cardiac death. This fatal condition, also known as cardiac arrest, occurs when the heart abruptly stops pumping blood to the body, resulting in loss of consciousness, absence of pulse, and a stop in breathing. The most common cause of sudden cardiac death is a heart attack. In addition to evaluating the new heart MRI technique, this study will also examine the effects of fish oil supplementation in people who have recently had a heart attack. Recent research has shown that omega-3 fatty acids, commonly found in fish oil, may be beneficial for people with heart conditions. Lastly, the study will determine whether specific biomarkers and genetic factors can help predict the likelihood of a person dying from sudden cardiac death after previously experiencing a heart attack. Apart from studying the likelihood of sudden cardiac death, This study will measure the change in structure and pumping function of the heart (known as ventricular remodeling) and this study will determine if the high dose of fish oil treatment will result in an improvement of the heart. This study will enroll people who have had a heart attack in the 2 to 4 weeks before study entry. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo an MRI of their heart and complete an exercise stress test on a treadmill. A blood sample will be collected, and women will provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. Questionnaires asking about diet, medical history, and emotions will also be completed. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either fish oil supplements or placebo on a daily basis for 6 months. Every 2 to 3 months, study researchers will call participants to check on their health and progress. At a study visit at Month 6, participants will undergo repeat baseline testing. After this visit, study researchers will call participants every 6 months for 3 years to follow up on participants' health status.</detailed_description>
