	<brief_title>The Therapeutic Efficacy of Neurofeedback in Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject - Fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders. - Persons who had organic disorders were excluded. - Who had been treated by psychoactive drugs for at least 2 months prior to the study were excluded. Design - Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups (EEG biofeedback /psychotherapy placebo) by block randomization. - EEG biofeedback training was provided for 5 weeks(10 sessions, twice per week). Each training session was composed of 6 four minute trials followed by 5 thirty second rest periods - Psychotherapy placebo session was provided for 5 weeks. These sessions consisted of additional assessment, interpretation of the test results and providing information on course and treatment of mood disorder. - After subjects completed the training, they participated in a month-long (twice per week) self-training session to maintain a similar mental state during neurofeedback training sessions without feedback system's assistance. - Subjects who had finished the psychotherapy placebo were referred to other therapists as necessary.</detailed_description>
