	<brief_summary>1. To determine if catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is superior to Amiodarone treatment for symptomatic persistent/permanent AF in ICD/CRTD patients with an impaired left ventricular function. 2. Hypothesis: AF ablation is better than Amiodarone for subjects with symptomatic persistent or permanent AF and impaired LV function in terms of recurrence of AF, quality of life, 6-minute walk distance, EF and total number of hospitalizations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with an dual chamber ICD or CRTD (with an existing functional atrial lead) with remote monitoring capabilities and EF &lt;= 40% within the last 3 months by echocardiogram, nuclear imaging, MRI or cardiac catheterization, 2. Persistent or chronic symptomatic AF resistant to antiarrhythmic medication other than Amiodarone. Resistant defined as recurrent AF of greater than 5 minutes duration at least once per month. 3. Therapeutic anticoagulation for at least three weeks prior to initiation of therapy 4. Ability to complete 6 minute walk test. 5. Age &gt;= 18 years old. (Females must be either postmenopausal &gt;12 months, practicing a protocolacceptable method of birth control [defined as injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptives, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, diaphragm plus spermicide], or have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation performed at least 6 months prior to enrollment). 6. All patients optimized on CHF medications including betablocker and aceinhibitor or angiotensinreceptor blocker. 7. patients receiving low dose amiodarone &lt;200 mg for 2 or less months The exclusion criteria are: 1. Reversible causes of AF such as pericarditis, hyperthyroidism, 2. Presently with Valvular Heart disease requiring surgical intervention 3. Presently with coronary artery disease requiring surgical intervention 4. Early Postoperative AF (within three months of surgery) 5. Previous MAZE or left atrial instrumentation 6. Prolonged QT interval 7. Hypothyroidism 8. Liver Failure 9. Life expectancy &lt;= 2 years 10. Social factors that would preclude follow up or make compliance difficult. 11. Contraindication to the use of antiarrhythmic medications and/or coumadin and heparin 12. Enrollment in another investigational drug or device study. 13. Patients with severe pulmonary disease i.e. COPD or asthma 14. Documented intraatrial thrombus, tumor, or another abnormality which precludes catheter introduction 15. Any ophthalmologic disorders (other than requiring glasses for vision correction)</criteria>
