	<brief_summary>The stomach of the newborn baby is often emptied soon after birth to prevent breathing problems (respiratory distress). Babies born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid and those with increased secretions associated with birth by C-section are thought to be at particular risk of breathing problems during the first minutes of life. Emptying the stomach by sucking out all its contents (gastric suctioning) is alleged to lessen the risk of aspiration and improve respiratory distress. This study will evaluate the usefulness of gastric suctioning during neonatal resuscitation.</brief_summary>
