	<brief_summary>This is a phase II study to evaluate RAD001 (Everolimus) in terms of 4-month progression-free survival rate (primary end-point) and response rate, toxicity, and overall survival (secondary end-points) in patients with metastatic and/or advanced inoperable gastric cancer. Eligibility criteria include histologically proven gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer who failed previous first-line standard treatment with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy. Oral RAD001 (everolimus) 10mg daily will be administered and the dose will be adjusted according to the observed clinical toxicities. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or patient's intolerability to the study drug. Total of 54 patients will be enrolled to decide whether the proportion of patients who are free from progression at 4 months (16 weeks), P, is less that or equal to 0.15 or greater than or equal to 0.30 to assess the treatment outcome in 48 patients assuming drop-out rate, 10%.</brief_summary>
