	<brief_summary>This is a dose exploration study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the candidate HRV vaccine at different virus concentrations in the target age group (infants approximately 2 months of age and previously uninfected with human rotavirus) and receiving concomitant administration of routine vaccinations. The study also aims at exploring the effect of unrestricted feeding on the immunogenicity of the vaccine.</brief_summary>

Any clinically significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease including any uncorrected congenital malformation of the GI tract or other serious medical condition as determined by the investigator. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. History of allergic disease or reaction likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Acute disease at time of enrollment. Gastroenteritis within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration. Household contact with an immunosuppressed individual or pregnant women. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period. Previous confirmed occurrence of rotavirus gastroenteritis.
