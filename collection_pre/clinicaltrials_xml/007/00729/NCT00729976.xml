	<brief_summary>Fever is one of the most common symptoms in pediatrics and one of the most common reasons for visits in pediatricians' office and pediatric emergency departments. Many parents consider fever to be the most terrifying symptom. Ibuprofen is an effective and safe treatment for febrile children. Until recently ibuprofen was available only in tablets suspension and as a liquid gel. All these dosage form are administered orally. Rectal suppositories are often essential for treating febrile children who cannot take medications by mouth (e.g vomiting). In the current study we aim to compare the effect on fever of ibuprofen given as suspension with ibuprofen suppositories.</brief_summary>
