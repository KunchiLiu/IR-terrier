	<brief_summary>The problem of cocaine dependence remains a major medical, social, and legal concern. Several studies have suggested that disulfiram may be beneficial for the treatment of cocaine dependence. A common assumption has been that disulfiram treatment, by increasing DA availability, enhances the aversive aspects of stimulants. This study aims to measure plasma activity in those with the C/C DBH genotype, which is associated with higher DBH activity subsequently making the disulfiram treatment more effective, as well as determine the effects of treatment with disulfiram on cocaine self-administration using a human laboratory model of cocaine self-administration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Meet DSM IV criteria for cocaine dependence; 2. Have a selfreported history of using cocaine by the smoked or IV route. Participants must report at least weekly use for the past month and have a cocainepositive urine test in the week of study entry; 3. Have vital signs after a 48 hours washout period as follows: resting pulse between 50 and 80 bpm, blood pressures between 105130mm Hg systolic and 4580mm Hg diastolic; 4. Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/ 10%) limits with the following exceptions: a) liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN) &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal; 5. Have a baseline ECG that demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias; and 6. Have a medical history and standard physical examination demonstrating no clinically significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the admitting physician and the principal investigator. 1. Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizures or brain injury 2. Have any previous medically adverse reaction to cocaine, including loss of consciousness, chest pain, or epileptic seizure; 3. Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as: psychosis, bipolar illness or major depression as assessed by MINI (or SCID if necessary); organic brain disease or dementia assessed by clinical interview; history of any psychiatric disorder which would require ongoing treatment or which would make study compliance difficult; history of suicide attempts within the past three months assessed by MINI and/or current suicidal ideation/plan as assessed by MINI; 4. Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined by the PI; 5. Have a family history in first degree relatives of early cardiovascular morbidity or mortality, as determined by the PI; 6. Have evidence of untreated or unstable medical illness including: neuroendocrine, autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease; 7. Have HIV and are currently symptomatic, have a diagnosis of AIDS, or are receiving antiretroviral medication; 8. Have any history of asthma, chronic coughing and wheezing, or other respiratory illnesses; 9. Heavy current alcohol intake that is likely to lead to withdrawal symptoms, in the opinion of the PI; 10. Refuse to abstain from alcohol during the protocol and for at least one week after discharge. 11. Have any other illness, condition, or use of medications, which in the opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion of the study.</criteria>
