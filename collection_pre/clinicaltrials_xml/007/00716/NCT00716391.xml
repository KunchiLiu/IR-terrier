	<criteria>1. Before the beginning of protocol's specific procedures, the informed consent has to be obtained. 2. Locally advanced cancer of head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx) stage IIIIV, without evidence of metastasis. 3. The tumor must be considered to be nonoperable according to the criteria of the Northern California Oncology Group. The reason of nonsurgical resection will be annotated in the CRF. Criteria of nonsurgical resection according to the NCOG: 3.1.Technically not resectable (includes: evidence of mediastinal dissemination ; fixed tumor to the clavicle, base of the cranium or cervical vertebrae; affectation of the nasopharynx). 3.2.Medical criteria based on a low surgical curability. 3.3.Medical contraindication for the surgery. 4. Epidermoid carcinoma histologically demonstrated 5. Measurable disease according to the RECIST criteria . 6. Men or women with age between 18 and 70 years, both inclusive. 7. Functional condition index according to ECOG scale:01 8. Patients in medical conditions to be able to receive treatment with TPF induction followed by normofractionated radiotherapy with cetuximab or cisplatin. 9. Patients with adequate hematologic function: neutrophils superior or equal to 2 x 109, platelets superior or equal to 100 x 109, hemoglobin superior or equal to 10 g/dl. 10. Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin lower or equal to 1 x top normal Limit, GOT and GPT lower or equal to 2,5 Top Normal Limit , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 Top Normal Limit. 11. Adequate renal function: creatinin &lt;1,4 mg/dl (120 Âµmol/l); if the values are &gt; 1,4 mg/dl, the clearance of creatinin will have to be &gt; 60 ml/min (real or calculated for CockcroftGault's method). 12. Calcium lower or equal to 1,25 x top normal limit. 13. Adequate nutritional condition: loss of weight &lt;20% with relation to the theoretical weight and albumin superior or equal to 35 g/L. 14. Patients must be accessible for the treatment and the followup. 1. Metastatic disease 2. Surgical treatment, previous radiotherapy and/or chemiotherapy for the study disease. 3. Other tumour locations in head and neck that are not oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx. 4. Other stages that are not III or IVM0. 5. Other previous and / or synchronic squamous carcinoma. 6. Diagnosis of another neoplasia in the last 5 years, excepting carcinoma in situ of uterine neck and/or a cutaneous carcinoma basocellular properly treated. 7. Active infection(at needs endovenous antibiotics), including active tuberculosis and diagnosed HIV. 8. Not controlled hypertension defined as arterial systolic tension superior or equal to 180 mm Hg and / or diastolic arterial tension superior or equal to 130 mm Hg baseline. 9. Pregnancy(absence must be confirmed with the test of betaHCG) or period of lactation. 10. Immunity systemic treatment, chronic and concomitant, or hormonal treatment of the cancer. 11. Other antineoplastic concomitant treatments. 12. Coronary clinically significant arteriopathy or precedents of myocardial infarction in the last 12 months or high risk of not controlled arrhythmia or cardiac not controlled insufficiency. 13. Pulmonary obstructive chronic disease that had needed 3 or more hospitalizations in the last 12 months. 14. Active non controlled peptic ulcer. 15. Presence of a psychological or medical disease that could prevent to accomplish the study by the patient or to grant his/her signature in the informed consent form. 16. Known drugs abuse (with the exception of excessive consumption of alcohol) 17. Known allergic reaction to some of the components of the treatment of the study. 18. Previous treatment with monoclonal antibodies or other transduction of the sign inhibitors or treatment directed against the EGFR. 19. Any experimental treatment in 30 days before the entry in the study.</criteria>
