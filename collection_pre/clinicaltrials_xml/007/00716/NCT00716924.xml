	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To test if 600 mg of clopidogrel loading dose administered ≥ 6 and ≤ 24 hours prior to PCI produce a greater decrease of periprocedural release of biochemical markers (CK, CK-MB, and troponin-T and/or I) of myocardial necrosis, compared to 300 mg loading dose, given ≥ 6 and ≤ 24 hours prior to PCI or 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel, administered immediately (≤ 45 minutes) before PCI.</brief_summary>
