	<brief_summary>A total of 300 women with lactational infectious mastitis will daily ingest 9 log10 cfu of Lactobacillus salivarius HN6, Lactobacillus reuteri CR20 or Lactobacillus fermentum LC40 for 4 weeks. The three lactobacilli strains were originally isolated from milk of healthy women. On days 0 and 28, milk samples will be collected, and staphylococci/streptococci and lactobacilli will be counted and identified. Evolution of clinical signs will be recorded by midwifes on days 0, 7, 14 and 28.</brief_summary>
