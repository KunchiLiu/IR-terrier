	<brief_summary>After transplantation, renal impairment, incidence and progression of atherosclerosis lead to modification of immunosuppressive regimens, as switch, reduction or discontinuation of CNI and/or introduction of everolimus. The risk or benefits of these strategies were not clearly evaluated by specific clinical trials. This study is specifically designed for evaluating the impact of everolimus introduction, with calcineurin dose reduction, at less one year after cardiac transplantation, on renal and clinical outcomes, specially on : - Renal function improvement - Vasculopathy and major cardiac event reduction - Maintenance of immunosuppressive efficacy</brief_summary>
