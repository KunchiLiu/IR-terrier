	<brief_title>Characterization of Executive Functions and Patterns of Eye Movements in Children With Developmental Disabilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormal Executive function (EF) profile was considered a major characteristic of Attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, and is frequently implicated in Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) children as well. The scientific literature implies that the EF profile among these three groups share some common abnormalities, but differ significantly in specific features. Abnormal EF profile may be a core feature of the developmental trajectory of each syndrome. The fine measurement of eye movements may shed light on the underlying mechanisms of specific disorders, and point to abnormal attention, information processing, or motor organization. Gaze is an important component of social interaction. Eye contact and recognition of other's gaze direction are crucial to empathy assessment. The current study will embark in the assessment of a wide range of EF in these populations and in a matched control group, as well as their relation to other important parameters such as daily function skills and comorbid neurobehavioral characteristics. It will also assess the pattern of eye movements in response to various visual stimuli in these populations. The main purpose is to characterize the similarities and differences of each of these populations, in terms of EF and eye movements. Assessment methods: Clinical parameters: - Intelligence tests (according to the child's age) - Communication: DSM-IV, ADOS, Stony Brook questionnaire - Motor / Coordination: Movement Advanced Battery for Children (M-ABC) - Attention: Conners Rating Scales - Revised (CRS-R 3rd ed.) - Sleep: Sleep habits questionnaire Executive functions will be assessed using the following methods: - NEPSI-II - BRIEF questionnaire - Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - Tower of Hanoi Eye movements will be measured using an infra-red video camera produced by ISCAN inc. the following visual stimuli will be presented: - Human faces presenting various emotions - Various objects - Saccade and anti-saccade tasks</detailed_description>
