	<brief_summary>Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare type of systemic vasculitis which occurs almost exclusively in patients with asthma and which is characterized by prominent blood and tissue eosinophilia. The disease has a chronic smoldering course with a permanent need for medium to high corticosteroid doses. Available unselective immunosuppressive agents are often insufficient to reduce corticosteroid doses, to induce complete remission and to protect patients from disease flares which occur in more than 50 % of cases. Interleukin-5 is the most potent cytokine regulating the production of eosinophil granulocytes which are the major effector cells in Churg-Strauss syndrome. Recently, an increased production of interleukin-5 was demonstrated in Churg-Strauss syndrome. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal IgG antibody targeting interleukin-5 and is effective in the treatment of the HES. The hypothesis of this study is, that mepolizumab will induce remission and allow for steroid reduction.</brief_summary>
