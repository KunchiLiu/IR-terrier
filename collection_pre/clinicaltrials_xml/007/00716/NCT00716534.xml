	<criteria>Subject must be at least 18 years of age. Subject must have cytologically or histologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC Subject must have recurrent or advanced (Stage IIIb with pleural or pericardial effusion) or metastatic (Stage IV) disease that is not amenable to surgical resection or radiation with curative intent. Subject has measurable disease, defined as at least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion on a computed tomography (CT) scan as defined by RECIST (for subjects in the randomized portion only). Subject has an ECOG Performance Score of 01. Willing to take adequate measures to prevent pregnancy. The subject has NSCLC with a predominant squamous cell histology Subject has hypersensitivity to paclitaxel. Subject has received any anticancer therapy for treatment of NSCLC. Subject has received radiation therapy within 21 days of Study Day 1. Subject has had major surgery within 21 days. Subject has untreated brain or meningeal metastases. Subject is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Subject has a central thoracic tumor lesion as defined by location within the hilar structures. Subject has proteinuria CTC Grade &gt; 1 at baseline. Subject has a history of, or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer related events of bleeding. The subject currently exhibits symptomatic or persistent, uncontrolled hypertension defined as diastolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 90 mm Hg or systolic BP &gt; 140 mm Hg. The subject has a history of myocardial infarction, stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) within 6 months of Study Day 1. The subject has a documented left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction &lt; 50%. The subject has known autoimmune disease with renal involvement (i.e., lupus). The subject is receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV. The subject has clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s). The subject has a history of another active cancer within the past 5 years. The subject has active ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease or any other conditions that interfere with absorption. The subject has a medical condition, which in the opinion of the study investigator places them at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities. The subject is pregnant or breast feeding.</criteria>
