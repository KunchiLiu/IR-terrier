	<brief_summary>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have been well controlled with methotrexate plus infliximab may remain in remission or low disease activity without infliximab. And the chance of sustained remission increase by the addition of another DMARD, bucillamine, at the time of discontinuing infliximab. The BuSHIDO trial is the prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing MTX monotherapy and MTX plus bucillamine combination therapy as to the rate of disease flare after discontinuing infliximab.</brief_summary>
