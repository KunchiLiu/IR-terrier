	<brief_summary>The goal of the vaccination is to induce humoral (antibody) and intracellular (T lymphocyte) responses. Various data show that intradermal vaccination is more efficient than intramuscular vaccination: the humoral response is statistically better after intradermic vaccination, compared to intramuscular vaccination, even in target populations such as older subjects or immunosuppressed patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathophysiological Study of Characteristics of the Changes in the Cutaneous Immune System After Intradermal Antigen Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Realisation of 2 groups of healthy subjects with 2 intradermal injection of 50 µl of tuberculin + 2 intradermal injection of 50 µl of physiological serum. 5 biopsy performed on 2 Tuberculin injection site, 2 physiological serum site and 1 on healthy skin site : - Group A : healthy young subjects(18 to 40 years old) : 18 subjects - Sub-group A1 (biopsy 30 minutes after injection) : 6 subjects - Sub-group A2 (biopsy 4 hours after injection) : 6 subjects - Sub-group A3 (biopsy 72 hours after injection) : 6 subjects - Group B : healthy old subjects(60 to 75 years old) : 18 subjects - Sub-group B1 (biopsy 30 minutes after injection) : 6 subjects - Sub-group B2 (biopsy 4 hours after injection) : 6 subjects - Sub-group B3 (biopsy 72 hours after injection) : 6 subjects Determination of the best time (30 minutes, 4 hours or 72 hours)for intradermal vaccination caracteristics after group A and B data analysis. From these results, last group of immunosuppressed patients performed:Group C with 6 immunosuppressed patients (18 to 60 years old)</detailed_description>
