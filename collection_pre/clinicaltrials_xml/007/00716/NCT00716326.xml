	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of TENS in addition to routine care in patients with chronic pain of predominantly neuropathic origin, compared to treatment with routine care alone." Hypothesis: An eventually neuropathic pain component is needed to be identified and alleviated in chronic pain patients to improve the quality of rehabilitation. 0-hypothesis: - TENS is not better than than placebo, medication or standard rehabilitation program. - A neuropathic pain component does not demand special considerations in rehabilitation of chronic pain patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for Chronic Pain of Predominantly Peripheral Neuropathic Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting: Skogli helse- og rehabiliteringssenter, Lillehammer, Norway. Center of Rehabilitation for chronic pain patients, rheumatic diseases and orthopedic postoperative patients. Duration: Until 18 months of intervention + 6 months of follow up and preparation. Intervention: Use of TENS during 3-4 weeks of hospitalization connected to multimodal rehabilitation (short-term efficacy). TENS or placebo-TENS is added to routine care. Follow-up: If patients want to continue the use of TENS/placebo-TENS at home, they will be offered to borrow equipment for 4 months. Questionnaires will be send at 2 and 4 months, both for the active group, the placebo group and for the group of patients who discontinued the use of TENS/placebo-TENS (long-term efficacy).</detailed_description>
