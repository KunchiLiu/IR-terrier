	<brief_summary>The proposal seeks to establish: - A comprehensive compilation (database) of clinical information comprising clinical, histopathological, treatment and follow-up characteristics of past and future gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) cases in Singapore that can be shared by investigators. The characteristics will include clinical (eg age, sex, stage), histopathological (eg. grade, type), treatment (eg. treatment status, regimens) and outcome data (eg. survival, toxicity) from medical records. - A collection (bank) of corresponding frozen and fixed tissue, blood and processed samples (enriched blood mononuclear cells, protein, RNA, DNA, tissue arrays) in Singapore that can be shared by the investigators. - A gastrointestinal cancer co-operative group (GCCG) of clinicians and scientists researching prognostic and predictive markers in GIC, which will benefit from the multi-disciplinary knowledge, information and samples of its members. - To characterise genetic polymorphisms related to Gastrointestinal cancer chemotherapy treatment in controls (healthy volunteers)</brief_summary>
