	<brief_summary>Hypertensive patients with moderate hypertension have a risk to develop cardiovascular events of 15-20% over a period of 10 years. It is important to reach quickly the advised target, but often this result can be obtained with a combination therapy. Some evidences demonstrate sartans and calcium channels blockers can be very useful and safe, but it is also important to verify which association can give side effects or give some pharmacokinetic interactions that can negatively influence the clinical combination efficacy.</brief_summary>
