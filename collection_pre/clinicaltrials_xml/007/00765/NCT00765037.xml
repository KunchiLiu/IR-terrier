	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The RSP is indicated for use in patients with a grossly rotator cuff deficient shoulder joint with severe arthropathy or a previously failed joint replacement with a grossly rotator cuff deficient shoulder joint. The patient's joint must be anatomically and structurally suited to receive the selected implant(s), and a functional deltoid muscle is necessary to use the device. The glenoid baseplate is intended for Cementless application with the addition of screws for fixation. The humeral stem is intended for cemented use only. Infection or sepsis Insufficient bone quality which may affect the stability of the implant, as determined by the physician Muscular, neurological, or vascular deficiencies, which compromise the affected extremity Alcoholism or other addictions Materials (metals, etc) sensitivity Loss of ligamentous structures High levels of physical activity Nonfunctional deltoid muscle</criteria>
