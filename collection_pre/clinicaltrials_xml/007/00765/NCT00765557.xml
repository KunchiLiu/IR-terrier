	<brief_summary>We hypothesize fecal retention is the primary source of bladder dysfunction in some children with Urge Syndrome. Our specific aims are: 1. To test this hypothesis through a prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial of laxatives for children diagnosed with US. 2. To determine if a validated questionnaire of bowel activity administered to the family, and when appropriate, the patient, will identify those likely to benefit from laxative therapy for bladder dysfunction. 3. To determine if the abdominal X-Ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB) assessment of fecal loading corresponds to answers on the questionnaire regarding incidence of constipation, and/or response to laxative therapy for US.</brief_summary>
