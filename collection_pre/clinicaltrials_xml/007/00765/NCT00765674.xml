	<criteria>Male or female 18 years of age or older msDBP and msSBP requirements: 3A: Diagnosis of moderate to severe hypertension (msSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg, and/or msDBP ≥ 100 mmHg and &lt; 120 mmHg) at Visits 4, 5 or 6 (Qualifying BP visit) In addition, at the visit immediately prior to the above qualifying visit, patients were also to have msSBP ≥ 145 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg and msDBP ≥ 95 mmHg and &lt; 120 mmHg) at Visits 3, 5 or 5. Patients had to meet the above two sets of requirements at subsequent adjacent visits, i.e. either Visits 3 and 4, Visits 4 and 5, or Visits 5 and 6.
