	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of the anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial cell growth factor) treatment, ranibizumab, in combination with proton beam irradiation for the treatment of choroidal melanoma by determining the incidence and severity of ocular adverse events. Systemic adverse events will also be evaluated. A secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of ranibizumab in reducing ocular complications that can occur after irradiation.</brief_summary>
