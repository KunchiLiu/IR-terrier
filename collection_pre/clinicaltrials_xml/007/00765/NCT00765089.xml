	<brief_summary>Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common postoperative complications after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Postoperative AF produces a substantial impact on hospital resources with an estimated annual expenditure of over $1 billion. This includes the cost of pharmacological treatment and the cost of the increased length of stay. The incidence of AF is about 30-40% in CABG patients and increases with age of the patient. As the average age of the patient that undergoes CABG surgery is increasing, it is critical to find a way to prevent or reduce the incidence of this complication. We propose a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the role of pulmonary vein isolation by bipolar ablation in the prevention or reduction of postoperative AF. The block- randomization plan will be used to maintain balance of the study and control arms throughout the study.</brief_summary>
