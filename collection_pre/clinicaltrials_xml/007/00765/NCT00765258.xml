	<brief_summary>To examine, through retrospective and prospective chart review, the difference in pain and mobility, pre and post treatment, as assessed by the patient's completion of the VAS pain scale and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). CT fluoroscopy guidance during percutaneous sacroplasty is an effective treatment for sacro-iliac insufficiency fractures resulting in rapid reduction of pain and improved mobility in patients. This can be effectively assessed using the VAS pain scale and RMDQ both pre and post procedure.</brief_summary>
