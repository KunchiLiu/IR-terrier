	<brief_summary>This project will provide novel information concerning the ability of exercise to enhance the capacity for oxidative metabolism of fatty acids and improve insulin resistance in older adults who are at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. Ultimately this may help identify mechanisms and therapeutic targets implicated in skeletal muscle metabolic dysregulation. The proposed study is to conduct a randomized controlled exercise training intervention trial in older men and women. In addition, the response to exercise in these subjects will be compared to those of highly endurance-trained, age-matched athletes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis and Specific Aims: 1. To determine whether aerobic exercise improves both skeletal muscle fat distribution and insulin sensitivity of older men and women. We will test two hypotheses. i. Physical exercise in older adults will decrease the amount of fat interspersed within muscle, specifically the fat between muscle groups (intermuscular adipose tissue) as well as decrease specific lipid metabolites within muscle cells, compared to controls. ii. Exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity of older men and women will be related to the changes in muscle fat content independent of changes in total body fat or visceral abdominal adipose tissue. 2. To determine whether increased capacity for oxidative fatty acid metabolism within muscle results in improved insulin sensitivity in older adults. We will test two hypotheses. i. Exercise training will increase the capacity of muscle to oxidize fatty acids assessed both in vitro and in vivo. ii. Improved capacity for oxidative fatty acid metabolism will predict improvements in insulin sensitivity.</detailed_description>
