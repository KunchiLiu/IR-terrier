	<brief_title>Effect of Niaspan on Cholesterol in Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single center, open-label, randomized, mechanism of action study consisting of 8 weeks of active treatment preceded by a screening phase from one to 8 weeks and a baseline measurement of parameters of reverse cholesterol transport for 10 days. The population for this trial is 15 non-diabetic men aged 18-70 years. Ten subjects will be low HDL-C male volunteers who will receive aspirin and Niaspan and five subjects will be low HDL-C male volunteers who will receive only aspirin.</detailed_description>
