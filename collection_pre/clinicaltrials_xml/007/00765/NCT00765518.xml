	<brief_title>Use of Ixmyelocel-T (Formerly Cardiac Repair Cell [CRC] Treatment) in Patients With Heart Failure Due to Dilated Cardiomyopathy (IMPACT-DCM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure remains a major public health problem, affecting 5 million patients in the US with 550,000 new diagnoses made each year. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in persons over 65 years of age with cost exceeding $29 billion annually. Prognosis is very poor once a patient has been hospitalized with heart failure. The mortality risk after heart failure hospitalization is 11.3% at 30 days, 33.1% at 1 year and well over 50% within 5 years (Hunt SA; et al., 2005). These numbers emphasize the need to develop and implement more effective treatments to manage heart failure. This study is targeting a subset of heart failure patient population, namely those diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines dilated cardiomyopathy as a cardiac condition wherein a ventricular chamber exhibits increased diastolic and systolic volume and a low (&lt;40%) ejection fraction. DCM is reported to affect 108,000 to 150,000 patients in the U.S. This study is a prospective, stratified, randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center study to assess the safety profile and efficacy of CRCs in treating patients with DCM. It will enroll a total of 40 patients at 5 sites in the U.S.</detailed_description>
