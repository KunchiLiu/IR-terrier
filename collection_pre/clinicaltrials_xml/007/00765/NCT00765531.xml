	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study proposal is that pediatric urinary stone formers have genetic risk factors which predispose their urinary stone production. 50-60% of pediatric stone patients have a positive family history of urinary stone disease. Several genetic mutations have been identified which predispose patients to various types of urinary stones. These genetic mutations can also lead to other significant sequela besides stones, including osteopenia/osteoporosis (bone loss). Furthermore, metabolic abnormalities can be identified in more than 50% of pediatric stone formers, some of which can be improved/alleviated with medical intervention to help decrease rate of stone formation and the need for hospitalization and surgical intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female Englishspeaking Caucasian patients &gt;4 years of age with a history of stone formation before age 20 years, their family members, and sex and agematched pediatric normal volunteers will be included regardless of current age, gender, race or ethnicity. Patients will be excluded with voiding dysfunction or metabolic disorders including renal tubular acidosis, chronic renal insufficiency, intestinal malabsorption (inflammatory bowel disease, history of ileal resection or bladder augmentation, and cystic fibrosis), hyperparathyroidism, prolonged immobilization, vitamin D excess, hpercalcemia, hypophosphatasia, Bartter's syndrome, high dose steroid therapy, prematurity, and chronic lasix use. Any child with a bleeding diathesis or who is immunocompromised will be excluded given the increased risks of drawing blood. Participants who have been on antiseizure medication such as Topamax or other lithogenic drugs and antiseizure medication will be excluded. NonEnglish speaking subjects are not eligible to participate in the study, as this study specifically focuses on Englishspeaking Caucasian patients based on the adult study from which this study project has been derived.</criteria>
