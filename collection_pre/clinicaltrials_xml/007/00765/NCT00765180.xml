	<brief_summary>The investigators previously reported that colonoscopy with a transparent retractable extension (TRE) device improved the adenoma detection rate without affecting intubation and withdrawal times. On the other hand, colonoscopy using narrow band imaging (NBI) is expected to lead to higher rate s of adenoma detection. The investigators compared the effects of TRE device on colorectal adenoma detection with those of NBI.</brief_summary>
