	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial of a Literacy Sensitive Decision Aid for Bowel Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several countries have recently implemented national bowel cancer screening programs. To ensure equal access to screening, consumer information is needed to suit adults ranging in literacy level. Decision aids (DAs) are tools which have been developed to assist patients and consumers make informed health decisions and encourage active participation in health care decisions. Their use in a wide range of clinical settings has increased dramatically. However, most DAs are highly dependent upon high levels of literacy and numeracy, and few have been developed for low literacy populations. This primary aims of this study are to assess the impact of the decision aid on (1) the proportion of adults who make an informed choice about bowel cancer screening (using faecal occult blood test) and, (2) the level of involvement in screening decisions among adults with lower levels of education and literacy. There are three secondary aims of the study. First, to measure the effect of the decision support tool on decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, anxiety, and bowel cancer worry. Second, to identify participant's screening interest, intentions and behavior. Thirdly, we will explore participant's reactions towards the information materials they receive and whether the doctor influenced their screening decision.</detailed_description>
