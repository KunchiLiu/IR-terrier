	<brief_summary>The presence of foot drop limits normal gait. Our prior data has suggested that approximately 30% of MS patients have foot drop. Although we have observed that "task-specific" rehabilitation using the Lokomat can improve ambulation in chronic MS patients, subjects with "foot drop" have difficulty translating task-specific training to normative gait patterns over ground, despite improving speed and endurance. One of the key limitations of the Lokomat is a lack of robot-assisted training for the ankle joint. The Anklebot, an MIT-developed rehabilitation robot for the ankle, has the potential to address this. The device can move throughout three planes and train ankle flexion, extension, inversion and eversion; however, therapy with the Anklebot alone does not train the knee or hip. We plan to test whether subject foot drop and overall gait benefit more from Anklebot therapy alone or a combination of Anklebot and Lokomat.</brief_summary>
