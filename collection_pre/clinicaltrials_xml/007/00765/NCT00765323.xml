	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Octreotide Implant in Patients With Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in 3 phases: Screening, the Primary Treatment Phase (ie, Day 1 to Week 24), and the Extension Phase (Post Week 24 to Week 48). Primary efficacy and safety will be determined from the Primary Treatment Phase. Eligible patients will be randomized during the Primary Treatment Phase; in a 3 to 1 ratio to receive 6 months of open-label treatment with either the 84 mg octreotide implant or monthy Injections of S-LAR. Each patient in this study will return to the investigational center every 4 weeks; safety and efficacy assessments will be performed during these visits. All patients who complete the Primary Treatment Phase and who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be offered the opportunity to enter the Extension Phase; patients entering the Extension Phase will be treated with an octreotide implant for 6 months.During the Extension Phase, patients will return to the investigational center every 4 weeks; safety and efficacy assessments will be performed during these visits.</detailed_description>
