	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan in treating Asian patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Asian Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan hydrochloride according to the genotype status of Asian patients with solid tumors. Secondary - To investigate the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan hydrochloride and its metabolites SN-38 and SN-38G. - To evaluate time to tumor response, response duration, and time to progression in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to genotype status (UGT1A1*28 vs UGT1A1*6) Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.</detailed_description>
