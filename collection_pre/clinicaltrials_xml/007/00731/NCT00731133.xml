	<brief_summary>This 8 week, open-label pilot clinical trial will examine the safety and tolerability of disulfiram at 250 mg/day in up to fifteen methamphetamine dependent individuals. After undergoing screening procedures (approximately one week), eligible subjects will enter the study proper attend clinic every weekday during week 1 of the trial in order to receive the disulfiram under observation and complete assessments. Then subjects will receive weekly blister packs of medication and attend clinic thrice weekly during weeks 2-6. During weeks 7-8, subjects no longer take disulfiram, are followed for two weeks, then referred to treatment elsewhere, if desired. Urine samples will be obtained and a disulfiram side-effects checklist will be completed thrice-weekly. Self-reported drug use, craving and mood ratings will be completed weekly. All subjects undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. Adjunctive contingency management procedures will be utilized to enhance retention. The primary outcomes of interest include retention, side-effects, and drug use. Our hypothesis is that disulfiram will be well tolerated in this population.</brief_summary>

Results of this study will provide initial safety and drug use data for grant applications proposing to examine the clinical efficacy of disulfiram or similar agents to for treating methamphetamine dependence under placebo-controlled, double-blind conditions.</detailed_description>
