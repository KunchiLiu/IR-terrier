	<brief_summary>A large dose of PPI is effective in preventing peptic ulcer rebleeding. The investigators hypothesize that 40 mg/q6h pantoloc is equivalent to 8mg/h pantoloc in preventing rebleeding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Proton Pump Inhibitor for Peptic Ulcer Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A bleeding peptic ulcer remains a serious medical problem with significant morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and is now recommended as the first hemostatic modality for these patients. In the past few years, adjuvant use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some studies, two consensus statements and two meta-analysis. In our previous experience, we used omeprazole 160 mg /day infusion instead of 8 mg/h in these patients and obtained a good result . The objectives of this study are to assess the outcomes of two different regimens of high dose of intravenous pantoprazole after endoscopic therapy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients were accepted for endoscopic therapy if a peptic ulcer with active bleeding, a nonbleeding visible vessel (NBVV) or an adherent blood clot at the ulcer base was observed within 24 hours of hospital admission. If patients were pregnant Did not obtain initial hemostasis with endoscopic injection of epinephrine Did not give written informed consent Had bleeding tendency (platelet count &lt; 50Ã—109/L, serum prothrombin &lt; 30% of normal, or were taking anticoagulants), uremia.</criteria>
