	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the InSpectra StO2 Monitor can safely guide the amount of fluid needed during colorectal surgery. The study hypothesis is that intraoperative fluid limitation can be safely accomplished when guided by StO2 monitoring, and that this fluid restriction regimen will result in a reduction in postoperative morbidity when compared to standard monitoring and fluid therapy.</brief_summary>
