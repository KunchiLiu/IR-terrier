	<brief_title>Drotaverine Hydrochloride Versus Hyoscine-N-butylbromide for Duodenal Antimotility During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ERCP is an important endoscopic technique in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic and biliary diseases. Duodenal peristalsis can make cannulation of the papilla and the necessary therapeutic procedures difficult. Intravenous hyoscine-N-butylbromide is often used during ERCP to inhibit duodenal motility and enhance cannulation in China. However, the pharmaceutical agent is occasionally associated with serious complications such as cardiovascular events or anaphylactic shock. Hyoscine-N-butylbromide may also affect the ocular, urinary, and salivary systems. Drotaverine hydrochloride is an analogue of papaverine with smooth muscle relaxant properties. It is a non-anticholinergic antispasmodic, which selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase IV and is accompanied by a mild calcium channel-blocking effect. Adverse effects with drotaverine hydrochloride, such as hypotension, vertigo, nausea, and palpitation, are mostly mild. It can be supposed that intravenous drotaverine hydrochloride might be a feasible antimotility alternative to intravenous hyoscine-N-butylbromide in ERCP. But there is no clear evidence to recommend the use of drotaverine hydrochloride as an antispasmodic during ERCP. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of drotaverine hydrochloride versus hyoscine-N-butylbromide in reducing duodenal motility during diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. The effects of drotaverine hydrochloride on facilitative cannulation and its adverse effects were also compared to hyoscine-N-butylbromide.</detailed_description>
