	<detailed_description>Currently there are no optimal methods for treating symptomatic uterine fibroids. Existing therapeutic options are conservative (medications), invasive (e.g., hysterectomy, surgical myomectomy), or minimally invasive (uterine artery embolization, or myolysis). Fibroid ablation using cryogenic energy, known as Cryoablation, offers a potential alternative method of fibroid treatment. Cryotherapy is a well-established technique for the treatment of various benign and malignant conditions. Cryoablation has been described for the treatment of prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, liver tumors and benign and malignant breast tumors. Galil Medical's proposed feasibility study is looking to examine the technical success, safety and feasibility of a hysteroscopic approach for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids. This technique involves the insertion and placement of Galil Medical's 17-gauge cryoablation needle(s)guided by a hysteroscopic device. Ultrasound provides real-time monitoring of the needle insertion, placement and iceball propagation during the cryoablation procedure. This treatment offers the patient to preserve her uterus by a minimally invasive procedure. The type of the fibroids intended for treatment (Type II submucous myomas)are often very difficult to completely and safely remove hysteroscopically and are often treated through an open or laparoscopic procedure. A hysteroscopic procedure does not involve intraperitoneal intervention and is therefore expected to be associated with less intra-operative and post-operative complications. The recovery from hysteroscopic cryoablation is expected to be fast with only minimal self resolving discomfort. The patient should be able to return to her normal activity within 24-48 hours.</detailed_description>
