	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to allow patients who have participated in the precursor study of BCI-024 in combination with BCI-049 versus placebo or BCI-024 alone (Protocol #CBM-IT-01) to receive 6 weeks of open-label treatment with an increased dose of BCI-024 in combination with an increased dose of BCI-049. The safety and tolerability of this higher dose of the combination will be evaluated, as will the treatment effect in reducing symptoms of depression in patients with MDD.</brief_summary>
