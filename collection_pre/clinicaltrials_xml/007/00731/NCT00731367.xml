	<brief_summary>This phase IIIb, randomized, comparative, multi-center study is designed to evaluate two AQUACEL Ag protocols of care for the management of split-thickness donor sites. Both protocols of care will utilize AQUACEL Ag as the primary dressing. As per the randomization assignment, one protocol of care will have the AQUACEL Ag initially covered with a gauze dressing to create an adherent state and in the other protocol of care the AQUACEL Ag will be covered with a transparent film to maintain a gelled state. The primary objective of the study will be to quantify the proportion of subjects healed at 14 days. Secondary objectives will include: time to healing, degree of pain at dressing change and while wearing the dressing, simplicity of use, resources used in treatment and safety. Approximately 68 subjects will be enrolled from 10 centers from within the US and Canada.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject or legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent. Subject who is younger than legal consenting age must have a legally authorized representative who will provide written informed consent. The subject is scheduled to undergo a splitthickness skin graft (autograft) Harvesting of the donor site must be limited to the location and size of the anterior thigh The selected anterior thigh must be a first time harvesting. Subjects with known skin sensitivity to any of the dressing components. Subjects who require a full thickness graft. The subject with a poor prognosis, which would make it unlikely that he/she would survive the 21 day study period. Subjects who have been previously randomized into the study, or who are presently participating in another clinical trial.</criteria>
