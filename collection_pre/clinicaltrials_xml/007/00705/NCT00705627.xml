	<brief_summary>Locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)(stage III, IV in UICC 2002 Classification) can be divided into two groups according to the risk of metastasis: high-risk metastasis group (T4 or N2-3) and low-risk metastasis group (T3N0-1). In low-risk metastasis group, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) might decrease local recurrence and distance metastasis, which benefits overall survival. On the other hand, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also associated with lower distance metastasis of advanced stage NPC. Nevertheless, CCRT alone or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone leads to unsatisfactory results regarding to distance metastasis in patients with high-risk metastasis group. In this case, it is utmost important to investigate the new treatment combining neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus CCRT in order to improve overall survival of locoregionally advanced NPC with high-risk metastasis. In our study, in order to investigate the effect and adverse reaction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus CCRT on distance metastasis and locoregionally relapse, four hundred patients with high risk of distance metastasis will be randomly divided into two groups, comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (DDP+5FU) plus CCRT (DDP) and CCRT (DDP) alone. We aim to find out the best therapeutic regimen with lowest adverse reaction for NPCS with high risk of distance metastasis.</brief_summary>
