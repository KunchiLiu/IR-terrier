	<brief_summary>The current gold standard for treatment of chronic hepatitis C is pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Drug administration accuracy and ease of use will definitely determine treatment effectiveness. This is the idea behind the development and usage of the PegIntron pen (PegPen). Therefore, it is worthwhile to evaluate patients' satisfaction with this novel device. The results of the study will be used to improve PegPen training techniques for patients and health care providers.</brief_summary>
