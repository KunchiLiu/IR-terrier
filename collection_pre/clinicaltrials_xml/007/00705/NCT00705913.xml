	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare sizing,implant techniques, and hemodynamics between the Mitroflow Pericardial Aortic Valve and the Edwards Magna Heart Valve.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Sizing and Hemodynamic Study Mitroflow vs. Magna</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparisons of valve types are often made according to labeled valve sizes. There is growing evidence that in the majority of cases the actual sizer and valve dimensions vary from the labeled diameters, which may not be related to any hemodynamically meaningful dimension. The disagreement between the true valve dimensions and the labeled valve size may render comparisons based on labeled size meaningless</detailed_description>
