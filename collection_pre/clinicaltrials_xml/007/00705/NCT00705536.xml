	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Humalog (insulin lispro) or Humulin-R (recombinant human insulin) when administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of 20 units (U) with or without coadministration of recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20). The study hypothesizes that the time required to reach maximum insulin concentration (tmax) when insulin is administered with rHuPH20 will be comparable or shorter than the time required without rHuPH20.</brief_summary>

Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol. 4. Vital signs within the normal range. 5. Within 7 days before the first injection, metabolic panel results and complete blood count (CBC) within the laboratory normal reference range. 6. Fasting plasma glucose within the normal range of 90 to 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) on the morning of the glucose clamp. 7. Agreement not to father a child or donate sperm and to use effective contraception during the study and for at least 30 days after study completion. 8. Willingness and ability to sign an informed consent form. 1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematologic, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic (to include history of seizures) or allergic disease, or history of hypoglycemic episodes. 2. Known history of diabetes mellitus. 3. Prior exposure to any insulin or insulin analogs. 4. Known allergy to hyaluronidase or any other ingredient in HYLENEX. 5. Known allergy to bee or vespid venom. 6. Positive urine drug screen results. 7. Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1, HIV 2, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C antibody test result. 8. Any history or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse. 9. History or evidence of use of any tobacco or nicotinecontaining product within 6 months of screening, or screening urine nicotine concentration &gt;50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). 10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs within 7 days or 5 halflives, whichever was shorter, except acetaminophen at doses of less than or equal to 1 gram per day (g/day). 11. Donation of blood in excess of 500 milliliters (mL) within 56 days before dosing. 12. Failure to limit alcohol consumption and refrain from exercise within 48 hours before each injection. 13. Known clinically significant intercurrent illness or other major systemic disease that would unduly risk the participant's safety or interfere with the interpretation of results. 14. Participation in a study of any investigational drug or device 30 days before enrollment in this study. 15. Unfitness for the study, in the investigator's opinion.</criteria>
