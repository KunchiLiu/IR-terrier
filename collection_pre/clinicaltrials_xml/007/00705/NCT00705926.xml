	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether HIV treatment that is initiated during the acute phase of HIV infection, followed by discontinuation of treatment, is effective in reducing the amount of HIV and an increasing the amount of CD4 cells in the blood of people with HIV, compared to the amounts of HIV and CD4 cells in people who do not receive treatment at this stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Antiretroviral Therapy During Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for the treatment of HIV infection has been remarkably successful in reducing morbidity and mortality in HIV infected people. This treatment still has its shortcomings, however. Individuals receiving ARV treatment are at risk of toxicity, developing drug resistance, and unknown long-term side effects. Therefore, development of alternative treatment strategies is important. A short course of ARV treatment that is initiated during the acute period of HIV infection, followed by treatment cessation may have a substantial impact on controlling infection and delaying the need for lifelong potent ARV therapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether treatment initiated during acute HIV infection and followed by a terminal treatment interruption is effective in lowering the viral load set point and raising CD4 cell counts in people with HIV, as compared to those measures in people with HIV who have received no treatment. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Participants in Group A1 will receive ARV therapy for 12 weeks. Participants in Group A2 will receive ARV therapy for 32 weeks. Participants in Group B will not receive any treatment. This study will not provide medications to any of the groups. All groups will be followed for a total of 72 weeks following study entry. Participants will attend between 30 and 36 study visits over the course of the 72 weeks, depending on their study group. Study visits will occur every week for the first 12 weeks and then every 1 to 6 weeks for the remainder of the study. Tests occurring at study visits may include blood tests, investigational immune system tests, and pregnancy tests. Participants will also undergo a complete physical exam and will be asked to provide information about their medical and medication histories.</detailed_description>

Individuals who received a saline placebo in a prior HIV vaccine trial are not excluded, provided that they did not receive a sham vector or an adjuvant. Receipt of immunosuppressive medications or immunomodulators (e.g., cytokine therapy) within the past 6 months. Participants taking corticosteroid nasal spray for allergic rhinitis; topical corticosteroids for acute, uncomplicated dermatitis; or over the counter medications for acute, uncomplicated dermatitis for a period not longer than 14 days will not be excluded.
