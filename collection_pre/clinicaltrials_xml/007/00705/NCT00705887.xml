	<brief_summary>The specific aims of this research are: Aim 1 - To describe the UV protection behaviors and beliefs of young adult patients in a dermatology clinic. Aim 2 - To examine whether or not the UV protection behaviors and beliefs of young adult dermatology patients are associated with age, gender, level of education, marital status, contact with skin cancer, time outdoors, skin type, the reason for their visit, and the date of data collection. Aim 3 - To test the efficacy of a motivational enhancement approach to UV protection counseling for young adult dermatology patients, as manifested by favorable changes in UV protection stages of change, UV protection self-efficacy, and UV protection attitudes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Motivational Enhancement Approach to Skin Cancer Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, it is highly preventable by reducing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, recent primary prevention efforts have been inadequate in evoking behavior change, as manifested by increasing rates of ultraviolet radiation exposure, particularly among young adults. These findings indicate the need to research novel approaches to skin cancer prevention. Motivational enhancement techniques facilitate patient-centered, directive discussions wherein practitioners provide clear structure and encourage patients to play an active role in the consultation. The use of motivational enhancement techniques for health behavior change in medical settings has thus far yielded encouraging results for other health behavior change topics, but research has not yet investigated the application of these techniques to skin cancer prevention discussions.</detailed_description>
