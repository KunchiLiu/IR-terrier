	<brief_summary>In February 2002, a French Consensus Conference on the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C in France was organized. The jury issued several recommendations on pegylated alpha interferon/ribavirin treatment strategy. Three years after these recommendations, it is of interest to understand the evolution of hepatitis C management in France in real clinical practice. This observational study will permit the identification of patients who are treated and will provide information on the use of PegIntron/ Ribavirin.</brief_summary>
