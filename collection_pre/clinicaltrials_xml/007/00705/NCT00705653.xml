An escalating dose of PG-11047 will be investigated in this study and the maximum tolerated dose of the drug will be established.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of CGC-11047 (PG-11047) in Subjects With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label phase I, dose-escalation safety study in subjects with refractory solid tumors. The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PG-11047. PG-11047 will be administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. The planned minimum treatment schedule is 2 cycles (8 weeks) of PG-11047 treatment. Subjects who tolerate treatment may be eligible to receive additional cycles as per investigator's medical judgment. Evaluation of anti-tumor response will be performed every 2 cycles.</detailed_description>
