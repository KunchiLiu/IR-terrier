	<brief_summary>Information on the mechanisms of zinc is still in developing phase. Ecological and biological implications of long term zinc supplementation at population level requires assessment. The trial aims to assess the impact of routine supplementation of zinc among young growing children and evaluate its impact on intestinal microbial flora and relationship with gut mucosa integrity and co-morbidities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>WHO has recommended the use of zinc for the treatment of acute diarrhea. Literature supports up-scaling of zinc supplementation programs to prevent childhood illnesses, such as diarrhea and respiratory infections, and its subsequent co-morbid conditions. As the potential mechanisms of action of zinc still remains to be established, this trial is proposed to evaluate the relationship of intestinal microbial flora, intestinal permeability, morbidity patterns and response to various enteric pathogens in a representative birth cohort randomly allocated to receive daily zinc and micronutrients from 6-18 months of age, and a control population.</detailed_description>
