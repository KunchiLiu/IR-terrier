	<brief_summary>Levamisole as an immunomodulator drug has been demonstrated to improve the immune response to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of levamisole supplementation on tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine response rate in hemodialysis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Levamisole Supplementation on Tetanus Vaccination Response Rates in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levamisole as an immunomodulator drug has been demonstrated to improve the immune response to HBV vaccination in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of levamisole supplementation on Td vaccine response rate in hemodialysis patients. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial 40 hemodialysis patients who had not received tetanus vaccination in a year before investigation and had unprotective anti-tetanus immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (&lt;0.1 International Unit [IU]/ml) were enrolled. These patients were randomized into two equal groups to receive one dose of intramuscular Td vaccine supplemented with either levamisole 100 mg or placebo daily, six days before and six days after vaccination. The anti-tetanus IgG levels were measured 1 and 6 months after vaccination.</detailed_description>
