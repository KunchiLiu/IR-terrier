	<brief_title>The Effects of Xalatan, Travatan and Lumigan on Skin Pigmentation Near the Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One uncommon side effect of prostaglandin eye drops is a change in color of the skin around the eyes, which is reversible. There are three different brands of the medicine which are equally effective in lowering eye pressure but their likelihood of changing skin color is unknown. Qualifying patients will be randomly assigned to use one of the three eye drops. We will take skin color measurements from several locations on the face over one year to measure pigmentation changes.</detailed_description>
