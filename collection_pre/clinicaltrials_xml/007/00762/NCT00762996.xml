They are willing and able to follow the protocol. They would be expected to attain at least 6.9 (20/30) in each eye with the study lenses. They are able to wear contact lenses which have a back vertex power of 1.00 to 6.00DS. They have a maximum of 1.00D of refractive astigmatism (i.e. &lt; 1.00 DC). They have worn soft contact lenses within six months of starting the study. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment. They are aphakic. They have had corneal refractive surgery. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or has keratoconus. They are pregnant or lactating. They have grade 2 or greater of any of the following ocular surface signs: corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining, tarsal conjunctival changes or any other abnormality which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear.
