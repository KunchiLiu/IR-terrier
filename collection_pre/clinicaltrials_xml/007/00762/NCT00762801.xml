	<brief_summary>RLIP76 (Ral binding protein1) is a 76 kDa splice variant protein encoded by the human gene (RALBP1, 18p11.22). It is a multifunctional modular protein found ubiquitously from Drosophila to humans, in cells ranging from red blood cells to endothelial cells of the brain. Its expression more predominant in breast, heart, liver and less so in colon and brain parenchyma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies on the Expression and Functions of RLIP76 in Blood Samples of Healthy Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RLIP76 is shown to be over expressed in a variety of cancer cells. However, no study has yet been done on its expression on normal cells. The studies proposed in this project will study the expression of RLIP76 in blood cells of healthy human subjects in the population of North Texas region.</detailed_description>
