	<brief_title>Study of TAK-559 in Treating Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin is a primary regulator of blood glucose concentrations. A subnormal response to circulating insulin levels at target tissues leads to a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Insulin resistance is associated with normal to high insulin levels and is often accompanied by dyslipidemia, a disruption in lipid metabolism resulting in increased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels as well as decreased high-density lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the early stages of insulin resistance, a compensatory mechanism of increased insulin secretion by the pancreas maintains normal to near-normal glucose levels. Once the pancreas fails to maintain the increased insulin output, overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs. Insulin also plays an important role in the metabolism of fat and proteins and exerts its influence at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor level. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -alpha receptors are expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, heart, liver, kidney, gut, macrophages, and vascular tissue, and play a key role in energy storage, glucose homeostasis, and vascular biology. Thus, as insulin activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptors, this results in the cellular uptake of glucose. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor receptors are ligand-activated transcription elements that regulate gene expression necessary for metabolism. For this reason, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors play a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and lipid storage. The genes predominantly targeted by transcription activity of activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptors are those that mediate fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and lipoprotein metabolism. As such, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonists have their greatest effect on lipid metabolism and vascular biology. TAK-559 is a novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid under investigation for use as an oral agent in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TAK-559 has partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity, potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity, and modest peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity at high concentrations in nonclinical models. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of TAK-559 in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were on a stable dose of insulin.</detailed_description>
