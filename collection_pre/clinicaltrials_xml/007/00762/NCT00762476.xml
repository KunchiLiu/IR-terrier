	<brief_title>Efficacy Trial of 3804-250A in the Prevention of Cold Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhinovirus infections are the most frequent cause up to 80% of cold illnesses during the fall rhinovirus season. While viral upper respiratory infections are generally mild and self-limited, they are associated with an enormous economic burden both in lost productivity and in expenditures for treatment. Rhinovirus infection is frequently associated with medical complications that have substantial morbidity such as acute otitis media and exacerbation of asthma. Marketed treatment options for rhinovirus consist primarily of symptomatic cold remedies have only modest effects on specific cold symptoms. 3804-250A is under investigation for the prevention of rhinovirus infection by interruption of person-to-person transmission appears to be technologically and economically feasible. The study is a randomized, double-blind, Placebo controlled, multi-site, parallel design clinical trial conducted in the natural setting. The study will be conducted during a 10-week period during the fall rhinovirus epidemic season. Healthy, normal subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned to the AV Lotion or Placebo control group. Subjects will use the assigned test product on a defined schedule and will record the presence of cold illness symptoms daily. Subjects will return to the study site every week during the study for review and clarification of study diary entries, for review and assessment of compliance, for specimen collection for rhinovirus PCR.</detailed_description>
