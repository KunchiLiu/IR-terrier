	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect information on unexpected adverse reactions (ADRs), how often ADRs occur, and factors that can affect the safety and effectiveness of Claritin (loratadine) when used in children. Patients will be observed while they are taking Claritin, and ADRs and symptom scores will be recorded. At the end of treatment, improvement in symptoms will be recorded. Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.</brief_summary>
