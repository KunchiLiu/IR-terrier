	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Anti-Plaque Effect of AN0128 Toothpaste</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The widespread successful use of triclosan as an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agent is well documented. The standard dentrifice has demonstrated a robust anti-plaque and anti-inflammatory effect providing multiple benefits. There is a clear value to identify additional agents with the same dual action with a comparable or an enhanced level of efficacy. This study examined the anti-plaque efficacy following a single use of the prototype dentifrice.</detailed_description>
