	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of desflurane (BLM-240) as an anesthetic agent and to demonstrate the non-inferiority of desflurane to sevoflurane in term of awakening/recovery from anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Japan Phase 2/3 Clinical Study With BLM-240 (Desflurane)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the use of desflurane (BLM-240) (with and without nitrous oxide) in maintenance of general anesthesia in adult patients undergoing surgical procedures typically performed under general anesthesia in Japan (thoracic, abdominal, joints, back, and neck), where analgesics and muscle relaxants are concomitantly used. The study is also intended to demonstrate the non-inferiority of desflurane with nitrous oxide to sevoflurane with nitrous oxide in time to awakening/recovery.</detailed_description>
