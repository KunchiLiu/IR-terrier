	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and utility of LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ in relation to a currently approved active control product (High Viscosity DermaBond). Specifically, the study is powered to demonstrate that LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ is not inferior to DermaBond in the rates of infection, dehiscence, cosmesis and apposition of the skin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of MedLogic LiquiBand Laparoscopic Versus Dermabond in the Closure of Surgical Incisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked multi-center clinical trial. Patients requiring laparoscopic surgery will be enrolled and randomized to receive either LiquiBand Laparoscopic™ or DermaBond High Viscosity for incision closure. No other closure methods will be allowed. All eligible laparoscopic incisions per patient will be enrolled. Patients will be followed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-procedure to assess wound characteristics, wound infection, wound dehiscence and at 3 months for cosmesis. The study will be double-masked in that both the wound evaluator and patient will be masked to the randomized study treatment assignment.</detailed_description>
