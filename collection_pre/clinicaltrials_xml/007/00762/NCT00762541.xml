	<brief_title>Study of the MEL 80 Excimer Laser Using LASIK in the Treatment of Moderate to High Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LASIK has become one of the most common refractive eye procedures performed in the country. Currently the MEL 80 Excimer Laser System is approved for the elimination of myopia of less than or equal to -7.0 D with or without refractive astigmatism of less than or equal to -3.0 D, with a maximum MRSE of -7.00 D. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness information on the treatment of moderate to high magnitudes of myopia.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Myopia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Myopia &gt; 7.00 D to 12.00 D, and astigmatism less than or equal to 6.00 D at the spectacle plane, with a maximum MRSE â‰¤12.00 D. Stable refraction for at least the last twelve months, as demonstrated by a change of less than 1.00 D of the spherical equivalent during the twelve months prior to the baseline examination of the eye to be treated, documented by previous clinical records. Discontinue use of contact lenses at least 2 weeks for hard contacts and 3 days for soft lenses prior to the preoperative examination. Hard contact lens wearers must have two central keratometry readings and two manifest refractions taken at least one week apart that do not differ by more than 0.50 D. Visual acuity correctable to at least 20/40 in both eyes. UCVA of 20/40 or worse in the operative eye. At least 18 years of age. Operative eye must be targeted for emmetropia. Have a normal corneal topography. Willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations for twelve months after surgery. Sign and be given a copy of the written Informed Consent form. History of anterior segment pathology, including cataracts (in the operative eye). Clinically significant dry eye syndrome unresolved by treatment. Residual, recurrent, active ocular or uncontrolled eyelid disease, corneal scars within the ablation zone or other corneal abnormality such as recurrent corneal erosion or severe basement membrane disease. Ophthalmoscopic signs of progressive or unstable myopia or keratoconus (or keratoconus suspect). An ablation deeper than 250 microns from the corneal endothelium. Irregular or unstable (distorted/not clear) corneal mires on central keratometry readings. Blind in the fellow eye. Undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind in the operative eye(s), including any type of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes. History of ocular Herpes zoster or Herpes simplex keratitis. History of steroidresponsive rise in intraocular pressure, glaucoma, or preoperative IOP &gt;21 mm Hg. Must not have diabetes, diagnosed autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease, or clinically significant atopic syndrome. Must not be immunocompromised or use chronic systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. Patients must not be pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential and not practicing a medically approved method of birth control. Patients must not have a known sensitivity to planned study medications. Patients must not be participating in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial during the time of this clinical investigation. For Fellow (Second) Eyes in Simultaneous Bilateral Treatment Procedures 1. Flap complications during the first eye's surgery such as a free cap, partial flap, thin flap, or irregular flap. 2. Epithelial defect exceeding 2 mm x 2 mm in dimension, or clinically significant debris in the interface between the flap and underlying stroma for the first eye. 3. Severe blepharospasm in the first eye that may have prevented or impeded the completion of the keratectomy and/or the laser ablation procedure. 4. Poor subject cooperation with instructions for the first eye's surgery and/or poor subject fixation on the laser fixation target. 5. Aborted LASIK procedure in the first eye or PRK was performed in the first eye because LASIK was not possible.</criteria>
