	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of TAK-559 in Combination With Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin is a primary regulator of blood glucose concentrations. A subnormal response to circulating insulin levels at target tissues leads to a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Insulin resistance is associated with normal to high insulin levels and is often accompanied by dyslipidemia, a disruption in lipid metabolism resulting in increased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels as well as decreased high-density lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the early stages of insulin resistance, a compensatory mechanism of increased insulin secretion by the pancreas maintains normal to near-normal glucose levels. Once the pancreas fails to maintain the increased insulin output, overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs. Insulin also plays an important role in the metabolism of fat and proteins and exerts its influence at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor level. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -alpha receptors are expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, heart, liver, kidney, gut, macrophages, and vascular tissue, and play a key role in energy storage, glucose homeostasis, and vascular biology. Thus, as insulin activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptors, this results in the cellular uptake of glucose. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor receptors are ligand-activated transcription elements that regulate gene expression necessary for metabolism. For this reason, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors play a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and lipid storage. The genes predominantly targeted by transcription activity of activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptors are those that mediate fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and lipoprotein metabolism. As such, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonists have their greatest effect on lipid metabolism and vascular biology. TAK-559 is a novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid under investigation for use as an oral agent in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TAK-559 has partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity, potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity, and modest peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity at high concentrations in nonclinical models. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and glycemic control of TAK-559 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking metformin for whom monotherapy with an oral anti-diabetic had been insufficient.</detailed_description>

Had any condition known to invalidate glycosylated hemoglobin results (eg, hemolytic states or hemoglobinopathies). Took any disallowed medication, prescription medication, herbal treatment or overthe counter medication that may have interfered with evaluation of the study medication, including: Insulin Oral antidiabetics including sulfonylureas and alphaglucosidase inhibitors Systemic corticosteroids Warfarin Rifampin St. John's Wort. Thiazolidinediones Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor agonists Nicotinic Acid Fibrates Had a history of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty or bypass graft, unstable angina pectoris, transient ischemic attacks, clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram, or documented cerebrovascular accident within 6 months before Screening A. Had abdominal, thoracic, or vascular surgery within 6 months before Screening A that in the investigator's opinion warranted exclusion from the study.

Had an alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, active liver disease, or jaundice at Screening A. Had a positive antihepatitis B surface antigen, or antihepatitis B e antigen test results at Screening A. Was currently taking another investigational study medication or had taken an investigational study medication within 30 days before Screening A. Had any other serious disease or condition at Screening A or at Randomization that might have affected life expectancy or made it difficult to successfully manage and follow the patient according to the protocol.</criteria>
