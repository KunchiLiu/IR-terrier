	<brief_summary>Many recent publications have reported encouraging results on diagnostic cardiac multislice CT performance in 1) coronary artery disease, 2) coronary arterial bypass graft potency and 3) intrastent restenosis. These single center studies were made on a limited number of patients (range, 50-130) and focused mainly on one of the indications mentioned above. Moreover, results were often given after exclusion of low quality examinations. At last, no study has compared the diagnostic performance of the different CT systems '16, 40 and 64) in these populations.</brief_summary>
