	<brief_title>Follow-up of Children After Stuttering Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stuttering treatment becomes more time-consuming and less effective as children become older. Therefore it is crucial to prevent relapse following treatment in the early years. This study will investigate predictors of relapse and assess the effectiveness of a simple two-weekly user-friendly reminder to parents, about when and how to address any re-occurring stuttering after treatment. Results from the study may help to prevent stuttering relapse in this age group in the future.</detailed_description>
