	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine how quickly HIV-1 is cleared from the blood in treatment-experienced patients beginning a salvage therapy regimen that includes the integrase inhibitor raltegravir. The hypothesis is that HIV-1 is cleared as rapidly in these patients as in treatment-naive patients starting a raltegravir-based regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV-1 Viral Dynamics in Subjects Initiating Raltegravir Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will closely examine the viral dynamics of both HIV-1 RNA and DNA in treatment-experienced subjects initiating raltegravir. The data derived from this study will further elucidate the effects of antiviral therapy on viral decay and help refine current viral dynamics models. In addition, results of this study will generate hypotheses for further testing regarding the mechanisms of action of integrase inhibitor therapy in salvage regimens. Lastly, this viral dynamic study on a unique cohort will provide an opportunity to further validate the effectiveness of the methods of measuring rate of decrease of viral RNA and DNA in piloting potential potent drug regimens.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Raltegravir Potassium</mesh_term>
	<criteria>HIVinfected patients age 18 years or older requiring treatment with raltegravir in order to construct an adequately active antiretroviral regimen. Availability of at least two other drugs expected to have full activity based on genotypic and/or phenotypic drug resistance testing, a coreceptor tropism assay, or first use of a drug from a previously unused class of antiretroviral drugs (e.g., first use of enfuvirtide). Plasma HIV1 RNA &gt;10,000 copies/mL at screening (within 6 weeks of study entry). Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 48 hours prior to entry for women with reproductive potential Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Previous treatment with any approved or investigational strandtransfer integrase inhibitor at any time prior to study entry. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or their formulation. Any subject with an acute AIDSdefining opportunistic infection (OI) who is not clinically stable or who has not been on therapy for the OI for at least 30 days prior to study entry. Subjects who have no evidence of active disease and are receiving maintenance therapy for AIDSrelated OIs will be eligible. Treatment within 30 days prior to study entry with immune modulators such as systemic steroids, interleukins, interferons, granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF), erythropoietin, or any investigational therapy. NOTE: Subjects receiving stable physiologic glucocorticoid doses, defined as prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day (or equivalent) as a stable or tapering dose, will be permitted. Subjects receiving corticosteroids for acute therapy forPneumocystis jaroveci pneumonia (PCP) or asthma exacerbation, or receiving a short course (defined as ≤ 2 weeks of pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy) will not be excluded. • Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until candidate either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the site investigator, for at least 7 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Oral candidiasis, vaginal candidiasis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, and other minor illnesses (as judged by the site investigator) have no restriction. • Substance abuse that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.who have limited or no treatment options due to extensive antiretroviral drug resistance or drug intolerance.</criteria>
