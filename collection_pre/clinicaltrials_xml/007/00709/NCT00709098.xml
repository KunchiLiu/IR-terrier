	<brief_summary>Patients with symptomatic idiopathic (IPAH) or familial (FPAH) pulmonary arterial hypertension in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV , naive to PAH treatment or currently being treated with a stable dose of either bosentan or sildenafil and who complete PROWESS 15 will be enrolled in the PROWESS 15 Extension study. This is a double-blind (12 week), randomized study to compare the safety and tolerability of inhaled iloprost power disc-15 and power disc-6 in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). After completion of the double blind period, patients will be entered in the open label period using iloprost power disc-15.</brief_summary>
