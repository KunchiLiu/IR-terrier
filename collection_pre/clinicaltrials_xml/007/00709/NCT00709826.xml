	<brief_title>APRiCOT-P: Study of Apricoxib With Gemcitabine and Erlotinib to Treat Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare the anti-tumor efficacy of apricoxib and gemcitabine/erlotinib with placebo and gemcitabine/erlotinib as measured by progression-free survival to test the hypothesis that down regulation of COX-2 and EGFR pathways in patients with up-regulated COX-2 expression in tumors will have a clinical benefit compared with Gemcitabine/Erlotinib only.</detailed_description>
