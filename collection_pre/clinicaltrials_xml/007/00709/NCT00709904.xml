	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of once daily (QD) subcutaneous (SC) injections of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) versus placebo for 3 additional weeks following an initial 7 to 10-day venous thromboprophylaxis with open-label AVE5026 in patients having undergone hip fracture surgery. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of extended AVE5026 administration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of AVE5026 as Compared to Placebo for the Extended Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients Having Undergone Hip Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total duration of observation per participant is 56-63 days from surgery broken down as follows: - 7 to 10-day initial treatment period with open-label Semuloparin sodium; - Randomization; - 19 to 23-day double-blind treatment period with Semuloparin sodium or placebo; - 30-day follow-up period.
