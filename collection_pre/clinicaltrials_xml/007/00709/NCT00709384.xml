	<brief_summary>The investigators performed a prophylactic peroperative linear lesions connecting the tricuspid annulus with a right atriotomy and the atriotomy with the inferior caval vein to prevent atrial flutter on 15 consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. Conduction time between electrodes placed on both sides of the lesions is measured on the second postoperative day. Coronary angiography and electrophysiology study using an electroanatomic mapping system to assess conduction across the line are performed three month after the operation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We perform a prophylactic peroperative linear lesions connecting the tricuspid annulus with a right atriotomy (surgical dissection plus cryoablation) and the atriotomy with the inferior caval vein (cryoablation alone) to prevent atrial flutter on 15 consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. Conduction times between electrodes placed on both sides of the lesions are measured on the second postoperative day. Coronary angiography and electrophysiology study using an electroanatomic mapping system to assess conduction across the line and to try to induce atrial flutter are performed three month after the operation.</detailed_description>
