	<brief_summary>A number of common eye diseases such as retinal artery and vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy are associated with ocular perfusion abnormalities. Although this is well recognized there is not much possibility to improve blood flow to the posterior pole of the eye in these diseases. Since many years, moxaverine is used in the therapy of perfusion abnormalities in the brain, the heart and the extremities. This is based on a direct vasodilator effect of the drug, but also on the rheological properties of red blood cells. Whether moxaverine affects blood flow in the eye is unknown. The present study aims to investigate whether moxaverine may improves blood flow in the eye after systemic administration.</brief_summary>
