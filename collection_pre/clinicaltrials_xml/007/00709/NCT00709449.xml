	<brief_summary>A number of common eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma are associated with ocular perfusion abnormalities. Although this is well recognized there is not much possibility to improve blood flow to the posterior pole of the eye in these diseases. For many years, moxaverine has been used in the therapy of perfusion abnormalities in the brain, the heart and the extremities. This is based on a direct vasodilatatory effect of the drug, but also on the rheological properties of red blood cells. In a recent study the investigators have shown that intravenous moxaverine increases choroidal blood flow in healthy young subjects. The present study aims to investigate, whether moxaverine also improves blood flow in the diseased eye after systemic administration.</brief_summary>
