	<brief_summary>This study was designed to assess single-dose and multiple-dose PK and safety parameters utilizing a dosage of 3 mL (500 µg/mL)AeroLEF delivered via nebulization with the AeroEclipse BAN device. The study was conducted in opioid naïve subjects who were not blocked with naloxone or other opioid receptor antagonists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Single and Multiple Doses of Inhaled AeroLEF (Liposome-Encapsulated Fentanyl)in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Period I: Subjects received an i.v.dose of fentanyl (200 µg) (Treatment A). Period II: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a single-dose (Treatment B) or multi-dose (Treatment C) of AeroLEF. In the multi-dose Treatment C group, subjects received a dose of 3 mL AeroLEF every 12 hours for a total of five doses over a 3 days with a 4 week washout period before crossing over to Period III. Period III: Subjects from Period II participated in the crossover study and receive either a multi-dose (Treatment C, 5 doses at 12 hour intervals) or a single dose (Treatment B). Subjects in Treatment B or Treatment C were instructed to continue inhalation of AeroLEF for approximately one (1) minute beyond the point of nebulizer sputter to ensure that all aerosolized medication was delivered.</detailed_description>
