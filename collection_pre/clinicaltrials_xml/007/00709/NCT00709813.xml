	<brief_summary>Patient-provider shared decision making and the inclusion of patients' illness experiences and preferences in patient care are prioritized areas in health care. CHOICE is a computer-based support system for patient-centered symptom management of cancer patients developed for this purpose. In this randomized clinical trial at Rikshospitalet- Radiumhospitalet HF 145 adult stem-cell transplantation and newly diagnosed lymphoma and leukemia patients used CHOICE for assessments of their symptoms, problems and priorities for care at in-and outpatient visits during treatment and rehabilitation. In the experimental group this information was shared with physicians an nurses for subsequent care planning, but not in the control group. This study tested effects of CHOICE on symptom- related patient care and outcomes of symptom relief, patients' needs for care over time and patient satisfaction;(2) analyzed how patients' symptoms, needs for care varied during illness/treatment stages; and (3) evaluated CHOICE' ease of use and user satisfaction. Controlling for gender, age, diagnosis, and type/stage of treatment, education, depression, health related quality of life, and social support, repeated measurement models were used to test differences and variations in outcome variables within and between groups and over time.</brief_summary>
