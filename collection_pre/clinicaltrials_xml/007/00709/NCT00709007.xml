	<brief_summary>Though the HIV epidemic in India is predominantly among heterosexual populations, it is estimated that there are approximately 1.1 million injection drug users (IDUs) in India with HIV prevalence as high as 64% among IDUs in certain cities. In April 2004, the government of India launched a free-antiretroviral therapy roll-out program aimed at initiating 100,000 persons on HAART. Similar guidelines are currently being followed for the delivery and choice of HAART for IDU and non-IDU populations. However, IDUs have certain issues that complicate the delivery of HAART that need to be addressed by delivery programs such as delayed access to care, poor perceived adherence, and more rapid disease progression. This proposal will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) in conjunction with opioid substitution as a mode of delivery of HAART to IDUs in Chennai, India. To evaluate this objective we will conduct a randomized controlled pilot study of DAART vs self-administered therapy (SAT) among 100 HIV-1 infected treatment naïve IDUs who are enrolled in an opioid substitution program in Chennai and compare the following outcomes between the two arms: Primary Endpoint: Proportion of participants with viral load (VL) &lt;400 copies/ml at 24 and 48 weeks; Secondary Endpoints: (1) Incidence of mortality and AIDS-defining illnesses at 24 and 48 weeks, (2) Changes in absolute CD4+ count from baseline at 24 and 48 weeks, and (3) Incidence of antiretroviral drug resistance at 24 and 48 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses will be used. The study objective is in line with the priority areas identified in the Indian National AIDS Control Program Phase III (NACP III) and the results of this study will help inform the government of India on appropriate modes of delivery of HAART to IDUs. This study will also be among the first studies to be conducted in India to evaluate two different modes of delivery of HAART to IDUs.</brief_summary>
