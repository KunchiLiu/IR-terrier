	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study of Folic Acid and Oral Contraceptive Tablets Containing Norgestimate (NGM)/Ethinyl Estradiol (EE) in Healthy Women.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), single-center, pharmacokinetic interaction study. Healthy adult women who met the prestudy eligibility criteria were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. The randomization was balanced using permuted blocks. Healthy volunteers in Group 1 were to receive a single oral dose of 250 Âµg NGM/35 mcg EE (1 tablet) on Days 1 and 17, and 1 mg of folic acid on Days 4 through 18. Healthy volunteers in Group 2 were to receive a single, oral 1 mg dose of folic acid on Days 1 and 17, and 1 tablet on Days 2 through 17. Serial blood samples were to be collected from each healthy volunteer on Days 1 and 17 before dosing and at specified times for up to 72 hours after dosing for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Healthy volunteers were to be confined overnight at the study unit on Days -1 and 16 for an overnight fast of at least 8 hours before dosing on Days 1 and 17. Healthy volunteers were to remain confined at the study unit until the 24-hour blood samples were collected on Days 2 and 18. Safety was based on the incidence of adverse events, and on changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and physical and gynecological examination findings. The Sponsor prematurely terminated this study on 14 February 2005 because of errors made at the study site in healthy volunteer randomization, the timing of blood draws, and handling of laboratory samples. As a result of these errors, the pharmacokinetic samples collected were not analyzed, and a new study was initiated (NRGMON-CON-1006). Due to the premature termination of the study, no healthy volunteer received more than 9 days of therapy. Most healthy volunteers completed the screening and premature termination procedures. Oral contraceptives tablet (250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE); Folic acid tablet (1 mg). Group 1: Single OC tablet on Days 1 and 17, 1 folic acid tablet on Days 4 to 18. Group 2: Single folic acid tablet on Days 1 and 17, 1 OC tablet on Days 2 to 17. The study drugs were to be taken with 240 mL (8 oz) of water at approximately 8:00 a.m. Healthy volunteers were required to fast for a minimum of 8 hours before dosing on Days 1 and 17.</detailed_description>
