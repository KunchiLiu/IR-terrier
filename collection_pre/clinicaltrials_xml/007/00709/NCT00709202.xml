	<brief_summary>The study attempts to evaluate a histamine analog long used for the treatment of Meniere's disease , betahistine, that,.shows promise in reversing the antihistaminergic effects thought to be involved in antipsychotic induced weight gain. The investigators hypotheses therefore are as follows: - Youth who have gained a developmentally inappropriate amount of weight on SGAs will see their weight stabilize or even decrease with betahistine augmentation as compared to placebo augmentation. - Betahistine augmentation in SGA treated youth will increase levels of satiety in a standardized meal situation and decrease caloric intake.as compared to placebo augmentation. - Metabolic effects of betahistine augmentation in SGA treated youth will be reflected in a normalization of adipose distribution when compared to placebo augmentation, in particular with regards to the ratio of visceral to peripheral adipose tissue. - Betahistine augmentation in this population will lead to a normalization in physiologic and lab values related to the development of metabolic syndrome as compared to placebo augmentation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability Study of Betahistine to Ameliorate Antipsychotic Associated Weight Gain in Adolescents and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects for this study will be adolescents and young adults from age 12 to age 18. 40 individuals ages 12-39 who have been psychiatrically stabilized on Cloz39ine, Olanzapine, Risperdal, or Seroquel, and have gained more than 2% of their weight in their first 6 weeks on these medications will be recruited to participate. Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases which may be exacerbated by a histamine analog) or are prescribed medications known to affect body composition or metabolism other than those currently being studied. Subjects will be randomized to receive either betahistine or placebo at a 1:1 ratio.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children and adolescents ages 1218 with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Schizophreniform, Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Bipolar NOS or Psychotic Disorder NOS Patients will be currently treated with antipsychotics and will have a have a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (including schizoaffective disorder), bipolar disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. Patients will qualify for entry if they meet the following weight criteria: 1. The patient has gained 7% of their weight since beginning of treatment with one or more of the current antipsychotics. 2. The patient has had an increase of 7% of their weight during the last year while being treated with antipsychotics. 3. The patient has a BMI of 30 or more and has gained 10 lbs or more in the past 8 months while being treated with antipsychotic medications. 4. The patient has a BMI of 35 or greater at the current time, and his chart shows a history of consistent weight gain over the past 1 to 3 years during treatment with antipsychotics. Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases which may be exacerbated by a histamine analog), or history of pheochromocytoma or peptic ulcer disease. Patients will be excluded if they are prescribed medications known to affect body weight or glucoselipid metabolism, such as prescription or over the counter medications taken for the purpose of weight reduction. Subjects who are currently treated with metformin, for less than a year and have shown recent weight change on metformin. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy or lipidlowering agents whose dosage has changed by more than 50 % in the past month will be excluded. If they are relatively stable doses of these medications they will not be excluded. Patients who are on lipid lowering medication, thyroid replacement medication, or diabetes medication, (excluding metformin), must remain on these medications throughout the period of the study. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding will be excluded.</criteria>
