	<criteria>Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD (i.e., predominately classic, minimally classic or occult no classic) as documented by fluorescein angiogram. Previous or concomitant therapy with intravitreous corticosteroids. Any of the following underlying diseases including: Diabetic retinopathy History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV), history or clinical evidence of unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or revascularization within last 6 months, ventricular tachyarrythmias requiring ongoing treatment. History or evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, such as intermittent claudication or prior amputation. Clinically significant impaired renal (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or s/p renal transplant or receiving dialysis) or hepatic function. Patients with results outside these ranges may be enrolled in consultation with Ophthotech. Stroke (within 12 months of trial entry). Any major surgical procedure within one month of trial entry. Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the past 60 days for any condition. Women who are pregnant or nursing.
