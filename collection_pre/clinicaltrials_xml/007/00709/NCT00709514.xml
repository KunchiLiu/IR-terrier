	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy of DCB-WH1 ointment in wound closure as compared to vehicle control when applied topically to chronic diabetic foot ulcers for 12 weeks. The secondary objective of this study is to collect safety information of DCB-WH1 ointment. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled, multi-center study of DCB-WH1 ointment applied topically to grade 1 foot ulcers (according to Wagner grading system) in 50 subjects with diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
