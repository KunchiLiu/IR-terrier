	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PegIntron plus Rebetol combination in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C in a primary care setting. Patients received no antiviral therapy prior to the current study. Only patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 will be enrolled in the study. The study will also explore the influence of liver fibrosis stage on the chances of achieving a sustained virologic response.</brief_summary>
