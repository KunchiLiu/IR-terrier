	<brief_summary>Subjects enrolling into a nutrition study of the effects of tea on fat absorption will be randomized to receive either a standard informed consent document or a modified document that is shorter and more easily understood than the standard document. The hypothesis is that using a shorter form that is more easily understood and more visually simple will lead to greater subject satisfaction in the consent process and will not compromise subject comprehension of key study aspects. Consent for study inclusion has been waived by the IRB because informing subjects of the nature and process of the study would likely affect the findings, and both the standard and modified consent forms were approved for use in the nutrition study.</brief_summary>
