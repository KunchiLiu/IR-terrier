	<detailed_description>A prospective, single-blind, randomized, multicenter, two arm study. The objective of this study is to show similar (non-inferior) safety and effectiveness between CYPHER® ELITE™ and CYPHER® Bx VELOCITY® Sirolimus-Eluting Stent Systems in a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical study for the treatment of de novo native coronary lesions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with de novo atherosclerotic CAD in 1 or 2 vessels; The subject must be &gt;/= 18 years of age; Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment; Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by stable angina pectoris Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (Class I, II, III) OR nonST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C) OR nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction &gt;/= 48 hours from the time of study index procedure OR asymptomatic subjects with a positive stress test; Treatment of &lt;/= two lesions in one or two major coronary arteries (1 target lesion in each of 2 vessels or 2 target lesions in 1 vessel); Target vessel diameter must be &gt;/= 2.25mm and &lt;/= 4.0 in diameter (visual estimate); Target lesion stenosis is &gt; 50% and &lt; 100% (visual estimate); Target lesion length &lt;30mm (for each target lesion(s)) with a total implanted stent length &lt; 66mm. Additional stents can be used to treat dissections, etc,: however, these must be the same stent to which the subject has been randomized in the study. Subject or Legally Authorized Representative must provide written informed consent prior to the procedure using a form that is approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee. ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) within 30 days of the study index procedure; Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;/= 50% stenosis; Total coronary occlusion or TIMI grade 0 or 1 in the target vessel; Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion(s); Calcified target lesion(s) which cannot be, in the investigator's opinion, successfully predilated; Bifurcation disease involving a side branch &gt;/= 2 mm in diameter; Prior stent within 5 mm of target lesion(s); Ostial target lesion(s); Target lesion(s) within a coronary bypass graft (e.g., saphenous vein or arterial graft); Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;/= 25%; Impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 250 μmol/L or &gt; 2.5 mg/dl) at the time of treatment; Pretreatment with devices other than conventional balloon angioplasty; Significant angulation in the target vessel that, in the Investigator's opinion, may preclude stent delivery and deployment; Subject previously treated with brachytherapy; Recipient of heart transplant; Subject with a life expectancy less than 12 months; Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate and ticlopidine, heparin, stainless steel, contrast agent (that cannot be managed medically), or sirolimus that cannot be managed medically; Any significant medical condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with the subject's optimal participation in the study; Currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study endpoints; In the Investigator's opinion, the lesion is not suitable for stenting; Known bleeding or hypercoagulable disorder; Known or suspected active infection at the time of the study procedures; Subject is known to be pregnant, a prisoner, mentally incompetent, and/or alcohol or drug abuser; Subject has had major surgical or interventional procedures unrelated to this study within 30 days prior to this study or planned surgical or interventional procedures within 30 days of entry into this study.</criteria>
