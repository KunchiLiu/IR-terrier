	<brief_summary>Rationale: The effect of positional distribution of dietary fatty acids on markers of inflammation and blood lipids metabolites on diets containing fatty acids such as oleic acid that are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease is not widely studied. Hypothesis: There would be difference detected in the concentrations of markers of inflammation and blood lipid metabolites in human volunteers fed controlled diets. Study design: A randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial that involves 41 healthy volunteers. The volunteers will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will consume controlled diets for 5 weeks that provides 15% of energy from protein, 30% of energy from fat, and 55% of energy from carbohydrates. Volunteers will be assigned to each test diets which is cooked with novel olein, palm stearin or partially hydrogenated soybean oil in random order until all three diets has consumed by each person. Main study parameters: LDL-cholesterol</brief_summary>
