	<brief_summary>In this study, the concentration of antibody to the vaccine one year, three and five years after vaccination in subjects who were vaccinated with GSK Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 and Menactra® in a previous study (whose objectives &amp; outcome measures are presented in a separate protocol posting with NCT number =00454909) will be evaluated. The safety and immune response to a booster dose of vaccine GSK134612 administered at 5 years post-primary vaccination and a primary vaccination of a newly enrolled group with GSK 134612 vaccine will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Long-term Antibody Persistence of GSK Biologicals' Meningococcal Vaccine GSK134612 in Healthy Adolescents/Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK Biologicals has developed a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK134612). This candidate vaccine has been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in subjects as of 12 months of age. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody persistence at approximately 1 year, 3 years and 5 years post-administration of one dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 as compared to Menactra® (meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine, sanofi pasteur) when given to healthy adolescents/ adults 11 to 25 years of age In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of GSK134612 administered to all eligible subjects at 5 years after the primary vaccination will be evaluated. Another cohort of subjects (naïve control group) 15 to &lt;31 years of age will be offered a dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine at the same time to allow for evaluation of a primary (naïve control group) and booster dose within the same study. This Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol Amendment 1, May 2010 and Protocol Amendment 2, May 2011.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Persistence phase: A male or female who was between and including 10 and 25 years of age at the time of primary vaccination in the study with NCT number = 00454909. Written informed consent obtained from parents/guardian of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than 18 years of age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved the 18th birthday. Healthy subjects as established by medical history. Having completed the active phase of the vaccination study with NCT number = 00454909. Booster phase: Written informed consent obtained from parents/guardian of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than 18 years of age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved the 18th birthday. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and historydirected physical examination before entering into the study. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential, i.e., premenarche, have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, oophorectomy or be postmenopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination and continue adequate contraception for 2 months after vaccination. Additional inclusion criterion for the naïve control group: • A male or female between, and including, 15 and 30 years of age at the time of the vaccination. Persistence phase: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days of each persistence time point. Vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine of serogroup A, C, W135, and/or Y outside of study with NCT number = 00454909. History of any meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, B, C, W135, or Y. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding each persistence time point. Concurrently participating in another clinical study within 30 days of each persistence time point, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Bleeding disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anticoagulant therapy. Chronic alcohol or drug abuse. Subjects withdrew consent to be contacted for followup studies. Booster phase (to be checked at Year 5 for all subject, including naïve control group): Child in care Not enrolled in the Kaiser Healthcare system. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days preceding administration of the study vaccine, or planned use throughout the extended safety followup period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior administration of the booster dose. Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine of serogroup A, C, W135, and/or Y outside of study with NCT number = 00454909. History of any meningococcal disease. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition,including human immunodeficiency virus infection based on medical history and physical examination. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration through Day 30 after vaccination. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Bleeding disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anticoagulant therapy. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting 30 days before until 30 days after the day of administration of the dose of vaccine(s) with the exception of any licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Previous vaccination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids within the last month. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. History of allergic disease or any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, including latex. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Previous history of GuillainBarré syndrome Acute disease at the time of vaccination. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions within 2 months after vaccination. For groups A, B and C only: Subjects withdrew consent to be contacted for followup studies. Note: if the subject is female, prior to vaccination she must be of nonchildbearing potential, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination and continue adequate contraception for 2 months after vaccination.</criteria>
