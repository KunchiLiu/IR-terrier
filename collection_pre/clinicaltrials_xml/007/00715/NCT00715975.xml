The follow-up visits will occur in times of 07 and 14 days after the start of treatment. If there is complete improves the disease, treatment is interrupted before this date. On each visit will be examined by clinical parameters validated scales of assessment internationally (PASI), which provide the exact data of changes in the framework of each patient in each parameter measured. As parameters of the tolerability will be evaluated frequency and intensity of adverse events and the potential of irritative formulations, will be held photo of patients and questionnaires of cosmeticidade the formulation. Patients will be geared not to expose to the sun during the treatment period. At the end of the study, patients who present evolution will be full of injuries released the study and those who are still with obvious symptoms have treatment interrupted because of the risk of prolonged use of the drug under study.
