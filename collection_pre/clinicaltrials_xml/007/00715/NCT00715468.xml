	<brief_summary>Treatment with MMF often results in adverse GI events, which can lead to dose reductions of MMF and decreased graft function. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (MYFORTIC*) was developed as an alternative formulation of MPA to improve upper GI tract side effects. An improvement in the severity of GI side effects could result in an increased tolerance to MPA and an improvement in patient quality of life. This study will use the GSRS to evaluate improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms.</brief_summary>
