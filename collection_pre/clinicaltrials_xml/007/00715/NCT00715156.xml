	<brief_title>Role of Recombinants in Peach Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intend to verify whether the different levels of severity of the clinical allergic reactions to peach are associated to sensitization towards different allergenic molecules of peach. In particular, we will analyze the reactivity towards the peach allergens Pru p 1, Pru p 3 and Pru p 4 and towards the birch pollen allergens Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4. The patients (with allergic symptoms of any severity provoked by the consumption of peach) will be divided into two groups: the first group showing oral allergy syndrome (OAS), the second group showing systemic symptoms of different severity, up to anaphylaxis. All the patients will be submitted to: complete clinical investigation; skin prick test with a panel of common food/inhalant commercial extracts; skin tests by the "prick + prick" method with fresh fruits and vegetables; skin prick test with purified peach LTP (Pru p 3) The sera of the patients will be used for: immunoblotting with peach extract and immunoblotting inhibition with purified natural Pru p 3 and, if possible, recombinant Pru p 3, Pru p 1 and Pru p 4, using a pool of selected sera; CAP system with a predetermined panel of fruit and vegetable allergens; CAP system with recombinant allergens of peach and birch pollen: Pru p 3, Pru p 1 and Pru p 4 for peach, Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4 for birch pollen. Finally, a statistical analysis will be carried out in order to verify if the two groups of patients will show significant differences in the allergens recognized. The results of this study will be a property of the Unit of Allergology and Immunology as stated by DM 17/2004 and will be presented as written publication or oral presentation at National and/or International Congresses of Allergy and Immunology, quoting the PHADIA company</detailed_description>
