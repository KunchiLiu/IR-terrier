	<brief_summary>This prospective randomised study comparing administration of a hypo-osmolar oral hydration solution with the classical hydration via IV (intravenous) infusion in premature infants of more than 32 weeks GA (gestational age) aims to determine whether administration of a hypo-osmolar oral hydration solution is as efficient as intravenous infusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Versus Intravenous Rehydration for Prevention of Dehydration in Premature Babies, During the First Days of Life.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to prevent dehydration of the premature infant during the first days of life, enteral nutrition with milk must be complemented by an additional fluid supply, commonly administered intravenously. We propose to perform a prospective randomised multi-centric study comparing administration of a hypo-osmolar oral hydration solution with the classical hydration via IV (intravenous) infusion in premature infants of more than 30 weeks GA (gestational age). We define success as a weight loss inferior to 15 % of birth weight and a weight at day 15 superior to birth weight. Failure was defined hence as a weight loss superior to 15% of birth weight or a weight at day 15 inferior to birth weight or a severe complication or death. Major violations of the protocol in the study group will be counted as failures. The other objectives were to determine whether oral hydration demonstrates practical advantages: less complications in initial management, more comfort for the baby and less technical challenges for the nurses/doctors in charge. Furthermore to evaluate the clinical tolerance of oral hydration from a nutritional point of view and to examine it's effects on intestinal function (defecation, gastric residues), signs of intestinal inflammation and GI flora.</detailed_description>
