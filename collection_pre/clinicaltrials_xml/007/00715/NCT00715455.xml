	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible and safe to use the REG1 Anticoagulation System instead of unfractionated heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility and Safety Study Comparing REG1 Anticoagulation System With Unfractionated Heparin in Elective PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug, REG1, is the first specific, direct-acting, antidote-controlled anticoagulant ever described. Regado is developing REG1 for use in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome who undergo coronary revascularization procedures. These procedures, which include coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), put patients at high risk for therapy-related bleeding complications. REG1 is being developed initially to increase therapeutic flexibility and improve patient outcomes in coronary revascularization procedures. REG1 is a two-component system, consisting of an aptamer-based anticoagulant and its matched antidote. The REG1 anticoagulant component (RB006) is a single-stranded, nucleic acid aptamer. RB006 selectively and potently binds to and inhibits Factor IXa, a protein critical to blood coagulation. The antidote component, RB007, is a complementary nucleic acid that binds to and neutralizes RB006. The binding of RB007 to RB006 causes the predictable and rapid reversal of the RB006 effect and allows the patient's blood to return to normal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females scheduled for nonurgent elective PCI (who do not have certain cardiac parameters) and have not been treated with UHF prior to PCI. Subject able to give informed consent and comply with the protocol. Negative urine pregnancy test or documented surgical sterilization or menopausal. Subject weight &gt;120 kg. Recent acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac markers or ST segment depression at rest. Evidence of clinical instability Angiographic highrisk. A contraindication to anticoagulation or increased risk of bleeding. Use of prohibited medications or investigational drugs prior to the study. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings. Planned use of femoral sheath greater than a certain size. Known allergy or intolerance to drugs mandated by the study. Use of devices other than angioplasty balloons and coronary stents. A history of licit drug abuse or illicit drug use or current evidence of such abuse. Any other factor that the Investigator feels would put the subject at increased risk if participating in the protocol. Lactation. Currently enrolled in this or another clinical trial (with some exceptions). Participation in an investigational drug or device trial in the past 30 days.</criteria>
