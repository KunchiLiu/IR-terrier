	<brief_title>Polycythemia Vera, Myelofibrosis and Essential Thrombocythemia: Identification of PV, MF &amp; ET Genes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as the Philadelphia Chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), are not congenital, but acquired. The purpose of this project is to find genes whose mutations cause these disorders, as well as improve diagnostic measures for these diseases. When this is accomplished new therapies to control and eventually cure the disease can be designed. All subjects will be asked to donate 4-6 teaspoons of blood. On occasion, if the blood cells from a particular sample do not grow well and the DNA from that sample is used up or other tests are needed, we may ask to collect additional samples. In patients who have undergone a bone marrow biopsy as part of their clinical evaluation, we will test the reproducibility between pathologists for the revised 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria to diagnose myeloproliferative disorders (MPD).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with an elevated hemoglobin concentration (&gt;18 in males and &gt;16 in females) and who are suspected to have congenital or acquired primary polycythemia 2. Patients with a persistent thrombocytosis (&gt;400,000) that does not have an obvious secondary cause 3. Patients with a bone marrow biopsy that shows increased cellularity and fibrosis 4. Patients where there is clinical concern for primary myelofibrosis, such as anemia in combination with leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly and/or a leukoerythroblastic blood smear 5. Patients with thrombosis at unusual sites, such as BuddChiari syndrome, can have early PV before hemoglobin is elevated, these patients will also be included. 1. Subjects who have a known acquired cause of polycythemia (increased hemoglobin/hematocrit) such as people living in high altitudes (in excess of 14,000 feet), subjects with heart disease, left to right heart shunt, severe hypoxia or severe pulmonary disease will be excluded from this study. 2. Subjects with a known acquired cause of thrombocytosis. 3. Subjects will be excluded if they cannot demonstrate decision making capacity sufficient to agree or decline the blood drawing or use of their blood for the study.</criteria>
