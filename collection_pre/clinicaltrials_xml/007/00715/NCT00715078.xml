	<brief_title>To Evaluate Sipuleucel-T Manufactured With Different Concentrations of Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PA2024) Antigen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, single blind, Phase 2 study. Subjects will receive the investigational product, sipuleucel-T, manufactured with 1 of 3 different concentrations of PA2024 antigen. The purpose of this study is to compare the changes in CD54 upregulation between each of these 3 groups of subjects. The study will also evaluate the levels of immune response, the length of survival, the role of circulating tumor cell levels in the blood, and changes in quality of life in each of the 3 groups of subjects. All subjects will be blinded to their cohort assignment to ensure unbiased completion of the quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. All subjects will be followed for this study for the remainder of their lives.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For a subject to be eligible for participation in this study, all of the following criteria must be satisfied. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Metastatic disease. Progressive androgen independent prostate cancer. Serum PSA &gt;= 5.0 ng/mL. Castrate level of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) achieved via medical or surgical castration. Men &gt;= 18 years of age. Adequate hematologic, renal and liver function. In order to ensure the integrity of the study data is maintained, study participants must be able to complete all study visits. For this reason, study participation is limited to those who live in a permanent residence within a comfortable driving distance (roundtrip within one day) to the clinical research site. A subject will not be eligible for participation in this study if any of the following criteria apply. The presence of known lung, liver, or brain metastases, malignant pleural effusions, or malignant ascites. A requirement for treatment with opioid analgesics for any reason within 21 days prior to registration. Moderate to severe disease related pain. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt;= 2 . Use of nonsteroidal antiandrogens within 6 weeks of registration. Antiandrogen withdrawal response. Treatment with chemotherapy within 3 months of registration. More than 2 chemotherapy regimens prior to registration. Initiation or discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy within 28 days prior to registration. Treatment with any of the following medications or interventions within 28 days of registration: Systemic corticosteroids, External beam radiation therapy or surgery, Dietary and herbal supplements, as well as alternative treatments that have evidence of hormonal and/or anticancer properties (e.g., PCSPES or PCSPEC) and saw palmetto, Megestrol acetate (Megace(R)), diethylstilbesterol (DES), or cyproterone acetate, ++Ketoconazole, 5alphareductase inhibitors, High dose calcitriol [1,25(OH)2Vitamin D] (i.e., &gt; 0.5 mg/day). Any other systemic therapy for prostate cancer (except for medical castration). Treatment with any investigational vaccine within 2 years of registration or treatment with any other investigational product within 28 days of registration. Participation in any previous study involving sipuleucelT, regardless of whether the subject received sipuleucelT (APC8015) or placebo. Known pathologic longbone fractures, imminent pathologic longbone fracture (cortical erosion on radiography &gt; 50%) or spinal cord compression. A history of stage III or greater cancer, excluding prostate cancer. Basal or squamous cell skin cancers must have been adequately treated and the subject must be diseasefree at the time of registration. Subjects with a history of stage I or II cancer must have been adequately treated and been diseasefree for &gt;= 3 years at the time of registration. A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sipuleucelT or granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF). Any infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever (temp &gt; 100.5°F or &gt; 38.1°C) within 1 week prior to registration. Any medical intervention or other condition which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the Dendreon Medical Monitor, could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.</criteria>
