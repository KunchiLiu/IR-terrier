	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Induced Neuroplasticity in Post Stroke Patients Suffering Chronic Neurological Deficiencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: Evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on patients with chronic neurological deficiency due to stroke. Methods: A prospective, randomized, control-crossed over trial including patients who had stroke 6-36 months prior to their inclusion. All patients had at least one motor dysfunction. After their inclusion patients were randomized to treated or cross group. The neurologic functions were evaluated by NIHSS, ADL, life quality and brain SPECT. Patients in the treated group were evaluated twice-at baseline and after HBOT. Patients in the cross group were evaluated three times-baseline, after 2 months control period of no treatment and after a consequent 2 month of HBOT. The following HBOT protocol was practice: 40 daily sessions, 90 minutes each, 100% oxygen at 2ATA, 5 days/week,. Results: The study included 74 patients (8 were excluded). During the control period, in the cross group, NIHSS and the ADL had not changed, while in the treated group both significantly improved. After the cross-over, when the cross group received HBOT, NIHSS and ADL had significantly improved. Same trend of changes were in life quality. The SPECT correlated with the clinical improvement. The improvements were mostly in territories where there was a noticeable discrepancy between the CT and SPECT. Interpretation: In this study, for the first time, it was demonstrated that HBOT can induce neuroplasticity in patients with chronic neurologic deficiencies due to stroke. The beneficial effect of the HBOT is mostly in territories where there is a brain SPECT/CT mismatch.</detailed_description>
