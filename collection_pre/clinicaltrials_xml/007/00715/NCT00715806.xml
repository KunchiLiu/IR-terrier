	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine the ability of open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners to reduce claustrophobic reactions, thereby enabling more examinations of severely anxious patients. The investigators hypothesize that anxiety-based claustrophobia that prevents MR examinations without sedation can be reduced using an open MR scanner design thereby improving clinical management of those patients.</brief_summary>
