	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to basal insulin with or without metformin over a period of 24 weeks of treatment, followed by an extension. The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to basal insulin on glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction at Week 24. The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide when added to basal insulin on body weight, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) after standardized meal challenge test, percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than 7 percent (%), percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less than or equal to 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), change in 7-point self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles, change in basal insulin and total insulin doses; to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed for at least 1 year before screening visit, insufficiently controlled with basal insulin with or without metformin HbA1c less than (&lt;) 7 % or greater than (&gt;) 10% at screening At the time of screening age &lt; legal age of majority Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method Type 1 diabetes mellitus Treatment with basal insulin for less than 3 months prior to screening or insulin regimen changed during the last 3 months prior to screening Basal insulin dose at screening &lt;30 units/day and/or not at a stable dose (+/ 20 percent [%]) during the last 2 months If treatment with metformin, no stable dose of at least 1.5 gram/day (except for South Korea: at least 1.0 gram/day) for at least 3 months prior to screening visit FPG at screening &gt;250 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (&gt;13.9 millimole per liter [mmol/L]) History of hypoglycemia unawareness Body mass index less than or equal to (&lt;=) 20 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) Weight change of &gt;5 kg during the 3 months preceding the screening visit History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease History of metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis within 1 year prior to screening Hemoglobinopathy or hemolytic anemia, receipt of blood or plasma products within 3 months prior to the time of screening Within the last 6 months prior to screening, history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization Known history of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the time of screening Cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, endocrine disease, active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease or patients with short life expectancy making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult, history or presence of clinically significant diabetic retinopathy, history or presence of macular edema likely to require laser treatment within the study period Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled hypertension at the time of screening with a resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;180 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or &gt;95 mmHg, respectively Laboratory findings at the time of screening: aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase: &gt;2 times upper limit of the normal (ULN) laboratory range; amylase and/or lipase: &gt;3 times ULN; total bilirubin: &gt;1.5 times ULN (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome); hemoglobin &lt;11 gram/deciliter and/or neutrophils &lt;1500 per cubic millimeter (mm^3) and/or platelets &lt;100 000/mm^3; positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen and/or Hepatitis C antibody and positive serum pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, or vital signs at the time of screening that, in the judgment of the investigator or any subinvestigator, precludes safe completion of the study or constrains efficacy assessment Patients who are considered by the investigator or any subinvestigator as inappropriate for this study for any reason (for example, impossibility to meet specific protocol requirements, such as attending scheduled visits, being able to do selfinjections; likelihood of requiring treatment during the screening phase and treatment phase with drugs not permitted by the clinical study protocol; investigator or any subinvestigator, pharmacist, study coordinator, other study staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol) Use of other oral or injectable antidiabetic or hypoglycemic agents other than metformin or basal insulin (for example, sulfonylurea, alphaglucosidase inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, rimonabant, exenatide, dipeptidylpeptidase4 inhibitors, fastacting insulin for 1 week or more) within 3 months prior to the time of screening Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical application or inhaled forms) for 1 week or more within 3 months prior to the time of screening Any previous treatment with lixisenatide or participation in any previous study with lixisenatide Use of any investigational drug within 3 months prior to study Renal impairment defined with creatinine &gt;1.4 mg/dL in women and creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL in men (applicable only for patients with metformin treatment) Endstage renal disease as defined by a calculated serum creatinine clearance of &lt;15 milliliter/minute and/or patients on dialysis, if no treatment with metformin Clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease associated with prolonged nausea and vomiting, including, but not limited to gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disease requiring medical treatment, within the previous 6 months History of allergic reaction to any glucagon like peptide1 (GLP1) agonist in the past (for example, exenatide, liraglutide) or to metacresol Additional exclusion criteria at the end of the runin phase: informed consent withdrawal; lack of compliance during the singleblind placebo runin phase (&gt;2 injections missed); and patient with any adverse event which precludes the inclusion in the study, as assessed by the investigator</criteria>
