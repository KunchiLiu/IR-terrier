	<detailed_description>This is a phase I blinded randomized study of the safety and tolerability of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 given daily for a period of five consecutive days. Upon enrollment subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a ratio of treatment to placebo of 2:1. Subjects will be randomized to receive either: A. Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr): 108 (100 million) organisms of Lactobacillus reuteri per dose, given once daily for a five-day treatment period that corresponds to a dose of the closely related L. reuteri ATCC 55730 strain that has shown to be therapeutic for infantile colic. The strain used in this study (DSM 17938) has been cured of an antibiotic resistance plasmid found in the original BioGaia strain (L. reuteri ATCC 55730). B. Placebo oil preparation, administered as 5 drops of the oil vehicle used in manufacturing the Lr suspension, given once daily for a five-day study period (BioGaia AB, Stockholm, Sweden).</detailed_description>
