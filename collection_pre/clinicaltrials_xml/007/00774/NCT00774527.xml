	<brief_summary>Randomized comparison of cyclophosphamide versus reduced-dose cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine in addition to anti-thymocyte globulin for the conditioning therapy in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for bone marrow failure syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Cy-Atg Vs Cy-Flu-Atg for the Conditioning Therapy in Allo-HCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, non-blind study. Conditioning therapy will start on day -5 in patients who are randomized to receive Cy+ATG. Hydration with 0.45% NaCl at 6 liters/24 hours will be started on day -5. Cy 50 mg/kg in D5W 200 ml i.v. over 1-2 hours on days -5 to -2 by pump through a central venous catheter. Mesna 12 mg/kg iv push immediately before Cy and 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after Cy. Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 0.5 mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 2 mg/mL) iv daily at 8 am on days -4 to -2. Premedication for ATG (ALG) will include methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg iv infusion, Tylenol 600 mg po, and Avil 45.5 mg iv push. The doses of cyclophosphamide and ATG (ALG) will be calculated using actual body weight. Conditioning therapy will start on day -6 in patients who are randomized to receive Cy+fludarabine (FludaraÂ®, Berlex Laboratories, Richmond, CA)+ATG. Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes in D5W 100 ml for 5 consecutive days (days -6 to -2). Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 0.5 mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 2 mg/mL) iv daily at 8 am on days -4 to -2. Premedication for ATG (ALG) will include methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg iv infusion, Tylenol 600 mg po, and Avil 45.5 mg iv push. Hydration with 0.45% NaCl at 6 liters/24 hours will be started on day -3. Cy 50 mg/kg in D5W 200 ml i.v. over 1-2 hours on days -3 to -2 by pump through a central venous catheter. Mesna 12 mg/kg iv push immediately before Cy and 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after Cy. The doses of cyclophosphamide and ATG (ALG) will be calculated using actual body weight.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with bone marrow failure syndrome. Written informed consent must be obtained from the patients and donors. Patients should have an HLAidentical or onelocus mismatched sibling, family or unrelated donor who is 60 years or less. Patients should be 15 years of age or older, but younger than 60 years. The performance status of the patients should be 70 or over by Karnofsky performance scale (see Appendix I). Patients should not have major illness or organ failure. Patients must have adequate hepatic function (bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than three times the upper normal limit). Patients must have adequate renal function (creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl). Patients must have adequate cardiac function (ejection fraction &gt; 45% on MUGA scan). Patients must not have a psychiatric disorder or mental deficiency severe as to make compliance with the treatment unlikely, and making informed consent impossible. Patients must not be in pregnancy. Patients should have major illness or organ failure</criteria>
