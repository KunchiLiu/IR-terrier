	<brief_summary>This is a prospective single centre Study designed to assess by OCT the effect of NUMEN cobalt-chromium balloon-expandable stent in inducing neointimal hyperplasia in de novo native coronary lesions of patients with Stable Angina Pectoris or ACS (except STEMI). A total of 60 consecutive patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions &gt;10mm and &lt;24mm in length and &gt;2.50mm to &lt;3.50mm in diameter by QCA estimate who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled and undergone stent implantation. After stent deployment an OCT imaging will be performed within the treated segment. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post-procedure, with all patients having repeat angiography and OCT at 6 months. It is anticipated that the total length of the study will be 18 months: 6 months to complete patient enrolment and 12 months for follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Numen Stent Assessment Using OCT Technique in a Single Center Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The main objective of this study is to assess the long term influence of NUMEN cobalt-chromium balloon-expandable coronary stent on neointimal hyperplasia in de novo native coronary lesions of patients with Stable Angina Pectoris or Acute Coronary Syndrom (ACS) - except STEMI. ENDPOINTS The primary endpoint is the assessment of the development of neointimal hyperplasia by OCT in the stented segment at 6-month follow-up. Breakdown of secondary endpoints: Degree of endothelialization of the stent internal wall by OCT at 6 months after stent implantation; Composite of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) defined as cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (Q wave and non-Q wave), emergent bypass surgery, stent thrombosis, or repeat target lesion revascularization at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post-procedure. Angiographic binary restenosis (&gt;50% diameter stenosis) 6 months post-procedure. Target vessel failure at 6 months post-procedure. Device success defined as achievement of a final residual diameter stenosis of &lt;30% (by Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA)), using the assigned device only. If QCA is not available, the visual estimate of diameter stenosis is used. Lesion success defined as the attainment of &lt;30% residual stenosis (by QCA) using any percutaneous method. Procedure success defined as achievement of a final diameter stenosis of &lt;30% (by QCA) using any percutaneous method, without the occurrence of death, MI, or repeat revascularization of the target lesion during the hospital stay. Acute (24 hrs post procedure), subacute (up to 30days post procedure) and late (&gt;30days post procedure) thrombosis.
