	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate left ventricular patterns of remodeling and hypertrophy in patients with aortic stenosis, and compare two-dimensional echocardiography measurements (wall thickness) with three-dimensional echocardiography data(left ventricular mass). Along with a second objective to assess Doppler diastolic filling indices associated with the various patterns of left ventricular remodeling. Previous studies(see reference list) were primarily derived from two-dimensional echo data set(based on wall thickness). Various patterns of left ventricular remodeling have been described in response to increased pressure overload. Three-dimensional echocardiography is a relatively new technique that is being increasingly used in the Echocardiography Lab in selected patients. This technique holds promise of being more accurate for volume-related measurements than the standard 2-dimensional echocardiography techniques.</detailed_description>
