	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare two different treatments for fit patients with head and neck cancer: All patients are given induction-chemotherapy (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU). Subsequently patients are being randomised into two groups: - The first group receives neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ('high' dose cisplatin) and conventional radiotherapy - The second group receives neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ('low' dose cisplatin) and accelerated radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TPF Induction With Concomitant Chemoradiation to Treat Patients With Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction Chemotherapy TPF(arm A and B) : Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 iv on day 1, Cisplatin 75 mg/ m2 iv on day 1, 5-FU 750 mg/ m2/day iv continuous infusion (in Hickman or port a cath) on days 1-5; prophylactic G-CSF This cycle will be repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 4 cycles. Clinical evaluation after each cycle and radiological evaluation after 2 cycles will take place. In case of PD or SD (after 2 cycles) with no minor response (no decrease in measurable disease from baseline) concomitant chemoradiotherapy will started per protocol. Surgery The investigators in each centre can decide neck surgery for residual tumor</detailed_description>
