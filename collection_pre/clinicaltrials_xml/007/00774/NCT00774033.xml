	<detailed_description>Comparing the impact in terms of cicatrisation duration and costs between 2 treatments of deep 2nd and 3rd degree burns. Determine if the costs of the innovating treatment RECELL®, a priori more expensive, are counterbalanced by a shorter cicatrisation duration and an improved evolution versus a conventional strategy. Give an information about efficiency improvement of RECELL® with additional costs</detailed_description>
