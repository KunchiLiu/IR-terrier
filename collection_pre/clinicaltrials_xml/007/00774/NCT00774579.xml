	<brief_summary>We will examine a cohort of growth hormone deficient adults starting growth hormone (GH) replacement. The purpose of this study is to determine whether GH replacement reduces the fat content of the liver. To compare the results we will include growth hormone deficient patients who do not start GH replacement as controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Growth Hormone Replacement on Liver Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adults with untreated growth hormone deficiency (GHD), a condition mostly due to pituitary disease, often show metabolic features similar to those described in the 'metabolic syndrome'. Growth hormone (GH) replacement has been shown to reverse many of these unfavorable changes, with a particular evident reduction of visceral fat. In recent years, a strong correlation between fat accumulation in the liver and features of the metabolic syndrome (particularly visceral fat) has been identified, and 'fatty liver' is now being referred as the hepatic feature of the 'metabolic syndrome'. The effect of GH replacement on liver fat, however, has never been systematically studied. We will assess 15 patients with GHD before and 6 months after starting GH replacement. We will also assess 15 control patients with GHD but who don't go on GH replacement for various reasons. Liver fat will be assessed using MR spectroscopy. Changes in liver fat will be correlated to changes in insulin sensitivity and changes in various inflammatory markers.</detailed_description>
