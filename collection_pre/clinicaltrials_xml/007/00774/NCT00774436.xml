	<criteria>A twostep consenting process will be in place for all patients being enrolled to this study. The twostep method is necessary because all patients being enrolled will need to have a repeat transrectal biopsy after meeting the initial study requirements. The two step consent process would enroll patients considering focal cryotherapy into the initial part of the study (QOL assessment at baseline, PCA3 test, and repeat biopsy); those deemed eligible after the restaging biopsy would be consented to participate in the remainder of the study (focal cryotherapy, QOL studies, repeat biopsy at 6 months for efficacy, PCA3 test). First Step Enrollment Men â‰¥ 21 years of age with a life expectancy estimated to be &gt; 10years. Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate and confirmed by MSKCC review No prior treatment for prostate cancer ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Prostate cancer clinical stage T1cT2a PSA &lt; 10ng/mL (this will be the PSA level prompting the prostate biopsy) Prostate Size &lt;60 cc on transrectal ultrasound Medically unfit for anesthesia Histology other than adenocarcinoma Men who have received any hormonal manipulation (antiandrogens; LHRH agonists) within the previous 6 months Men who are currently receiving anticoagulant drugs (e.g.: Coumadin, warfarin) Second Step Enrollment Repeat transrectal prostate biopsy that must meet the following parameters: Minimum of 12 biopsy cores No Biopsy Gleason grade 4 or 5 Unilateral cancer (only rightsided or leftsided, not bilateral) No more than 50% cancer in any one biopsy core No more than 25% of cores containing cancer Medically unfit for anesthesia Histology other than adenocarcinoma Men who have received any hormonal manipulation (antiandrogens; LHRH agonists) within the previous 6 months Men who are currently receiving anticoagulant drugs (e.g.: coumadin, warfarin)</criteria>
