	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Clarithromycin 500 mg Tablets Under Non-Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioavailability study on clarithromycin formulations comparing clarithromycin 500mg tablets of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Biaxin® tablets 500mg (containing clarithromycin 500 mg)in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed conditions Subjects were given a standardized meal starting 30 minutes before their assigned dosing time consisting of one buttered English muffin, one fried egg, one slice of American cheese, one slice of Canadian bacon, 2.45 ounces of hash brown potatoes, six fluid ounces of orange juice, and eight fluid ounces of whole milk. A single oral dose of clarithromycin 500mg was administered during each period under supervision of a trained Medical Officer. During the course of study, the safety parameters including vital signs, physical examination, medical history, clinical laboratory and safety tests (haematology, biochemical parameters) were assessed and, clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology &amp; biochemical parameters) were performed again at the end of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Source of Subjects: Noninstitutionalized subjects consisting of members of the community at large. 2. Characterization of Study Group All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age. Female subjects must be unable to become pregnant (postmenopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile). Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of initiation of the study. Such examinati°n includes, but is not limited to, blood pressure, general observations, and history. Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the prestudy screening process. At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements. Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements. Drags of Abuse Screen: prestudy and at checkin each study period subjects will be selected if all above are normal. Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of the study and filed with each Subject's case report forms. 1. Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption (during past 2 years), drug addiction, or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma(during past 5 years), diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for this study. 2. Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical investigator deems the result to not be significant. 3. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to theclass of drag being tested (including any penicillin product) should be excluded from the study. 4. All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures at checkin each study period. Subjects found to have urine concentrations of tested will not be allowed to participate. 5. Subjects should not have donated blood or plasma for at least (30) days prior to first dosing of the study. g. Female subjects who are pregnant or who are able (women child bearing potential) to become pregnant during the study not be allowed to participate. h. All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy at check in each study period. Subjects with positive pr inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study</criteria>
