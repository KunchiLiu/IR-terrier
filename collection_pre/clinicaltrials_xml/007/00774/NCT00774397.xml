	<brief_summary>The objective was to investigate the antiviral effect, safety, and pharmacokinetics of BI 201335 (Faldaprevir), given as a soft gelatine capsule, in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. Combination therapy of BI 201335 (Faldaprevir) with pegylated interferon α-2a (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV), with or without a 3-day lead-in, was assessed in treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment experienced (TE) patients.</brief_summary>
