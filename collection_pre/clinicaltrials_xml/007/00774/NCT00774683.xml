	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research sub-study is to learn about the levels of an antiretroviral (ARV) medication called Raltegravir, and response to HIV virus in the genital tract of HIV-positive women. We would like to see how this study medication is tolerated, and how the body processes the study medication in women who are HIV-positive. More specifically, we are interested in how Isentress® might penetrate into the female cervicovaginal secretions thereby potentially reducing the amount of HIV in those secretions. A reduction in the amount of HIV in genital secretions may prevent female subjects from transmitting HIV to their sexual partners. This information will help the research team know how a medication such as Isentress® might be used to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Characterize the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in the Cervicovaginal Fluids of HIV-infected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: This study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in cervicovaginal fluids of HIV-infected women, and compare this to the blood plasma pharmacokinetics being obtained in the main study, CID 0706. Participants: Six HIV-positive women from the CID 0706 study Procedures: During the pharmacokinetic visit to obtain blood plasma in the CID 0706 study, women will be asked to self-collect cervicovaginal samples using a vaginal aspirator at the following timepoints: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after raltegravir 400mg dose administration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load Selfdescribed as AfricanAmerican Less than 7 days cumulative of prior HIV therapy Plasma HIV RNA PCR equal to or greater than 1000 copies/mL within 90 days prior to study entry Able to provide informed consent In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study medication and procedures ALT (SGPT) &lt; or equal to 3.0 x ULN within 45 days prior to study entry GRF &gt; 60 as calculated by MDRD within 45 days prior to study entry All women of reproductive potential (who have not reached menopause or undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum or urine βHCG pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before entry. All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) and, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study volunteer/male partner must use at least one reliable method of contraception (e.g., condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an IUD; or hormonalbased contraception), simultaneously while receiving the protocolspecified medication(s) and for 6 weeks after stopping the medication(s). Pregnancy Breastfeeding Prior receipt of Raltegravir Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator is likely to interfere with followup or ability to take the study medication appropriately A positive test for bacterial vaginosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HSV2 (active lesions), or trichomonas at entry or week 2 of the main study, CID 0706</criteria>
