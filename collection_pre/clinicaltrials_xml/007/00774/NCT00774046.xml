	<criteria>Patients must have received cytotoxic chemotherapy,radiation,or a drug known to affect the properties of DNA or cell growth for some condition other than acute myeloid leukemia prior to diagnosis. Patients must have tMDS/tAML To be eligible for allogeneic transplantation, patients must have a suitable donor who is HLA compatible. Patients must be over the age of 10. Patients must be reviewed and discussed at the Leukemia and Transplant Conferences of the Section of Hematology/Oncology. Patients must not have any other serious medical condition(e.g.uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or infection) Psychiatric condition which would prevent compliance or possibly be worsened by treatment</criteria>
