	<brief_summary>This trial is titled "A Phase 1b/2 trial of AMG 479 or AMG 102 with Platinum-Based Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Extensive Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)." Part 1, the phase 1b portion of this study, is a multicenter, open-label investigation to identify safe dose levels of either AMG 102 or AMG 479 in combination with etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin in subjects with previously untreated extensive stage SCLC. Part 2, the phase 2 portion of this study, is a multicenter, double-blind, 3-arm investigation to evaluate overall survival of either AMG 102 or AMG 479 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
