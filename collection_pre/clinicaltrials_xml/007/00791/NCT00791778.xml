	<criteria>Histologically confirmed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (67) III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer at presentation. Patients must have achieved a clinical complete response (disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor) after only one regimen (46 cycles) of platinum and taxanebased standard chemotherapy received after tumor debulkment. Normal serum CA125 (cancerassociated tumor marker) level within 7 days of first dose of sorafenib. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. All scans used to document complete response must be done within 30 days prior to randomization. Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication. Patients with any residual cancer tissue after the completion of chemotherapy detectable by standard Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Prior local radiotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer other than epithelial (i.e. sarcoma, lymphoma, germ cell). Major surgery, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 30 days prior to randomization.</criteria>
