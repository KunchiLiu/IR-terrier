	<brief_title>Evaluation of Surgical Stress Index (SSI) During Sevoflurane/Remifentanil Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General anesthesia can be considered as a combination of hypnosis, antinociception and immobility. Whereas monitoring of depth of hypnosis, and muscle relaxation can be regarded as accepted, determination of the nociception is based on clinical signs like somatic or autonomic responses. Recently, the multivariate surgical stress index (SSI)has been demonstrated to correlate with surgical stress intensity. Thus, SSI might be a useful variable to adjust analgesic drug administration in individual patients. We want to investigate whether SSI is able to indicate nociception following standardized noxious stimulation during balanced sevoflurane - remifentanil anesthesia.</detailed_description>
