	<brief_summary>The objective of this pilot study is to estimate a procedure where the biological samples routinely obtained at the site of suspected infection could be guided by the early realization of a TEP with FDG coupled to scanner X, in patients hospitalized in ICU for severe sepsis of unspecified etiology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of MorphoTEP With the FDG Among Patients in Severe Sepsis of Unspecified Etiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis constitutes the leading cause of mortality in ICU, in particular because a microbial documentation is lacking in about half of the cases. Tomography by emission of positons, which uses the property of activated macrophages and leucocytes to collect 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose may prove useful to identify the site(s) of infection and then guide sampling. Thirty patients will be included over 12 months. Within 24 hours after admission, patients presented with a severe sepsis of still unknown etiology will benefit from the realization of a morphoTEP, including an examination MtOe with the FDG, associated with a conventional scanner X. Suspected infected sites will then be the subject of sampling when possible. These samples will be send for microbial culture, histology and TREM-1 expression (membrane-bound and soluble form) when appropriate. The main judgement criteria will be the percentage of the MtOe exams proved to be useful for diagnosis and/or associated with therapeutic modifications. This pilot study will make it possible to evaluate the interest of the early realization of a TEP/scanner X examination among severe sepsis patients of unknown origin.</detailed_description>
