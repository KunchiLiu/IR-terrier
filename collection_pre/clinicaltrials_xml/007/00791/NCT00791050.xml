	<brief_summary>Although data on cardioprotective effects (as profile of troponin I)of perioperative maintenance of normothermia during CABGs are already known, little is known about the effects of maintaining normothermia on clinical outcomes of patients submitted to coronary surgery. Being acute renal failure (ARF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) the two most frequent complications of this surgery, this study compare as primary end point the rate of postoperative ARF and AF in two group of patients, one actively warmed with Thermowrap and the control group receiving standard institutional care.</brief_summary>
