	<brief_summary>This study will involve established clinic patients. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine will be administered during patients' regular clinic visits. Patients will then be referred to the Consumer Health Education Center (CHEC)by healthcare providers who will fill out a referral form. The form will be given the the CHEC health educator who will assist patients in finding literacy-appropriate health information. BMI and Hgb A1c values will be compared after 3 months and 6 months to baseline values. It is hypothesized that objective assessment of patient use of literacy-appropriate, health information from the Clarksdale Diabetes and Metabolism Clinic CHEC will improve Hgb A1c and BMI values among patients.</brief_summary>
