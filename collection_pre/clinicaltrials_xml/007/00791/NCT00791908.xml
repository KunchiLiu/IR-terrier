	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether laser treatments over 6 weeks using the pulsed dye laser system or the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser are effective in patients with cherry angiomas as observed by a physician provider and the subject. The investigators hypothesize that the two laser treatments will be an effective tool for treating cherry angiomas. The investigators aim to compare these modalities to electrodessication, as all three modalities are considered the current standard of care. Electrodessication can result in atrophic lesions at the site of the treated cherry angiomas. In summary, the goal of this project is to compare the non-ablative pulsed dye laser and the AuraTM potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser to each other and to the current standard of care, electrodessication.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 to 95 years. Have at least 12 cherry angiomas (4 per each third of the torso) that have been documented. The subjects are in medically stable condition. The subject has willingness and the ability to understand and provide informed consent for the procedure and is able to communicate with the investigator. Must be willing not to employ other treatment options for cherry angiomas during the course of this study. Under 18 years of age and over 95 years of age Pregnancy or lactation. Subjects who are unable to understand the protocol or to give informed consent. Subjects cannot have had previous laser treatment in the last 6 months before enrollment. Subjects have a cardiac defibrillator or pacemakers that may interact with the electrodesiccation technique. Subjects have no serious medical conditions that would contradict participation in the research.</criteria>
