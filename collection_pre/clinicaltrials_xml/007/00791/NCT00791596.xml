	<detailed_description>A non-randomized, crossover trial design was used with follow-up repeated 6, 12, and 30 months from baseline in the first intervention period and then beginning at 6 months following the crossover. The administrative offices in the two main buildings of the town hall of Forl√¨, Italy. The study population was composed of 400 employees, who used VDTs for at least 20 hours a week, of whom we randomly selected 100 participants from each building. Of the 200 initial participants, 153 completed the study; the dropouts were due to illness/injury or maternity. Participants were assigned to intervention or control during the first period and then crossed over after a 30-month washout. The intervention used in this investigation was an ergonomic adjustment of the VDT workstation design. Our study showed that the workstation ergonomic adjustment improved work-related posture and in reducing LBP in VDT operators among subjects who received the intervention both in the first period and in the crossover, and maintained these positive effects for at least 30 months.</detailed_description>
