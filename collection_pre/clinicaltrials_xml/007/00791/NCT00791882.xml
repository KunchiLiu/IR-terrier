	<brief_title>Social Skills Training in Refractory Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In schizophrenia positive symptoms can be improved with an antipsychotic treatment. However there is a subgroup of patients who have a predominance of persistent negative symptoms that do not respond to antipsychotic treatment, such as blunted affect , emotional and social withdrawal, and there is evidence that such symptoms can improve with psychosocial interventions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Social Skills Training on negative symptoms in patients with refractory schizophrenia by means of a randomized, single-blind controlled trial with the duration of a year, including, follow up. This study will be conducted in two groups: one group will receive social skills training (N=46) and a control group (N=46) will attend the same number of sessions, but without intervention of the therapists (befriending). Psychiatric, psychological and neuropsychological aspects will be evaluated at baseline, after 20 weeks and 6 months after the end of the intervention. The scales that will be used for the psychiatric assessments are: PANSS (reduction of 20% in the negative subscale), CGI, CALGARY, SDS, and PSP, As well as the Social Skills Inventory IHS. The neuropsychological assessment will have groups of scales to measure: Attention, Memory, Executive Functions, Estimated Intellectual Efficiency and a ToM. For statistical , the repeated measure ANOVA will be used, as well as the effect size and number needed to treat.</detailed_description>
