	<brief_summary>Premature infants are highly susceptible to oxidative stress because of the immaturity of their antioxidant defense system. The use of prenatal glucocorticosteroids administered to the mother improves respiratory function and overall outcome. The investigators hypothesize that prenatal glucocorticosteroids favor the expression and competence of the antioxidant defense system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prenatal Corticosteroids and Antioxidants in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study recruiting extremely low gestational age neonates (&lt;28 weeks gestation) whose mothers received or not full scheduled prenatal glucocorticosteroids. Healthy term newly born infants acted as controls. At birth cord blood were drawn for the following analytical determinations: reduced and oxidized glutathione; malondialdehyde; superoxide dismutase; catalase; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; glutathione s-transferase. In addition, first urine voided was collected for ortho-tyrosine/phenylalanine and 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-deoxyguanosine/2-deoxyguanosine determination. Analytical data and clinical outcomes are compared.</detailed_description>
