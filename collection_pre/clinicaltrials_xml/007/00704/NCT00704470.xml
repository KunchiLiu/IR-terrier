	<brief_summary>In Intensive Care Medicine, critical incidents are not rare and may result in fatal outcome. High fidelity patient simulators are commonly used in training curricula for healthcare professionals especially in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and intensive care medicine. Several different course concepts have previously been published. As we know from recently published data, up to 80% of all critical incidents in the field of medicine are caused by human error. The authors of the present study aimed to investigate the effects of two different course concepts (one addressing technical skills in intensive care medicine and on addressing non-technical skills) on stress and performance. Stress and performance are measured in a pre-intervention and a post-intervention testing scenario.</brief_summary>
