	<brief_summary>The 12-month study will investigate a cognitive training augmentation of supported employment to improve cognitive performance and work outcomes, which are expected to result in improved quality of life and community integration for veterans with mild to moderate traumatic brain injuries. The primary hypothesis is that compared to veterans who receive enhanced supported employment, those who receive supported employment plus cognitive training will work more weeks during the 12 months.</brief_summary>
