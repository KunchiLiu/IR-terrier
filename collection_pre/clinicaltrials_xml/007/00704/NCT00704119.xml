	<brief_summary>RhuDex® (code number AV1142742) is a novel, orally bioavailable, low molecular weight modulator of co-stimulation of T lymphocytes. RhuDex® binds to the protein CD80 (also known as B7-1) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and inhibits its interaction with CD28 (but not with CTLA-4) presented by CD4+ T lymphocytes. RhuDex® is being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. To improve oral bioavailability, the study drug has to be co-administered with an alkaline buffer that increases gastric pH values. In previous in vitro and phase I studies, meglumine has been identified as the most effective buffer. Study CT 5002 is designed to evaluate the bioavailability of four increasing doses of RhuDex®, combined with a fixed amount of meglumine using a tablet formulation, under fed and fasted conditions as well as with co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. Furthermore, dose/plasma concentration proportionality for single dosing and accumulation effects for repeat dosing of RhuDex® will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Pharmacokinetic Profile of RhuDex® in a Tablet Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, non-randomized, monocentric Phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of single-dosed and repeat-dosed RhuDex® using a tablet formulation as well as to assess the effect of food and the effect with co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor on the bioavailability of RhuDex®. 12 healthy male subjects will receive study medication in 8 different treatment periods in 4 subsequent steps A, B, C and D. Within steps A and B, the subjects will receive different treatments (4 in A and 2 in B), sequentially. There will be a wash-out period of at least 4 days between each of the 8 different treatments/treatment periods of steps A, B, C and D. In Step A, each subject will receive increasing doses of RhuDex® in 4 subsequent treatments. In Step B, each subject will receive 2 different doses of RhuDex® preceded by pantoprazole intake, in 2 subsequent treatments, and in Step C the RhuDex® dosing will be preceded by a standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal. In Step D, RhuDex® will be administered twice daily for 7 days. For assessing the pharmacokinetic profile of RhuDex® in steps A, B and C, blood samples will be collected prior to and at different intervals after RhuDex® administration. In step D, blood samples will be collected on Days 1, 2, 4 and 7. Cmin, Cmax, tmax, t½ term, CL/F, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞) of RhuDex® will be analyzed. Safety will be evaluated by regular observation and documentation of AEs, vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory parameters.</detailed_description>
