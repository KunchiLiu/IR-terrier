	<brief_summary>Subjects will receive their first dose of darapladib in the clinical research unit (CRU), and the remaining 9 days of dosing will occur at home. Subjects will record any adverse events throughout the dosing period in a paper diary. Subjects will return to the CRU 10-14 days after the last dose of darapladib for a follow-up visit. The total study duration for each subject including the screening, treatment and follow-up periods will be approximately 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
