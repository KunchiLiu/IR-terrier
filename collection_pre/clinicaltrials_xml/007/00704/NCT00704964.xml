	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the impact of participant care and support on treatment adherence. PegIntron pen and Rebetol will be administered to participants with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in accordance with approved labeling. Sites will be categorized as providing high vs low level of participant management based on information about the level of participant support and management captured on the site questionnaire. Data on each participant will be collected by a physician on an electronic participant case report form (CRF) and by the participant via a questionnaire. Treatment completion rates will be analyzed based on the high vs low level of participant management. The hypothesis is that Physicians investing more time and effort into participant management achieve higher treatment completion rates among their hepatitis C patients than physicians offering less participant management measures.</brief_summary>
