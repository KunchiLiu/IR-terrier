	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 4 regimens of Vaniprevir + Peg-IFN and Ribavirin as compared to Placebo (PBO) + Peg-IFN/RBV. The primary hypotheses are that Vaniprevir is well tolerated, and that Vaniprevir 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) is superior to the control regimen for the percentage of non-cirrhotic (NC) participants achieving undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) 24 weeks after the end of study therapy (SVR24).</brief_summary>
