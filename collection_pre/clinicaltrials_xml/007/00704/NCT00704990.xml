	<brief_summary>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobehavioural disorder often diagnosed in childhood years. Complementary/alternative treatments including natural health products (NHPs) are used by children with ADHD despite limited information on their safety or usefulness. Some evidence suggests children with ADHD have a greater need for zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. This study will supplement a small number of children diagnosed with ADHD with therapeutic levels of these nutrients over 10 weeks to get a better understanding of the safety and possible benefit of using these nutrients to treat symptoms associated with ADHD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Natural Health Product in Children With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The is an open-label study. Children diagnosed with ADHD will be provided with a weight-based dose of a chewable natural health product containing zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C for 10 weeks with an additional follow-up post intervention at 20 weeks. Severity of ADHD symptoms will be measured at baseline, week 5 and week 10 using the Connor-3 Parent and SNAP-IV validated questionnaires. Nutritional status will be monitored at baseline and week 10 for changes in serum zinc and erythrocyte magnesium. Children will be monitored for any adverse reactions that may occur using the investigational product.Following the informed consent process, participants will undergo a structured psychiatric interview prior to enrollment and will have 4 30 minute study visits and 2 10 minute telephone calls throughout the study. Blood samples will be taken 2 times with the use of a topical anesthetic to decrease sensation during the blood draw. Once enrolled, children can withdraw from the study at any time if assent to participate is withdrawn.</detailed_description>

Diagnosis of additional mental health disorder using the Kiddie Sads. Diagnosis of cancer.
