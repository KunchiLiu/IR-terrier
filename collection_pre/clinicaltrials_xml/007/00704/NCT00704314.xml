	<brief_summary>We aimed to address the issue whether statins affect insulin resistance. To this end, we combined the available state-of-the art technology for detailed assessment of both whole-body and tissue specific insulin sensitivity in vivo in humans (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, stable isotope [6,6-2H2]glucose dilution technique, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - 1H MRS - of liver and skeletal muscle). Outcome measures were determined before and after 8 weeks therapy with 80 mg Simvastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
