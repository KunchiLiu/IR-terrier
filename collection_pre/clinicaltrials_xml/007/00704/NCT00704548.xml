	<brief_summary>Few trials have investigated the hypotensive effect of the Statins. Most were not specifically aimed at this pleiotropic effect or had methodological problems. The possible hypotensive effect may explain part of the favorable results of the Statins use on cardiovascular prevention independently from its action on the cholesterol profile. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Simvastatin on the blood pressure</brief_summary>
