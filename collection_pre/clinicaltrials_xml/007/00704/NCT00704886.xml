	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) is the process in which patients plan for future medical care under circumstances of impaired decision-making. Video is an underutilized medium that can assist clinicians in discussions of future health states, such as the state of advanced dementia. Video may enable patients to visualize the future by concisely providing complex information vital for ACP. This study will examine whether the use of video could facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of advanced dementia and inform clinician-patient discussions about the level of care a patient would want in the event of advanced dementia. RESEARCH PLAN: We propose to conduct a randomized trial studying ACP for 200 elderly subjects using a video depiction of a patient with dementia compared to the traditional verbal narrative. Specific aims 1 and 2 assess the effect of a video of advanced dementia on the clinical decision making of elderly subjects compared to the traditional verbal narrative.</brief_summary>
