	<brief_summary>A study to evaluate how effective different levels of Vaniprevir (MK-7009), when administered with Pegylated-Interferon (Peg-IFN) and Ribavirin, are at achieving rapid viral response (RVR) i.e., undetectable hepatitis C virus [HCV] viral ribonucleic acid [RNA] at Week 4 in participants with chronic HCV infection. The primary hypothesis was that the proportion of participants in one or more of the Vaniprevir treatment groups achieving RVR would be greater than the proportion of placebo participants achieving RVR when Vaniprevir and placebo were co-administered with Peg-IFN/Ribavirin.</brief_summary>
