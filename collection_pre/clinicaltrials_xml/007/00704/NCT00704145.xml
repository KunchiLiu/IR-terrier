	<brief_summary>A prospective Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) study on the completeness of strut coverage and vessel wall response, at different time points (3-6-9 Months), following TAXUS Liberte stent implantation (staged procedures) in patients with multi vessel native coronary artery lesions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography Following Paclitaxel Eluting Stent Implantation in Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major concerns were addressed to the delayed healing process of drug-eluting stents in off-label indications. To date no studies have detailed the in-vivo completeness of DES coverage at different time points. The objective of this prospective study is to measure the completeness of strut coverage and vessel wall response (neointima disomogeneity, acquired late incomplete strut apposition) at different time points following paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation, in patients with multivessel disease treated with staged PCI procedures. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) that detects smaller degrees of stent strut coverage more accurately than IVUS will be used at different time point. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will be performed as per normal practice at any index procedures and 9 months elective follow-up.</detailed_description>
