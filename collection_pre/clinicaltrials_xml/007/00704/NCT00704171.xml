	<criteria>PreOperative Subjects 18 years of age or older Scheduled for an elective pulmonary lobectomy and segmentectomy (limited resection in case of reduced functional operability) in one or more lobes via an open thoracotomy Subject or authorized representative has been informed of the nature of the study and has provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee of teh respective clinical site PreOperative Documented history of bleeding disorders and/or severely altered renal or hepatic function Compromised immune system (e.g., HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, immunosuppressive therapy) Prior ipsilateral thoracotomy Subject with Tuberculosis Extensive adhesions from previous thoracic trauma or surgery Undergoing lung volume reduction surgery, wedge resection, pneumonectomy, sleeve resection or bronchoplasty, blebectomy, bullectomy, pleurodesis, lung transplant, or living lobe transplant donor Subject has active systemic or pulmonary infection Treated with chronic steroid therapy unless discontinued more than 6 weeks prior to surgery (standard acute perioperative steroids are permitted). For purposes of this protocol, chronic steroid therapy is defined as greater than 4 weeks Pregnant (documented by pregnancy test), breastfeeding, or that wish to become pregnant during the course of the study or not willing to use birth control (e.g. IUD; oral, transdermal or parenteral contraceptives; abstinence) Documented history of uncontrolled diabetes Subject has an estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months Currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with this study Congestive heart failure, cor pulmonale, or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may jeopardize the subject's wellbeing and/or negatively impact the interpretation of data collected during the clinical study Unable to comply with the study requirements or followup schedule IntraOperative At least one intraoperative air leak identified during lung submersion leak test after the initial closure is completed Hemostasis must be confirmed prior to randomization IntraOperative Procedure performed via VATS only Air leaks originating from bronchioles &gt;1 mm in diameter that cannot be primarily closed or a residual tidal volume loss of &gt;=30% Extensive intrathoracic adhesions present Exploratory thoracotomy performed only Pneumonectomy, wedge resection, sleeve resection, pleurodesis, bronchoplasty, blebectomy or bullectomy performed Incidental finding of any other preoperative exclusion criteria Use of buttressing materials or other nonautologous staple/suture line reinforcement or other surgical sealants when used for pulmonary sealing (i.e., use of hemostatic agents for hemostasis is permitted); however, the sealant should not be applied over intact hemostatic material and all hemostat should be removed prior to sealant application Investigator determines that participation in the study may jeopardize the safety or welfare of the subject</criteria>
