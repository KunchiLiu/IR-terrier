	<brief_title>Family Based Treatment of Depressed Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a major public health concern among adolescents. Research suggests that it not only is prevalent among adolescents (as many as 20% of adolescents have a depressive episode by the age of 18), but its effects last well into adulthood. Although available studies of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions show promise, there are concerns regarding their effectiveness and possible side effects like increase in suicidal ideation. Family conflict is not only an effect of depression, but also a risk factor for depression. High conflict and dysfunction, have consistently been shown to increase risk for depression. As such, family treatments that target risk and protective factors (e.g., quality of parent-child interaction, parental monitoring) for depression seem promising to reduce depression. The current study is a randomized clinical trail aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a 12-week family based intervention for depressed adolescents (Attachment based family therapy- ABFT). Adolescents referred to specialist mental health hospital in south-west Norway (Stavanger University Hospital) will be randomized to either ABFT or treatment as usual (TAU). Therapists administering both the experimental and control group intervention are regular staff clinicians. Outcome assessments would be carried out at baseline, 6, 12 and 26 weeks by raters blind to the condition of the treatment.</detailed_description>
