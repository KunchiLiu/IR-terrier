	<brief_title>Change in Plaque Characteristics With Atorvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) who will undergo PCI and have at least one atherosclerotic lesion of &gt;25% stenosis other than culprit lesions of current ACS are enrolled. Fibrous cap thickness of a target coronary plaque is evaluated by optical coherence tomography.</detailed_description>
