	<brief_summary>This study will explore the correlation of biomarkers with response rate, and the overall efficacy and safety, of Avastin in combination with carboplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be randomized to one of 2 groups, to receive either Avastin 7.5mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 week cycle, or Avastin 15mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 week cycle; all patients will also receive treatment with carboplatin and either gemcitabine or paclitaxel for a maximum of 6 cycles. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
