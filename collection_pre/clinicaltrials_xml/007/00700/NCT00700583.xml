	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to determine whether the combined administration of a diuretic agent, hydrochlorothiazide, at night would improve the frequency of nocturia unresponsive to alpha-blocker monotherapy in men with LUTS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha-blocker Plus Diuretic Combination Therapy as Second-line Treatment for Nocturia in Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because nocturia may result in sleep disturbances, daytime fatigue, a lower level of general well-being, and an increased risk of falling at night, it is among the most bothersome of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Nocturia is related to a variety of conditions such as aging, overactive bladder (OAB), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)/LUTS, medications, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, anorexia nervosa, and sleep disturbance. In a previous study, we suggested that treatment with terazosin can reduce episodes of nocturia, both subjectively and objectively, in some men with LUTS. Other study showed that in men with nocturnal polyuria, furosemide resulted in a significant reduction in night-time frequency and percentage of the voided volume.</detailed_description>
