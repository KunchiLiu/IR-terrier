	<detailed_description>The Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD)is defined as that developed after the started antibiotic therapy ou until six to eight weeks after the end of the treatment. The occurence of AAD is about 5% to 25% of the patients using antibiotics and cause watery diarrhea, fever and vomit, mainly on pseudomembranous colitis. Several studies had demonstrated the use of probiotics as therapeutic or preventive form of AAD with or without the presence of C. difficile. About the tolerance of the probiotics,there weren´t observed deleterious effects on health with the consumption of 106 - 107 UFC of Lactobacillus spp and Bifidobacterium spp during a period of one year. The realization of this study can demonstrate the efficacy of Lactobacillus casei e Bifidobacterium breve at the treatment of AAD.</detailed_description>
