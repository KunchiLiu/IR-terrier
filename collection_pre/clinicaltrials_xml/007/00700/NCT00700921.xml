	<brief_title>Lovastatin as a Potential Modulator of Apoptosis in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact of lovastatin, 40mg by mouth once daily on biological and clinical outcomes will be evaluated in an exploratory 16-week comparative treatment efficacy trial in 44 adult former smokers with established COPD of moderate severity. This trial employs a longitudinal randomized, parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled design using biomarkers of airway inflammation as the primary outcomes of interest.</detailed_description>
