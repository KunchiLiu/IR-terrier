	<brief_summary>Study will evaluate the persistence of antibodies approximately three years after an initial dose of Menactra® vaccine in toddlers who participated in study MTA26 (NCT00643916) and age-matched Menactra naive participants. Objectives: - To assess the persistence of antibody responses three years after one or two doses of Menactra® vaccine in subjects who participated in study MTA26. - To describe the antibody responses to a single dose of Menactra® vaccine in subjects who had previously received one or two doses of Menactra® vaccine and in Menactra® vaccine-naïve subjects. - To describe the safety profile of a single dose of Menactra® vaccine in subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects that received Menactra® vaccine in study MTA26 (NCT00643916) and age-matched Menactra naive participants will receive a single dose of Menactra® on Day 0. They will be evaluated for immunogenicity and safety post-vaccination.</detailed_description>

Subject and parent/legal guardian able to attend all scheduled visits and comply with all study procedures. Exclusion Criteria : Participation in the active (i.e., treatment) portion of another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or a medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the first study vaccination Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months, or longterm systemic corticosteroids therapy. Known or suspected systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the study vaccine or to a product containing any of the substances present in the study vaccine. Chronic illness at a stage that could interfere with trial conduct or completion, in the opinion of the investigator. Received blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months. Received any vaccine (other than desensitization therapy for allergies or influenza vaccine within 2 weeks before vaccination) in the 4 weeks preceding the first study vaccination. Planned receipt of any vaccine within the 4 weeks following the study vaccination. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs antigen), or hepatitis C seropositivity. History of invasive meningococcal infection (confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically).

Anticipated to receive oral or injected antibiotic therapy within the 72 hours prior to any of the trial blood draws. Personal or family history of GuillainBarré Syndrome (GBS). Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine.</criteria>
