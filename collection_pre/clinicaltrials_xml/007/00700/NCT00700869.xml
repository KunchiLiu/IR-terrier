	<brief_title>Evaluation of a New Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Strategy for Patients With Altered Level of Consciousness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current guidelines for mechanical ventilation weaning do not apply for patients with altered level of consciousness. One major limitation is a failure of clinical assessment of the respiratory behaviour status of these patients that are not able to interact appropriately with the examiner. We propose a non-invasive method for the respiratory behaviour assessment of a patient under artificial ventilation that do not requires his participation. Our hypothesis is that, in case of normal respiratory behaviour status, it is possible to wean under security a patient despite his abnormal level of consciousness.We previously demonstrate that patients successfully wean by the clinical team also disclose a normal respiratory behaviour status while patients with weaning failure had abnormal respiratory behaviour. In the present study, we wonder to evaluate that a weaning strategy governs by respiratory behaviour status assessed by our method is safe. For this purpose, in this study, tracheal tube withdrawal is triggered by a recognition of a normal respiratory behaviour status assessed daily in patients under mechanical ventilation with an altered level of consciousness and a good tolerance to T tube challenge.</detailed_description>
