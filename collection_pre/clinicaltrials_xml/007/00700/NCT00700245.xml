	<brief_summary>The human adipose and muscle -tissue produce and release a number of bioactive proteins which contributes to the chronic low grade of inflammatory status which is associated with obesity and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Study 1: Our aim is to investigate if exercise has independent and additive effects in combination with diet-induced weight loss on circulating levels of inflammatory markers and mRNA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and skeletal muscle tissue (SM. Study 2: Our aim is to investigate whether gender and weight status plays a role in the metabolic response during two hours of acute exercise</brief_summary>
