	<brief_title>Cohort Study of the Patterns of Microvesicles in the Serum of Participants With Atopic and Non-atopic Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 20 participants (men or women) between the ages of 18-50 years with asthma will be enrolled. Participants will remain on their usual asthma treatments as prescribed by their usual asthma care provider. Current asthma treatments and any changes will be recorded at baseline and each subsequent visit. The primary outcome measures are correlation of microvesicle patterns with atopic state and variation from baseline with episodes of poor asthma control. Secondary outcomes include correlations between microvesicle patterns and spirometry, eNO levels, and glucorcorticoid sensitivity.</detailed_description>
