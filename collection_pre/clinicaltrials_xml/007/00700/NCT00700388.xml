	<brief_summary>Mechanical devices to increase the individual's bronchial hygiene are commonly used in patients with chronic retention of secretions and abnormal cough reflex. In this clinical context a new technology (namely TPEPÂ® - Temporary Positive Expiratory Pressure) has been recently developed with the aim to improve the respiratory condition in patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases. This trial has the aim to assess the clinical efficacy of TPEP in patients with chronic hypersecretion and airways obstruction, but with a normal competence of the cough reflex</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Temporary Positive Expiratory Pressure (TPEP) in Chronic Hypersecretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-blind multicentre controlled randomized trial with consecutive recruitment. Randomization list by blocks will be available. Group comparison will be made between active therapies including TPEP added to conventional MABT (Intervention) or MABT alone (Control). Active therapy will last 10 consecutive daily sessions in both groups. Primary outcome Efficacy comparison on change in: a.arterial oxygenation (as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 ratio and/or SatO2 index) Secondary outcomes Efficacy comparison on change in: 1. Sputum characteristics 2. Daily sputum volume 3. Perceived sensation 4. Lung functions (as assessed by spirometry and RM strength)</detailed_description>
