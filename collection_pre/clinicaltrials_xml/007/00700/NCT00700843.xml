	<brief_title>Long-Term Follow-up of Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC) Bariatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to obtain long-term follow-up results for bariatric patients who underwent medical management or surgery for treatment of morbid obesity by Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC) surgeons during the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Our hypothesis is that surgical intervention for treatment of morbid obesity leads to sustained weight loss and decreased obesity-related morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>
