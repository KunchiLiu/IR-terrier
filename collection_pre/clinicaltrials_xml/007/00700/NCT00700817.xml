	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe and North America. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect on blood sugar control of liraglutide or sitagliptin, both in combination with metformin, in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone. The trial has been extended by 52 weeks. The extension will consist of two 26-week periods: 1. Week 27-52 after randomisation - All subjects will continue receiving sitagliptin or liraglutide at unchanged dose and dosing regimen. 2. Week 53-78 after randomisation - Subjects receiving sitagliptin at the end of week 52 after randomisation will discontinue sitagliptin and will be randomised 1:1 to liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Liraglutide will be initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg/day, and increased to 1.2 mg/day or 1.8 mg/day in weekly intervals. - Subjects receiving liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or 1.8 mg/day at the end of week 52 after randomisation will continue the treatment at unchanged dose and dosing regimen. Trial completion is planned for June 2010.</brief_summary>
