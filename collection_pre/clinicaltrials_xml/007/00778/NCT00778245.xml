	<detailed_description>A single dose, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover study design was used to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the cefprozil tablet products when dosed (1 x 500 mg) under fed conditions. The washout period will be at least 14 days between doses. Twenty four plus two alternate (24 + 2) subjects were enrolled in this study and all volunteers were healthy adults.
