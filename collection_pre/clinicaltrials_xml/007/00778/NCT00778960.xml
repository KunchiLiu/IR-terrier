	<brief_title>Mechanistic Pathways of Mindfulness Meditation in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study requires nine visits to the clinic: one screening visit, one baseline visit, six training sessions, and one endpoint visit. There will be approximately 100 people enrolled in this study who will be randomly allocated to one of four groups: a slow breathing group, a meditation group, a meditation plus slow breathing group and a sitting quietly group. Participants will undergo a telephone screening, a screening visit, baseline visit, six intervention visits (once per week for six weeks), and one endpoint visit (one week after the final training visit). A telephone screening and screening visit will ensure participant eligibility. The screening visit included structured clinician interviews on PTSD symptoms and other mental health disorders, completion of questionnaires, and receipt of home saliva collection kit. At the baseline visit, electrodes will be attached to measure the electrical activity of head, chest, skin, and respiration and blood pressure during a computer task. Intervention visits include slow breathing, meditation, mediation and slow breathing, or sitting quietly depending on which group the participant is allocated to. Breathing rates and other electrical activity of the body will be measured also. Breathing rate will be measured with an elastic band that is placed around the chest. Electrical activity will be measured by the electrodes that will be placed on the scalp, chest and skin. The endpoint visit will be exactly the same as the baseline visit.</detailed_description>
