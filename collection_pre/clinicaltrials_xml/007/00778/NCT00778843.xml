	<brief_summary>The pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is associated to severe oxidative stress and non-selective immunological disturbance that leads to necro-inflammation and progression of fibrosis. Previous trials suggested that antioxidant and inmunostimulant therapies may have a beneficial effect. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether Viusid, a nutritional supplement with hepatoprotective properties, could ameliorate the oxidative stress and modulate the immune response in patients with CHC and non-responders to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, during 24 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
