	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if children who are allergic to milk can increase tolerance through frequent dose-escalation every 6 months versus 12 months leading to eventual tolerance of less heated milk and ultimately unheated milk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Milk Allergy and Tolerance in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Milk is among the most common food allergens in infants and children. The majority of children outgrow their milk allergies; however, the exact mechanisms by which food tolerance is achieved are unknown. Strict avoidance of the offending food is currently the only known therapy. However, some have been known to tolerate milk products cooked at high heat such as when baked in foods. This clinical trial involves a diet containing extensively baked milk protein to investigate the effects of ingestion of heat-denatured milk on development of oral tolerance to non-baked milk.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>One or more of the following inclusion criteria for enrollment in the study have to be met: Convincing history of an allergic reaction to milk or a positive double blind placebo controlled milk challenge (DBPCMC) within the past 2 years and either detectable milk immunoglobulin E (IgE) or positive prick skin test to milk OR Serum milkIgE of high predictive value &gt;14 kUa/L or prick skin test to milk &gt; 10mm wheal within the past 6 months regardless of past clinical history of reactions OR Convincing history of an allergic reaction to milk or a positive DBPCMC more than 2 years ago and either a positive serum milkIgE &lt; 14 kUA/L or positive prick skin test to milk &lt; 10 mm wheal within the past 6 months (eligible only for the active arm of the study and will undergo a reversed sequence of initial bakedmilk challenges) Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or to comply with study protocol</criteria>
