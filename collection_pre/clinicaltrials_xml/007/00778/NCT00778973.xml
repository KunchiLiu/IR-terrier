	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test formulation of sertraline 100 mg tablets with an already marketed reference formulation Zoloft® 100 mg tablets (Pfizer), under non-fasting conditions in healthy male and female adult subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Sertraline Hydrochloride 100mg Tablets Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of two formulations of 100 mg sertraline hydrochloride tablets under non-fasting conditions. The study was conducted with 36 (34 completing) healthy adults in accordance with protocol No. 10540324 (Revision 0). In each study period, a single 100 mg dose was administered to the subjects following a standardized high fat breakfast preceded by an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was Ranbaxy Research Laboratory's Sertraline Hydrochloride 100 mg Tablets and the reference formulation was ZOLOFT® (sertraline hydrochloride) 100 mg Tablets Manufactured by Roerig (Division of Pfizer). The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There was a 14-day interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 144 hours after each dose. The plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen Fassoulas, B.Sc., Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul Industriel, Laval, Quebec, H7LAS3 Canada, Telephone: 450-663-6724, ext. 438, FAX: 450-975-8111 for determination of sertraline plasma concentration. Statistical analysis was performed by Yetta I. Wilbur, Biostatistician, Novum Pharmaceutical Research Services, 5900 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, USA, Telephone: 412-363-3300, Fax: 412-362-5783 to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test formulation to that of the reference product. A total of 36 healthy adult subjects.</detailed_description>
