	<brief_title>A Prospective Observational Registry of Peripheral Use of AngioJet Rheolytic Thrombectomy With Mid-Length Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PEARL Registry collects real world data about mid-length AngioJet catheters to: - Characterize usage patterns, treatment approaches, and targeted vessels - Document treatment strategies, including specific techniques and concomitant therapies - Collect outcome data during initial hospitalization and at a 3-month follow-up phone call or visit - Evaluate the frequency of specific clinical events in relation to risk factors, diagnosis, and treatments provided - Identify treatment strategies that may optimize procedural and clinical outcomes, to facilitate development of treatment guidelines - Offer sites a valuable resource for tracking usage and performance of the AngioJet System at their institution Information collected by the PEARL Registry is intended for educational and clinical research purposes only.</detailed_description>
