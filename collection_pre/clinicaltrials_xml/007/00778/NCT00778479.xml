	<brief_summary>This study will examine the Performance of Sepraspray in Patients undergoing open abdominal surgery NOTE regarding reason for study termination: A patient death reported during the trial warranted temporary suspension for review by the independent data review committee. Although the committee recommended continuing enrollment, enrollment was electively terminated by the sponsor. A preliminary analysis did not identify any new risk that was not listed on the investigational labeling for this product. A full analysis of the results is expected to allow characterization of the risk/benefit and clinical utility of the product in the exposed patient population.</brief_summary>
