	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, India, Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid and GlaxoSmithKline, U.S.A. (Augmentin ES-600), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, administered as a 1 x 5 mL (600 mg - 42.9 mg) oral suspension, under fed conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid 600 mg-42.9 mg/ 5 mL Oral Suspension Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single center, randomized, single-dose, open label, 2 - way crossover bioequivalence study to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a test amoxicillin-clavulanic acid versus Augmentin ES-600, a reference amoxicillin- clavulanic acid, under fed conditions. Prior to the study commencement, subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment in accordance with the randomization scheme generated by Anapharm. Subjects were confined to the Anapharm Clinical research Facility from at least 11 hours prior to drug administration until after the 12.0 hour post-dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment phases were separated by a washout period of 14 days. A total of sixty-two (62) healthy adult subjects signed the study specific informed consent form and were confined for period I; of these subjects forty eight (48), (21 males and 27 females) were enrolled and dosed in the study; forty six (46) of these enrolled subjects completed the clinical phase of the study</detailed_description>

BMI greater than or equal to 19.0 and less than 30.0 Subjects to whom any of the following applies will be excluded from the study: 1. Clinically significant illness or surgery within 4 weeks prior to dosing 2. Any clinically significant abnormality or abnormal laboratory test results found during medical screening 3. Any reason which in the opinion of the clinical SubInvestigator, would prevent the subject from participating in the study 4. Positive tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV at screening 5. ECG abnormalities (clinically significant) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or over 90 mmHg, or heart rate less than 50 or over 100 bpm) at screening 6. History of significant alcohol abuse or drug abuse within one year prior to the screening visit 7. Regular use of alcohol within six months prior to the screening visit (more than 14 units of alcohol per week [ 1 unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL of 40% alcohol]) 8. Use of soft drugs (such as marijuana) within 3 months prior to the screening visit or hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP] and crack) within 1 year prior to screening 9. History of allergic reactions to amoxicillinclavulanic acid, penicillin, or other related drugs 10.

Use of an investigational drug or participation in an investigational study within 30 days prior to dosing 12. Clinically significant history or presence of any gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases), unresolved gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), liver or kidney disease, or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug. 13. Any clinically significant history or presence of neurological, endocrinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, immunologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disease. 14. Use of prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration of study medication or overthecounter products (including natural food supplements, vitamins, garlic as a supplement) within 7 days prior to the administration of the study medication, except for topical products without systemic absorption and hormonal contraceptives 15. Difficulty to swallow study medication 16. Smoking more than 25 cigarettes per day 17. Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the Clinical SubInvestigator, could contraindicate the subject's participation in this study 18. A depot injection or an implant of any drugs (other than hormonal contraceptives) within 3 months prior to administration of study medication 19. Donation of plasma (500 mL) within 7 days prior to the drug administration. Donation or loss of whole blood (excluding the volume of blood that will be drawn during the screening procedures of this study) prior to administration of the study medication as follows: 50 mL to 499 mL of whole blood within 30 days More than 499 mL of whole blood within 56 days prior to the drug administration 20. Wear of dentures or presences of braces at the time of dosing or any piercing in mouth, lips, and/ or tongue 21. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening 22. Breast feeding subject 23.
