	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover, relative bioavailability study performed on 24 healthy adult volunteers and 2 alternates. All 26 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before dosing until after the 36-hour blood draw. Single oral 400 mg doses were separated by a washout period of 7 days A total of 24 healthy adult volunteers and 2 alternates (17 males and 9 non-pregnant females) enrolled in and completed the clinical phase of the study</detailed_description>
