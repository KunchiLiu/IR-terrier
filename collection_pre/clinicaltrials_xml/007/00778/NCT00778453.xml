	<brief_summary>The findings of this study will advance movement reorganization mechanism underlying treatment approaches and clinical intervention techniques. These findings may inform rehabilitation professionals about which treatment approach is superior to another one in certain aspect of outcome and who can benefit most from certain treatment approach. Accordingly, the results of this project may help us move quickly to design and develop efficient and effective rehabilitation programs for individualized patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relative Effects and Predictive Models of Contemporary Upper Limb Training Programs in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first purpose is to investigate the relative effects of modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) vs. bilateral isokinematic training (BIT) vs. traditional or therapist-based training (TR) on movement reorganization, motor performance, functional ability, and quality of life (QoL) immediately and six months later after treatment delivered at hospitals. Movement reorganization will be evaluated by kinematic instrument. Motor performance, functional ability, and QoL will be assessed using clinical assessment tools. By the same token, we also investigate the relative effects of these two approaches delivered at home. The second purpose is to study whether home-based mCIT is efficacious in various aspects of outcomes described above immediately and six months later following treatment, compared to home-based TR, and hospital-based mCIT and TR.We also study the same question regarding home-based BIT efficacy. The third purpose is to establish predictive models to predict functional and QoL outcomes immediately and six months later following mCIT and BIT.</detailed_description>
