	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter Phase II study evaluating folinic acid + fluorouracil + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab (Erbitux) or folinic acid + fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) plus cetuximab as first-line therapy of patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. Only subjects with k-ras oncogene (KRAS) wild-type tumors are eligible. Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks. Treatment will be continued until progressive disease or unacceptable adverse events occur. After the end of study treatment, information on further anticancer treatment and survival will be collected every 3 months.</brief_summary>
