	<brief_summary>Study purpose: To investigate whether ALT rebound following corticosteroid priming enhances response to telbivudine therapy. Efficacy assessments: The primary endpoint will be the 1-year HBe-Ag seroconversion rate with or without prednisolone priming. Data analysis: A summary table will be presented as frequency tables for categorical variables as number, and percentage, whereas descriptive tables for continuous variables as number, mean ± SD and median (minimum, maximum). All statistical assessments will be two-sided and evaluated at significance level of 0.05. Continuous variables will be analyzed using t-test, or ANOVA, and categorical variables will be analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A non-parametric method, Wilcoxon rank-sum or sign-rank tests will be conducted for continuous, and categorical variables if data is far from normal distribution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prednisolone Priming Study in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase IV, multi-center, double-blinded, placebo control randomized study to evaluate the therapeutic effect of telbivudine with or without prednisolone priming in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients are allocated to either group A or B randomly. Group A: Patients initially receive a 4-week course of oral prednisolone (30 mg daily for 3 weeks and then 15 mg daily of 1 week). After a rest period of no treatment for 2 weeks, the patients receive telbivudine therapy at a daily dose of 600 mg for 2 years. Patients will be asked to come back to clinic for follow-up 6 months after telbivudine treatment. Group B: Patients receive a 4-week course of placebo. After a rest period of no treatment for 2 weeks, the patients receive telbivudine therapy at a daily dose of 600 mg for 2 years. Patients will be asked to come back to clinic for follow-up 6 months after telbivudine treatment. Eligible patients will be randomized prior to the first dose of study medication. The visit at which the patient receives the first dose will be defined as the study Baseline. Patients will return to the clinic at 3, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 30, 44, 58, 72, 86, 98, 110, 116, 122, 128 and 134 weeks post-Baseline. At each of these visits, routine clinical laboratory tests, adverse event inquiry, and other clinical assessments will be performed. Serum samples for HBV DNA analysis will be obtained at 4, 6, 30, 58, 86, 110 and 134 weeks. Serum samples for HBV sequencing will be obtained at Screening and Week 110 (or upon early termination from the study). Complete physical examinations will be performed at each study visits to evaluate any adverse signs or symptoms reported by the patient. Serum for HBeAg, antibody to HBeAg (HBeAb), HBsAg, and antibody to HBsAg (HBsAb) will be obtained at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 6, 30, 58, 86, 110 and 134(or upon early termination from the study), and at all protocol-required follow-up visits. Patients will be followed monthly for 6 months after discontinuation of study drug(s).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Treatment naïve patients or interferontreated patients 6 months before, or oral antiviral agents treatment ≦ 2 weeks before or treatment &lt; 3 months 1 year prior to screening. 2. Male or female, 18 to 65 years of age. 3. Documented chronic hepatitis B defined by all of the following: Clinical history compatible with compensated chronic hepatitis B. Detectable serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) &gt;6 months and at the screening visit. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive &gt;3 months. Serum HBV DNA &gt; 2x10^5 IU/mL and raised serum ALT &gt; 2xULN but &lt; 5xULN determined on at least 2 occasions 1 month apart before screen or within 3 months of prescreen, raised serum ALT &gt; 2xULN but &lt; 5xULN determined 1 month apart before screen and at screen.4. 4. Liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis and fibrosis stage ≦ 4 by Ishak classification within 6 months or fibrosis ≦ 4 between 6 to 12 months plus platelet count ≧ 150,000/mm3 or noninvasive assessment (fibroscan or ARFI) of liver fibrosis to excluding liver cirrhosis within 6 months. 5. Willing and able to comply with the study drug regimen and all other study requirements. 6. Willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons: 1. Pregnant or nursing. 2. Of reproductive potential (men and women) and unwilling to use doublebarrier method of contraception (i.e., condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide). 3. Coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), or HIV. 4. History or clinical signs/symptoms of hepatic decompensation or portal hypertension, such as ascites, presence of esophageal varices or variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 5.
