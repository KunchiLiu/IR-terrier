	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Gabapentin 400 mg Capsules Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover relative bioavailability study performed on 24 healthy adult volunteers and 2 alternates. A total of 26 subjects (22 males and 4 females) completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 36-hour blood draw. Both periods were separated by a wash out period of 7 days A total of 26 healthy adult volunteers (22 males and 4 non-pregnant females) enrolled in and completed the clinical phase of the study enrolled in and completed the clinical phase of the study</detailed_description>
