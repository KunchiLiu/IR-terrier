	<brief_summary>Patients who have received the appropriate number of years of alendronate or risedronate therapy will be recruited. Each patient will have received baseline BMD measurements performed at the spine and the hip by DXA. Each patient will receive tetracycline to label the bone and then have a transiliac bone biopsy. One year later teh bone label and biopsy procedure will be repeated.</brief_summary>
