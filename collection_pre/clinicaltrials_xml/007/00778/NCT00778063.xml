	<brief_title>Study Using Dexmedetomidine to Decreases Emergence Delirium in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence delirium has been described as a dissociated state of consciousness in which the child is irritable, uncompromising, uncooperative, incoherent, inconsolably crying, moaning, kicking or thrashing. The children can run the gambit from restlessness and incoherence to combative and psychotic. The incidence of emergence agitation or delirium is 80% after a procedure with sevoflurane-induced anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to have sedative and analgesic effects. In the pediatric population, it has been shown to provide sedation for radiographic procedures. Intravenously, it is has been shown to decrease emergence delirium following sevoflurane based anesthesia. The ability to administer a medication intranasally might solve the problem of emergence delirium and emergence agitation posed by the young patients undergoing myringotomy and tube placement.</detailed_description>
