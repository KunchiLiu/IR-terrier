	<brief_summary>The Swefot trial was designed to compare two treatment strategies for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (less than 1 year symptom duration): the use of a combination of traditional antirheumatic medications (DMARDs), versus a combination including a newer "biological" anti-TNF medication. In order to make this trial consistent with current practices in rheumatology, all patients were first given the most commonly used antirheumatic medication, methotrexate (MTX). After 3-4 months those patients who had not responded adequately to this treatment were randomized to receive either MTX plus sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine, or MTX plus infliximab. Again, to be truly life-like, the trial allowed patients who could not tolerate one of the added medications to switch in treatment - but keeping with the same strategy - so that sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine could be replaced by cyclosporin A, and infliximab by etanercept. The primary outcome in this trial was the percentage of patients who, after one year of treatment, achieved a "good response" as defined by Eular.</brief_summary>
