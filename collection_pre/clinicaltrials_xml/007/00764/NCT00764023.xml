	<brief_summary>The intent of this protocol is to salvage human-related material that is normally destined for destruction, so it can be used in infection-related scientific studies. This clinical material can be studied in order to better understand the molecular, cellular, or ecological components of the infected or potentially infected tissue or device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Center Protocol for Obtaining and Storing Human Samples for Immediate or Future Microbial, Immune, or Host-Microbe Scientific Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The samples can include material such as wound debridement, removed orthopedic implants, removed catheters or shunts, excised tonsils, amputated tissue, sputum, stool, or other excretions. The samples can be cultured for microbes, examined using microscopy, or analyzed using molecular techniques. The studies can examine microbes or the host's response to microbes by examining the nucleic acids (e.g. 16S DNA, mRNA), proteins, or other metabolites.</detailed_description>
