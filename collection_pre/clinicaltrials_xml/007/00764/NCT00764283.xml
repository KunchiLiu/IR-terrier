	<brief_summary>Three types of dressing will be compared to prevent postoperative epidural catheter migration. Patients will be randomised to have a Tegaderm dressing, an Epi-fix dressing or a Lockit-Plus dressing to secure the epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia. The length of the epidural catheter visible at the patient's skin surface will be recorded after insertion and every day until removal. The integrity of the dressing and problems with analgesia will also be recorded.</brief_summary>
