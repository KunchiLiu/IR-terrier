	<brief_summary>Patients with a history of colorectal cancer and known or suspected liver metastases who are scheduled for contrast-enhanced tomographic imaging will be included in this study. After randomization to either Primovist-enhanced MRI, extracellular contrast media (ECCM)-enhanced MRI or contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT outcomes and resource needs of the diagnostic work-up and treatment will be evaluated for each of the three imaging modalities. Main objectives of the study are to assess the proportion of patients for whom further imaging is required to come to a therapy decision and to evaluate the proportion of patients with intraoperatively modified surgical plans after Primovist-enhanced MRI as compared to ECCM-enhanced MRI and CE-CT.</brief_summary>
