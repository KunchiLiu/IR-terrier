	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the PSA (biochemical) progression-free survival (PFS) of high-risk metastasis-free PC patients, treated with LH-RH agonist for one year with or without docetaxel after prior radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT). The study was powered at 80% to detect a 25% improvement in biochemical PFS for a total sample size estimated at 252 patients, with a two-sided type I error rate of 5% (non-parametric methods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Hormonal Therapy +/-Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel was shown to be active in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (PC) in phase III trials (1-2). It is likely to demonstrate a substantial role in the management of early-stage PC patients in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, where clinical trials are underway.â€¢53% of all men who undergo radical prostatectomy will develop prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevations in the 10 years following surgery, with approximately 77% of these recurrences occurring within the first 2 years.A prospective, multicenter, national, randomized, two-arm, phase III study comparing hormonal treatment (LH-RH agonist alone) with or without docetaxel was designed to evaluate the interest of chemotherapy in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients at high risk of systemic recurrence after initial treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy). 1.
