	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this work is to identify changes in the optical properties of oral tissues to develop a non-invasive tool for the detection, diagnosis and screening of oral pathology so that treatment can be provided at the earliest possible time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Investigation of a Fluorescence/Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy (F-ESS) Device for Oral Tissue Characterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically, we will be obtaining optical spectroscopic data using a fiber optic contact probe that exploits elastic-scattering spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Both of these technique have independently shown to provide signatures for the onset of cancer, with varied success. The purpose of this effort is to combine the two techniques and develop and understanding of the signatures obtained in both normal and abnormal oral tissue with simultaneous collection of these optical signatures.</detailed_description>
