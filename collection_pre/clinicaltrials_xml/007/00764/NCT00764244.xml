	<brief_summary>Macular edema is the main cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. Its treatment is mainly based on laser photocoagulation, but has limited results. Alternative treatment are under investigation, such as vitrectomy and intravitreal injections of triamcinolone .The aim of VITRILASE is to compare the efficacy of these two treatments to laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular edema.</brief_summary>
