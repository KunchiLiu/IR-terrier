	<brief_summary>This study randomizes patients seen by Redmond Medic One into a control arm and a study arm when they present with acute coronary syndrome and have non-contributory ECG's (i.e.non-STEMI). The control group is treated normally and delivered to the receiving hospital. The study group is treated normally as well, however troponin measurements are made using an i-STAT blood analyzer prior to hospital arrival. The results are presented to the receiving physician. Door-to-reperfusion time is monitored for both groups.</brief_summary>
