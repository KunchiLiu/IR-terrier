	<brief_summary>Neonates with intra-uterine growth delay represent more than 2% of the 800 000 annual births in France. Studies have shown that milks enriched with protein allow to accelerate newborns growth. According to some papers, growth acceleration would have a favourable effect on psycho-motor development at age of 2 or 3. However, for other authors, this would not lead to any benefit and even an early hyperproteinic feeding would have bad long term consequences such as appearance of several diseases in the future adult (overweight, diabetes, arterial hypertension, renal function alteration).The main objective of this clinical trial is to check that an hyperproteinic feeding does not lead to any benefit on psycho-motor development at age of 2, compared with a milk containing same level of protein than milk proposed to newborns of normal weight. The secondary objectives of our clinical trial are to compare the effects of these two types of milk on renal function, arterial blood pressure, body composition, corpulence, food preferences, insulin resistance and intestinal integrity at age of 2. A sub study will also be realized to analyse the proteic turn over . This sub-study will be undertaken only with neonates of Nantes Hospital.</brief_summary>
