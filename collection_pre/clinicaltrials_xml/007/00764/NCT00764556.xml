	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are commonly admitted to hospital with exacerbations of their lung disease. A combination of the acute illness and treatment with oral steroids causes a rise in blood sugar. Patients with high blood sugar do worse than those with normal blood sugar. The aim of this study is to develop a safe and effective protocol for tight control of blood glucose with insulin on acute medical wards outside the intensive care environment. This will allow us to perform a formal trial to determine whether blood glucose control with insulin reduces death and complications from COPD exacerbations.</brief_summary>
