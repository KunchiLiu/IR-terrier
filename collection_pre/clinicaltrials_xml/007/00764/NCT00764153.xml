	<brief_summary>An estimated 1.6 million patients sustain a hip fracture every year, about half of these are intracapsular femoral neck fractures. A femoral neck fracture is a life changing event for any patient, and the risk of disability, increased dependence and death is substantial. The main treatment options for displaced femoral neck fractures are internal fixation and arthroplasty. It is established that there are more complications and reoperations after internal fixation, and better short term clinical results with arthroplasty, but knowledge about long term results is lacking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemiarthroplasty or Internal Fixation for Displaced Femoral Neck Fractures - 5 Years Follow up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were included from 2002-2004. Two years follow up was finished by 2006. Patients with displaced intracapsular femoral neck fractures were included and randomized by means of closed numbered envelopes to operation groups: 1. Two parallel screws (Olmed). 2. Hemiarthroplasty with Charnley/ Hastings prosthesis. A priori one would expect that there would be less morbidity and mortality with the less extensive and quicker operation with parallel screw and that a faster and better rehabilitation would be achieved with hemiarthroplasty.</detailed_description>
