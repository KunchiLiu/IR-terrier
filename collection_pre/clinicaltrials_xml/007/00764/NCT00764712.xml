	<brief_summary>A randomized trial to compare three insulin-titration protocols for tight glycemic control in surgical ICU: an absolute glucose (Matias) protocol, a relative glucose change (Bath) protocol, and an enhanced model predictive control algorithm (eMPC)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Three Protocols for Tight Glycemic Control in Cardiac Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 consecutive post-cardiac surgery patients randomized to the three protocols with a target glycemia range from 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l. Intravenous insulin was administered continuously or in combination with insulin boluses (Matias protocol). Blood glucose was measured in 1-4 hour intervals as requested by protocols.</detailed_description>
