	<brief_summary>Visual outcomes using monthly ranibizumab therapy are well established in clinical trials, but the best way to assess when and how to treat patients with PRN therapy has not been proven. Information is lacking on Multi-focal ERG and microperimetry outcomes with ranibizumab therapy. Additionally, VA and OCT outcomes don't always correlate and other assessments such as the Multi-focal ERG and microperimetry may be useful as early predictors of when patients should be retreated. This study will assess 2 groups (monthly and PRN therapy) and assess high resolution OCT, microperimetry, and Multi-focal ERG outcomes. For the PRN group retreatment will be based on OCT criteria. We will investigate if microperimetry or multifocal ERG would have been an early predictor of fluid recurrence.</brief_summary>
