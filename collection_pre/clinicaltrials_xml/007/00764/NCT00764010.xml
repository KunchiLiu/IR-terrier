	<brief_summary>The study was actuated to evaluate the effects of a 3-year intervention with diet and/or very long chain omega-3 (VLC n-3 PUFA), in a randomized 2x2 factorial design on the progression of atherosclerosis in a high risk population. A total of 563 elderly men were included and randomized to receive usual care and VLC n-3 placebo capsules (control group), dietary advice and VLC n-3 placebo capsules, usual care and VLC n-3 capsules, and finally both VLC n-3 capsules and dietary advice. The evaluation of atherosclerosis were i) ultrasound measurement of carotid intima media thickening ii) pulse wave propagation time iii) circulating biomarkers of atherosclerosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The basis for recruitment was a follow up of subjects participating in the Oslo Diet and Anti Smoking Study (1972-1977) characterised as hypercholesterolemic in 1972. Measurements of the outcome variables were performed at baseline and after 36 m; blood sampling also after 6 and 18 m. In addition to the main outcome variables, a biobank was established for future analyses. Clinical events were also recorded.</detailed_description>
