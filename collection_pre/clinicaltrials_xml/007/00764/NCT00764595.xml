	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of imatinib mesylate and to see how well it works in treating patients with liver metastasis from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Liver Metastasis From a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate the safety and efficacy of imatinib mesylate in patients with resectable hepatic metastasis secondary to gastrointestinal stromal tumor. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
