	<brief_summary>Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome have permanent variations of their hemodynamic parameters during the night : heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output. This is due to the repetition of respiratory events (obstructive apnea and hypopnea) leading to frequent micro-arousals. These disorders have several consequences : hypertension, NO-dependent vasodilatation impairment, baroreceptor reflex impairment, insulin resistance and other cardiovascular impairments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Phenotype Study in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective of the study is to characterize the cardiovascular phenotype of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, relative to the presence of hypertension or not. Hypertension should not have been previously treated. 2 groups of apneic patients (SAS+HTA+ and SAS+HTA-) will be compared together, referred to group of non apneic but hypertensive patients (SAS-HTA+) and non apneic / non hypertensive patients (SAS-HTA-). Apneic and hypertensive patients may have a sympathetic nervous system activation and a much more important vascular and baroreceptor reflex impairment, than non apneic but hypertensive patients. During the study, a second visit as control will be done for apneic patients only, 3 to 6 months after SAS treatment setting.</detailed_description>
