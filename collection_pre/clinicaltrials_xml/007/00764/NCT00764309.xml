	<criteria>Target Population meet American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for scleroderma have clinical evidence of active skin disease with a skin score of ≥15 have had the onset of their first nonRaynaud phenomenon feature of SSc no more than 3 years prior to screening have evidence of fibrosing alveolitis (active pulmonary fibrosis) manifested by a forced vital capacity (FVC) between 45% and 80% of predicted normal and/or diffusing capacity (DLCO) between 30% and 70% of predicted normal values have an abnormal high resolution Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest/lungs demonstrating typical ground glass changes of alveolitis with background fibrosis have adequate renal function no evidence of renal crisis in the 2 months prior to enrollment and serum creatinine &lt; 3 mg/dL for both sexes, must use an acceptable form of birth control age ≥ 18 Clinically significant pleural or pericardial effusion in the previous 12 months: Grade 3 or 4. Patients with recent Grade I or II effusions or peripheral edema will be permitted to enter the study Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III or IV) including preexisting arrhythmia, (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or "Torsade de Pointes"), myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina within 6 months, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or pericardial disease Clinicallysignificant coagulation or platelet function disorder (eg, known von Willebrand's disease) Abnormal QTcF interval prolonged (&gt; 450 msec) after electrolytes have been corrected on baseline electrocardiogram Laboratory Test Findings Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL; platelet count &lt; 100,000/dL; WBC &lt; 3,000/dL; PMN &lt; 1,000/dL; OR lymphocytes &lt; 350/dL The presence of any of the following laboratory findings at screening: positive for antibodies to hepatitis C virus; positive for antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); serum bilirubin 2 times normal, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)&gt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies use of other immunosuppressive therapies must be discontinued at enrollment, eg methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine treatment with any other experimental or investigational drug(s) concurrently or less than 12 weeks prior to study enrollment use of antifibrotic agents must be discontinued at enrollment, eg colchicine, D‑penicillamine, minocycline or Type 1 oral collagen</criteria>
