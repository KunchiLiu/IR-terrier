	<brief_summary>Renal artery stenosis (RAS) usually refers to a disease of the large extra-renal arterial vessels and most frequently is caused by atherosclerotic obstructions. The prevalence of atherosclerotic RAS increases with age, male gender, traditional cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia) and atherosclerotic comorbidities like coronary artery or peripheral artery disease (PAD). A prevalence up to 40% has been reported in patients with PAD. Undoubtedly, atherosclerotic RAS is a progressive disease, as more than half of the patients exhibit an increasing degree of stenosis within five years after diagnosis, and one out of five patients with a critical stenosis (&gt;60%) suffers renal atrophy and renal failure during this period. RAS may be treated conservatively by so called best medical treatment, surgically, or by endovascular interventions using balloon angioplasty and stenting. The purpose of the investigators study is to determine the incidence and the predictors of RAS in patients with PAD, and to compare the effect of renal artery stenting versus best medical treatment in patients with hypertension and ostial renal artery stenosis in a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
