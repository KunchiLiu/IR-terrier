	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether manual removal of the placenta during a cesarean delivery results in higher changes in the resistance of blood flow throughout the body, also called systemic vascular resistance (SVR)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manual and Expressed Placental Removal at Cesarean Delivery and Its Effects on Various Cardiac Indices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presenting to William Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak Labor and Delivery for a scheduled low transverse cesarean delivery will be asked to participate in a prospective, randomized study to evaluate any changes in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) pre- and post-delivery. After obtaining informed consent, the patients will be randomized to one of two groups: group 1 will have manual removal of the placenta at cesarean section and group 2 will have expressed removal of the placenta at cesarean section. Both groups will have a pre-operative continuous wave Doppler evaluation and a post-operative continuous wave Doppler evaluation at 24 hours after delivery. Continuous wave Doppler evaluation will be used pre- and post-operatively to evaluate any changes in SVR.</detailed_description>
