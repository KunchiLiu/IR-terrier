	<brief_summary>Objectives: Examine the acute utility of immediate maintained cannulations of a newly implanted prosthetic arteriovenous access. Background: Recurrent failure of central catheterization is not uncommon. An alternative access is necessary for acute hemodialysis after the exhaustion of central veins. Methods: We constructed the access by cannulating two dialysis needle-catheters and securing them on the skin after the implantation of the graft. The access was used immediately and maintained for one week and thereafter used as a long-term access.</brief_summary>
