	<brief_summary>This research is being done to find out the best way to give narcotics for pain relief in adults with sickle cell disease and painful crisis. This study is a comparison of two ways of giving narcotics. The first way is what occurs now in the Emergency Acute Care Unit (EACU) where patients are given a single intravenous (iv) dose of a narcotic which is repeated by the nurse as needed to control the pain. The second way is to provide a single iv dose of narcotic and then allow the patient to push a button and receive one or more additional doses of narcotic when he/she thinks it is needed. Our hypothesis is that PCA will be a more effective way of controlling pain.</brief_summary>
