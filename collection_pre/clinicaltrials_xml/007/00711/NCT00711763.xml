	<brief_summary>The aim of our work is to study the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) cycling in preterm infants on hypercalcuria (excessive calcium excretion in urine). TPN cycling refers to administering the TPN over a portion of the day rather than the whole day. Our hypothesis is that cyclic TPN includes more hypercalcuria in preterm infants as compared to continuous TPN. Objectives: Measure Urinary Calcium(Ca) during the periods of continuous and cyclic TPN. Compare the amount of Ca losses in the urine continuous vs. cyclic TPN</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calciuric Effect and Cyclic Parenteral Nutrition in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized cross over design, in which babies will receive TPN either continuously or on a cyclic basis for 3 days. The patients will then be crossed over to receive the other way of administration over the following 3 days, thus each patient will serve as his or her own control. Continuous TPN will be administered over 24 hours for 3 days, while the cyclic TPN will be given for 18 hours then followed by a Dextrose only solution at the same concentration and rate as the TPN for 6 hours. Trophic feeds up to 20 ml/kg/day will be allowed throughout the study period at the discretion of the attending neonatologist.</detailed_description>
