	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of implants placed in individuals who are about to loose one or more of their upper teeth. The main objective is to study how the surrounding bone tissue reacts to two different shapes of implants. Clinical performance, in wider terms, means esthetics and long lasting function. Half of the patients will receive a cylindrically shaped implant and the other half will receive a conical-cylindrical implant. The implants will be placed and after a healing period of 16 weeks the gum will be re-opened and the bone tissue response clinically evaluated. Permanent artificial tooth/teeth will be attached six weeks after that.</brief_summary>
