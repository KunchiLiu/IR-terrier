	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Risk in Growth Hormone Deficient Young Adult Males After Completing Growth Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adults with growth hormone deficiency are at risk for cardiovascular disease. What age this begins is not known. The objectives of this study are to compare the following measurements between growth hormone deficient young males 3-7 years post completion of growth hormone treatment and age related healthy controls: 1. Carotid artery imaging 2. Metabolic and cardiac parameters 3. Body composition measurements</detailed_description>
