	<detailed_description>Several lines of evidence support protocol-driven care using a multidisciplinary approach with special focus on periodic assessments, reinforcement of compliance and attainment of treatment targets improves risk factor control and reduces morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes mellitus The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Program is an innovative project using state of the art information technology with internet on-line system to enable doctors, nurses and other medical personnel to manage people with diabetes. It provides a virtual platform to facilitate implementation of evidence-based clinical protocols and to collect, manage and analyse data to track performance for quality assurance and improvement purposes. The JADE Program incorporates validated risk equations developed by the CUHK Diabetes Care &amp; Research Group to stratify patients into various risk clusters for recommendation into different care protocols. This information can be relayed to people with diabetes in an interactive manner, in the form of charts and time trends, to motivate changes in behaviour and to attain treatment targets. In this implementation project, we aim to recruit 600 type 2 diabetic patients managed in a community setting. With written informed consent, these patients will be invited to enrol into the JADE Program. All patients will undergo annual comprehensive assessment (CA) at a diabetes centre with personalized JADE report (JADE) for 3 years. Half of the patients will be managed according to the JADE protocol implemented with additional support by a trained CHW (JADE+CHW). Guided by the personalized report with embedded decision support, the CHW will reinforce treatment adherence and self care after each clinic visit.</detailed_description>
