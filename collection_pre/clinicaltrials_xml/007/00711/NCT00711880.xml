	<brief_title>A Study of Sativex® for Relief of Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Associated With Allodynia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a six week, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of Sativex®. Subjects with peripheral neuropathic pain characterised by allodynia, were screened to determine eligibility and entered a seven day baseline period. Subjects then returned to the centre for randomisation and dose introduction, and received either placebo or Sativex in a double blind manner for five weeks, with a follow up visit 7 to 10 days after the end of the treatment period. The primary efficacy measure was the difference in pain severity at the end of treatment, measured using a peripheral neuropathic pain 0 to 10 numerical rating scale.</detailed_description>
