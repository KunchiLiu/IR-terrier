	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional problem in the world. The objectives of this study are: - to evaluate the prevalence of anemia in children from 6 to 24 months of age and the therapeutic and prophylactic response to ferrous sulfate plus folic acid on hemoglobin levels. - to compare the effect of folic acid supplementation with ferrous sulfate on the linear and weight growth of anemic and non-anemic Study hypothesis: - The ferrous sulfate plus folic acid can improve the response on hemoglobin levels. - The folic acid supplementation with ferrous sulfate have effect on the linear and weight growth of anemic and non-anemic.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose The objective of this study were: - to assess the prevalence of anemia and the therapeutic and prophylactic response to ferrous sulfate and folic acid. - to compare the effect of folic acid supplementation with ferrous sulfate on the linear and weight growth of anemic and non-anemic. A double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted with 196 children 6 to 24 months of age enrolled in municipal daycare centers in Goiânia, Goias State, Brazil. The children were assigned to two treatment groups that received a daily dose (5 times a week) of either 4.2mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate + folic acid (50μg) or 4.2mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate + folic acid placebo. One of the prevention groups received 1.4mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate + folic acid (50μg/day) and the other 1.4mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate + folic acid placebo. Supplementation lasted approximately three months.</detailed_description>
