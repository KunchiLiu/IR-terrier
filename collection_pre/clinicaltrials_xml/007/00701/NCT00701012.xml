	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the defecatory function when nerve fibers around the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA) and left colic artery(LCA) are preserved(so called low ligation ) or not(high ligation) in the rectosigmoid and rectal cancer surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Low and High Ligation in the Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fecal incontinence after anterior resection are often observed. Whether or not postoperative bowel function is influenced by the preservation of nerve fibers around the root of IMA and LCA (low ligation) is still unknown. So in this randomized controlled trial, we evaluate the efficacy of low ligation in terms of the bowel function.</detailed_description>
