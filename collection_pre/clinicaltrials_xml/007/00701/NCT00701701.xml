	<brief_summary>An exploratory, open-labeled study of patients with Pompe disease, who have previously received Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa) treatment, to evaluate the efficacy, safety and clinical benefit of 2 Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) regimens in combination with Myozyme. Eligible patients who are currently receiving Myozyme therapy will be enrolled into the study, and will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on-study (a 6-month ITI treatment module and a 12-month follow-up module on Myozyme alone). Eligible patients will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a patient is &lt;6 months of age at the time of enrollment, until the patient is 2 years of age. Both cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM)-negative and CRIM-positive patients can be eligible for Regimen A depending if they meet the required criteria. Regimen B however, is limited to CRIM-negative patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient (and/or patient's legal guardian if patient is &lt; 18years) must provide written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures that are performed; The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease defined as a documented acid αglucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency from any tissue source or 2 GAA gene mutations; The patient (and/or legal guardian) must have ability to comply with clinical protocol; If the patient is Crossreacting immunologic material (CRIM)positive, he/she must have received at least 6 consecutive months of Myozyme infusions (20mg/kg qow) If the patient is CRIMnegative, he/she must have received at least 1 Myozyme infusion prior to enrollment Regimen A only: The patient exhibits clinical decline; The patient has persistent high antirecombinant human acid αglucosidase (antirhGAA) antibody titers and/or tested positive for antibodies that inhibit enzymatic activity and/or uptake of Myozyme; Regimen B only: The patient is CRIMnegative AND The patient does not exhibit clinical decline; OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING: The patient is CRIMnegative AND The patient exhibits clinical decline AND The patient does NOT exhibit high antirhGAA antibody titers and has NOT tested positive for antibodies that inhibit enzymatic activity and/or uptake of Myozyme. The patient has a clinical condition unrelated to Pompe disease that would interfere with program assessments; The patient is at risk of reactivation or is a carrier of Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C; The patient is at risk of reactivation or has positive serology suggestive of active infection for cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex, JC virus, Parvovirus or Epstein Barr virus; The patient is at risk of reactivation of tuberculosis or has regular contact with individuals who are being actively treated for tuberculosis; The patient has low serum albumin; The patient has a major congenital abnormality; The patient has used any investigational product (other than alglucosidase alfa) within 30 days prior to study enrollment; The patient is pregnant or lactating; The patient has had or is required to have any live vaccination within one month prior to enrollment.</criteria>
