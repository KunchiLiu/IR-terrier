	<brief_summary>Diabetes and its associated complications affect more than 20 million Americans, and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance rises dramatically with age such that 40% of Americans over age 60 are affected. In older adults, glucose metabolism may be affected by reduced skeletal muscle capillary supply, which limits insulin, glucose, and oxygen delivery to skeletal muscle. Reduced capillary supply to skeletal muscle is found in older individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and we hypothesize that this is due to reduced vascular growth factor expression, and chronic inflammation. Further, we hypothesize that reversal of a sedentary lifestyle through aerobic exercise training will increase insulin signaling and vascular growth factor expression, as well as decrease inflammation, to increase capillary supply to skeletal muscle, which contributes to improved glucose metabolism in older adults. This study will: 1) Determine the mechanisms underlying reduced skeletal muscle capillarization in older adults with impaired glucose tolerance; and 2) Determine the effect of aerobic exercise training-induced increases in skeletal muscle capillarization on glucose metabolism in older adults.</brief_summary>
