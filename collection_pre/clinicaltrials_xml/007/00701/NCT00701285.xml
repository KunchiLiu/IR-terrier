	<brief_summary>We want to evaluate the utility of statins on heart function according to potency. Patients with chronic ischemic heart failure are administered pitavastatin 4mg or pravastatin 10mg for 52 weeks. Then we evaluate the effect of pitavastatin and pravastatin primarily on rate of hospitalization for cardiovascular cause and lipid profile secondarily biomarker, echocardiography parameter, 6-minute walk, change of NYHA class distribution, cardiovascular mortality.</brief_summary>
