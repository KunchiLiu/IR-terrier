	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with Dutasteride (0.5mg), administered once daily for one year in combination with Tamsulosin (0.4mg), administered once daily for 3 months, followed by counseling on flexible dosing of Tamsulosin on an as needed basis, on the improvement of symptoms and clinical outcome in men with moderate to severe symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). At each scheduled visit (3, 6, and 9 months), the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin. After randomization, study visits are every 13 weeks for up to 52 Weeks. (Including Screening, (up to 7 clinic visits)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with Dutasteride (0.5mg), administered once daily for one year in combination with Tamsulosin (0.4mg), administered once daily for 3 months, followed by counseling on flexible dosing of Tamsulosin on an as needed basis, on the improvement of symptoms and clinical outcome in men with moderate to severe symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). At each scheduled visit (3, 6, and 9 months), the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin. A recently published, landmark study (MTOPS - Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms), co-sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK), demonstrated that, in selected patients, combination therapy with Doxazosin and Finasteride provided additive symptomatic improvements, reduced the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and surgical intervention, and was a more effective treatment for reduction in the overall risk of BPH clinical progression. The aim of this proposed combination study, in a population of patients at high risk of BPH clinical progression, is to investigate whether combination therapy with Dutasteride and Tamsulosin with the subsequent withdrawal of Tamsulosin can maintain superior symptom improvement. At each scheduled visit (3, 6, and 9 months), the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin. We hypothesize that patients may start with a combination of Dutasteride and Tamsulosin and eventually may be able to eliminate the use of Tamsulosin and maintain acceptable urinary symptoms on Dutasteride alone.</detailed_description>

Able to participate for study duration 1. Total serum PSA &gt;10.0 ng/mL at Screening. Patients with total serum PSA &gt;10.0 ng/mL may be acceptable for inclusion if the PSA elevation is thought to be due to BPH and not prostate cancer (by TRUS and biopsies showing no evidence of prostate cancer). 2. History or evidence of prostate cancer 3. Previous prostatic surgery or other invasive procedures to treat BPH 4. History of flexible/rigid cystoscopy or other instrumentation of the urethra within 7 days prior to Screening. Catheterization (&lt;10F) is acceptable with no time restriction. 5. History of AUR within 3 months prior to Screening 6. Postvoid residual volume &gt;250mL (suprapubic ultrasound) at Screening 7. Any causes other than BPH, which may in the judgment of the investigator, result in urinary symptoms or changes in flow rate 8. History of breast cancer or clinical breast examination finding of unclear origin or suggestive of malignancy 9. Use of 5 alphareductase inhibitor, any drugs with antiandrogenic properties, or drugs noted for gynecomastia effects, within past 6 months and throughout the study. Previous use of AVODART within 12 months of the baseline or historical TRUS. Chronic use of Metronidazole is prohibited. 10. Concurrent use of anabolic steroids 11. Use of phytotherapy for BPH within 2 weeks of Screening 12. Use of any alphaadrenoreceptor blockers within 2 weeks of Screening 13. Use of any alphaadrenoreceptor agonists, anticholinergics or cholinergics within 48 hours prior to all uroflowmetry assessments. 14. Hypersensitivity to any alpha/beta adrenoreceptor blocker or 5alphareductase inhibitor, or other chemicallyrelated drugs. 15. Concurrent use of drugs known or thought to interaction with Tamsulosin. 16. History of hepatic impairment, abnormal liver function at Screening, History of renal insufficiency, serum creatinine &gt;1.5 times the upper limit 18. history of malignancies other than basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin within the past 2 years. 19. History of any illness the investigator might confound the results of the study or poses additional risk to the patient. 20. Any unstable, serious coexisting medical condition(s) 21. History of postural hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, or any other signs and symptoms of orthostasis. 22. History of 'first dose' hypotensive episode on initiation of alphaladrenoreceptor antagonist therapy. 23. History of unsuccessful treatment with finasteride or Dutasteride 24. History or current drug or alcohol abuse within the previous 12 months. 25. Participation in any investigational or marketed drug trial within 30 days (or 5 halflives whichever is the longer) preceding Screening and/or during the course of this study.</criteria>
