	<brief_summary>Study to understand the effects of migraine treatments on blood pressure in participants with migraine. The primary hypothesis is that the effect on semi-recumbent mean arterial pressure following the coadministration of telcagepant and sumatriptan is similar to that following administration of sumatriptan alone. That is, the true mean treatment difference (sumatriptan with telcagepant sumatriptan alone) in time-weighted mean arterial pressure for 2.5 hours following dosing is less than 5 mmHg.</brief_summary>
