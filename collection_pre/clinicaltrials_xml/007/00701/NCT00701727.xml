	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial comparing the the effects of approximately 7 weeks of placebo treatment to 7 weeks of ezetimibe (10mg/day) treatment on several parameters of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in men and post-menopausal women diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. The primary hypothesis is that the ezetimibe treatment will increase the excretion of endogenous (plasma-derived) cholesterol as fecal sterols, with secondary hypotheses that there will be a significant increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis, treatment will increase cholesterol efflux from tissues into the bloodstream, and increase global RCT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will compare the effects of approximately 7 weeks of placebo treatment to 7 weeks of ezetimibe (10mg/day) on: 1) the efficiency of endogenous (plasma-derived) cholesterol excretion (%/day) 2) de novo cholesterol (DNC) synthesis ((%/day) 3) cholesterol efflux from tissues into blood (Ra), and 4) global RCT (efflux from tissues that is excreted as fecal sterols). Subjects will receive 7 weeks of either treatment or placebo, undergo RCT and DNC measurements, taking 10 days, then cross-over to the alternate placebo or treatment for an additional 7 weeks, followed by a second set of RCT and DNC measurements.</detailed_description>
