	<brief_title>Study of Telintra for Treatment of Chemotherapy Induced Neutropenia in Patients With Non‑Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TLK199.2102 was a multicenter Phase 2 randomized study to determine the effect of Telintra treatment on chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) in patients with non small cell lung cancer receiving first‑line therapy with carboplatin and docetaxel. After randomization, patients in Treatment Arm 1, chemotherapy with carboplatin and docetaxel will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle, followed by Telintra at a starting dose of 3000 mg total daily dose (1500 mg orally, twice daily) on Day 2 until the absolute neutrophil count improves as confirmed by two consecutive measurement at least 24 hours apart. In Treatment Arm 2 (control arm), chemotherapy alone consisting of carboplatin and docetaxel will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle.</detailed_description>
