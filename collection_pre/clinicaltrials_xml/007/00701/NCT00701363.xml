	<criteria>The subject has given written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures The subject is male or female and is over 18 years of age The subject must have had documentation supporting the diagnosis of acromegaly, based on elevated IGF1 and/or GH levels The subject has been receiving octreotide LAR (10 or 20 mg) treatment for at least six months and is biochemically controlled. Control is defined as normal (age and sex adjusted) IGF 1 levels for two consecutive measurements (at least two months apart) preceding study entry If the subject is receiving dopamine agonist therapy, treatment should be stable for at least four months, and no change in their dopamineagonist medication is expected during the entire study period The subject has received radiation therapy to the pituitary gland before study entry The subject has a history of hypersensitivity to lanreotide or drugs with a similar chemical structure The subject has received a growth hormone receptor antagonist (pegvisomant) therapy within three months before study entry The subject has undergone treatment with any other investigational drug in the 30 days before study entry or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug, other than lanreotide 120 mg, during the course of the study The subject has received any unlicensed drug within the 30 days prior to the baseline visit or is scheduled to receive an unlicensed drug during the course of the study</criteria>
