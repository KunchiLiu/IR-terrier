	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Using Motivational Therapy and Varenicline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-infected smokers are at increased risk for life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia. To date, very little is known about the tobacco consumption characteristics of this at-risk population of smokers, but it has been well documented that they are at high risk for smoking-related co-morbidities. In addition, few effective cessation strategies have been described in HIV-infected populations. A specialized smoking cessation that combines recommendations from an existing scientifically-valid clinical guideline with Motivational Interviewing a new pharmacotherapeutic agent, may be an effective mechanism to apply to this vulnerable population of smokers. This initial, efficacy investigation has the potential to guide future treatment and research pertaining to tobacco cessation, respiratory illness and HIV.</detailed_description>
