	<brief_summary>The present trial will be performed to determine the MTD and to evaluate the efficacy of BI 2536 in the treatment of elderly patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Different schedules will be compared to identify the better dosing schedule for the further development programme of BI 2536. Dose escalation starting with the maximum tolerated dose previously determined in patients with advanced solid cancers will be performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose for AML patients.</brief_summary>
