	<detailed_description>This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Bangkok and surrounding provinces. Approximately 1500 participants were enrolled. Study staff interviewed participants on basic demographic data, health status, physical activities, food frequency and 24-hour recall. Anthropometry (body weight, height, hip and waist circumference) and physical assessment (blood pressure)were measured. Ten milliliters of venous blood was drawn by venipuncture after a 12 h overnight fast for determination of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and blood lipid concentrations (total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol). FPG was measured by the enzymatic colorimetric method with glucose oxidase.21 Total cholesterol was determined by the cholesterol oxidase method and serum triglycerides concentration was determined by standardized enzymatic procedures using glycerol phosphate oxidase assay.22, 23 HDL- cholesterol was measured by enzymatic assays.24 LDL cholesterol was calculated according to the method of Friedwald et al.25 All samples were analyzed when internal quality control met the acceptable criteria. Intra-and inter-assay CVs were 2.01% and 3.01% for FPG, 1.87% and 4.24% for total cholesterol, 0.93% and 11.6% for triacylglycerols, and 0.99% and 1.49% for HDL cholesterol, respectively.</detailed_description>
