	<brief_title>Sharing Our Strength: A Research Study for Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplant Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study for survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (also known as bone marrow transplant), which is an intensive medical treatment for cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma as well as other diseases. Because it is a physically and emotionally demanding treatment, many people report having ongoing physical and emotional difficulties after having a transplant. The Sharing Our Strength study is being conducted to help us understand people's transplant experiences and to test a new program designed to help them recover physically and emotionally after transplant. All parts of the study are completed by mail and telephone. Participants will receive compensation for their time.</detailed_description>
