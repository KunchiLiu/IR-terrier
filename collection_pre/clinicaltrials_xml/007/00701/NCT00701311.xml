	<brief_summary>Prostatitis is the most common urologic diagnosis in men under the age of 50 and the third most common diagnosis in older men. In Chronic Prostatitis (CP) or Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS), men have lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction and decreased quality of life. Little is known about the cause of CP/CPPS. Likewise, no definitive therapy exists for CP/CPPS. We plan to study the use of CC-10004 in men with CP/CPPS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study of CC-10004 for Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostatitis is the most common urologic diagnosis in men under the age of 50 and the third most common diagnosis in older men. In Chronic Prostatitis (CP) or Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS), men have lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction and decreased quality of life. Little is known about the cause of CP/CPPS. Likewise, no definitive therapy exists for CP/CPPS. Unlike bacterial prostatitis, where a clear infecting organism can be determined, CP/CPPS is not always treated with antibiotics. Due to the significant inflammatory nature of CP/CPPS, most prior therapies have focused on targeting the inflammation. CC-10004 in several studies has shown to be an inhibitor of inflammatory mediators, and may decrease the pain experienced from CP/CPPS.</detailed_description>
