	<brief_title>Clinical Application of Autologous Three-Cellular Cultured Skin Substitutes (CSS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and Objective: Permanent wound closure remains a limiting factor in the closure of extensive, full-thickness loss of substance. The aim of this work was to present our experience in the use of autologous three-cellular cultured skin substitutes (CSS) consisting of cultured keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts attached to a scaffold of hyaluronic acid. This method represents a surgical alternative in the treatment of a variety of pathologies, including burns, ulcers and giant nevi. Methods: CSS were obtained from full-thickness skin biopsies collected after enrollment of 11 patients in a study protocol approved by the local Institutional Review Boards of the "La Sapienza" University of Rome. CSS consisted of a structure characterized by the presence of a pluristratified epithelial cell surface with melanocytes (relation 1/20) and a basement of fibroblasts kept together by an esterified hyaluronic acid scaffold that can be surgically manipulated, and is gradually reabsorbed after implantation and substituted by the host connectival stroma.</detailed_description>
