	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age. 2. ECOG 0, 1, or 2. 3. Patients with Ph+ CML who have failed treatment in the core protocol. 4. Diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia with cytogenetic confirmation of Philadelphia chromosome of (9;22) translocations (presence of BCRABL a review of a minimum 20 metaphases is required). 5. Adequate end organ function as defined by: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2.5 x ULN, Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN, Serum amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN, Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless considered tumor related. 6. Patients must have the following laboratory values (≥ LLN (lower limit of normal) or corrected to within normal limits with supplements prior to the first dose of study medication.): Potassium ≥ LLN, Magnesium ≥ LLN, Phosphorus ≥ LLN, Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) ≥ LLN. Exclusion criteria: 1. Previously documented T315I mutations. 2. Impaired cardiac function including any one of the following: LVEF &lt; 45% or below the institutional lower limit of the normal range (whichever is higher) as determined by locally read echocardiogram. Inability to determine the QT interval on ECG. Complete left bundle branch block. Use of a ventricularpaced pacemaker. Congenital long QT syndrome or a known family history of long QT syndrome. History of or presence of clinically significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmias.</criteria>
