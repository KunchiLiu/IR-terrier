	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure concentrations of Raltegravir in cerebrospinal fluid. The hypotheses are: - Raltegravir concentrations in CSF will be measurable - Raltegravir concentrations in CSF will remain constant, while plasma concentrations vary widely leading to highly variable CSF-to-plasma ratios. - Following at least 4 weeks of Raltegravir-containing combination therapy, HIV RNA levels in CSF will be below 50 copies/mL in all subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Enrollment in a raltegravir parent protocol at UCSD. Willing to undergo lumbar puncture. Able to give informed consent. If cognitively impaired, a test will be administered to ensure adequate comprehension of the consent document and procedure. Relative or absolute contraindication to lumbar puncture, such as current coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelets&lt;50,000/ÂµL), hemophilia, or use of anticoagulant medication. Psychiatric disease that would interfere with study participation, in the opinion of the investigator. No major opportunistic infections within 30 days. Moderate or severe cognitive impairment. The proposed study does not have a neuropsychological objective.</criteria>
