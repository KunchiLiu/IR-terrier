	<brief_summary>This investigation is designed to assess the immediate and long-term angiographic patency outcomes of excimer laser recanalisation followed by PTA in the treatment of long (&gt;50 mm) infrapopliteal lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) The Spectranetics Turbo elite™ excimer laser catheters are percutaneous intravascular devices constructed of multiple optical fibers around a guidewire lumen. The laser catheters transmit ultraviolet energy from the Spectranetics CVX-300® Excimer Laser System to the obstruction in the artery. The ultraviolet energy is delivered to the tip of the laser catheter to photo-ablate fibrous, calcific and atheromatous lesions, thus recanalizing diseased vessels.</brief_summary>
