	<brief_summary>This study is a retrospective cross-sectional study at one institution, where the investigators compared diabetic patients admitted to Medicine Services from March-April 2006 (before CPOE was implemented) to patients admitted from October-November 2007 (one year after CPOE implementation). Capillary blood glucose values, Hemoglobin AIC, diabetes medication profile and demographic data were obtained to compare between groups. The investigators hypothesized that a computer-based protocol that emphasizes basal-bolus and correctional insulin orders and excludes sliding scale, in conjunction with nursing personnel inservicing, improves outcomes.</brief_summary>
