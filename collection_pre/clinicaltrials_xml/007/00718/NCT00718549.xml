	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effect of maintenance treatment with MabThera,in comparison with a 2 year observation period (no treatment),in patients with progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have had previous first-line induction treatment with MabThera (RCC regimen).After 6 months of induction therapy with RCC (MabThera + cladribine + cyclophosphamide) patients will be randomized either to receive maintenance treatment with MabThera (375mg/m2 iv every 12 weeks, or to receive no treatment (observation only).The anticipated time on study treatment is 2+ years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
