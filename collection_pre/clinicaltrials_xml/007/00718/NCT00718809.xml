	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well saracatinib works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory thymoma or thymic cancer. Saracatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saracatinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Thymoma or Thymic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the objective response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with relapsed or refractory thymoma or thymic carcinoma treated with AZD0530. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicity of AZD0530 in these patients. II. To evaluate the progression-free survival of these patients. III. To evaluate the overall survival of these patients. IV. To evaluate the disease control rate, defined as complete response, partial response, and stable disease, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral saracatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>
