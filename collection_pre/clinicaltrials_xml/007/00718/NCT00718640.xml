	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bortezomib in participants previously treated for multiple myeloma (cancer of plasma cells in bone marrow causing numerous tumors and characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood) with limited kidney function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Bortezomib in Participants Previously Treated for Multiple Myeloma With Limited Kidney Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study conducted at multiple sites), non-comparative, single arm study of bortezomib. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (21 days before Day 1 of cycle 1); Treatment phase (consist of 8 cycles each cycle of 21 days or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity); and a Follow-up phase (for participants with positive treatment response or stable disease at the final visit). Follow-up for disease progression will be done in every 3 months up to 2 years. Participants who will experience disease progression after completing at least 2 cycles of bortezomib treatment or have no change from baseline in stable disease after completing at least 4 cycles or as per Investigator's discretion will receive dexamethasone. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of participants with renal compromised Multiple Myeloma by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria; greater than or equal to 10 percent plasma cells in the bone marrow (or tissue biopsy) detected, monoclonal protein in the serum or urine and the, presence of endorgan injury Participants with measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 5 measurements: a) serum Mprotein greater than or equal to 1 gram per deciliter (g/dl), b) Urine M Protein greater than or equal to 200 milligram per 24 hour, c) Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: Involved FLC level greater than 10 mg per dl (mg/dl) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal, d) Bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to 30 percent Participants who received at least 1 prior line of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and, is refractory to or has relapsed after the last therapy Participants with Karnofsky performance status greater than 60 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 Participants with calculated or measured creatinine clearance of less than or equal to 30 mililiter per minute (ml/min). During the screening period, 2 measures of creatinine clearance at least 7 days apart must be obtained, and both must be less than 30 ml/min Participants who had received bortezomib in previous clinical trial and best response was progressive disease or experienced one or more serious events Participants who received nitorsoureas within 6 weeks, or 2 consecutive weeks of intense corticosteroids, or immunotherapy or antibody therapy within 4 weeks before enrolment Participants with history of allergic reaction attributable to compounds containing boron or mannitol Participants with peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater intensity at the time of signing informed consent form Pregnant or breastfeeding female participants</criteria>
