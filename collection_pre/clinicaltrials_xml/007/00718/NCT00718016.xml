	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to determine whether this device is a practical and realistic means for ALS patients to operate their computers with only the use of facial, brainwave, and eye movements. This study is intended to evaluate both the complexity of the system and the degree to which complications of ALS (such as severity of involuntary movements) may interfere with the use of cyberlink.</brief_summary>
