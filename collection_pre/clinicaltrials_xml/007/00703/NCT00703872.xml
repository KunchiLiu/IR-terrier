	<brief_summary>A Phase II, Open Label, Multi-Center, Proof-Of-Concept Study determing whether treatment with HDV-Interferon (HDV-IFN), by oral or subcutaneous (injection) routes, and ribavirin results in similar efficacy [Rapid Virologic Response (RVR)] and safety as the reported efficacy and safety with pegylated alpha-interferon-2a and ribavirin (historical control) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (treatment na誰ve by oral route and non-responders by SC route respectively).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HDV-Interferon in the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Nonresponders and Naive Hepatitis C Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 ("initial part") - 4 weeks of treatment (28 days): - All patients will complete an initial 4 weeks of treatment with HDV-Interferon (HDV-IFN) (treatment na誰ve by oral route and non-responders by SC route respectively) and ribavirin. - The Part 1 of the study shall assess whether a 4-week treatment course with HDV-Interferon (HDV-IFN), orally or by subcutaneous injection, and ribavirin results similar efficacy [Rapid Virologic Response (RVR)] and safety as the reported efficacy and safety with pegylated alpha-interferon-2a and ribavirin (historical control) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (treatment na誰ve and non-responders). Part 2 ("continuation part") - 44 or 20 weeks of treatment + 24 weeks (follow-up period): - Patients with hepatitis C viral genotype 1, who achieve RVR, will be treated for another 44 weeks of therapy (to complete 48 weeks of active treatment) followed by 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up period. - Patients with hepatitis C viral genotype 3, who achieve RVR, will be treated for another 20 weeks of therapy (to complete 24 weeks of active treatment) followed by 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up period. - Follow-up period (24 weeks): Thus, in addition to treatment in Part 1 of study, each completed patient with viral genotype 1 will receive 44 weeks of therapy and 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up; and viral genotype 3 patients will have 20 weeks of therapy &amp; 24 weeks of treatment study drug free follow-up. - Overall study duration (72 or 48 weeks): Patients with viral genotype 1 will have an overall study duration of 72 weeks (48 weeks of therapy plus 24 weeks follow-up) and patients with viral genotype 3 will have an overall study duration of 48 weeks (24 weeks of therapy plus 24 weeks follow-up).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Nonresponders: Patients &gt;18 years with established chronic hepatitis C with viral genotype 1 or viral genotype 3 who have failed to respond to at least a 3month course of a pegylated interferon alpha 2a + ribavirin and have a detectable HCV RNA and baseline liver biopsy available from within the prior 12 months. Inclusion Criteria Naive: Treatment na誰ve patients &gt; 18 years, inclusive, are eligible for this study. Patients will be viral genotype 1 or viral genotype 3, have quantifiable HCVRNA &gt; 1000 IU/mL as demonstrated by PCR and an abnormal ALT (within 6 months of screening) and compensated liver disease with or without cirrhosis.
