	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial was to evaluate whether Corifollitropin Alfa treatment for the induction of multifollicular growth in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was safe for pregnant participants and their offspring. The primary endpoint was the take-home baby rate calculated as the number of participants with an ongoing pregnancy in Base Trial P05787 (NCT00696800) with at least one live born infant relative to the number of participants in the Base Trial, and to the number of participants in the Base Trial with Embryo Transfer (ET).</brief_summary>
