	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship among regional transcranial oxygen saturation (rSO2), brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbtO2) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Invasive and Non-Invasive Assessment of Cerebral Oxygenation in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experience with rsO2 assessed by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients with severe TBI is lacking. Reports about the usefulness of rSO2 are contradictory as regards its technical reliability and clinical value. Continuous time-domain analysis comparing rSO2, PbtO2 and CPP has never been carried out and the correlation among these variables remains largely unknown. A significant association between rSO2 and these clinically important variables would suggest that cerebral oximetry provides relevant data signifying that rSO2 might be a useful tool assessing cerebral oxygenation in selected patients with TBI.</detailed_description>
