	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Piperacillin/Tazobactam in Patients Treated by Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacokinetics of piperacillin/tazobactam will be evaluated in twenty septic patients with renal failure undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. This is a prospective study. Continuous replacement therapy has a continuous effect on drug elimination which could compromise effective antibiotic treatment. Patients will receive a standard course of pip/tazo 4g intravenously 8 hourly administrated immediately when CVVHDF will be started. Blood samples will be collected at 30mn, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 16h, 24h for the first and the second day. We will measure plasma piperacillin/tazobactam concentration and compare them to MICs for the whole dosing interval.</detailed_description>
