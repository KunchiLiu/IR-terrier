	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Supplements, such as folic acid, may stop or delay the development of cervical cancer in women infected with human papillomavirus. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well folic acid supplements work in preventing cancer in women infected with human papillomavirus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folic Acid Clinical Trial for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the effects of folic acid supplementation on clearance of human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and other specific types of HR-HPV and on prevention of the progression of ≤ cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 lesions (not true preneoplastic lesions) to CIN ≥ 2 (true neoplastic lesions) by conducting a 12-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with 5 mg of folic acid/day. Secondary - Evaluate whether the clearance of HPV 16 and other specific HR-HPV types and the progression of cervical lesions (≤ CIN 1 to CIN ≥ 2) is modified by lower levels of circulating and/or cervical cell folate, presence of micronuclei or global DNA hypomethylation in cervical cells, presence of integrated vs episomal HPV 16, or a high HPV 16 viral load in cervical cells at the enrollment. OUTLINE: This is a single center study. Patients are stratified according to multivitamin use (yes vs no) and smoking status (smoker vs nonsmoker). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral folic acid pill once daily for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or any other adverse effects. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or any other adverse effects. All patients complete a diet, physical activity, and a risk factor questionnaire at the enrollment visit (0-month) and at 4, 8, and 12 month visits (a total of 4 visits). Fasting blood samples for assessing circulating concentrations of micronutrients (folate, vitamins B12, A, E, C, and total carotenes) and exfoliated cervical cell samples for assessing HPV are collected at all 4 visits. Anthropometric measures are taken at all study visits. A colposcopically directed biopsy is taken at the 0-month visit and at the 12-month visit to assess the histological diagnoses of cervical lesions.</detailed_description>
