	<brief_summary>Treatment options that increase immune function, such as Osteopathic Manipulation Treatment (OMT) lymphatic techniques, may provide improved short or long term performance of the immune system. However, the efficacy of OMT to boost immune function among people living with HIV has not yet been examined in a controlled study. Our experiment is designed to examine the short (45 minutes) term impact of OMT on the white blood cells counts of HIV positive men who are either antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve or have not taken ART for at least 12 months prior to enrollment in the study.</brief_summary>

The potential causes for ribcage noncompliance include: congestive obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) spinal arthritis costochondritis congestive heart failure (CHF) pulmonary edema recent trauma to the ribcage certain connective tissue disease such as Ankylosing Spondylitis There is a risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture in participants with AAA and these participants are excluded from the study.</criteria>
