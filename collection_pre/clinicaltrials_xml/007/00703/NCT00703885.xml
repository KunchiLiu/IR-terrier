	<brief_title>PharmacofMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of Anxiolytic Medications (Alprazolam)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased amygdala and insula activity have been implicated in neurobiological models of anxiety. Using fMRI, the anxiolytic medication, lorazepam, has previously been found to decrease activation in these areas during the processing of emotional stimuli. This study aims to replicate those results but by using a different medication, alprazolam. An eventual aim of this study, in combination with future studies, is to evaluate the utility of fMRI as a tool to identify anxiolytic function in both established and novel compounds that may be used to treat anxiety.</detailed_description>
