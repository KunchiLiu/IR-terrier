	<brief_title>Pilot Study:Role of Dietary Fiber in PCOS Anovulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that 6 months of fiber supplementation will improve ovulation in women with PCOS by improving insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss. In this pilot study, we will determine the feasibility of conducting a larger double-blind, randomized trial in women with PCOS to test this hypothesis. We will evaluate 15 women over a 10-month period, starting with a 4-month intervention-free observation period to determine the effect on ovulation of adding up to 22g/day of fiber supplementation to their usual weight-maintenance diets (to achieve 28-36 g fiber/day assuming baseline dietary fiber intake, could feasibly be translated into clinical practice.</detailed_description>
