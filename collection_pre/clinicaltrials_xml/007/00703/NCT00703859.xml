	<brief_summary>This is a study to see whether radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (Temozolomide) plus Dichloroacetate (DCA) improves overall survival and offers better control of the disease in patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combining Radiotherapy and Temozolomide With Dichloroacetate in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumours, once consented to the study, would undergo standard treatment of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (TMZ) with DCA in pill form (twice a day) during the radiation phase of the study and then with TMZ for six months after. Other elements of the clinical trial include pharmacokinetics and MGMT genetic testing.</detailed_description>
