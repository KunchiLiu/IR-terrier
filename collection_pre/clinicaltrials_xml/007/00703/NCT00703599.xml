	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes Mellitus is of large epidemic proportions worldwide. It is proliferating at such a fast rate that new novel drugs and other therapeutic approaches are required. The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to determine whether the intravenous administration of activated adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction as a single procedure is safe and efficacious in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Patients will be observed over 12 months following the procedure, with 2 weeks, 1 month and tri-monthly diagnostics and life style questionaires.</detailed_description>
