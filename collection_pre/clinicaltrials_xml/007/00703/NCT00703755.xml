With 3 of the following 5 criteria, including at least 2 biochemical abnormalities (glucose and one lipid abnormality) And having signed a written informed consent (at inclusion V1). known Type 1 diabetes, or treated type 2 diabetes [25], [26]; wth HbA1c &gt; 8 % [27] at the first blood sample; body mass index (BMI) &gt; 45 kg/m2; females who were not surgically sterilized or not using adequate contraceptive or not using adequate contraceptive precautions or not postmenopausal pregnant or lactating women; known hypersensitivity to fibrates; known hypersensitivity to metformin chlorhydrate; known abnormal thyroid hormone levels, or high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level; having received an investigational drug in the last 30 days before the date of randomization; unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol; likely to withdraw from the study before its completion; treated with some concomitant medications: reporting a change within the last 6 weeks before randomization and during the study in the medications that could interfere with the lipid profile (i.e., antihypertensive drugs, oral corticosteroids, thyroid hormones, retinoids, thiazidic derivatives, hormone replacement therapies); presenting with the following disease or conditions: chronic respiratory insufficiency, patient with medical device for sleep apnea; current chronic pancreatitis, or identified risk or known history of acute pancreatitis; hepatic insufficiency, acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism; known cholelithiasis without cholecystectomy; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 times the upper limit normal (ULN); musculoskeletal disease or increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) &gt; 3 times the ULN; renal failure or renal dysfunction defined by serum creatinine levels &gt; 135 μmol/L in males and &gt; 110 μmol/L in females [28]; acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as dehydration, severe infection, shock or intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents; acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as cardiac or respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction (within 3 months prior to randomization), shock; known gastric or peptic ulcer or intestinal disease within the previous 3 months of randomization capable of modifying the intestinal absorption of the drugs; any other severe pathology such as cancer, mental illness, etc., which in the opinion of the investigator might pose a risk to the patient or confound the results of the study</criteria>
