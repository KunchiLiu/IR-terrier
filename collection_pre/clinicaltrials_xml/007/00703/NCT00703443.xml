	<brief_title>The Genetics of Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to explore the causes and inheritances of cardiomyopathies. Cardiomyopathies are serious medical conditions that result in a wide range of cardiac problems, from no symptoms at all to heart failure. The underlying genetics of cardiomyopathies are poorly understood. This study will collect personal, family, and medical history information to create a database of participants with cardiomyopathies. This information will be used to identify inheritance patterns within families with cardiomyopathies. In addition, samples from participants will be studied in the lab to see if any changes in their genetic information can be identified that would cause a cardiomyopathy. Overall, the research study is aimed at determining the cause of these cardiac conditions so that tests and treatments might be developed in the future.</detailed_description>
