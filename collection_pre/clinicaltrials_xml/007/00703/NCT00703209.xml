	<brief_summary>The UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas would like to give you information about a research study that is being done for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy and have not responded to medical treatment. Doctors from the departments of Internal Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Neurology, Pain Management and Plastic Surgery are conducting a research study to examine the effects of nerve decompression on decreasing the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and increasing the sensation at the bottom of the foot.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Role of Decompression of Lower Extremity Nerves for the Treatment of Patients With Symptomatic Diabetic Neuropathy With Chronic Nerve Compression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dr. Shai Rozen, is working with physicians from Internal Medicine, Neurology, and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation to conduct a clinical study on patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Specifically, regarding the efficacy of peripheral nerve decompression in the lower extremity in a select group of patients which may have superimposed nerve compression in addition to their diabetic neuropathy. Initial data supports success rates at around 80% in terms of significant alleviation of pain and restoration of at least protective sensation and long term follow ups have suggested decrease in prevalence of infections, ulcerations, and amputations. Potential candidates for the study are patients who have symptomatic painful diabetic neuropathy who have not responded to medical treatment (glucose control, pain medications)and continue to have severe pain. It is thought today that one third of patients with diabetic neuropathy may have superimposed nerve compression in the nerves in the leg, or in other words the nerves may be pressed by the surrounding tissue. This nerve compression is what might be contributing to the pain, and often loss of sensation at the bottom of your feet. The principle is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome which is pressure of a nerve in the wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome is seen in 14-30% of patients with diabetes compared to 2% in the general population. This study involves one year of close care and follow-up. As a part of this study, you will have regular evaluations by a foot care specialist from Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, receive glucose management tips from a Diabetic Nurse Educator, and also have specialized, non-invasive testing in the Neurology department. The care that you would receive for being a part of this study is highly exceptional due to the various departments involved and their dedication to this research. Initial data supports success rates at around 80% in terms of significant alleviation of pain and restoration of at least protective sensation and long term follow ups have suggested decrease in prevalence of infections, ulcerations, and amputations. Potential candidates for the study are patients who have symptomatic painful diabetic neuropathy who have not responded to medical treatment (glucose control, pain medications) for at least one year and continue to have severe pain. Dr. Shai Rozen is the principal investigator on this study, and Julia Kalayanamit is the clinical coordinator. We are both very happy to speak with you if you would like more information about the study, including appointments, scheduling and visit activities.</detailed_description>
