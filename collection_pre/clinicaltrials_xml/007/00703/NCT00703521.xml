	<brief_summary>Background. The World Health Organization recommends pre-exposure vaccination (PreP) to protect children living in canine rabies endemic countries. Including PreP in national childhood immunization programs (EPI) is a viable option. Methods. In an open-label phase II clinical trial, 200 healthy toddlers were randomized to receive Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV) in a 3-dose Full-IM (1mL), Half-IM (0.5mL), 3-ID (0.1mL), or a 2-dose 2-ID (0.1mL) regimen, all in combination with two doses of Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), or JEV alone. One booster dose of PCECV (IM or ID) and JEV, or JEV alone was administered concomitantly one year after primary vaccination. Safety was evaluated after each injection. Blood was drawn on days 0 and 49, one year later prior to booster and on days 7 and 28 post-booster, and at two and three years post primary vaccination. All sera were analyzed for rabies and JE virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA, JEVNA).</brief_summary>
