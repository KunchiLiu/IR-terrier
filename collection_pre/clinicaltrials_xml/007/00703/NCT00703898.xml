	<brief_summary>Although nevirapine is used as an alternative to efavirenz for initial regimen in developed countries, nevirapine has still been a key antiretroviral drug in many resource-limited countries including Thailand due to its accessibility and affordability. In addition, a component of stavudine and lamivudine is still widely used as a backbone in the antiretroviral regimen in this setting.To date, data on the durability of a regimen of stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine are very limited, particularly from the resource-limited settings.</brief_summary>
