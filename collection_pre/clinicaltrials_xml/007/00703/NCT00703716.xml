	<brief_title>Stabilization of Trochanteric Fracture Using a Screw-plate TRAUMAX</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fractures are a serious public health problem. The current incidence is projected to increase fourfold worldwide by the year 2050. This affliction is obviously linked to the aging of the population and the absence of a systematic prevention of osteoporosis. This leads to the creation of a minimally invasive, or ever percutaneous, implantable osteosynthesis material which associates : - the well-known reliability of osteosynthesis using screw-plate with barrel, - the safety of the fixation with Surfix concept, locking the screws to the plate using lock-screws, - a modularity thanks to the choice between 3 sizes of barrel, - the creation of a simple material, easing the operative surgery by minimally invasive approach. The TRAUMAX answers to all those characteristics.</detailed_description>
