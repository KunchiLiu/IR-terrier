	<detailed_description>Diabetes Mellitus is of large epidemic proportions worldwide. It is proliferating at such a fast rate that new novel drugs and other therapeutic approaches are required. The purpose of this Phase 1/Phase 2 study is to determine whether the intavenous administration of activated adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction as a single procedure is safe to and can benefit the disease pathology of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (insulin resistance). Patients will be observed over 12 months following the procedure, with a 2 week, 1 month and then tri monthly diagnostics and life style questionaires.</detailed_description>
