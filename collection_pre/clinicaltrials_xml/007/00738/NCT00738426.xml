	<brief_title>Study of Low Level Laser Therapy for Body Contouring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss and body contouring are large, constantly-growing fields of cosmetic surgery. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) statistics, more than 324,000 liposuction procedures, 233,000 eyelid surgeries and 114,000 facelift procedures were performed in 2004 in the United States alone. However, while the demand for body shaping procedures is constantly on the rise, so is the demand for such procedures to be performed more quickly, simply and most importantly, less invasively. Cosmetic surgery patients are no longer satisfied with procedures that require general anesthesia, pose a multitude of potentially serious risks and complications and that require several weeks of recovery time. Hence the growing popularity of non- to minimally-invasive cosmetic surgery procedures. In 2005, more than 7.5 million minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures were performed, a 35% increase from 2000. Consequently, patients and physicians alike are continually searching for non-invasive alternatives to traditional cosmetic procedures such as liposuction that are efficient, safe and effective.</detailed_description>
