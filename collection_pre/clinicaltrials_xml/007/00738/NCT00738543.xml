	<brief_summary>The investigators have few options for skin antisepsis. Alternatives for povidone-iodine, which is the most commonly used agent, are costly or ineffective. To have more options, this study is needed. The investigators want to know if there are difference between the use of 10% sodium hypochlorite or 10% povidone-iodine for skin antisepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Povidone-iodine Against Sodium Hypochlorite as Skin Antiseptics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sodium hypochlorite at 10% has been widely used as antiseptic in patients on dialysis as well as for irrigation of wounds and burns. Since it has been used successfully in caring for the exit site of hemodialysis catheters, it is reasonable to propose its use for the insertion and care of central intravascular catheters, as well as for skin preparation before surgery. Alternatives for povidone-iodine, which is the agent most commonly used, are costly or ineffective. To have more options, this study is needed to know if 10% sodium hypochlorite is similar to the most common option for skin antisepsis.</detailed_description>
