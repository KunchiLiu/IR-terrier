	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose level of lenalidomide combined with fludarabine/rituximab in the therapy of patients with previously untreated CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Following a dose escalation phase lenalidomide will be given at the pre-determined maximum tolerated dose in combination with rituximab to further determine the efficacy and tolerability of this regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Dose Escalation Combined With Rituximab/Fludarabine in Untreated CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase I/II study in patients with previously untreated CD20-positive CLL. Phase I of the study will evaluate the maximal tolerated lenalidomide dose level in combination with fludarabine/rituximab chemoimmunotherapy in 10 patients. Phase II will determine efficacy using the combination in the previously defined maximal tolerated dose. Both phases will be followed by a maintenance phase evaluating the tolerability and possibility to further improve response quality.</detailed_description>
