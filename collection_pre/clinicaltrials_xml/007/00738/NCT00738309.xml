	<criteria>Patient age &lt; 21 years Male or female Diagnosis of classical Scheuermann's Kyphosis (3 successive vertebrae wedged 5 degrees or more, +/ end plate deformities) or idiopathic structural Kyphosis (rigid structural kyphosis without classic Scheuermann's Kyphosis findings). for which surgical treatment is recommended to prevent progression of the curvature or to correct trunk deformity (unacceptable cosmesis) any deformity magnitude. OR for which surgical treatment is not being undertaken (and alternate treatment, i.e. bracing, or observation) is being pursued for any curve magnitude of clinical concerns of Scheuermann's Kyphosis. Inclusion Criteria for Anterior Release (for those surgeons performing anterior release surgery): Deformity magnitude = any degree and any other criteria defined by the individual surgeon. Posterior disc herniation is not an exclusion criteria from being in the study, only from being in the Posterior surgery group these patients will be defaulted to Ant/Post Surgery. Only patients that have had a preop MRI performed as a part of their routine care, should be included in this study. Previous operated Kyphosis, Scoliosis or Spondylolisthesis Neuromuscular comorbidity Post laminectomy kyphosis</criteria>
