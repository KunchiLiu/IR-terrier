	<brief_title>Safety Study of Surgical Technique to Treat Acute Dorsal Trans-Scaphoid Perilunate Dislocations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open reduction and internal fixation is an effective method of treating acute trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocations. We study a new surgical technique that allows for early wrist excises postoperatively. We compare this technique to Inoue et al. 's techniques affect the objective and subjective outcomes. We also compared the long-term outcomes of these two procedures performed in similar patient groups.Although both groups had satisfactory results with regard to their pain relief, sufficient grip strength and union of scaphoid fracture, the technique using in group I was more easily and quickly to perform. It allows early postoperative excises and results better functional wrist range of motion.</detailed_description>
