	<brief_summary>It is reported that sivelstat improved and preserved the postoperative renal function in the orthopedic management. Moreover because sivelstat reduced the migration of neutrophil, it improved acute lung injury. During liver resection, Pringle maneuver, clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament, was performed. Pringle maneuver causes reperfusion injury of the liver. We have a hypothesis that sivelstat prevent the warm shock of reperfusion injury of the liver by Pringle maneuver.</brief_summary>
