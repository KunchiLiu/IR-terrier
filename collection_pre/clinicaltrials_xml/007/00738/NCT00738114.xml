	<brief_summary>High blood glucose levels in surgical patients with and without diabetes are associated with increased risk of medical complications and death. Over the short-term, high blood glucose can adversely affect fluid balance, impair immunologic response to infection, and promote inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (blood vessel function). Blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy in patients with critical illness (very sick patients in intensive care unit) reduces the risk of multiorgan failure and systemic infections, and decreases short- and long-term mortality. High blood glucose has also been associated with poor outcome in non-critically ill patients admitted to general surgical and medical wards; however, intensive glycemic control is not aggressively pursued because of fear of hypoglycemia. A computerized search of biomedical journal literature from MEDLINE, PubMed, and Ovid from 1966 to 2008 provided very little information on the prevalence and outcome of high blood glucose during the perioperative period (before and after surgery) in non-critically ill patients. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of high blood glucose, in large number of subjects with and without diabetes, during general (non-cardiac) surgery.</brief_summary>
