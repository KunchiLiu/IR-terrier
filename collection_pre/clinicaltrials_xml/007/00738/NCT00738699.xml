	<brief_summary>The study is being conducted to find out if paclitaxel works better when given together with an experimental drug called MORAb-003 (farletuzumab) or alone in patients with platinum-resistant or refractory relapsed ovarian cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of MORAb-003 in Platinum-Resistant or Refractory Relapsed Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety was assessed by the monitoring and recording of all adverse events (AEs), including drug hypersensitivity adverse events (DHAE), and serious adverse events (SAEs); clinical laboratory test (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); tolerability (discontinuations, treatment delays, dose reductions); physical examinations (including vital signs assessment); 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) obtained in triplicate and reviewed by independent blinded cardiologist, and Karnofsky's performance status.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube malignancies, measurable by CT or MRI scan assessed within 4 weeks prior to study entry Must have evidence of relapse by CA125 (2xUpper Limit of Normal) or radiographically within 6 months of most recent platinumcontaining chemotherapy. At least one of the lines of chemotherapy must have included a taxane. Must have been treated with debulking surgery and at least one line platinumbased chemotherapy; Subjects may have received up to four additional lines of chemotherapy after they developed platinumresistance. Subjects must be candidate for repeat paclitaxel treatment Clinical contraindications to use of paclitaxel, which include: 1. persistent Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy 2. prior hypersensitivity reaction that persisted despite rechallenge with or without desensitization or resulted in bronchospasm or hemodynamic instability or was at least Grade 2 and resulted in medication discontinuation Current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas). Note: EOC with prior diagnosis of a low malignant potential tumor that has been surgically resected is acceptable provided the subject did Prior radiation therapy is excluded with the exception that it is allowable only if measurable disease for ovarian cancer is completely outside the radiation portal Known allergic reaction to a prior monoclonal antibody therapy or have any documented human antihuman antibody (HAHA). Previous treatment with MORAb003 (farletuzumab).</criteria>
