	<brief_title>A Follow-up Assessment of Resistance to ABT-333 in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-Infected Subjects Who Have Received ABT-333 in ABT-333 Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2, multicenter study was conducted in HCV-infected participants who received ABT-333 at any dose level or matching placebo in a prior clinical study involving ABTâˆ’333. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who received ABT-333 at any dose level or matching placebo in Study M10-351 Substudy 2 (NCT00696904; ABT-333 dosing duration was 2 days) and Study M10-380 (NCT00851890; ABT-333 dosing duration was 28 days) were eligible. After receiving at least 1 dose of ABT-333 or placebo, subjects were assessed for participation in this rollover study and asked to review the informed consent. The day of study completion or early discontinuation from the prior ABT-333 clinical study served as the baseline assessment. If it was found that a participant received placebo during the previous ABT-333 clinical study, the sites were instructed to discontinue the participant from this study. This study included approximately monthly blood sample collection procedures for 48 weeks, and no treatment was provided during this time.</detailed_description>
