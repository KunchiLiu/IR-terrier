	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if Metanx improves sensory neuropathy in persons with Type 2 diabetes. Metanx is a medical food available with a prescription from a physician. It consists of L-methylfolate, Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and Methylcobalamin, which are the active forms of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, respectively. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Metanx or placebo for 6 months.</brief_summary>
