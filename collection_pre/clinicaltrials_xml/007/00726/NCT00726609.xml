	<brief_title>Post-marketing Surveillance Study of Invasive Mycosis With Posaconazole (Study P04641)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data regarding demographics, underlying disease, prior fungal infection, prior antifungal medication, invasive fungal infection signs &amp; symptoms, concomitant medication, posaconazole use, tolerability, safety and therapy outcome will be collected on abstracted electronic Case Report Forms. This surveillance study was originally limited to subjects receiving posaconazole as salvage antifungal therapy as indicated. A subgroup of subjects at risk for invasive fungal infection was included for prophylactic treatment following the enlargement of the marketing authorization for NOXAFIL® (posaconazole) during the course of the study. These participants only contributed data for the assessment of safety.</detailed_description>
