	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether aprepitant blocks the opiate reward system in non-dependent opiate abusers, indicating its potential as a safe, non-addictive first line therapy for early heroin abuse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ability of Aprepitant to Block Opioid Reward in Non-Dependent Opiate Abusers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This initial proof-of-concept study focuses on evaluating whether an NK1 antagonist, aprepitant, can block opiate reward in non-dependent opiate experienced volunteers in response to a standard opiate challenge. Sixty subjects will be included in a randomized controlled study. Following a training challenge session, they will receive 1 week treatment with aprepitant or matching placebo, followed by a challenge session during which subjective and physiological responses to the opiate partial agonist buprenorphine will be assessed.</detailed_description>
