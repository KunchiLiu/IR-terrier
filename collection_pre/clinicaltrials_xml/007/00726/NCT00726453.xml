	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.25 mm to 4.2 mm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Medtronic RESOLUTE US Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is comprised of four studies: the 2.25 mm - 3.5 mm main study (1242 patients), the 2.25 mm - 3.5 mm Angio/IVUS sub-study (100 patients), the 4.0 mm sub-study (60 patients), and the 38 mm Length Sub-study (114 patients). A patient's inclusion in a given study is dependent on the size (diameter or length) of the stent(s) the patient receives.</detailed_description>
