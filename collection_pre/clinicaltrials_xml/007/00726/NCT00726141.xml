	<brief_summary>Despite rising smoker rates, particularly in girls and young women, only few studies have focused on smoking cessation in young smokers. Gynaecologist practices may be an ideal setting to proactively intervene with young female smokers. Elevated health risks of smoking while using hormonal contraceptives could be a successful approach to gain young women's attention on smoking cessation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention for girls and young women visiting gynaecologist practices and using hormonal contraceptives.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brief Interventions on Smoking for Hormonal Contraceptive Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the randomized controlled trial, female smokers aged 14-25 will be recruited in practices of gynaecologists. Intervention within the practice consists of a 30 minutes counseling session based on Motivational Interviewing, a standardised physician letter focusing on the elevated health risks of smoking while using hormonal contraceptives and a stage-matched self-help manual. After four weeks, an expert system feedback letter will be sent. In the intervention group, no smoking intervention will be given. Follow-up assessments will be conducted after 12 months, including saliva cotinine measures.</detailed_description>
