	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of genetic and environmental parameters on racial/ethnic differences in aspects of insulin secretion and action. The genetic component will be modeled by estimating the degree of European genetic admixture (ADM) obtained from approximately 50 ancestry informative markers (AIMs). The environmental components will be modeled by measuring energy intake (food intake), energy expenditure (physical activity) and socioeconomic status.</brief_summary>
