	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test a new method for diagnosing and monitoring Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia, which is a major killer among ICU patients. The method requires analysis of a small amount of the patient's blood for concentration of a hormone called Procalcitonin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Procalcitonin Study in the Management of Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the onset/progress/resolution of pneumonia and the levels of Procalcitonin, a prohormone whose concentrations fluctuate in response to bacterial infection.</detailed_description>
