	<brief_summary>The "Capteur Evadiac" study group, composed of French and Belgian diabetologists, has designed a 1 year randomized controlled multicenter study in order to define what should be the best clinical way of using continuous glucose monitoring in the long term to improve metabolic control in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Are the Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems Able to Improve Long Term Glycaemic Control in Type 1 Diabetic Patients?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to determine whether patients with chronically poor glycaemic control as evidenced by HbA1c &gt;= 8% twice can achieve improved metabolic control using during one year CGM together with educative program about insulin adaptation doses compared to conventional self monitoring finger sticks with educative program about insulin adaptation doses alone.</detailed_description>
