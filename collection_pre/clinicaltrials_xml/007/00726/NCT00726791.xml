	<brief_summary>Chronic somatoform pain is common in psychiatric patients. Chronic somatoform pain causes significant distress and disrupts social functioning. Moreover, chronic somatoform pain often does not sufficiently respond to medication. Chronic somatoform pain is associated with medial pain system. The medial pain system is comprised of structures engaged in affect and motivation, such as medial thalamus and limbic structures. The medial pain system gets inhibitory control from motor cortex. Functional neuroimaging studies indicate that chronic somatoform pain is associated with hypoactivity of motor cortex, defective inhibitory process, and hyperactivity of medial pain system. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and non-invasive tool to modulate neurophysiologic activity of the focal brain. Therefore, pain relief by rTMS can be obtained from motor cortex stimulation, restoration of defective inhibitory process, and deactivation of medial pain system. Studies have shown that motor cortex stimulation using rTMS can relieve pain in patients with neuropathic pain. However, to our knowledge, there is no rTMS study on chronic somatoform pain in psychiatric patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of motor cortex rTMS on chronic somatoform pain.</brief_summary>
