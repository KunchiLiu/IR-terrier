	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Zidovudine 300 mg Tablets, USP Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, single dose, two way crossover study was conducted with up to 32 healthy, male and female adult subjects to compare two Zidovudine 300 mg tablet formulations under fasting conditions. In each period one x 300 mg tablet was administered to fasting subjects. Subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period. The order of the treatment administration was as per the dosing randomization schedule. Each dose was separated by at least a 7 day interval. A total of thirty two (32) subjects (23 males and 9 females) were enrolled for the study, of which only twenty eight (28) subjects completed the clinical portion of the study.</detailed_description>
