	<brief_summary>The trial is a single-center randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo and positive controlled, parallel group clinical trial. This trial investigated whether NOMAC-E2 (Org 10486 -0 + Org 2317), a new combined hormonal contraceptive, has potential to delay cardiac repolarization. The primary measure of cardiac repolarization in this trial is the Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF). QTcF represents the duration of ventricular depolarization and subsequent repolarization. A delay in cardiac repolarization creates an electrophysiological environment that favors the development of cardiac arrhythmias, most clearly torsade de pointes (TdP), but possibly other ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The primary aim of this study is to investigate, if the administration of a therapeutic (2.5/1.5 mg) or supra-therapeutic (higher than required for treatment: 12.5/7.5 mg) dose of NOMAC-E2 administered over a period of 14 days will prolong the mean QTcF interval to values above the accepted threshold of regulatory concern. In addition, a single dose of moxifloxacin will be administered in order to prove that sensitivity of the applied assay is sufficient to detect the prolongation of the QTcF-interval. Secondary aims of this study are to evaluate the relation between concentrations of NOMAC (therapeutic and supra-therapeutic) after steady state has been reached in the subject's body, the time matched change in Estradiol E1 and E2 in relation to baseline and the QTcF intervals after multiple dose administration of NOMAC-E2. Finally, the safety and tolerability of different treatments are investigated. A total of 189 subjects will participate in this trial. The entire study duration is about 9 weeks with a 4-week screening period, 14-day treatment period and a follow-up period of about 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
