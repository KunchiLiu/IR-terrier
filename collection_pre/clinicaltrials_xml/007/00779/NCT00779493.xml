	<brief_summary>Evidence exists to support low-grade inflammation as the inciting factor leading to visceral hypersensitivity and alteration in motility in irritable bowel syndrome.In the medical literature,there is ample in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting turmeric and its derivative curcumin as an antitumor, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent. We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded, parallel treatment study evaluating the effects of turmeric on the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.</brief_summary>
