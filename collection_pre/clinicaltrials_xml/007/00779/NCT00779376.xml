	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Zidovudine 300 mg Tablets, USP Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open label, randomized, single dose, 2-way crossover, comparative bioavailability study performed on 68 healthy adult volunteers. In each period, subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 12 hour blood draw. Single oral dose 300 mg Zidovudine doses were separated by a washout period of 7 days. A total of sixty-eight (68) healthy adult subjects (29 males and 39 females) were enrolled in the study, of which sixty five (65) subjects (29 males and 36 females) completed the clinical portion of the study.</detailed_description>
