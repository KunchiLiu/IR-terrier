	<brief_summary>This trial will use a new method of treating lymphoma using a therapy derived from a person's Killer T cells. These Killer T cells are taken from a person's blood and grown in a test tube to increase the number of these cells that are specifically active against the lymphoma cells. The cells are then given to the patient by intravenous infusion with the aim of killing the lymphoma cells. Potentially this treatment will help to kill the residual/recurrent tumour that is present after other lymphoma treatment and reduce the chance of the tumour recurring.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent. EBVpositive lymphoma as determined by in situ hybridization or equivalent (excluding Burkitts Lymphoma). Age 18 years or older. ECOG performance status 1, 2 or 3 Life expectancy of at least 6 months. Measurable disease: either relapsing, partially responsive, refractory or progressive disease, includes disease detected either by clinical examination, radiographic evaluation (including CT scans, and at physician's discretion by functional imaging), or a persistently detectable plasma EBV viral load. No chemotherapy / radiotherapy and/or antibody therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to anticipated date of first infusion. EBV negative tumour Presence of detectable malignant cells in the peripheral circulation by flow cytometry or morphology Serious infection within the past 28 days that has not adequately responded to therapy Pregnancy, or unwilling to use adequate contraception Serology (taken within 3 months of CTL release date) indicating active HBV or HCV infection, positive serology for HIV I&amp;II, HTLV1 or syphilis Negative serology for EBV Psychiatric, addictive or any condition which may compromise the ability to participate in this trial</criteria>
