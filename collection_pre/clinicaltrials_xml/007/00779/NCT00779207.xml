	<brief_title>Effect of Weight Loss and Exercise on Liver and Muscle Fat in Obese Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity causes serious medical complications and impairs quality of life. Moreover, both aging and obesity cause metabolic and physical dysfunction. The primary objectives of the proposed research are to evaluate the independent and combined effects of weight loss and exercise on Intrahepatic and Intramyocellular fat in obese elderly men and women. The central hypothesis is that in obese elderly subjects, weight loss will improve metabolic and physical function while the addition of exercise will not only augment improvement in these outcomes, but also attenuate the adverse effects of weight loss on bone and muscle masses. To test this hypothesis, 20 elderly (65-85 years old) obese men and women (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 30 kg/m2) with physical frailty will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: 1)10% weight loss, 2) 10% weight loss plus exercise training.</detailed_description>
