	<brief_summary>Multiple pathways including peripheral and central hormones and neurotransmitters are involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight. One of the most studied pathways involves the melanocortin receptor. Agouti-related protein (AgRP) and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alphaMSH)have been shown to play an integral role in food intake and body weight. It is reasonable to speculate that if there is an imbalance of alphaMSH and AgRP exist in obese individuals and inhibiting the activity of AgRP may be of therapeutic benefit in treating obesity.</brief_summary>
