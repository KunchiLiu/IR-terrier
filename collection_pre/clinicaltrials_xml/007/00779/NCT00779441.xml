	<detailed_description>This was a single-center, randomized, open label, two-way cross over study conducted under non-fasting conditions. Subjects checked into the clinical facility the day prior to dosing at least 10 hours prior to dose administration. On study day 1, subjects were dosed with single oral dose (1x10mg tablet) of the test and reference products thirty minutes after initiation of a standardized, high fat breakfast which was preceded by an overnight fast. Following a seven day wash out period, subjects returned and were dosed with an alternative treatment as per randomization Thirty-six (N=36) volunteers were enrolled in the study of which 17 were females and 19 were males.
