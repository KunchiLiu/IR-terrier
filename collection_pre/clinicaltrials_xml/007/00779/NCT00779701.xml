	<brief_summary>Glycemic control can be safely achieved in surgical and medical intensive care unit settings and has been shown to improve short and long-term clinical outcomes. As such, insulin infusion protocols are routinely used in the ICU setting. The investigators plan to establish the use of strict glycemic control in a heterogenous group of acutely ill patients in the ED setting. The investigators propose to study the aspects of implementing a strict glycemic control protocol in the ED.</brief_summary>
