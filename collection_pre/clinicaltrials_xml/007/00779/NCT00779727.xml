	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial assessing the benefit of cesarean wound drainage in pregnant women at increased risk of hemorrhage.

Outcome measures were difference between preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, postoperative fever, cumulative opiate dose adjusted to body weight, length of stay and operation time.
