	<brief_title>Determination of Lysine Requirement in the Parenterally Fed Neonate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is important to identify the appropriate level of lysine requirements for parenterally fed neonates as this amino acid is the limiting amino acid in the diet of neonates. Feeding lysine at requirement improves the likelihood that other amino acids will be utilized appropriately for building proteins. In addition, lysine plays a major role in calcium absorption, development of muscle proteins and in the production of hormones, enzymes and antibodies. We believe that the lysine requirement will be 158 mg/kg/day which is significantly lower than the current 267 and 327 mg/kg/d that is found in the current Trophamine and Primene parenteral solutions.</detailed_description>
