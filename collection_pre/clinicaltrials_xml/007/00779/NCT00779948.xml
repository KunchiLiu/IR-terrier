	<brief_title>Dynamic Internal Fixation of Femoral Neck Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two implant systems are mainly used for internal fixation: canulated screws and plate-screw-systems. Regarding the latter, the dynamic hip screw systems (DHS)represent the most frequently used devices. Targon FN (Aesculap) is a new plate-screw system and available on the market since 2007. In contrast to the DHS, which uses only one telescrew, the Targon FN provides up to four telescrews. With this registry, we want to evaluate the results of Targon FN compared with DHS systems.</detailed_description>
