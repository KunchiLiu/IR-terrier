	<brief_title>Case Management Alternatives for African American Women at High Risk for HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is fundamentally concerned with the implementation and evaluation of theoretically-based, culturally appropriate case management interventions targeting individual, social and environmental factors among highly vulnerable African American women. The research is designed to test innovative, comprehensive approaches to HIV prevention/intervention through case management driven service linkage and engagement. Testing new approaches to intervention with African-American women at high risk for HIV addresses a particularly urgent public health need in Miami, as well as other large metropolitan areas, where officials continue to document epidemic rates of HIV/AIDS clustered in urban, impoverished African-American communities. Comparison: Participants will be randomly assigned to: a Strengths-Based / Professional Only Condition in which clients participate in a "strengths-based" case management approach; or, a Strengths-Based / Professional/Peer Condition in which a team composed of: a) a credentialed, professional case manager and b) a recovering addict peer - both trained in "strengths-based" case management techniques - develop and facilitate the implementation of a service plan.</detailed_description>
