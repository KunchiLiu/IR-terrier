	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Dysfunction, Q4-Atomoxetine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to see if the drug atomoxetine (Strattera) has effects on the body's ability to defend itself against low blood sugar. Normally, when blood sugar levels drop below normal, the body creates a series of responses, which increase the sugar inside the body to bring blood sugar levels back to normal. The hormone epinephrine is a key defense against low blood sugar in people with diabetes. Atomoxetine has been shown to increase this hormone level. Thus, any approaches to increase levels of this key defense during low blood sugar may have great value.</detailed_description>
