	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigation is to determine the relationship of core stability to core proprioception</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPARQ and Core Proprioception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As no previous research has been reported correlating the SPARQtm method of athletic performance with the McGill Side Bridge test and core joint position error, this study is designed as a pilot. The subject's core stability will be measured with the SPARQtm method of athletic performance and the McGill Side Bridge test for core stability. Core proprioception will be determined using the standard test for proprioception, Joint Position Error (JPE) testing, with the Skill Technologies motion capture device. All participants will receive the SPARQtm method of athletic performance testing, the McGill Side Bridge test for core stability and the core joint position error tests twice, one week apart.</detailed_description>
