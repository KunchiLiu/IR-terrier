	<brief_summary>OPTIMON will compare the efficacy and the cost of two monitoring strategies: one based on the classic standards of quality assurance, and the other one being a priori "optimized" on the main scientific and regulatory principles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimisation of Monitoring for Clinical Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no validated standard of monitoring strategy for clinical research studies. Optimon will compare two monitoring strategies - a classical strategy based on the practices of the pharmaceutical industry, and an optimized strategy based on patient's risk level - on their ability to produce exact data, focusing on the main quality criteria: regulatory requirements and scientific validity of results. Optimon is a non inferiority randomized trial.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Clinical Research Studies: risk level A, B, or C in the Optimon riskassessment scale, with or without a sponsor and the advice of an ethical committee, starting in 2008 and ending before the end of 2010, with a foreseen accrual of 20 patients or more, multicentric with at least 4 clinical sites, with a paper or electronic CRF, with the participating agreement of the coordinating investigator and the sponsor. Clinical sites: Sites with a foreseen accrual of 5 patients at least, with the participating agreement of the principal investigator. Clinical Research Units: with the label of an institution, with at least 2 years of experience in multicentric studies, with SOPs finalized before 2008, willing to participate in Optimon.</criteria>
