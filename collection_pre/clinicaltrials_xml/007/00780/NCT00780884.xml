	<brief_summary>Insomnia, a common feature of schizophrenia, has serious consequences for daytime functioning and quality of life. Although insomnia is most often treated with medication, a growing number of studies have demonstrated the efficiency of a variety of relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioral therapies and alternative medicine procedures. Acupuncture is among the oldest healing practices in the world. Part of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture aims to restore and maintain health through the stimulation of specific points on the body. Previous studies have demonstrated that acupuncture has a positive influence on a number of diseases and disorders, among them Depression, Chronic Pain and Sleep Disorders. Hence, the aim of the present study is to examine the effects of acupuncture as a treatment for insomnia in schizophrenic patients.The study begins with a 7-day, running-in, no-treatment period, followes by an 8-week experimental period. During the experimental period, subjects receive acupuncture treatments twice a week. During the first week of the study (no-treatment period) and the last week of the experimental period, subjects' sleep is monitored with a wrist actigraph, and subjects complete a wide spectrum of questionnaires.</brief_summary>
