	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose for phase II studies of a chemotherapy-combination of sorafenib, irinotecan, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA) (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial of Sorafenib + FOLFIRI In Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A standard phase I dose escalation design with three to six patients per dose level will be used. The first three patients will receive chemotherapy at the dose level 1 for 4 weeks (2 FOLFIRI regimen). The dose will be escalated for the next patients by one dose level if none of the three patients at a dose level experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first six weeks. Intrapatient dose escalation is not allowed. If one of the three patients has a DLT, an additional three patients will be enrolled at this dose level and the dose will be escalated if no additional patients experience a DLT. Otherwise, the dose escalation will be stopped, and the last dose will be regarded as the Maximum Administered Dose (MAD). The preceding dose level will be declared the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). This dose level will be the recommended dose (RD). At least 6 patients will be treated at the MTD. The cohort at the MTD dose level can be expanded to as many as 12 patients to gain experience with the toxicities and efficacy of Sorafenib + FOLFIRI combination over a broad patient range. Patients experiencing a DLT during the first cycle of treatment will have the drug withheld. They will be eligible for repeated treatment at a lower dose or treated off protocol. Treatment is to be discontinued in cases of serious or unmanageable toxicity or request by the patient. Otherwise therapy will continue until clinically or radiologically documented disease progression.</detailed_description>
