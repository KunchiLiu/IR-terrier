	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of quarfloxin in patients with low or intermediate grade neuroendocrine cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of clinical benefit response to quarfloxin treatment including the reduction in secretory symptoms of flushing and/or diarrhea or the reduction quantifiable hormones or other biochemical tumor markers.</brief_summary>
