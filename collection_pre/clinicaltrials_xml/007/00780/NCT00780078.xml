	<brief_summary>Patients with failed extubation stay significantly longer in an intensive care unit (ICU) and have a higher mortality rate, than those intubated successfully. Reintubation is associated with life-threatening complications and a poor prognosis. Functional respiratory tests are frequently used as weaning parameters, however, they are not accurate enough to predict extubation failure. The incidence of swallowing dysfunction is underestimated, mainly among patients whose intubation lasts longer than 48 h.We previously observed that the assessment of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity, conducted by the physiotherapist before extubation could be helpful for making decisions to extubate patients intubated for over 6 days. The objective of this study is to validate a scale previously devised and used for physiotherapist bedside evaluation of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity, among patients intubated for over 6 days, to determine whether this scale is a good predictor of airway secretion-related extubation failure.Expected results : to validate a scale previously devised called " physiotherapist evaluation of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity before extubation" by the mean of a multicentric study. In our hypothesis the clinical parameters studied could be predictive of extubation failure. Then, this evaluation could help the medical decision in the choice of the good time for extubation. The final objective is to lower the mortality related to extubation failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Swallowing Disorders as a Predictor of Extubation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients selection, inclusion and procedure: All successive patients admitted to the medical or surgical ICU, and intubated by the orotracheal route for &gt;6 days, will be prospectively enrolled when extubation will be decided. Patients with previous swallowing disorders, ENT surgery or chronic persistent vegetative status will not be included. All patients will have to fulfill the usual criteria for extubation. Then, before extubation, the different components of swallowing functions will be evaluated by the trained physiotherapist, using a bedside pre-extubation scale based on 3 tests: assessment of 1)- cervical, oral, labial and lingual motricity; 2)- the gag reflex; and 3)- swallowing. After extubation, the ability to cough and swallow, secretion volume, and the need for suctioning will be evaluated immediately, then at 24, 48 and 72 hours. - Expected results : to validate a scale previously devised called " physiotherapist evaluation of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity before extubation" by the mean of a multicentric study. In our hypothesis the clinical parameters studied could be predictive of extubation failure. Then, this evaluation could help the medical decision in the choice of the good time for extubation. The final objective is to lower the mortality related to extubation failure.</detailed_description>
