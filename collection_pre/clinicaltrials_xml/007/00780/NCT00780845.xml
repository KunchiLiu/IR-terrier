	<brief_title>AKIN Criteria: Acute Kidney Injury After On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eight hundred and seventeen patients was enrolled in this series and divided into to groups: Group AKI (-) - patients without acute kidney injury after on-pump CABG. Group AKI (+) - patients with acute kidney injury after on-pump CABG. AKI was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.4 μmol/l) or a percentage increase in SCr of more than or equal to 50% (1.5-fold from baseline). The change in SCr concentration was defined as the difference between immediate postoperative concentration and the highest concentration during the stay in ICU. Clinical Outcomes and 30-day mortality was evaluate in this patients.</detailed_description>
