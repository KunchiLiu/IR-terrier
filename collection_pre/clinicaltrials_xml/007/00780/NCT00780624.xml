	<brief_title>Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation In Newborn Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is similar to nCPAP, but also gives some breaths, or extra support, to newborn infants through a small tube in the nose. NIPPV is safe and effective, and already in use as an alternate "standard" therapy. Nevertheless, NIPPV has never been used in chinese babies. The submitted trial is the first prospective, randomized trial Comparing NIPPV vs nCPAP in newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Newborn infants with birth weight &gt;500 gm. 2. Gestational age &gt;24 completed weeks. 3. Intention to manage the infant with noninvasive respiratory support (i.e. no endotracheal tube), where either: 1) the infant is within the first 7 days of life and has never been intubated or has received less than 24 hours of total cumulative intubated respiratory support; 2)the infant is within the first 28 days of life, has been managed with intubated respiratory support for 24 hours or more and is a candidate for extubation followed by noninvasive respiratory support. 4. No known lethal congenital anomaly or genetic syndromes. 5. Signed parental informed consent. 1. Considered nonviable by clinician (decision not to administer effective therapies) 2. Lifethreatening congenital abnormalities including congenital heart disease (excluding patent ductus arteriosis) 3. Infants known to require surgical treatment 4. Abnormalities of the upper and lower airways 5. Neuromuscular disorders 6. Infants who are &gt;28 days old and continue to require mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube</criteria>
