	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Metformin Hydrochloride Liquid 500mg/ 5 mL Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single-dose crossover bioavailability study performed on 36 healthy adult male and female non-smoking or light smoking volunteers and 2 alternates. A total of 36 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw. Single oral 1000 mg doses were separated by a washout period of 7 days Of the 36 healthy adult non-smoking or light-smoking (10 cigarettes/day) volunteers and 2 alternates (19 males, 19 non-pregnant females) enrolled in the study, two did not complete the clinical phase of the study. Subject No. 11 was withdrawn from the study by the on-duty Physician after a positive pregnancy test prior to dosing in Period 2 and Subject No. 20 was withdrawn from the study by the Clinical Study Manager after she failed to complete her breakfast prior to dosing in Period 2. Thus a total of 36 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study</detailed_description>
