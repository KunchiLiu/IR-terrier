	<brief_title>Study of IMC-3G3 in Patients With Tumors That Are Not Responding to Standard Therapies or No Therapy is Available</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the anti-PDGFRα monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in patients with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Histopathologicaldocumented, measurable, or non measurable, advanced primary tumor or recurrent solid tumor or lymphoma unresponsive to standard therapy or for which there is no standard therapy available. 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤ 2 at study entry. 3. Able to provide written informed consent. 4. Age 18 years or older. 5. Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months. 6. Adequate hematologic function, as defined by: an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3; a platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 7. Adequate hepatic function, as defined by: a total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels ≤ 2.5 x the ULN or ≤ 5 x the ULN if known liver metastases 8. Adequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x the ULN. 9. Uses effective contraception (per the institutional standard), if procreative potential exists. 10. Adequate recovery from recent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 11. Accessible for treatment and followup, must be treated at the participating center. 1. Received chemotherapy or therapeutic radiotherapy 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication or has ongoing side effects ≥ grade 2 due to agents administered more than 28 days earlier. 2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics; symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stenting, or myocardial infarction 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication; uncontrolled hypertension; clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia including but not limited to: multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia that is symptomatic or requires treatment or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; uncontrolled diabetes; psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise patient safety or limit compliance with study requirements 3. Progressive or symptomatic brain metastases 4. Has a serious or nonhealing active wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. 5. Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity. 6. Major surgical procedure, an open biopsy, or a significant traumatic injury 28 days prior to treatment. 7. Is currently or has recently used (28 days prior to) a thrombolytic agent. 8. Currently using fulldose warfarin (an exception is lowdose warfarin to maintain patency of preexisting, permanent, indwelling intravenous [I.V.] catheters; for patients receiving warfarin, the international normalized ratio [INR] should be &lt; 1.5). A patient requiring heparin is excluded. 9. Undergoes chronic daily treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications known to inhibit platelet function (cyclooxygenase2 [COX2] inhibitors are permitted). 10. Has a history or clinical evidence of a deep venous or arterial thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism) 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication. 11. Has proteinuria ≥ 2+ by routine urinalysis 12. Pregnancy (confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin) or lactating 13. Received prior treatment with agents targeting the PDGFR ligand or receptor 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. 14. Received prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. 15. Has a history of allergic reactions to monoclonal antibodies or other therapeutic proteins.</criteria>
