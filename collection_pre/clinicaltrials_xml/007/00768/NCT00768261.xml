	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this research is to determine if there is a relationship between your symptoms of Dementia of the Alzheimers type and changes in the size and shape of certain brain structures during combined Donepezil (Aricept®) and Memantine (Namenda®) treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study we will be using Memantine (Namenda®) in an investigational fashion with individuals with very mild to mild dementia. Donepezil (Aricept®) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. Memantine (Namenda®) is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for moderate and severe dementia only. This study may be instrumental in the development of a new therapy for others with similar conditions, and to determine whether Memantine (Namenda®) will be helpful to individuals with very mild to mild dementia. Specific Aim 1. To determine what neuroanatomical measures are most strongly correlated with the progression of clinical and cognitive deficits in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). To accomplish this aim, we will use high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and the tools of computational anatomy to assess changes in the structure of selected subcortical (e.g., hippocampus) and cortical (e.g., parahippocampal gyrus and cingulate gyrus) structure along with clinical and cognitive measures of dementia severity in subjects with very mild-to-mild DAT. Specific Aim 2 - To determine whether cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can slow disease progression in DAT subjects. To accomplish this aim, we will use MR imaging and the tools of computational anatomy to compare the rate of change in the neuroanatomical measures listed above in 1) untreated DAT subjects, 2) DAT subjects treated with donepezil alone, and 3) DAT subjects treated with the combination of donepezil and memantine.</detailed_description>
