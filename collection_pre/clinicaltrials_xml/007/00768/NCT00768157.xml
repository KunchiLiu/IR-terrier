	<brief_title>Efficacy of Antiviral Therapy After Radical Resection for Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As we know, recurrence and metastasis could happen in hepatocellular carcinoma even after radical resection.One reason is that virus hepatitis B could be one factor contributing to the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.To investigated whether anti-viral therapy could improve the efficacy of radical resection of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC),we planed to conduct this clinical trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. patients who did not receive antiviral therapy prior to the resection of hepatocellular carcinoma 2. patients who underwent radical resection of HCC, and 1 month after surgery,dynamic computed tomography showed on lesion in the liver and no signs of extrahepatic metastasis. 3. hepatitis B surface antigen should be positive before surgery HBVDNA level between 100000 copies/ml and 10000000copies/ml antiHCV negative 1. previous history of antiviral therapy 2. a baseline serum alanine aminotransferase level 2.5 times the ULN or higher 3. positive for antiHCV or antiHIV 4. ChildPugh classification B or C after surgery 5. preexisting evidence of hepatic decompensation, including encephalopathy,ascites,a bilirubin level more than 2 times the ULN, or a prolonged prothrombin time of more than 3 seconds 6. signs showing recurrence or metastasis oen month after surgery 7. underlying cardiac or renal diseases</criteria>
