	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation is widely considered to be the treatment of choice for children with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of sirolimus monotherapy for long-term immunosuppression in children and adolescents after kidney transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Immunosuppression Minimization in Children and Adolescents After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improvements in surgical techniques, donor selection, immunosuppression practices, and the enhanced experience of specialized pediatric transplant teams have all led to marked improvements in patient and kidney graft survival in infants and young children Long-term graft survival rates decrease in adolescents 11 to 17 years of age. Several studies have suggested this decrease may be the result of noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications in this age group. Therefore, protocols that minimize the use of immunosuppressive medications, while retaining kidney function are necessary for improving graft and patient survival in children. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of sirolimus monotherapy for long-term immunosuppression in children and adolescents after kidney transplantation. This study will enroll 10 participants who previously completed the CCTPT-PC01 study. The accrual period is scheduled for 12 months. The study follow-up period will last 96 weeks. Patients from the CCTPT-PC01 study have been maintained on sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) since 2-3 months post transplant. Enrolled participants receiving (MMF) or Azathioprine at study entry will have their doses withdrawn gradually over a period of 6 months. Dosage will be reduced by 25% initially and by 25% every 2 months resulting in complete withdrawal by 6 months. This study will consist of 11 study visits after screening and study entry. Study visits will occur at weeks 1, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96. A physical exam, vital signs, sirolimus levels, as well as blood and urine collection will occur at all visits. A renal biopsy will be performed at week 96.</detailed_description>
