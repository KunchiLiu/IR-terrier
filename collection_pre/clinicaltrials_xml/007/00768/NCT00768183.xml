Subjects with a history of moderate consumption of at least 721 units of alcohol per week or the alcohol equivalent (12 oz beer = 5 oz of 80proof distilled spirits = 1 unit). Weighing at least 70 kg and within 20% of their ideal weights (table of "Desirable Weights of Adults", Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983). Medically healthy subjects with no clinically significant abnormalities in their laboratory profile and ECGs, as deemed by the Principal Investigator.

History of no alcohol intake (alcoholnaive) or less than moderate alcohol intake. Subject with a history of alcohol intake exceeding the equivalence of 21 units/week or exceeding the average of 3 drinks per day. Subjects who had a surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy) which would interfere with absorption of the study drug. Subjects who received hepatic enzyme inducing drugs (e.g. Nizoral, Tagamet) within the previous three months. Subjects whose QTc interval was &gt;450 msec at screening and prior to dosing. Subjects whose sitting blood pressure was less than 110/45 mm Hg at screening or 100/45 mm Hg before dosing. Subjects who had been on a special diet (for whatever reason) during the 28 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study. Subjects who had made any significant donation or loss of blood within 56 days. Subjects who had made a plasma donation within 7 days prior to the study. Subjects with hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL. Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the first dose. Subjects who had a positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol.
