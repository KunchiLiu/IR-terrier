	<brief_summary>This is a 6-week clinical study (4 weeks of treatment, once per day, plus a 2-week follow-up period) of a topical foam to treat athlete's foot. The active ingredient in the foam -- econazole nitrate 1% -- is the same active pharmaceutical ingredient in a cream that your doctor can currently prescribe to treat athlete's foot. This study will help to understand if the foam works the same as the cream to treat athlete's foot.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Econazole Foam 1% in Athlete's Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treating athlete's foot with a cream can leave a greasy, wet feeling on the foot that is uncomfortable to the user and messy on clothing and foot wear. A foam formulation that spreads easily and rubs-in easily that is as effective as the (reference) cream formulation in treating athlete's foot would be a benefit to the user. This study is designed to substantiate a clinical bridge between econazole nitrate foam 1% and econazole nitrate cream 1% based on clinical outcome, safety, and pharmacokinetic data. The study is (foam) vehicle-controlled and is randomized 1 to 1 to 1 (foam:cream:vehicle).</detailed_description>

Be willing and able to give informed consent. Has microscopic evidence (positive KOH) of the presence of fungi. Evaluable subjects must have a positive KOH and a fungal culture positive for a dermatophyte at Baseline. Subjects with a positive KOH may be entered into the study pending the results of the fungal culture. Be in good health and free of any disease or physical condition which might, in the investigator's opinion, expose the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test and agree to use an effective, nonprohibited form of birth control for the duration of the study (abstinence, stabilized on oral contraceptives for at least two months, implant, injection, IUD, patch, NuvaRing, condom and spermicidal or diaphragm and spermicidal). Is nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study. Has used topical antifungal or corticosteroid therapy or systemic antibacterial therapy within 30 days prior to the start of the study. Has received systemic antifungal therapy within 12 weeks prior to the start of the study medication. Has a history of diabetes mellitus or is immunocompromised (due to disease, e.g., HIV, or medications). Has concurrent tinea infection (in the opinion of the investigator). However, concurrent onychomycosis is allowed. Has any other skin disease which might interfere with the evaluation of tinea pedis. Is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study. Has received an investigational drug or treatment with an investigational device within 30 days prior to entering this study Is unreliable, including subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Has known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study medications.</criteria>
