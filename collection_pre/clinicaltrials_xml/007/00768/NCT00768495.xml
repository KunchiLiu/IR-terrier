	<brief_summary>This trial will collect tissue oxygenation data via hyperspectral imaging before and after endovascular procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperspectral Imaging Pre and Post Endovascular Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a nonrandomized, nonblinded, prospective observational study to correlate the results obtained with the traditional measures of success of endovascular revascularization of peripheral arteries for the treatment of chronic limb ischemia; i.e., ABPI, PVR with oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoxyHb) measurements obtained with a new imaging device manufactured by HyperMed Inc (OxyVu) that uses hyperspectral technology.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with established diagnosis of lower limb ischemic based on their symptoms of claudication, rest pain, nonhealing ulcers or gangrene and other vascular laboratory tests that are currently used to make this diagnosis and have been scheduled for endovascular revascularization. 2. Age group between 5085 3. Gender Male or Female 4. Race all race and ethnicities 1. Patients with known cardiac disease new MI (within 3 months). 2. Patients with hypertension with the systolic BP &gt;200 or diastolic BP&gt;110 on the day of testing 3. Patients on supplemental O2 for chronic obstructive lung disease 4. Bedridden subjects either due to chronic disability or neurological problems</criteria>
