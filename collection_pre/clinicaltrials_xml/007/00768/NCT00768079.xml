	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenously Administered MEDI-563</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the effect of two IV dose regimens of MEDI-563 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) on the proportion of adult subjects with asthma exacerbations (relapse and de novo) who required an urgent healthcare visit for treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Asthma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged 18 to 60 years at the time of the administration of investigational product. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization (applies to covered entities in the US only) obtained from the subject/legal representative prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations. Physiciandiagnosed asthma with a duration of greater than or equal to 2 years by medical chart or subject report. Had an asthma exacerbation requiring urgent care in the year prior to screening. Meets NHLBI for persistent asthma in the 3 months prior to the current urgent healthcare visit. Current asthma exacerbation that must have lasted greater than or equal to 2 hours prior to arrival to the urgent healthcare setting. Requires at least 2 treatments of inhaled bronchodilators for the current asthma exacerbation in the urgent healthcare setting or within the emergency medical system (EMS)for greater than or equal to 1 hour. Shows an FEV1 or PEF of not more than 70% predicted after 1 hour of treatment of the current asthma exacerbation. Women of childbearing potential, unless surgically sterile (including tubal ligation) and/or at least 2 years postmenopausal, must have used 2 effective methods of avoiding pregnancy (including oral, transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap, abstinence, use of a condom with spermicide by the sexual partner, or sterile sexual partner) from screening through the end of the study (Study Day 84; Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician). Men, unless surgically sterile, must likewise practice 2 effective methods of birth control (condom with spermicide or abstinence) and must use such precautions from Study Day 0 through Study Day 84. Otherwise healthy by medical history and physical examination. A chest xray that is normal for an asthmatic population and excludes alternative diagnosis per the investigation. Ability to complete the followup period until Study Day 168 as required by protocol. The investigator has determined that the subject is clinically stable and the FEV1, is greater than or equal to 30% predicted prior to receiving investigational product on Study Day 0. Known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the investigational product formulation. Acute illness other than asthma at the start of the study. Fever &gt; 38.6°C (&gt;101.5°F). Current acute asthma attack is due to aspirininduced asthma. Current asthma episode is an anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction presenting with acute bronchospasm. Evidence of clinically significant nonrespiratory active infection, including ongoing chronic infection. History or current prolonged diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or blood and mucus in stools or have minor symptoms AND have exposure to stream or lake water, been exposed to someone who has a parasitic infection (like a family member), or study subject has traveled outside the US and/or Canada within the last year. Use of immunosuppressive medication (except oral prednisone and inhaled and topical corticosteroids) within 30 days before randomization into the study. Have received Xolair(TM)within 6 months before randomization into the study. Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 30 days before randomization into the study. Receipt of any investigational drug therapy within 6 months before the first dose of investigational product in this study through Study Day 168. History of primary immunodeficiency. Previous medical history, or evidence, of an intercurrent illness that may compromise the safety of the subject in the study. History of clinically significant abnormality on ECG in the opinion of the investigator. Pregnancy (must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to the first dose of investigational product). Breastfeeding or lactating woman. History of treatment for alcohol or drug abuse within the past year. Diagnosis of COPD by a healthcare professional. Evidence of any clinically significant systemic disease on physical examination. History of cancer except basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with apparent success with curative therapy &gt; 1 year prior to entry or other malignancies treated with apparent success with curative therapy &gt; 5 years prior to entry. Known exposure to inhaled occupational agents or fumes with an established diagnosis of occupational asthma. Any condition (ie, impending ventilatory failure or hemodynamic compromise) that,in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of study results. Any employee of the clinical study site who is involved with the conduct of the study. History of cigarette smoking &gt; 20 pack years. Previously received MEDI563. Asthma exacerbation due to acute inhalational exposure.</criteria>
