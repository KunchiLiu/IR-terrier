	<detailed_description>The study is carried out on two groups of female volunteers, 30 in each group, of age 30 to 60 years, in compliance with the principles established by the World Medical Association in the Declaration of Helsinki. In group I, the subjects took SBA24 sea buckthorn oil capsule (2 x 2 capsules per day) and apply two different creams on the face, one cream on each half of the face, twice per day. In group II, the subjects apply only the two creams, one cream on each half of the face, twice per day, for 8 weeks. The assessment is performed on the skin surface of the periocular areas. The efficacy of the active products is assessed on the skin face at the beginning, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks of treatment using the following instrumental measurements: - cutaneous elasticity (CUTOMETER SEM 575 Courage &amp; Khazaka); - cutaneous hydration level (CORNEOMETER CM 825 Combi 3 Courage &amp; Khazaka); - cutaneous roughness by cutaneous replicas and image analysis (Quantilines, Monaderm); Determination of benefit is based on instrumental measurements and subject self-assessment questionnaires.</detailed_description>
