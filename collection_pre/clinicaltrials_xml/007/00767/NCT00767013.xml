	<brief_summary>We sought to determine whether the dual-source computed tomography assessment of aortic valve stenosis and coronary artery disease is equivalent to or even better than conventional invasive coronary angiography and transthoracic echocardiography.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Until now invasive coronary angiography has established itself for the assessment of symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. Literature shows a good correlation between MSCT, MRI, TTE and TEE for evaluating the severity of the aortic valve stenosis. The dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) is capable of assessing coronary arteries with a high sensitivity and specificity in term of relevant stenosis (&gt;50%), due to its excellent spatial and temporal resolution. This study includes the assessment of patients with symptomatic valve stenosis. The severity of the aortic valve stenosis is being assessed by DSCT and TTE. Significant coronary artery stenosis and its localisation are assessed by DSCT and invasive coronary angiography. We examine the correlation between DSCT on one side and either TTE or invasive coronary angiography on the other.</detailed_description>
