	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effect of MK-0941 as add-on therapy for participants taking insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with MK-0941 added to insulin will provide greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level than will placebo added to insulin at 14 weeks, and that MK-0941 will be well-tolerated at 1 or more doses that demonstrate efficacy.</brief_summary>
