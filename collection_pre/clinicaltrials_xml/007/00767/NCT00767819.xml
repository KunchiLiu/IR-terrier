	<criteria>Histological evidence of progressive or metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma. The following tumor types are included: malignant fibrous histiocytoma liposarcoma synovial sarcoma malignant paraganglioma fibrosarcoma leiomyosarcoma angiosarcoma including haemangiopericytoma malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor STS, not otherwise specified miscellaneous sarcoma including mixed mesodermal tumors of the uterus osteosarcoma Ewing's sarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma gastrointestinal stromal tumor (only after failure or intolerance of imatinib or sunitinib in 1st and 2nd line) alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) Objective progression of disease may be documented by RECIST criteria. Any of the following would be sufficient according to RECIST: a 20% increase in the sum of unidimensionally measured target lesions a new lesion unequivocal increase in nonmeasurable disease. Patients must have disease not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined modality therapy with curative intent. ECOG performance status 0 2. Anticancer therapy within 3 weeks of enrollment including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy. The following tumor types will not be included: gastrointestinal stromal tumor (except for patients after treatment with imatinib or sunitinib in 1st and 2nd line) chondrosarcoma malignant mesothelioma neuroblastoma. Prior therapy with RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus). Neurotoxicity &gt; grade 2 CTC. Radiation of the lung. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
