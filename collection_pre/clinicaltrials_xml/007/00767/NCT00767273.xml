	<mesh_term>Pancreatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Adult patients (&gt;18) with histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas of the pancreas with a treatment plan consisting of definitive or palliative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy with or without surgery. Negative urine pregnancy test if a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP). WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study period. All patients will be evaluated in a uniform manner at the Stanford GI Combined Modality Tumor Board to determine eligibility. 1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 2. Any concurrent malignancy other than nonmelanomaskin cancer, or carcinomainsitu of the cervix. Patients with a previous malignancy without evidence of disease for &gt;5 years will be allowed to enter the trial. 3. WOCBP who is pregnant or breastfeeding. 4. Inability to sign written consent.</criteria>
