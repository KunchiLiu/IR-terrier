	<brief_title>COPE Intervention for Parents of Children With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic neurological conditions have a significant impact on the child and family system. Parents of children with neurological conditions want to foster the healthy development of their child, however, they struggle with constant feelings of uncertainty, which results in an increased level of stress that can interfere with this goal. Stress in parents also results in anxiety, depression, decreased confidence in care giving skills, ultimately leading to an increase in behavior problems in the child with epilepsy. Pediatric nurses are in a position to intervene with parents of children with epilepsy to facilitate coping with and adjustment to these issues. Although many researchers have identified the relationship between effective parental coping and the improved psychosocial outcomes of children with epilepsy, little has been done to test interventions that may be effective in improving the coping strategies of parents of children with epilepsy. COPE (Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment) is a nurse coached educational intervention, which shows promise for improving coping in parents of hospitalized children. This is particularly significant for parents of children with neurological conditions, as these conditions are associated with repeated hospitalizations, stigma, and numerous comorbidities. Collectively, these factors make epilepsy one of the most stress producing pediatric conditions for parents to manage. This study will help to advance Nursing science in several ways. First, this study will develop an intervention that can be used to teach parents how to help their children cope with living with a chronic condition. This intervention could further advance Nursing science because it could be adapted and trials performed with children who have a wide variety of medical conditions. This study has the potential to improve the way we prepare parents and children for hospitalization. This study will guide nursing in how to best help families cope with caring for a child with a chronic condition.
