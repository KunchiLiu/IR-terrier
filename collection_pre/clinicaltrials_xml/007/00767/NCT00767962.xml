	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomised Study of Efficacy, Safety and Costs of Talc Pleurodesis Under Medical Thoracoscopy and Pleurodesis Under Video-assisted Thoracoscopy Surgery for Recurrent Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial and many therapeutic options exist. What is the best technical option : treatment of the lung and the parietal pleura or treatment of the pleura with pleural symphysis ? Talc pleurodesis performed during medical thoracoscopy and resection of blebs or bullae associated with pleural abrasion during surgical thoracoscopy (or video-assisted thoracic surgery) are the most usual methods. These two procedures have never been compared in a prospective trial. The aim of this study is to compare pleural symphysis by talc poudrage during medical thoracoscopy and surgical management combining pleural abrasion and blebs or bullae resection for treatment of recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax.</detailed_description>
