	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of steady-state concentrations of LPV, co-administered with a low dose of ritonavir, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of TMC125 and to determine the effect of steady-state concentrations of TMC125 on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of LPV, co-administered with a low dose of ritonavir.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC125-TiDP2-C197: A Phase I Trial to Investigate the Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between Lopinavir/Ritonavir and TMC125 Both at Steady-state in Healthy Volunteers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), 2-period, 2-way cross-over interaction trial to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction (study of the bodily absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs) between lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv) and TMC125, both at steady-state.The trial population will consist of 16 healthy volunteers. In 2 consecutive sessions, healthy volunteers will receive Treatment A and Treatment B, in a randomized sequence. In Treatment A, 200 mg TMC125 b.i.d.will be administered for 7 days (from Day 1 to Day 7) with an additional morning dose on Day 8. In Treatment B, 400/100 mgLPV/rtv twice a day will be administered for 15 days (from Day 1 to Day15) with an additional morning dose on Day 16, while 200 mgTMC125 b.i.d. will be co-administered from Day 9 to Day 15 with an additional morning dose on Day 16. Subsequent sessions will be separated by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC125 will be determined over the 12-hour dosing interval after the morning intake on Day 8 of Treatment A and on Day 16 of Treatment B. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of LPV and ritonavir will be determined over the 12-hour dosing interval after the morning intake on Days 8 and 16 of Treatment B. All treatments will be administered under fed conditions and will be taken within 10 minutes after a meal. Safety and tolerability evaluations will be recorded continuously. Treatment A = 200 mg TMC125 b.i.d. will be administered for 7 days (from Day 1 to Day 7) with an additional morning dose on Day 8. Treatment B = 400/100 mg LPV/rtv b.i.d. will be administered for 15 days (from Day 1 to Day 15) with an additional morning dose on Day 16, while 200 mg TMC125 b.i.d. will be co-administered from Day 9 to Day 15 with an additional morning dose on Day 16.</detailed_description>
