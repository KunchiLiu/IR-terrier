	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to better understand how this study pillowcase works when people use it to treat acne. Most people, including people with acne, sleep six to eight hours each night in direct contact with bedding fabrics that provide no benefit to the healing process associated with acne. The fabric in this study pillowcase may be able to reduce bacteria on the skin. This study would evaluate how acne is affected by this silk-like pillowcase. This type of study has not been done before.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Silk - Like Bedding Fabric Pillow Case in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study of subjects with mild to moderate/severe facial acne vulgaris with an assessment of 2-4 on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale . We will enroll 40-60 subjects in order to obtain 40 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects will be defined as those that complete the protocol, or those that fail to complete due to an adverse event related to the study. One-half of subjects will be assigned to sleep on the study product, which is a standard size pillowcase made of a silk-like fabric. The other half will be assigned to sleep on the placebo pillowcase made of 100% cotton. Each subject will be instructed to sleep on this pillowcase every night for 12 weeks. Investigators will be blinded to the type of pillowcase used by the study subject. The distribution of placebo and study product pillowcases will be randomized 1:1. The study period will last for 12 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, weeks 2, 6 and 12.</detailed_description>
