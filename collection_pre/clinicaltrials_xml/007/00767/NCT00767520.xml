	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether exemestane plus dasatinib will be well-tolerated and will increase progression-free survival (PFS) in the treatment of advanced estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer after disease progression (PD) on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI).</brief_summary>
