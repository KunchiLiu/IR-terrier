	<brief_summary>Dental implants (screws for fastening false teeth) have been coated with bisphosphonates (drugs that slow down removal of bone). Patients get one such screw and one without coating, by a surgeon who does not know which is which. The screws are compared by measuring how well fixed they are by a vibration measuring technique, and x-rays. The hypothesis is that the bisphosphonates will improve fixation.</brief_summary>
