	<brief_title>Mesalamine Pellet to Maintain Remission of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of eMG 1.5 g given once daily (QD) compared to placebo in subjects with demonstrated remission from UC. Eligible subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio (active:placebo) to receive 1 or 2 treatments: 1.5g eMG (4 capsules total) or matching placebo capsules QD for 6 months. The study consists of a screening phase (completed within 7 days prior to randomization), a treatment phase (6 months), and a follow-up visit (2 weeks after end-of-study [EOS] visit.) The treatment phase consists of 4 scheduled study visits: visit 1 (baseline/randomization (day 1), visit 2 (month 1), visit 3 (month 3), visit 4 (EOS (month 6). Primary objective: To compare the maintenance of remission from mild to moderate ulcerative colitis as measured by rectal bleeding and endoscopic mucosal appearance after 6 months of treatment with encapsulated mesalamine granules (eMG) of 1.5 g QD, as compared with placebo. Secondary objective: To compare the safety and tolerability of long-term dosing with eMG at 1.5 g QD as compared to placebo in the maintenance of remission from mild to moderate UC.</detailed_description>
