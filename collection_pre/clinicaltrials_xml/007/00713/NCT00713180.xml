	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to find out why pterygium occurs and recurs in a rural African population. Participants will be interviewed on personal and lifestyle information, family history of pterygium, environmental exposure and history of previous eye inflammation. They will undergo eye examination and photography. Those with pterygium will be operated on to remove pterygium and followed up to detect any recurrence and complications of surgery. The excised pterygium will be examined pathologically and genetically; participant's blood will also be examined genetically. Data will be analyzed for statistically significant differences in findings between pterygium and pterygium free participants. The study hypothesis is that multiple factors are responsible for the occurrence and recurrence of pterygium in a rural african population.</brief_summary>
