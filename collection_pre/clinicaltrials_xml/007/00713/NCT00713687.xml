	<brief_summary>In patients with cholangiocarcinoma therapeutic effects have been reported for Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin. Furthermore, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has significantly improved patients survival in two randomised trials. PDT induces tumor necrosis only in an area of few millimetres, while tumor parts which are located beyond this area remain untreated. An additive effect could result from PDT as a local therapy in combination with systemic chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin and Photodynamic Therapy in Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients entered in the study receive a sequential therapy consisted of photodynamic therapy followed by systemic chemotherapy (Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin) 4 weeks later. Systemic chemotherapy every 2 weeks is scheduled 9 times in each cycle. Thereafter, another cycle of PDT followed by chemotherapy is intended.</detailed_description>
