	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: An educational and skills training program for the parent of a childhood cancer survivor with neurobehavioral dysfunction may help improve the child's school performance, thinking ability, and behavior. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying an educational and skills training program for parents of childhood cancer survivors who have neurobehavioral dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Educational and Skills Training Program for Parents of Childhood Cancer Survivors Who Have Neurobehavioral Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the feasibility of implementing an educational and skills training intervention for parents of a childhood cancer survivor with neurobehavioral dysfunction using face-to-face training sessions and phone assistance. - To pilot test and collect preliminarily data on the indirect therapeutic impact of the parent training intervention on the child's academic, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. - To pilot test and collect preliminary outcomes of the parent training intervention on parents of a childhood cancer survivor with neurobehavioral dysfunction. OUTLINE: Parent and child participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I (parent intervention program and usual care): In addition to medical care, child participants and their families may access multidisciplinary psychosocial services (i.e., usual care). Parents also receive 8 weekly face-to-face training sessions (75-90 minutes each) with a therapist over approximately 2-3 months. The training sessions include integration and didactic review of a parent's role as a behavioral and emotional support system for the child's school success; a parent's role as a monitor and motivator for school performance; a parent's role as an intervener and teacher of effective learning and study strategies; and a parent's role as a child advocate and accessor of educational and community resources. Parents are instructed to engage in ≥ 30 minutes of cognitive and academic activities with their child ≥ 4 days a week. The therapist will observe the parent (in the home or clinic) apply knowledge and techniques learned in the parent training sessions directly with the child at least once after the 4th parent-therapist session to provide feedback to the parent and child and to assess which parents may require more intense training and support. The sessions may be videotaped by the parent and provided to the therapist for review and follow up. Phone support/assistance is provided by the therapist within 2-3 days following each training session to provide additional problem-solving assistance and teaching support to the parents while they are implementing the knowledge and strategies learned during the training sessions and to measure study adherence and behavioral implementation between the sessions. After completion of the training sessions, continued phone support/assistance is provided by the therapist every 2 weeks for up to 6 months to provide ongoing support and problem-solving and teaching assistance as needed and to promote ongoing maintenance of the trained parenting practices with a greater degree of independence. "Booster" in-person sessions may also occur if determined to be needed by both the therapist and parent. - Arm II (wait-list/usual care control [UCC]): Child participants and their families undergo usual care as in arm I and are placed on a wait-list. Parent and child participants in both arms complete battery testing and questionnaires at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Battery testing includes the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-II) and the WISC-IV Working Memory Index and Children's Memory Scale (CMS) subtests. Questionnaires include parent, teacher, and child [self-report] questionnaires (BASC-II, BRIEF, and SMALSI); Parent Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised; Parent Knowledge and Efficacy Questionnaire; and Parent's Treatment Barriers and Satisfaction Questionnaire.</detailed_description>
