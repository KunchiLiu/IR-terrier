	<brief_summary>The study consists of a 12 week run-in period when all subjects are stabilized on a single dose of Avalide (300 mg/12.5 mg or 300mg/25mg dose) per day. After this 12 week run-in ends, subjects will be randomly assigned to start the addition of either Adalat XL or Tiazac XC for 18 weeks of treatment. Subjects will have a 1 in 2 chance of receiving the study drug Adalat XL and a 1 in 2 chance of receiving the drug Tiazac XC. An end of treatment visit will be done 18 weeks after start of study drug. The expected duration of the study is 30 weeks. The purpose of this study is to compare the change in proteinuria, through a urine test, while taking study drug until high blood pressure (BP) is reduced to near normal levels in study subjects with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension.</brief_summary>
