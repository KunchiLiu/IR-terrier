	<brief_title>The Use of Computer-Assisted Learning Pediatrics Program (CLIPP) in the Pediatric Clerkship</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Computer-Assisted Learning Pediatrics Program was developed by members of the Council on Medical Student Medical Education (COMSEP) and has been very well received by both medical students and faculty. The program is a comprehensive Internet-based learning method designed for use by third year medical students during their pediatric rotation. More than 80 medical schools in the US and Canada have been successfully using the CLIPP cases with an estimated 3000 to 4000 cases being reviewed by students weekly. All third year medical students will be required to complete specific cases, based on gaps identified through review of prior student contact logs. Using the students' own patient contact logs, they will also be strongly encouraged to complete any cases for which they have not met the clerkship requirement. Students will be allowed to complete any other cases they choose. The study proposes that by utilizing CLIPP cases in the pediatric rotation, student exposure to essential pediatric conditions will increase, thereby increasing retention of knowledge and increasing their performance on end of clerkship OSCEs (Observed Structured Clinical Exam) and on NBME Pediatric Subject Exam (shelf exam).</detailed_description>
