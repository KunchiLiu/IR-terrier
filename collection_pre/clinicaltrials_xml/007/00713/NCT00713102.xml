	<detailed_description>An epidemiologic database documenting medical and surgical emergencies across European airlines will provide access to data potentially valuable for further flight-epidemiological research. Data on medical emergencies / per rpk (revenue passenger kilometres) are sparse and often based on data from a single airline. While handling the data the regulations of the data protection act of the Ethic commission of the Ruhr-University Bochum are fully respected. As noted, evaluation of the data will be completely anonymized without any information regarding the airline or other details than the passengers illness. Preview: The results of the study specified above will be submitted for publication in a peer review and Medline listed journal. Study Design: Retrospective, epidemiological study for the evaluation of medical and surgical emergencies on board airliners. Patients: In the context of a retrospective study approximately 20,000 patient data from 32 European airlines are collected and statistically evaluated. Documentation: The direct documentation takes place through project responsible person into an electronic statistical data base.</detailed_description>
