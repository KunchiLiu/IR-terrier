	<brief_summary>The trial is conducted in Europe, North America and Asia. The aim of this trial is to evaluate catridecacog (recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII)) treatment in patients with inherited FXIII deficiency. It is expected that recombinant FXIII can be used for the prevention of bleeding episodes.</brief_summary>
