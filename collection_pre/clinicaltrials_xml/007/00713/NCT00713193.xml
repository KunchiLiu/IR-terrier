	<brief_title>Study of Cyclosporine or Corticosteroids as an Adjunct to Plasma Exchange in Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TTP is a rare blood disorder that causes blood clots to form in the small blood vessels throughout the body, including the kidneys, brain, abdomen, and the heart. Plasma exchange is the standard treatment for TTP. Plasma exchange is a treatment that removes the plasma (the liquid portion of the blood without any cells) from a patient and replaces it with plasma from a donor. With plasma exchange, 90% of patients achieve a remission of the disease. Unfortunately, up to one half of patient will relapse after the plasma exchange has stopped, leading to significant complications and added risks to the patient. This study randomizes patients to receive either prednisone or cyclosporine as an adjunct to plasma exchange, with the cyclosporine arm being the experimental arm of the study. All patients will undergo plasma exchange but will be randomized to receive either prednisone or cyclosporine as an adjunct to plasma exchange. Previous studies suggested that cyclosporine was superior to prednisone as an adjunct to plasma exchange, and therefore this randomized study attempts to confirm the findings of two previous single institution studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic TTP as defined by a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia (&lt;100 x 103) Additional components of the pentad (fever, renal and neurologic abnormalities) need not be present. Additional explanations for the microangiopathic changes including DIC and malignancy should be excluded. Patients with pregnancy associated TTP will be permitted on this therapeutic trial if the child is delivered prior to the initiation of therapy for TTP. However, female patients that are breastfeeding and are unwilling to discontinue breastfeeding at the time of enrollment will be excluded from this study Patients with a previous diagnosis of TTP are eligible to be enrolled provided they meet eligibility criteria and have not been treated for an TTP in the past 30 days Given the potential for nephrotoxicity with CSA, all patients must have a serum creatinine of &lt; 2.5 mg/dl prior to enrollment In light of concern for the prompt initiation of PE, all patients with suspected TTP may be enrolled on this trial. If it is subsequently found that the patient does not meet enrollment criteria, they will be removed and their spot replaced for study purposes. Patients removed from the study after enrollment will continue to be followed longitudinally for 6 months to be monitored for safety and will be included in the safety database. Patients with TTP clinically categorized as secondary to stem cell transplant and solid organ, bloody diarrhea associated, malignancy associated, and drug associated will not be enrolled on this therapeutic study. Incarcerated patients will be excluded from the study due to the inherent difficulties in maintaining close followup for study purposes in patients who are incarcerated. Any patients already being treated chronically with corticosteroids or cyclosporine and taking these at the time of their presentation will be excluded from this study. Female patients that are breastfeeding and are unwilling to discontinue breastfeeding at the time of enrollment will be excluded from this study Patients taking any medications contraindicated in combination with CSA that cannot be safely discontinued will be excluded from this study.</criteria>
