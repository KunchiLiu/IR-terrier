	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention for smokers interested in quitting smoking. We expect that this project will contribute much needed knowledge about the role of aerobic exercise in smoking cessation. If the efficacy of moderate-intensity, aerobic exercise for smoking can be established, smokers may have a valuable adjunct to more traditional smoking cessation approaches.</brief_summary>
