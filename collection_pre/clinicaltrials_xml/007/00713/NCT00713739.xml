	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to conduct a prospective controlled trail of four currently approved Department of Defense (DOD) - formulary medications for use as medical expulsion therapy (MET) for kidney stones. Between 8% and 15% of Americans will develop symptomatic urolithiasis in there life. Several medications, including steroids, calcium channel blockers, alpha-adrenergic antagonists and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have been utilized to aid in the spontaneous passage of distal ureteral calculi. Recently, use of selective alpha-blockers has shown promise for medical expulsion therapy (MET) of distal ureteral calculi. None of these studies have been widely publicized outside the specialty of urology. Recent studies have shown a success rate of nearly 90% when the selective alpha-blocker tamsulosin (Flomax) was used for MET. MET has also been shown to result in a decreased narcotic requirement, shorter time to stone passage, and reduced requirement for further interventions. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of MET as initial management for kidney stones using DOD-approved formulary medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alfuzosin for Medical Expulsion Therapy of Ureteral Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presenting to Naval Medical Center San Diego with symptomatic ureteral stones visible on CT and KUB, and who are medically stable will be offered enrollment. Upon consent, patients will be randomly assigned to one of four outpatient treatment arms, randomized 1:1:1:1 and include; Group 1 - Alfuzosin 10 mg daily, Group 2 - Nifedipine 30 mg daily, Group 3 - Doxazosin 4 mg daily, or Group 4 - Prazosin 1 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint is stone expulsion rate and secondary endpoints are time to expulsion, need for additional intervention, degree of pain control, amount of narcotic use, and evaluation of study drug side effects. The treatment regimens consist of daily medication until the stone passes or 21 days, whatever is shorter. Patients will also receive oral pain medication as needed.</detailed_description>
