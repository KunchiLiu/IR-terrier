	<brief_title>Establishing Normal Values for Neuropsychological Testing in HIV-negative Thais</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Southeast Asia Research Collaboration with Hawaii (SEARCH) operates or collaborates on several neuroAIDS research protocols. To allow accurate interpretation of neuropsychological data, normative data that are obtained in a similar population are needed. Currently, there are limited such data available for this purpose. The SEARCH 001 study evaluated the neurocognitive changes before and after highly active antiretroviral therapy in 30 HIV positive subjects and has also enrolled 230/300 proposed HIV-negative controls for this purpose. Normative data tables typically require many more individuals so that age and education strata can be established. We now propose to enroll up to 1000 HIV-seronegative individuals for this purpose.</detailed_description>
