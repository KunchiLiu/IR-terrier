	<brief_summary>This unblinded pilot study is intended to assess the feasibility of a larger double-blind, randomized control trial. For the larger trial the investigators are interested in understanding the relative benefits of vaccine and antiviral prophylaxis, the risk factors for influenza infection in healthy adults, and in assessing the safety and tolerability of seasonal antiviral prophylaxis in healthcare workers. The pilot study will be assessing the rate of infection with influenza and the rate of adherence to long-term zanamivir in 60 healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zanamivir Versus Trivalent Split Virus Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have demonstrated that zanamivir and oseltamivir are effective in preventing influenza infection and illness when used either as prophylaxis after exposure to a household contact with influenza or when taken for several weeks at the height of influenza activity in the general community. However, the longest duration of prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors in two clinical trials, to date, has been six weeks. Antiviral medication will likely have an important role in the response to the next influenza pandemic. Additionally, there may be indications for use during seasons when the major infecting strain of influenza in not one whose antigen is well covered by the vaccine.</detailed_description>
