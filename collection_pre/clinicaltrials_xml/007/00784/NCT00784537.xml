	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to define an improvement in patients: - To evaluate if patients resistant to the initial treatment for residual PET-positive masses after the first two courses of ABVD (PET-2 positive), can be salvaged by early shift to high-dose chemotherapy supported by stem cell rescue - To analyse if patients achieving early complete response (PET-2 negative), can be spared the adjuvant radiotherapy on areas of initial bulky disease, at the end of the planned six courses of ABVD. To answer this question, PET-2 negative patients will be randomized between radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy at the end of ABVD therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-dose Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplantation, in Patients PET-2 Positive, After 2 Courses of ABVD and Comparison of RT Versus no RT in PET-2 Negative Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is composed by two phases: 1. A phase II multi-centre study evaluating in patients with advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma the efficacy of an early salvage treatment with high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation in patients FDG-PET positive after two courses of ABVD (PET-2 positive). 2. A phase III randomised study comparing the efficacy of radiotherapy to the areas of initial bulky disease versus no further therapy in PET-2 negative patients in complete remission (PET-6 negative) at the end of six courses of ABVD.</detailed_description>
