	<brief_title>Observing Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptoms And Treatment Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be identified by reviewing the hospital's surgical boarding list and contacted by phone to obtain informed consent. Once informed consent is obtained, chart review will be conducted here at William Beaumont Hospital and at the physician's office to collect patient information related to their prolapse condition. Prior to surgery, questionnaires will be mailed and completed by the participant and then again at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and then yearly. Questionnaires will assess urinary, bowel, and sexual function, and patient treatment goals, treatment satisfaction, and general health and wellbeing. Completion of the questionnaires will be voluntary, and participants will be followed in this manner until voluntary withdrawal, exclusionary criteria emerge, or death.</detailed_description>
