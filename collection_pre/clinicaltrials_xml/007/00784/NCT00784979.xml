	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to offer Panel Reactive Antibodies [PRA] reduction treatment to high responder renal transplant patients who otherwise may never be compatible with a potential organ donor. PRA reduction is offered in the following phases: 1. Immunological Testing 2. Transplant Nephrectomy 3. Pharmacologic Therapy 4. Plasmapheresis 5. Transplant</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) Reduction in Sensitized Patients Awaiting Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with high level of preformed antibodies (panel reactive antibodies [PRA]) to donor antigens make identification of a suitable donor difficult. For most transplant centers, 20-35% of patients waiting for a kidney transplant comprise this challenging group. These patients have a wait time of over five years and have many incompatible cross-matches with potential organ donors.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Renal transplant recipients with a potential living donor who is incompatible (T&amp;/or Bcell locus) due to recipient high PRA or MHC antibodies PRA greater than or equal to 20% within last twelve months Recipient and donor accepted as potential candidates by the LifeLink Healthcare Renal Transplant Committee Patients with known allergy to CytoGam(R), Cellcept, Rapamycin Patients who will receive IVIG or CytoGam(R) for any cause prior to protocol process ABO incompatibility Patients not capable of following through the treatment for various reasons as determined by treating physicians Any potential recipient who is pregnant or becomes pregnant Exclusion for Plasmapheresis: known allergy to ethylene oxide or natural rubber latex. Exclusion for Plasmapheresis: Intake of ACEinhibitor or Angtiotensiinreceptor blockers in the last 24 hours prior to plasma exchange</criteria>
