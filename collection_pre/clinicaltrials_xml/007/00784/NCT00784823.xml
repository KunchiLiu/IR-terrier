	<brief_title>Study Combining Bortezomib With High Dose Melphalan to Treat Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy that has affected approximately 40,000 Americans.Conventional chemotherapy has achieved limited control of this disease but studies have reported improved response rates for patients who are treated with dose-intense therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This Phase I/II study will investigate the potential of combination therapy of dose-intense melphalan with escalating doses of bortezomib.</detailed_description>

Show progression of disease after a previous cycle of doseintense melphalan, or less than 25% decrease in paraprotein measured at 8 weeks after a prior cycle of doseintense melphalan May have received intervening therapies for disease progression after doseintense melphalan and enrollment in this protocol 3. Age:18yrs76yrs at time of melphalan administration 4. Gender: There is no gender restriction 5. Availability of &gt;2x10^6 autologous peripheral blood CD34+ cells/kg or a syngeneic donor meeting eligibility criteria for syngeneic donation Syngeneic transplantation is preferred For patients enrolled in the phase I part of this study, &gt;1x10^6 autologous or syngeneic peripheral blood CD34+ cells/kg remaining in storage as "backup" in case of engraftment failure 6.
