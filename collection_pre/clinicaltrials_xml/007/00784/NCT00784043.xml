	<criteria>Between 12 and 36 months of age at time of implantation Profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss English as the primary language in the home Realistic expectations of guardians Child must be enrolled in a postoperative rehabilitative/educational program that supports the use of cochlear implants and the development of auditorybased skills Willing and available to comply with all scheduled procedures as defined in the protocol Audiological: Profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with average thresholds between ears of 90 dB HL or greater at 1000 Hz and above, and must demonstrate minimal functional benefitfrom conventional amplification Behavioral test measures must include unaided threshold measures for the right and left ears using insert earphones; leftalone and rightalone aided sound field threshold measurements; and aided and unaided speechawareness / detection thresholds (for each ear individually) Children accepted into the study must be able to demonstrate a consistent response to sound. If a child has no measurable hearing, he/she must be able to demonstrate a consistent response to vibrotactile stimuli. All children must have completed an appropriate trial period with optimally fit amplification prior to inclusion in the study. Medical: Good general health status, as judged by Primary Investigator Patent cochleae bilaterally, as indicated by radiological evaluation No contraindications for surgery, in general, or cochlear implant surgery in particular Prior experience with any cochlear implant system Younger than 12 months or older than 36 months at time of implantation Audiological: Presence of otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonic, indicating possible condition of auditory neuropathy Medical: Evidence of ossification that would prevent full insertion of the standard C40+ / PULSARCI100 /SONATATI100 electrode array in the cochlea(e) to be implanted, as indicated by radiological evaluation Abnormal or malformed cochlea(e) to be implanted Severed or nonfunctional auditory nerve in the ear(s) to be implanted Central auditory lesion Cognitive and/or neurological dysfunction Auditory neuropathy</criteria>
