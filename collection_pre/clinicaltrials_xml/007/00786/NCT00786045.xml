	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate, among persons who have completed the restorative phase of stroke and have ceased rehabilitation, the relative effectiveness in improving functional exercise capacity of two programs for continued care, a home-based general fitness training program using stationary cycling and a disability targeted, home-based exercise program to enhance mobility and walking competency. capacity compared with the "walking" group and that consequently the cycle group will achieve a higher quality of life. A secondary objective is to explore factors associated with compliance with the exercise regimens. Previous research has indicated that cognitive-affective-behavioural profile is related to exercise activity in a number of populations including sedentary adults, older adults and patients with cardiovascular disease. As we anticipate that one of the mechanisms by which the cycling will result in an outcome better than the more traditional type of disability tailored exercise program is through greater compliance, this second objective is very relevant. This study will also address the impact of regular exercise on cardio-vascular risk factor profile.</brief_summary>
