	<brief_summary>Variable pressure support during assisted spontaneous breathing (noisy PSV) has been shown to improve the respiratory function in experimental acute lung injury (ALI). We aimed at comparing the effects of noisy PSV with traditional PSV on the respiratory function of patients suffering from ALI.</brief_summary>
