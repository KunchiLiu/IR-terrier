	<criteria>Patients must have a clinically documented diagnosis of bilateral cataract (either cortical, nuclear, subcapsular or a combination) liable to benefit from standard cataract surgery. Patients must be undergoing primary cataract surgery with IOL inthebag implantation, requiring a IOL power from 10 to 30 diopters. Patients with corneal damage. Patients with any anterior segment pathology for which extracapsular phacoemulsification cataract surgery would be contraindicated. Patients with any ocular pathology, other than the cataract, having repercussions on visual function:</criteria>
