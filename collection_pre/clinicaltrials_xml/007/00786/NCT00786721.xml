	<brief_summary>There has been increasing support for our hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the etiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the overlapping Metabolic Syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mitochondria and Metabolic Syndrome in a Southern California Chinese Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once the mitochondrial defect(s) of these subjects has been defined, the data will be used to develop two non-invasive screening tools to detect mitochondrial defects in Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Syndrome patients. The device call Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy develope at Beckman Laser Instituteis is non-invasive measurement technique, to measure the properties of the muscle tisuue and vascular activity (calf, bicep, or the brain)to evaluate the patient's metabolic status and and to assess muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS function.</detailed_description>
