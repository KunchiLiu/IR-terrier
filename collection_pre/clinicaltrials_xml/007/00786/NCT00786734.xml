	<brief_summary>Patients who is scheduled elective PCI are randomized to pitavastatin 4mg daily or without pitavastatin for 5 -7days before the procedure. Creatine kinase-MB, troponin I, and myoglobin levels are measured at baseline and at 8 and 24 hours after the procedure(1st evaluation). After PCI, pitavastatin will be administered for additional 4 weeks(2nd evaluation).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pitavastatin Pre-Treatment Study in Patient With Elective PCI for Stable Angina Pectoris (PIPA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedural ischemic myocardial injury remains the most frequent complication after coronary angioplasty. Recently it was reported that pretreatment with atorvastatin reduce the myocardial damage compared to placebo. Thus, we will evaluate the difference of pretreatment of pitavastatin compared to standard therapy on the reduction of myocardial damage in patient who is scheduled elective PCI for stable angina pectoris.</detailed_description>
