	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about the natural history of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection in men. The study will also find out what factors are linked to HPV in men including other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If participants test positive for syphilis, gonorrhea or chlamydia, we are required by law to report the results to the Florida Department of Health. Participants will be able to get free medical treatment from the Florida Department of Health for these STDs. Participants will be given a written report of the results of the STD testing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History of HPV Infection in Men: The HIM Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study protocol will include a pre-enrollment run-in visit, a baseline visit (enrollment), and 8 additional visits after enrollment scheduled 6 months apart. Intervals of every 6 months were chosen to insure that both acquisition and loss of infections may be assessed, as studies in women indicate that median duration of oncogenic infections ranges between 7-9 months. Informed consent will occur during the run-in visit. The run-in and follow-up visits will include questionnaire administration, visual inspection of the skin and external genitalia, and the collection of urine, blood, oral cells, and penile skin samples If anogenital lesions are present at any of the clinic visits, they will be sampled as well.</detailed_description>
