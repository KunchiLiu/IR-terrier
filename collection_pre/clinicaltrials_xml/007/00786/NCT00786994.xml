	<brief_summary>In this study the impact of Oleogel-S-10 versus placebo on actinic keratoses over a treatment period of 3 months will be tested. Additionally, once and twice daily applications are tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Tolerability of Oleogel-S-10 in Patients With Actinic Keratoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oleogel-S-10 has shown efficacy and was well tolerated in two previous clinical trials. In the second open label phase II trial the efficacy of Oleogel-S-10 alone was similar compared to a more invasive treatment with cryotherapy. Response rates of 85% with a clear-ance of more than 75 % of the lesions of the patients treated with Oleogel-S-10 over three months were reported. These encouraging results led to the present randomized, multicenter, double blind phase II trial. The efficacy of the treatment shall be tested in a double blind placebo controlled (petroleum jelly) fashion in order to obtain more reliable results for the planning of a phase III study.</detailed_description>

If invasive SCC or other malignant conditions are confirmed within the treatment area, the patient will not be included in the study.</criteria>
