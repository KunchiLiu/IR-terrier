	<brief_summary>Silver nitrate treatment of Bartholin's cyst or abscess will be compared to marsupialization treatment. It is expected that silver nitrate treatment is effective, simple, inexpensive and the least anaesthetic requiring procedure, which can easily be carried out in the outpatient setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Treatment of Bartholin´s Cyst or Abscess With Silver Nitrate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background and objective: Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses are common problems in women of reproductive age. The traditional treatment of Bartholin´s cyst or abscess is marsupialization, which has disadvantages, such as pain of long duration, scarring, risk of general anaesthesia and risk of recurrence. In the present study we use silver nitrate in the treatment of Bartholin's cyst or abscess and compare to marsupialization. We expect lower healing time, lower recurrence rate and less pain with the silver nitrate treatment. Methods and materials: 30 patients with Bartholin´s cyst or abscess will be investigated. It is prospective randomized study. The silver nitrate treatment is performed under local anaesthesia on an outpatient basis. A simple vertical incision 1 cm in length is made in the vaginal mucosa and the underlying cyst or abscess wall. A crystalloid silver nitrate stick of 5 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length is inserted into the cyst or abscess cavity. The standard marsupialization treatment is performed under general anaesthesia.</detailed_description>
