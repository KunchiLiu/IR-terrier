	<brief_summary>The use of dexmedetomidine in cataract surgery is still limited and to date only one study has examined anesthetic technique in this patient population. This pilot study will therefore compare the use of dexmedetomidine and propofol in subjects undergoing cataract surgery. The primary endpoint will be based on simple cardiorespiratory measures often associated with complications from sedation as well as assessment of the achieved sedation by the attending anesthesiologist and surgeon.</brief_summary>
