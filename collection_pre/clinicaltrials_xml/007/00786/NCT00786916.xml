	<brief_summary>This protocol describes a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of lidocaine at reducing pain associated wiht propofol infusion for short-term deep sedation in children. Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo (saline) or one of two dosing regimens of IV lidocaine prior to initiating propofol infusion. The efficacy of the differing lidocaine doses will be compared to determine the minimum dose required to safely achieve alleviation of pain. We hypothesize that premedicating with lidocaine will significantly decrease pain experienced by pediatric patients receiving propofol for outpatient sedation.</brief_summary>
