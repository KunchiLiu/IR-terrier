	<brief_summary>The number of cardiac angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) has increased steadily in recent years. This has resulted in the increasing incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI). Major risk factors for CIAKI include older age, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease(CKD), the concurrent use of nephrotoxic drugs, hemodynamic instability, etc. Importantly, DM appears to act as a risk multiplier, meaning that in a patient with CKD it amplifies the risk of CIAKI. The aim of this multicenter prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate whether statins treatment during the perioperative period would reduce the risk of CIAKI in a high-risk population of patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and CKD undergoing coronary angiography or noncoronary angiography, and evaluate the influence of such potential benefit on short-term outcome.</brief_summary>
