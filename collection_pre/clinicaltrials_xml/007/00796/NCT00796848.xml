	<brief_summary>The purpose of doing this study is to see if continuous glucose monitoring can help people with type 1 diabetes who are sometimes unable to feel if they have a low blood glucose reading. For this study we will be using the Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitor. We think that your body may not have enough of a certain hormone that usually helps people know when they are going low. If you can keep from going low, we think there will be enough of that hormone to help you recognize the symptoms of a low before it happens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversal of Hypoglycemia Unawareness Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To enroll in this study you must be between the ages of 7 and 20, have type 1 diabetes, and experience at least two episodes of low blood glucose readings weekly that you do not feel. Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled at Stanford and another 25 at the Barbara Davis Center in Colorado. The study will last approximately 8 months for each participant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be at least 7 to 20 years old 2. Have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year 3.

For females, you are not intending to become pregnant during the study 7. No expectation that you will be moving out of the area for the duration of the study 1. The presence of a significant medical disorder (including epilepsy, or any cause of seizures other than hypoglycemia) that in the judgment of the Investigator will affect the wearing of the sensors or the completion of any aspect of the protocol 2. Treatment with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in the last six months 3. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past six months for you or your primary caregiver 4. Current use of oral/inhaled glucocorticoids or other medications, which in the judgment of the Investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the study 5.
