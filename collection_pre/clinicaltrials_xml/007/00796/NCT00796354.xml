	<brief_title>Constipation Associated With Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated for 28 days, with clinical assessments carried out over 2 visits. Follow-up will be performed via telephone at a specific interval during the study to determine the outcome of unresolved AEs, any new drug-related AEs or any pregnancies. During the run-in period and the treatment phase, patients are prohibited from taking prescription or over the counter (OTC) laxative medication or constipating medications. Prescription and OTC medications not related to constipation are permitted and must be fully documented, but any changes (e.g., dosage, regimen) are to be limited as much as possible.</detailed_description>
