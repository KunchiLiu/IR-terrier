	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if the experimental drug, DSC127, is safe, how well it can be tolerated, and how different doses effect the healing of the chronic foot ulcers in diabetic subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of DSC127 in Treating Subjects With Diabetic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After a 14-day baseline to evaluate ulcer healing to ensure DU are chronic, a 4-week active treatment followed by 8 weeks of observation and assessment of the treatment will compare the effects of two concentrations of DSC127 and placebo (n = 25 evaluable subjects per group; n=75 total evaluable subjects) to identify the optimal dose of DSC127. Sustained tissue integrity will be evaluated for all subjects during a follow-up period at study weeks 16 and 24. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups. Group 1: Placebo Vehicle Control Group 2: 0.03% DSC127 in Vehicle Group 3: 0.01% DSC127 in Vehicle The four week treatment period requires daily application of the treatment to the wound site. First application each week will be at the clinic and for the remainder of the week the patient self-administers the treatment. If wound healing occurs during the treatment or assessment periods a final assessment visit is conducted and the integrity is assessed four and twelve weeks later (usually weeks 16 and 24 of the study).</detailed_description>
