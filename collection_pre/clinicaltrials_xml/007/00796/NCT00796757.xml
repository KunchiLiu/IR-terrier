	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess progression free survival, tumor response and safety of Avastin in combination with interferon alfa-2a (IFN) as first line treatment in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Patients will receive Avastin (10mg/kg iv) every 2 weeks in combination with a low dose of interferon alfa-2a (3 MIU sc three times per week (t.i.w.). The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
