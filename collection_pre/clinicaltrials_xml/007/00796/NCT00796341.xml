	<brief_summary>Implantation of the human embryo is the limiting factor in the success of invitro-fertilization and embryo transfer(IVF-ET).We wanted to find out whether creating a local injury to the endometrium in the non-transfer cycle would improve the IVF-ET outcome in the subsequent cycle.We believe that the injury created causes release of substances which help in implantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endometrial Injury and IVF-ET Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design and Subjects: This is a randomized control study designed to evaluate the effect of local injury to the endometrium in non-transfer cycle in patients with previous failed IVF. Patients will be randomly allotted to control and intervention group The patients in the intervention group Pipelle endometrial sampling 7-10th day and 24-26th day in the cycle prior to IVF transfer cycle. Outcome Measures: Clinical pregnancy rate,implantation rate and ongoing pregnancy rate. SAMPLE SIZE: 100 PATIENTS (50 in each group).</detailed_description>
