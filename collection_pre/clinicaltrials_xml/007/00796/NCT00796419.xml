	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are similar conditions in which the lungs are critically injured by another inflammatory process in the body. Together they affect more than 150,000 people per year in the United States, with mortality approaching 50% and a financial burden estimated to exceed $5 billion. Fluid overload, weight gain, and reduced oncotic pressure (low blood proteins) are associated with prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with ALI/ARDS. Historical studies have provided conflicting evidence for benefits with colloid or diuretic therapy in ALI/ARDS, but recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in blood oxygen levels. The mechanisms of these benefits are not yet certain, but appear to relate to albumin's (a protein medicine) specific ability to influence injury and inflammation in the lungs, thus improving the ability for the lung to repair and exchange oxygen. The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of therapies that affect blood proteins on their ability to change the way the lungs and cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels) function. Special measurements will be taken to understand how these protein medicines change the ability of the lung and whole body to recover from widespread injury, with additional measures of specific heart and lung function. This clinical trial randomizes ALI/ARDS patients with low blood protein levels to receive albumin (a natural blood protein that is known to influence inflammation) or hetastarch (a synthetic blood protein) with diuretic therapy targeted to improve respiratory function. Therapeutic effects on respiratory function and blood oxygen levels, extravascular lung water, oncotic pressure, lung fluid removal, and heart function will be characterized. This trial will advance our understanding of treatment of ALI/ARDS and the factors that affect fluid balance in the lungs of these patients. Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
