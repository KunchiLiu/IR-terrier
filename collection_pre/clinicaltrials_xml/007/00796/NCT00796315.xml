	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate in children ages 2 to &lt; 18 years. Once characterized, these pediatric pharmacokinetic data will be pooled with historical adult PK data from other studies to assess whether the existing Over-the-Counter (OTC)doses provide comparable systemic drug exposure as that associated with efficacy in adults.</brief_summary>
