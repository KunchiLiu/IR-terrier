	<brief_title>Telephone Care Coordination for Smokers in VA Mental Health Clinics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States and is a particular problem among VA users and among persons with a diagnosed mental illness. The prevalence of smoking among VA mental health patients has remained high, in part because smoking cessation treatment rates have remained low. Telephone-based counseling represents the most feasible approach to increasing smoking cessation treatment among VA patients. The approach used in this study has been used very effectively in a primary care-based population that includes a large percentage of mental health patients. This project would target the program specifically at patients seen in VA Mental Health Clinics.</detailed_description>
