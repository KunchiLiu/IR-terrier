	<brief_title>Evaluation Of A Novel Breast Compression Paddle For Wire Localization In Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presently, the breast compression paddles that are used in mammography for wire localization are made of plastic and contain a relatively small rectangular shaped opening through which the wire is placed in the breast. When technologists use this paddle, they must carefully position the breast such that the rectangular opening is above the region for wire localization. A novel paddle has been developed which increases the wire localization access area tremendously and should therefore make it easier to perform the procedure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functionality of this new compression paddle. The new compression paddle was developed by Biomedical Engineering students in conjunction with Radiologists and a Medical Physicist at the University of Michigan. It was designed and manufactured for a student project in the Mechanical Engineering 450/599 course at the University of Michigan.</detailed_description>
