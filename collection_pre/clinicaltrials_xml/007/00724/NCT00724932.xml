	<brief_summary>The current trial was designed to demonstrate faster recovery from a neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium after reversal at 1-2 Post Tetanic Count (PTC) by 4.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex compared to 50 Âµg.kg-1 neostigmine at reappearance of second twitch (T2) in participants undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy under propofol anesthesia, to compare safety and to evaluate operating room and Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) length of stay.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Sugammadex With Neostigmine During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy or Appendectomy (P05699)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In those surgical procedures where a neuromuscular block is desired for intubation and/or avoid unwanted muscular activity, anesthesiologists may use a more profound NMB until the end of surgery, e.g. in open abdominal procedures or during laparoscopic procedures in order to improve surgical conditions. Reversal with sugammadex at a dose of 4.0 mg.kg-1 at 1-2 PTC after an intubation dose of 0.6 mg.kg-1 or maintenance dosing rocuronium has been found to be both safe and efficacious in previous clinical trials but has never been investigated exclusively in participants undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy. With sugammadex profound muscle relaxation may now be provided right up to the end of the surgical procedure. This may lead to improved Patient Outcomes, such as improvement in the time from end of surgery to the discharge to the PACU. In this multi-center, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, safety-assessor blinded trial such benefits will be further investigated.</detailed_description>
