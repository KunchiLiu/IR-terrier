	<brief_summary>Available data suggest that obtaining adequate sleep is associated with a better ability of the body to use carbohydrates as a source of energy and a lower risk of developing diabetes. The sleeping pill, Eszopiclone (Lunesta), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of people who complain of trouble falling or staying asleep. This study will examine the hypothesis that the use of Eszopiclone (Lunesta) to improve the sleep of people with insomnia may also improve the use of sugar in their body.</brief_summary>
