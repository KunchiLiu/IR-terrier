	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate, in each group, the number of participants who achieve rapid virological response (RVR) after 4 weeks treatment with PegIntron and Rebetol. The study will also assess whether RVR is a reliable predictor of sustained virologic response (defined as undetectable viral load at 24 weeks post-treatment).</brief_summary>
