	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing lung resection due to pulmonary cancer can be compromised in their postoperative period due to atrial fibrillation. A retrospective analysis performed at our institution indicates that 30 % of the population develope atrial fibrillation in the postoperative period. Amiodarone is known to diminish the occurence of postoperative atrial fibrillation after heart surgery, why this drug is chosen as a prophylactic agent for the mentioned population. Amiodarone is administrated twice a day for 5 days at a dose of 600 mg oral treatment after an initial loading bolus og 300 mg intravenously.</brief_summary>
