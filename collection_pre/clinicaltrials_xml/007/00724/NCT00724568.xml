	<brief_summary>This research study is evaluating an investigational combination of four drugs called Revlimid® (lenalidomide), Velcade® (bortezomib), Dexamethasone and Doxil® (RVDD) as a possible treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Study of Revlimid®, Velcade® Dexamethasone and Doxil® (RVDD)for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the Phase I portion of this clinical trial, the doses of Revlimid® and Doxil® will be increased until the best and safest amount (or dose) is identified in combination with Velcade® and Dexamethasone. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause and how effective the Velcade®, Doxil®, Dexamethasone and Revlimid® investigational combination is for treating newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. In this clinical trial we are looking for the highest dose of the combination that can be given safely and see how well it works as a combination in newly diagnosed patients. Each of these drugs, Velcade®, Doxil®, Dexamethasone and Revlimid® are approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). They have not been approved in this combination for use for your type of cancer or any other type of cancer. Velcade® is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Doxil® has recently been approved by the US FDA for multiple myeloma in combination with Velcade® in patients who have not previously received Velcade® and have received at least one prior therapy. Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. Revlimid® is currently approved by the US FDA in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy. After the Phase I clinical trial defines the safest doses of Velcade®, Doxil®, Dexamethasone and Revlimid® that can be taken together, the research study will move on to its second portion, a Phase II clinical trial. The Phase II portion of the clinical trial will test the clinical effectiveness of the best dose combination of the four drugs.</detailed_description>
