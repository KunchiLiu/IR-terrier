	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth of mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome. Ultraviolet light therapy uses a drug, such as psoralen, that is absorbed by cancer cells. The drug becomes active when it is exposed to ultraviolet light. When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed. Giving PEG-interferon alfa-2b together with ultraviolet light therapy may kill more cancer cell. PURPOSE: This is a pilot study of dose-escalating pegylated IFN-α-2b and PUVA or NB-UVB. The purpose is to study the side effects and best dose of PEG-interferon alfa-2b to be given together with ultraviolet light therapy in patients with stage IB, stage II, stage III, or stage IVA mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (CTCL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pegylated Interferon-Alfa 2b in Combination With PUVA Therapy In CTCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive UV light therapy (either PUVA or NB-UVB). Health-related quality of life is assessed periodically using the FACT-BRM, FACT-G, and FACT-CTCL questionnaires. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 1 year.</detailed_description>
