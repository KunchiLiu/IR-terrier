	<criteria>Patients over the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with a brain tumor of the central nervous system and a treatment plan has been discussed. Must be willing/able to undergo 3 to 5 additional contrast enhanced research MRI scans. You can take part in this study if you are NOT afraid of small, enclosed places. A patient who is claustrophobic. Females who are pregnant or lactating. Patients who have electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants such as heart pacemaker, magnetic surgical clips, prosthesis or or implanted neurological stimulator. Any patient who has a history of allergic reactions to MR contrast agent (Omniscan, Magnevist, MultiHance) Patients who require general anesthesia to complete MRI exam or patients who have had a negative reaction to MRI sedation. (Chloral Hydrate, Pentobarbital or Versed) You should NOT have any metals, or implanted devices in your body, for example, aneurysm clips, pacemakers, or artificial joints or limbs. It is extremely important that you tell us about any and all surgeries you have had so that we might now if there is a chance that any metal would be inside you. Also, if your job or any other experience might have left metal fragments in your body, please let us know, as the MRI's strong magnetic field could disturb a metal fragment in your body or interfere with an implanted device, such as a pacemaker, causing you harm.</criteria>
