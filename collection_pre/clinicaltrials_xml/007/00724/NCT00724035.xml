	<brief_summary>This study aims to detect differences in onset time of brachial plexus (i.e., arm) anesthesia using two different nerve block techniques. Using ultrasound guidance, axillary (i.e., at the armpit) and infraclavicular (i.e., below the collarbone) blocks will be performed to patients undergoing upper limb surgery. The investigators will analyze how long it takes for anesthesia to be adequate for pain-free surgery, thus determine the optimal technique for this kind of surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Axillary or Infraclavicular Nerve Block for Upper Limb Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Real-time ultrasound guidance has substantially reduced the risk of pneumothorax and/or vascular puncture during infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. The role of this technique has thus been expanded to overlap those procedures for which an axillary nerve block would be commonly considered as first choice. A reference block for upper limb surgery thanks to its safety profile and clinical efficacy, the axillary approach may be more painful or unpleasant for some patients. The investigators aim to determine possible differences in onset time and patient acceptance between the two techniques.</detailed_description>
