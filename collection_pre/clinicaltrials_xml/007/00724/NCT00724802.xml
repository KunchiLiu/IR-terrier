	<brief_summary>Canavan disease is caused by Aspartoacylase deficiency. There is no treatment for the disease, but there is a food additive that includes acetate . We suggest an early treatment with acetate and a neurologic evaluation, including MRI, after 4 months of treatment. In any case the treatment will be stopped at the age of 22 months, when myelinization is ended.</brief_summary>
