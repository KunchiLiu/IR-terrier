	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to collect data on the incidence of congenital malformations in infants of women with an ongoing pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone /ganirelix followed by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra cytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI), and to compare this incidence with that of a group of women who used a long protocol with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist as historical controls.</brief_summary>
