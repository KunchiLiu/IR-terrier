	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical research study is to examine the acute hormonal and metabolic effects of the drug olanzapine, as well as appetite effects, in healthy volunteers. The hypotheses to be tested are that: (1) Olanzapine rapidly attenuates plasma leptin and (2) rapidly alters glucose tolerance in healthy volunteers. These questions will be answered by having volunteers undergo two glucose tolerance tests in a crossover study design.</brief_summary>
