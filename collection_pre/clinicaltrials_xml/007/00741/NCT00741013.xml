	<brief_summary>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial we used positron emission tomography to determine if lovastatin or recombinant human activated protein C exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in humans following intrabronchial installation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS or endotoxin).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Quantitative, noninvasive biomarkers for lung-specific inflammation have yet to be developed but can potentially contribute significantly to the development of therapies to treat lung inflammation. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging with [18F}fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) can be used to quantify the change in lung inflammation in healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
