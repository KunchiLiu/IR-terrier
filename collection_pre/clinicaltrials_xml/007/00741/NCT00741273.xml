	<brief_title>Evaluate the Safety and PK of Proellex速 in Female Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function and Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>16 subjects will be allocated to 2 groups. The test group will consist of 8 female patients with moderately impaired hepatic function meeting the Child-Pugh Class B severity criteria, while the control group will consist of 8 healthy female adult volunteers. During Stage I, all subjects will receive a single oral dose of 25mg of Proellex速 (fasting state) and be followed in a Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for about three days. Only subjects who do not experience serious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events (AEs) that are determined by Investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to the treatment will participate in Stage II. The dose will be increased to a single dose of 50mg of Proellex速 (fasting state) and subjects will be followed in a Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for about three days. Subjects will undergo blood draws at several time points.</detailed_description>
