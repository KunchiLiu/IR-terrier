	<brief_title>Effect of Iron Fortified Wheat Flour on Cognition and Iron Status in Indian School Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Iron (Fe) deficiency is a major cause of anemia in children. Fortification of wheat flour with NaFeEDTA, a highly bioavailable iron fortificant that protects Fe from the phytic acid present in wheat flour, could be a practical approach to addressing this problem. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of NaFeEDTA-fortified whole wheat flour in improving mental performance and reducing iron deficiency and improving body iron stores in urban, school going Indian children. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, 7 month, school-based feeding trial was carried out in Bangalore, India. Iron-depleted (serum ferritin, SF &lt;20 µg/L), and/or iron deficient (serum transferrin receptor, TfR &gt;7.6 mg/L), 6 -13 year old children (N=194) were randomly assigned to either receive a whole wheat flour based lunch meal fortified with 6 mg Fe as NaFeEDTA or an identical unfortified control meal. The meals were administered under supervision and left overs were weighed. Hemoglobin (Hb) and iron status were measured at baseline, 3.5 months, and 7 months. At baseline and at 7 months, the study children were also subjected to a battery of cognitive tests to assess attention/concentration, motor development, visuospatial and verbal abilities. Sensory evaluation using triangle tests were carried out using meals prepared from the fortified and unfortified whole wheat flour.</detailed_description>
