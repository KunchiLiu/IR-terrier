	<criteria>The study was open to patients who had satisfactorily completed either study CNI1493CD03 or CNI1493CD05. Initial entry criteria were: 1. Patients who satisfactorily completed either study CNI1493CD03 or CD05 were eligible for participation in this study. Satisfactory completion was defined as follows: 1. The patient completed 5 treatment courses in the previous trial. 2. The patient had responded to treatment, as defined by a decrease in CDAI of at least 70 points from original baseline (prior to treatment on study CD02 or CD04) at the last assessment for study CD03 or CD05, respectively. The decrease had to be attributable to semapimod treatment. Thus, patients whose response was attributable to other antiCrohn's disease therapy are not to be included. 3. The patient had no adverse event &gt;grade 2 felt to be probably or definitely related to study medication. 4. The patient did not meet any discontinuation criterion in previous trial. 2. Patients had to sign informed consent specifically for this study, in addition to the consents for the previous studies, CNI1493CD02 or CD03, and CNI1493CD04 or CD05. 3. Patients could not take any other investigational therapies during the course of this study. 4. Men and women of childbearing potential had to be using a barrier method (diaphragm or condom) of contraception and continue doing so for at least 3 months after last study medication. It was strongly recommended that two forms be used. 5. Patients had to be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and/or protocol requirements. Could not have met any of the exclusion criteria for the CD02, 03, 04 or 05 studies.</criteria>
