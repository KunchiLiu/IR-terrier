	<brief_title>Influence of Physical Exercise on Endothelial Function in Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia is a common maternal disease that complicates 5% to 10% of pregnancies and remains as the major cause of maternal and neonatal mortality, especially in developing countries. Cost-effective interventions aimed to prevent the development of preeclampsia are urgently needed. Ethiopathogenesis of preeclampsia involves multiple mechanisms as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, infections, maternal constitutional factors, and others. Regular aerobic exercise recovers endothelial function, decreases oxidative stress and improves maternal constitutional factors. The purpose of this Controlled Clinical Trial is to determine the effect of regular aerobic exercise on endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Furthermore, the effect of exercise on biomarkers on vascular function and perinatal outcomes will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
