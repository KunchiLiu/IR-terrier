	<brief_summary>The present study is assessing the efficacy and safety of AVE5530 (25mg and 50mg) co-administered with all approved doses of atorvastatin in a double-blind comparison with placebo, AVE5530 alone and atorvastatin alone in the management of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. The main objective is to evaluate the effects of the association AVE5530+atorvastatin on LDL-C level reduction after 12 weeks of treatment. The effects of AVE5530+atorvastatin on other lipid parameters will be assessed as secondary objectives</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will include a 2 week pre-randomization placebo lead-in phase. There will be a 12- week double-blind treatment period for both components AVE5530 and atorvastatin, followed by a 40-week period with maintenance of double-blind design for AVE5530 component and open label for atorvastatin component transitioning at 20 mg for all patients with subsequent titration, if necessary, based on regular LDL-cholesterol monitoring. The treatment period can be variably extended up to approximately 18 months with double-blind for AVE5530 component and open-label for atorvastatin.</detailed_description>
