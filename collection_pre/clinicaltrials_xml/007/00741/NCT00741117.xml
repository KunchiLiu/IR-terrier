	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if higher levels of bilirubin in the blood of people with liver disease affects how accurate a pulse oximeter machine is able to measure the concentration of oxygen in the blood. Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the affect of high levels of bilirubin in the blood on the accuracy of the pulse oximeter reading. Initial studies showed an underestimation of the oxygen concentration in the presence of elevated bilirubin. Subsequent studies have suggested that high levels of bilirubin in the blood do not influence the accuracy of the pulse oximeter machine. However, recent reports in bone marrow transplant literature and our personal observations in patients with liver disease suggest that high bilirubin levels are associated with an overestimation of the oxygen concentration as measured by the pulse oximeter machine.</brief_summary>
