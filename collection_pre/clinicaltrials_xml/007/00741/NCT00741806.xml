	<brief_summary>It is the hypothesis of this study that intranasal vaccination with a single dose of GHB04L1 is safe and induces an immune response against influenza A H5N1. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I dose-escalation study assessing the safety and tolerability of single dose administration of GHB04L1 in healthy adults. Furthermore, the local and systemic immune response as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of a single dose of GHB04L1 will be studied as secondary objectives. GHB04L1 will be escalated according to a fixed dose escalation scheme comprising three dose levels.</brief_summary>
