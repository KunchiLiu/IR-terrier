	<brief_summary>Adolescents are at risk for HIV because of sexual and drug use behavior initiated during early adolescence, and those with mental health problems appear to be particularly susceptible. Problems with managing emotions may make it difficult for early adolescents to make good decisions about sexual and substance use behaviors. This project will develop and evaluate interventions for early adolescents with mental health issues. An intervention focused on teaching affect management skills will be compared to an intervention addressing a variety of health topics to determine which intervention best reduces risk behavior among this at-risk population.</brief_summary>
