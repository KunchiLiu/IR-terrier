	<brief_summary>Among surgical methods for gastric cancer, incision about 15 ~20 cm length is prepared for open gastric cancer surgery while 0.5 ~ 1.2 cm is for laparoscopy gastric cancer surgery. Complications such as pain, abdominal adhesion, and problems associated with delayed recovery are common in open surgery because of large incision; however, those complications are less common in laparoscopy surgery because small sized incision is prepared. Range of surgery for curative dissection depends on the level of progress of a cancer, i.e., depends on whether gastric wall invasion, lymph node metastasis, or invasion to adjacent organs presented. Since recurrence in the lymph nodes after the operation is very common, the most important step in the gastric surgery is to dissect lymph node completely. According to the gastric cancer surgery manual published by Japan Gastric Cancer Association, more than D2 lymph node dissection is essential for improving survival rate in advanced gastric cancer. More than D2 lymph node dissection is relatively safely conducted by open surgery, whereas it is controversial in laparoscopy surgery because it is very hard to maintain surgical field under laparoscopic condition. Recently, widened rage of lymph node dissection by using laparoscopy is possible as laparoscopic surgical techniques are accumulated and new surgical devices are introduced. According to the case reports, D2 lymph node dissection by laparoscopy surgery shows similar results to the one by open surgery in aspects of recurrence rate and the number of dissected lymph node. Also, according to Hur and el., in case of upper gastric cancer, laparoscopy surgery is more useful to dissect #10 and #11 lymph node.In our prospective case study, the investigators would like to compare effectiveness, complications, patterns of recurrence, and survival rate between the two surgical approaches, laparoscopy distal gastrectomy and open distal gastrectomy. The investigators randomly operate the advanced gastric cancer patients, who need distal gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Surgical methods are selected randomly whether open surgery or laparoscopy surgery. Finally, the investigators wish our case report to contribute to the establishment of the safety and the effectiveness of laparoscopy surgery conducted for advanced gastric cancers. Consequently, our case report will contribute to establish the ideal surgical method for the advanced gastric cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Laparoscopy-Assisted Distal Gastrectomy and Open Distal Gastrectomy for Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In both arms,subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy) and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of splenic artery (4d, 4sb), hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) wiil be performed basically. As a general rule, Billroth II method will be used for gastric reconstruction for all cases.Billroth II gastrectomy is to link the gastric pouch to the jejunum 10~15 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. An antecolic or retrocolic gastrojejunostomy connects the jejunum to the stomach in one continuous segment. For anastomosis, absorbable suture is used. Anastomotic diameter is 5~6 cm length. Drainage tube is inserted through the right flank area and additional drainage tubes can be inserted as needed.</detailed_description>
