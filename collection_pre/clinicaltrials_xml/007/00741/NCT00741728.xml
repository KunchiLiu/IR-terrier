	<detailed_description>Overall, 10 000 men and women will be recruited during two years for an extensive clinical examination including a 2h holter ECG, a carotid doppler echo tracking, a step test, as well as blood and DNA collections. Thereafter, the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the participants will be followed up for 10 years at least.</detailed_description>
