	<brief_summary>An open label, dose-escalation study to evaluate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 given twice weekly for three consecutive weeks in cancer patients The objectives of this study are: - To determine the safety and MTD of CPI-613 when administered 2x weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. - To determine pharmacokinetics of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV) administration. - To observe the anti-tumor effects of CPI-613, if any occur.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have advanced and/or metastatic, histologically or cytologically documented solid tumors and lymphomas, for whom there is no available therapy shown to provide clinical benefit. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt;70%. Must be ≥18 years of age. Expected survival &gt;3 months. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not surgically sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation. (Note: Pregnant patients are excluded because the effects of CPI613 on a fetus are unknown.) Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study period, unless documentation of infertility exists. Mentally competent, ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent form. No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents (except CPI613), or treatment with biologic agents within the 3 weeks prior to treatment with CPI613. At least 2 weeks must have elapsed from any prior surgery or hormonal therapy. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities of any prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anticancer modalities (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment). Patients with persisting, stable chronic toxicities from prior treatment ≤Grade 1 are eligible, but must be documented as such. Laboratory values ≤2 weeks must be: Adequate hematologic (white blood cell [WBC] ≥3500 cells/mm^3 or ≥3.5 bil/L; platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm^3 or ≥100 bil/L; absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥1500 cells/mm^3 or ≥1.5 bil/L; and hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9 g/dL or ≥90 g/L). Adequate hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST/SGOT] ≤3x upper normal limit [UNL], alanine aminotransferase [ALT/SGPT] ≤3x UNL (≤5x UNL if liver metastases present), bilirubin ≤1.5x UNL). Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL or 177 µmol/L). Adequate coagulation (International Normalized Ratio or INR must be ≤1.25). Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association Class III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase patients' risk for toxicity. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor. Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g., active peptic ulcer disease). Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of contraception (because the teratogenic potential of CPI613 is unknown). Lactating females because the potential of excretion of CPI613 into breast milk. (Note: Lactating females are excluded because the effects of CPI613 on a nursing child are unknown.) Fertile men unwilling to practice contraceptive methods during the study period. Life expectancy less than 3 months. Any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the safety of patients. Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements. Dyspnea with minimal to moderate exertion. Patients with large and recurrent pleural, or peritoneal effusions requiring frequent drainage (e.g. weekly). Patients with any amount of clinically significant pericardial effusion. Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 6 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias requiring medication, or symptomatic congestive heart failure. Albumin &lt;2.5 g/dL or &lt;25 g/L. Evidence of active infection, or serious infection within the past month. Patients with known HIV infection. Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their cancer, or any other investigational agent for any indication within the past 3 weeks prior to initiation of CPI613 treatment. Patients who have received immunotherapy of any type within the past 4 weeks prior to initiation of CPI613 treatment. Requirement for immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery. Patients that have received a chemotherapy regimen with stem cell support in the previous 6 months. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated exhibition of a QTc interval &gt;470 ms.). A history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., clinically significant heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome). Troponin I above institution limit of normal or Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) below 35%.</criteria>
