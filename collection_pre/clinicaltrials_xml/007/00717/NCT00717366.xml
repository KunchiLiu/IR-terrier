	<brief_summary>This sequential study will assess the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of intravenous Mircera, and will determine the optimum starting dose for maintenance treatment of anemia in children with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Pediatric patients will remain on epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa during the screening period, after which they will receive intravenous Mircera monthly, at a starting dose related to the previous weekly epoetin or darbepoetin alfa dose. Depending on the response achieved, another group may be selected to receive a higher or a lower dose. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
