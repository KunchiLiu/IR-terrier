	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the hemoglobin maintenance with once monthly Mircera administration versus epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Patients will be randomized to receive either monthly s.c. or i.v. Mircera (at a starting dose of 120 or 200 micrograms, calculated from the last weekly dose of epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa previously administered), or standard therapy (iv or sc epoetin beta once, twice or thrice weekly, or iv or sc darbepoetin alfa once a week or twice a week). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
