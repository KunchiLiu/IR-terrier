	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if a specific blood protein, S-100B, can help predict who will have a traumatic abnormality on head CT scan after a concussion. We will compare the levels of this protein in the subject's blood to the initial head CT scan and to how the subject is feeling one month after injury. We hope that the information we collect in this trial will help us determine who needs a head CT scan after a concussion and who may be more likely to have trouble recovering from a concussion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S-100B as Pre-Head CT Scan Screening Test After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the ability of a serum S-100B to predict traumatic abnormalities on brain CT scan after mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI). The secondary objective is to determine the relationship between initial S-100B levels and cognitive outcome at one month.</detailed_description>
