	<brief_title>A Survey To Elicit The Relationship Between Literacy And Glycemic Control In Pediatric Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"Literacy" is defined as an individual's ability to read, write, and speak English, and compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, to achieve one's goals, and develop one's knowledge and potential, according to the National Literacy Act of 1991. The National Work Group on Health and Literacy reported that between 40 and 44 million persons in the United States have rudimentary literacy skills, and are unable to understand written materials that require only basic reading proficiency. Illiteracy has become an increasingly important problem, especially as it relates to healthcare. Literacy skills are paramount to effective self-management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. And, "Diabetes Self-Management Education" is the cornerstone of care for all individuals with diabetes who want to achieve successful health-related outcomes. Self care of diabetes plays a major role in achieving DCCT recommended level of hemoglobin A1C. Deficient self-management will lead to uncontrolled diabetes, resulting in multisystem complications, increasing exponentially the burden on our healthcare system. Structured education of individuals tailored to combat poor literacy skills is imperative in helping these individuals achieve good glycemic control. Hence we would like to evaluate literacy in our clinic so appropriate educational material can be developed to help patient with T1DM who have low literacy.</detailed_description>
