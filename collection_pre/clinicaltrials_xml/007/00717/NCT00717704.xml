	<brief_summary>Patients are being asked to take part in this study because they have been diagnosed with an advanced solid tumor that is not responding to standard treatments. This study will find the highest dose of ixabepilone and dasatinib in combination that can be given without causing severe side effects. Both ixabepilone and dasatinib have individually been tested in many (several thousand) patients, however the combination of the two drugs has not yet been tested in humans. All patients who will take part in this study will receive combined drug therapy of dasatinib and ixabepilone. Dasatinib is a pill that is taken by mouth. Ixabepilone is a medicine that will be given by vein (IV). All participants will receive ixabepilone by vein once every three weeks as well as dasatinib by mouth once daily.</brief_summary>
