	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that subjects with CYP2D6*10 alleles may have a lower steady state levels of endoxifen due to reduced conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen. Primary objectives: - To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen and its metabolites - To test the effects of genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 on plasma concentration of tamoxifen and its metabolites in hormone receptor positive women who are taking tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
