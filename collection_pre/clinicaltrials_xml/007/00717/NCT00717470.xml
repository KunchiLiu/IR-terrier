	<criteria>End stage kidney disease and a suitable candidate for primary renal transplantation or retransplantation (unless the graft was lost from rejection within 12 months) Receiving a kidney transplant from a cadaveric or living (non HLA identical) donor with compatible ABO blood type Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at enrollment and must agree to maintain effective birth control during the study Receiving or having previously received an organ transplant other than a kidney Cold ischemia time of the donor kidney &gt; 30 hours Receiving a graft from a nonheartbeating donor other than of Maastricht category 3 (withdrawn of support awaiting cardiac arrest) Significant liver disease, defined as having continuously elevated SGPT/ALT and/or SGOT/AST and/or total bilirubin levels ≥ 2 times the upper value of the normal range of the investigational site or is receiving a graft from a hepatitis C or B positive donor Requiring initial sequential or parallel therapy with immunosuppressive antibody preparation(s) Requiring ongoing dosing with a systemic immunosuppressive drug prior to transplantation. Significant, uncontrolled concomitant infections and/or severe diarrhea, vomiting, active upper gastrointestinal tract malabsorption or active peptic ulcer Pregnant woman or breastfeeding mother Subject or donor known to be HIV positive Known allergy or intolerance to tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics, corticosteroids, basiliximab or mycophenolate mofetil or any of the product excipients Diagnosis of newonset malignancy prior to transplantation, with the exception of basocellular or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which had been treated successfully Currently participating in another clinical trial, and/or has taken an investigational drug within 28 days prior to enrollment Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may complicate communication with the investigator</criteria>
