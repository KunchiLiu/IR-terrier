	<brief_summary>The endpoint is to investigate if the addition of low molecular heparin - enoxaparin, will result in a significant increase of overall survival in patients with small cell lung cancer, receiving standard chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Standard Treatment +/- Enoxaparin in Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy will be given in accordance with local or regional guidelines but shall include a platinum drug + any topoisomerase inhibitor. Within these limits the study will accept different local variants as long as each centre remains consistent to its declared standard chemotherapy regimen. The recommended regimen is carboplatin or cisplatin plus etoposide q3 weeks for 4 cycles but up to 6 cycles is allowed. Local dosages and dose reduction schedules will be used.</detailed_description>
