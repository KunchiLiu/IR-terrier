	<brief_title>Determination of the Glycemic Index and the Insulinemic Index of a Sweetener Syrup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glycemic index is a measure of how carbohydrate-containing foods affect blood glucose levels. All foods that contain carbohydrates, such as starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn), desserts, fruits, bread, pasta, and rice, can be tested for how they affect blood sugar levels after being eaten. Glycemic index is assessed by having one or more people eat a specific amount of a single food (usually 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate) and then measuring the change in blood sugar levels compared with the levels achieved after they have eaten a control food containing the same amount of digestible carbohydrate, such as white bread or glucose. The average change in blood sugar levels over a set period of time relative to the levels after consumption of the control food, usually white bread or glucose, is the food's glycemic index. Insulinemic index is measure with the same methodology.</detailed_description>
