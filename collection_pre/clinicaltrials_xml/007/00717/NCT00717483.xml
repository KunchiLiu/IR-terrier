	<brief_summary>The landmark study Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) clearly showed that intensive insulin management delays the onset and progression of longterm complications in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The same clinic trial also showed increased rate of severe hypoglycemia which required assistance. The risks of severe hypoglycemia, defined as loss of consciousness or seizure associated with hypoglycemia, include lower HbA1C, younger age, higher insulin dose, male sex, lower parental socioeconomic status, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, longer duration of disease, the presence of psychiatric disorders, and underinsurance. The purpose of this protocol is to explore the relationship between hypoglycemic seizures and BMI.</brief_summary>
