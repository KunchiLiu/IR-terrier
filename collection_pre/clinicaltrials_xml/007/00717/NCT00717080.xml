	<brief_title>The Role of Capsular Tension Ring (CTR) in Anterior Capsular Contraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract is a common complication in retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patient especially posterior sub capsular cataract. Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis is the preferred method of capsulotomy in cataract surgery. Anterior capsular contraction (ACO) is a unique complication following cataract surgery. The rate of which is higher in RP patients due to the weak zonules and the increased rate of inflammation. CTR has been proven to reduce the rate of contraction. Study population includes 40 eyes having RP with cataract. 20 eyes will receive CTR and the other 20 would not receive CTR. The percentage of anterior capsular contraction would be evaluated using EPCO software.</detailed_description>
