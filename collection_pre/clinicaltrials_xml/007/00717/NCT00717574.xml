	<brief_summary>The study hypothesizes that adding 60% nitrous oxide to a steady state sevoflurance or propofol anesthetic will lead to a decrease in both BIS and Entropy indices during a constant level of surgical stimulus</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition of Nitrous Oxide and Its Effects on Depth of Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitrous oxide is a widely used general anesthetic pas. It is often used in addition to a second, more potent agent. BIS and Entropy are depth of anesthesia monitors in clinical use. There are conflicting reports about the usefulness of these monitors when nitrous oxide is used as a part of the anesthetic regimen. While some studies demonstrate a decrease in BIS and Entropy, this study aims to investigate the effects of adding nitrous oxide to a sevoflurane or a propofol based anesthetic on BIS and Entropy indices.</detailed_description>
