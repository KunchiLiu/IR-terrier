	<brief_title>Association of Multiple Genetic Polymorphisms With Clozapine-Associated Metabolic Change in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of antipsychotics, especially clozapine and olanzapine is associated with metabolic side effects, which put patients with schizophrenia at risk for cardiovascular morbidity or diabetes. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 53.8% of patients who taking clozapine. The high interindividual variability in antipsychotic-induced metabolic abnormalities suggests that genetic makeup is a possible determinant. The genotypes of the multiple gene such as HTR2C, LEP, adrenergic receptor,PPAR,GNB3 are suggested to have associations with the metabolic side effects (weight,glucose,lipid,BP,metabolic syndrome) in patients using antipsychotics. We are going to investigate whether those multiple genetic polymorphisms are associated with the metabolic side effects in patients taking clozapine.</detailed_description>
