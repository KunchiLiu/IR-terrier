	<brief_summary>Oral Mucositis (OM) is a painful and debilitating side effect of many of the drug or radiation regiments used to treat cancer. This study examines the investigational drug SCV-07 and it's possible application in treating Oral Mucositis. Studies have shown that SCV-07 can possibly increase a broad immune system response, thus lowering the painful side effects experienced when treated for head and neck cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SCV-07 and it's ability to delay the onset of Oral Mucositis for patients receiving chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
