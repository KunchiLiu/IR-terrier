	<brief_summary>The general hypothesis of this research is that patients who have undergone treatments for Head Neck Cancer have a decreased quality of life and experience depression and fatigue. Increasing and sustaining physical activity of these patients will improve their emotional well-beings, increase their immunological response, improve wound healing, lessen fatigue and improve their general functionality and quality of life. The purposes of this study are to: (1) determine the effectiveness of the 12-week exercise intervention program in increasing physical activity in head and neck cancer patients; (2) determine if physically active patients differ in quality of life, depression and fatigue during the course of the study; and (3) determine if the change in physical activity levels is related to changes in the immune responses in human.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients 19 years of age or above (Nebraska legal age). 2. Patients diagnosed with HNC who are seen at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. 3. Patients who have undergone chemotherapy, radiation and/or surgery for their cancer. 4. Patients who have completed their cancer treatment at least 3 months prior. 5. Patients who have consented to participate in this study with approval by their physicians. 6. Patients who have no significant mental impairment. 1. Patients who are on enteral feeding. 2. Patients who are not able to walk or whose surgeons report that walking is not advisable. 3. Patients diagnosed with Lymphoma, Thyroid cancer or Melanoma. 4.
