	<brief_summary>38 patients with pruritus due to chronic cholestatic liver disease will be evaluated in an investigator initiated, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-week study assessing the effects of colesevelam on pruritus. Colesevelam is an oral, non-absorbable bile-acid sequestrant much more potent than cholestyramine but free of adverse effects. It is registered as a lipid lowering agent. The intensity of symptoms will be scored by means of daily Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Fatigue, quality of life and cutaneous scratch lesions will also be evaluated using quantitative instruments.</brief_summary>
