	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help in learning how well radiation therapy and chemotherapy work in killing tumor cells and allow doctors to plan better treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI scans to see how well they evaluate the effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Scans in Evaluating the Effects of Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme or Anaplastic Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To quantitatively compare the relative cerebral blood volume/flow, mean transit time, and mean vessel diameter as measured by perfusion-weighted MRI before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. - To measure the permeability-surface area product on a voxel-by-voxel basis before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in these patients. - To measure the full water self-diffusion tensor on a voxel-by-voxel basis before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in these patients. - To compare the tensor fractional anisotropy before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in these patients. - To compare the relative regional concentrations of choline, N-acetyl-asparate, and myoinositol as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy to interrogate cell membrane turnover, neuronal integrity, and glial reactions. - To test the affects of a short period of 100% oxygen inhalation on imaging of tumor and surrounding tissue regions of interest, specifically cerebral blood volume changes in each area as compared to room air. Secondary - To collect blood and urine samples for correlation analysis between imaging changes, molecular markers (including genetic markers), and clinical outcome of glioblastoma multiforme (phenotypic information). - To correlate blood and urine biomarkers and blood genetic markers with tumor expression of these markers. OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients also receive oral temozolomide once daily 7 days a week during radiotherapy. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 5 days. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo MRI, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy prior to initiation of chemoradiotherapy, once weekly during chemoradiotherapy, and then monthly until tumor progression or until completion of 6 courses of post chemoradiotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually.</detailed_description>
