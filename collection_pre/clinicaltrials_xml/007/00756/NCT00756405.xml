	<brief_summary>The aim of the Antioxidant Study is to compare the efficacy of foods naturally rich in antioxidants with that of antioxidants in a pill form on markers of inflammation and plasma cholesterol in healthy adults at risk of cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Dietary Antioxidants on Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing the amount of antioxidants in your diet is thought to be one way to improve your health. If antioxidants do have a beneficial effect, one way to measure that is to examine possible changes in the levels of "inflammatory markers" in your blood. Participants will be asked to consume an antioxidant supplement that may or may not include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Beta-carotene, and Selenium or a placebo for 8 weeks. The doses of antioxidants will be similar to the amounts suggested by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) recommended daily allowances (RDA). In addition, a group of participants will be asked to change their usual eating habits and consume more of certain foods that are naturally good sources of the four antioxidants contained in the pills. Eligible participants will be asked to come to the Stanford Campus for 3 fasting blood draws over the period of 8 weeks and to complete diet and physical activity questionnaires at the beginning, middle and end of the study period.</detailed_description>
