	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to determine whether oral citrulline administration enhances whole body protein synthesis in healthy humans in the postabsorptive state. Protein metabolism will be assessed using an intravenous infusion of stable isotope labeled leucine. The investigators hypothesize that citrulline supplementation will decrease leucine oxidation without altering proteolysis, and consequently stimulate protein synthesis .</brief_summary>
