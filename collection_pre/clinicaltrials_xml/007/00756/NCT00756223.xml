	<brief_summary>The main objective of this trial is to provide safety data in terms of drug-related adverse events for the recommendation of the dose for further trials in the development of BI 831266. Secondary objectives are the collection of antitumour efficacy data and the determination of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of BI 831266.</brief_summary>
