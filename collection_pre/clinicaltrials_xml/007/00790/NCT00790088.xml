	<brief_summary>The aim of the project is to document the international routine practice in sensor usage in patients treated with sensor-augmented pump therapy and to assess which variables (e.g. training of patients, frequency of sensor usage etc) are associated with an improvement in clinical outcome(s) from the start of the sensor use to the end of the follow-up period.</brief_summary>
