	<detailed_description>The success of bare metal coronary stenting is limited by the restenosis phenomenon, with rates depending on patient vascular morphology and lesion-related factors, the indication for and technique of stent deployment, and others. Drug-eluting stents (DES) improve the treatment of many coronary artery lesions by significantly reducing in-stent restenosis. However, there have numerous limitations resulting from the need for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy, the consequent bleeding risk (old patients, surgery, colon or gastric cancer, trauma), the unknown side-effects of long-term antiplatelet therapy, the cost associated with a long-term thienopyridine regimen, the body's reaction to the stent polymer, and the 0.2% per year increase in late stent thrombosis in comparison with bare metal stents (BMS). For these reasons, continuous research is devoted to improve the effectiveness of bare metal stents. The ideal stent should be non-thrombogenic, with a low rate of restenosis and late thrombotic events. The NUMEN stent has been designed to meet these criteria, using an extremely low stent strut thickness.</detailed_description>
