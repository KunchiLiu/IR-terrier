	<brief_summary>Children with primary resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma who do not achieve remission with conventional chemotherapy have extremely dismal prognosis. A novel treatment strategy combining tumor targeted radioisotope treatment with metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and immunotherapeutic effect of haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploSCT) followed by low-dose donor lymphocyte infusions will be piloted. The use of the isotope is aimed to decrease pre-transplant tumour burden. Reduced intensity conditioning containing Fludarabine, Thiotepa and Melfalan will enable sustained engraftment as well as will serve as additional anti-tumor treatment. A prompt natural killer (NK)-cell mediated tumour control may be achieved by haploidentical stem cell transplantation. The investigators hypothesize that tumour cells potentially evading NK-cell mediated immunity may be targeted by infused donor T-cells and eliminated by either MHC-dependent manner or through a bystander effect. The possible graft versus tumor effect will be evaluated in children with therapy resistant neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
