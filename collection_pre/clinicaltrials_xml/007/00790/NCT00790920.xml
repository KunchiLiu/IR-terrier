	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Desmoteplase to Treat Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute stroke is a major cause of mortality and long-term disability in the developed world. The only currently approved thrombolytic intervention for acute ischemic stroke, which constitutes the majority of strokes, is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rtPA). The use of alteplase is limited as it is approved for use within 3 hours after symptom onset and by the risk of inducing intracerebral haemorrhage; consequently fewer than 3% of acute stroke subjects are treated. The thrombolytic agent desmoteplase (recombinant Desmodus Salivary Plasminogen Activator alpha-1; rDSPAalpha-1) produced by recombinant biotechnology has its naturally occurring counterpart in the saliva of the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus. Compared to alteplase, desmoteplase has a more favourable profile in terms of high fibrin specificity and non neurotoxicity. The study aims to confirm efficacy and safety of desmoteplase for thrombolytic therapy of patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the extended time window of 3-9 hours after onset of stroke symptoms.</detailed_description>
