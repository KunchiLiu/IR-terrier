	<brief_title>Comparison of Ibuprofen, Cyclobenzaprine, or Both for Acute Cervical Strain: A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxants have been used extensively for neck and back pain since muscle spasm is thought to play a role in the cycle of pain and spasm. However, prior studies have conflicting results regarding their additive effect when given in addition to analgesics such as the NSAIDs. Because they have the potential to lead to adverse events their efficacy should be clearly demonstrated before their routine use.</detailed_description>
