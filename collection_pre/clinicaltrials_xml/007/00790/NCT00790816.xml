	<criteria>Participation in a Phase I lapatinib trial that has met its study objectives. Ability to understand and provide written informed consent to participate in this study. Male or female greater than or equal to 18 years of age. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods stated in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at baseline, and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception from two weeks prior to the administration of study drug and throughout the entire active study treatment period until four weeks after the last dose of study medication. Permanent discontinuation of lapatinib in the previous study due to intolerance or treatment failure. Is a pregnant or lactating female. Is considered medically unfit for the study by the investigator as a result of the medical interview, physical exam, or baseline investigations.
