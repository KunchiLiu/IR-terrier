	<brief_summary>This is a 5-year double blind, randomized, controlled, trial conducted at three treatment sites, aimed at showing the acute and longer-term effects of DCS augmentation of exposure-based CBT for panic disorder relative to placebo augmentation. By demonstrating that DCS can enhance the results of even a brief treatment strategy, we are seeking to validate an approach that fits well wtih teh practice limitations and applications of CBT in effectiveness studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exposure, D-Cycloserine Enhancement, and Genetic Modulators in Panic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this application, we propose to further validate and expand upon one of the apparent striking successes of translational research. Specifically, basic research on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction led to the examination of d-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist of the NMDA receptor in the amygdala, as an agent capable of enhancing extinction learning (Davis et al., 2006; Davis et al., in press). Following successful validation of this strategy in the animal laboratory (see Ledgerwood et al., 2005; Richardson et al., 2004), Ressler et al. (2004) showed that single doses of d-cycloserine (DCS) could enhance extinction in a human exposure paradigm for height phobic adults. This exciting initial finding was replicated by our research team for the treatment of social anxiety disorder (Hofmann et al., 2006), as well as an initial pilot study by our research team of the treatment of panic disorder (Tolin et al., 2006; see Preliminary Studies). As discussed by Anderson and Insel (2006), these findings have the potential to foster significant advances in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The present study represents the further application of DCS for augmenting the effects of exposure-based cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), now applied to the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In the current application, we propose a five-year study to show the acute and longer-term effects of DCS augmentation of exposure-based CBT relative to placebo augmentation. Our study is noteworthy for the use of a brief treatment strategy that has been shown to be successful in previous trials (e.g., Clark et al., 1999; Roy-Byrne et al., 2005) and has served as the basis for the DCS augmentation effect seen in a pilot study for this application (see Preliminary Studies). By demonstrating that DCS can enhance the results of even a brief treatment strategy, we are seeking to validate an approach that fits well with the practice limitations and applications of CBT in effectiveness studies (e.g., Katon et al., 2006; Roy-Byrne et al. 2005). Furthermore, by studying the genetic predictors of the overall response to CBT, and DCS augmentation in particular, we hope to further elucidate the nature of DCS augmentation and the selection of particularly responsive subgroups of patients in need. This agenda is in accords with "the ultimate goal of personalized therapy: identifying individual patterns of pathophysiology that indicate which pharmacological or behavioral treatment will be most useful for any individual patient" (Anderson &amp; Insel, 2006, p. 320). Our study design calls for a double blind, randomized, controlled, trial conducted at three treatment sites. Patient with panic disorder will randomly receive DCS or placebo 1 hour prior to sessions 3-5 of a 5-session CBT protocol that includes 2 additional booster sessions over the course of follow-up. We will enter a total of 192 patients over 5 years with the identical treatment protocol followed at each of the sites. Sites will nonetheless differ with respect to study management and analysis procedures.</detailed_description>
