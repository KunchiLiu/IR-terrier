	<brief_title>Automated Telephone Outreach With Speech Recognition to Improve Diabetes Care: A Randomized Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomly allocate a total of 1200 health plan members with diabetes to automated telephone outreach with speech recognition (ATO-SR; N = 600) or usual care (N = 600). The intervention is a series of three calls, using automated calls, originating from the health plan, using interactive speech recognition technology, spaced approximately 4-6 weeks apart, to encourage participants to fulfill the recommended testing (dilated eye examinations, glycated hemoglobin, LDL-cholesterol, microalbumin) that had not been performed received in the preceding year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or older Diabetes, defined as either 1) filled a prescription for insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent; or, 2) had two outpatient or one inpatient or two outpatients encounter claims with an ICD9CM or CPT code indicating diabetes. Gap in a key diabetes management metric as evidenced by no claim for a dilated eye examination in the prior 15 months and no claim for one or more of the following tests: glycated hemoglobin, LDLcholesterol, or microalbumin. (Individuals with evidence of having received ACEinhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were considered to have had a microalbumin test.) No primary care clinician in the data base Those who had previously asked the health plan to exclude them from research or quality improvement Women whose claim records contained diagnoses suggesting gestational diabetes</criteria>
