	<brief_title>An Open-label Study of Vedolizumab (MLN0002) in Participants With Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to treat people who have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This study will determine the safety profile of long-term vedolizumab treatment. The study enrolled 2243 patients. Participants who received either placebo or vedolizumab 300 mg IV infusion every 4 or 8 weeks in previous vedolizumab studies received: â€¢ Vedolizumab 300 mg All participants received vedolizumab intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for up to 46 months. This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study was up to March 2016 until vedolizumab was available in the country in which the participant resided, or until participant withdrawal, whichever came first. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic up to 16 weeks after receiving their last dose of vedolizumab and were being followed up for 2-years during which a safety questionnaire was administered by telephone for follow-up assessments.</detailed_description>
