	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of low molecular weight sulfated dextran (LMW-SD) on post-transplant islet function in people with T1D who have responded to intensive insulin therapy and have received kidney transplants. This study is taking place in Uppsala and Stockholm, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Low Molecular Weight Sulfated Dextran in Islet Transplantation After Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T1D is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple insulin injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin therapy allows long-term survival in individuals with T1D; however, it does not guarantee constant normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic survivors often develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease that can cause poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure and thus kidney transplant. Some individuals with T1D develop hypoglycemia unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable with medication and is characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia. For such individuals, pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation are possible treatment options. Rejection of these islets by the recipient's immune system, however, can make the treatment ineffective. An immune response known as instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) results in the disruption of islet integrity and islet loss within an hour of transplantation. LMW-SD inhibits IBMIR by preventing the cascade that triggers it, when combined with pancreatic islets. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of LMW-SD improving the outcome of islet transplantation by preventing IBMIR. Once a preparation of islets becomes available, participants will be randomly assigned to either the low molecular weight sulfated dextran (LMW-SD) Arm or to the Control Group/Standard of Care Arm. Participants in the LMW-SD Arm will receive LMW-SD before, with and for 5 hours after islet transplantation. Participants in the Control Group will receive heparin with the islet transplantation. All participants will also receive the oral medications, mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus and tacrolimus or cyclosporine throughout the study. In addition, they will receive either intravenous daclizumab on the day of islet transplantation and at Week 2, 4, 6, and 8 or intravenous basiliximab on the day of islet transplantation and on Day 4. The islet transplantation will occur at the hospital and will be given via the portal vein. All participants will be eligible to receive second and third islet transplantation(s) if previous transplants fail. After each islet transplantation, study visits will occur on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 75, and Months 6 and 12. At these visits, physical exams and blood collection will occur. At some visits urine collection will also occur.</detailed_description>
