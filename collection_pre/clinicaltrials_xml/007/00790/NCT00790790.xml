Mean score of 4 or greater on the 24hour average pain score from Visit 2 to Visit 3. Completion of electronic daily diaries with at least 70% complete between Visit 2 and Visit 3. Taken nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) less than 15 days over the past month AND not taken NSAIDs at least 1 week prior to Visit 3. Agree to maintain the same activity level throughout the study. Women who can become pregnant must test negative for pregnancy and agree to utilize medically acceptable/reliable birth control during the study and 1 month following the last dose of the study. Competent and freely able to give an informed consent. Ability to understanding and intelligibly communicate with the investigator.

Use of a cane in the hand opposite the index knee is acceptable. Body Mass Index over 40. Confounding painful condition that may interfere with assessment of the index knee. (Knee pain should be the predominant pain. Mild OA of the hands is allowed, for instance.) Diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis) or an autoimmune disorder (except inactive Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Received intraarticular hyaluronate or steroids, joint lavage, or other invasive therapies to the knee in the past 3 months.

Serious or unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, or hematologic illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical condition that in the opinion of investigator would compromise participation or be likely to lead to hospitalization during the course of the study. Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 2.0 times upper limit of normal at Visit 1, based on reference ranges of the central lab. Prior renal transplant, current renal dialysis, or serum creatinine laboratory value &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal based on the reference ranges of the central lab. Diagnosis or past history of glaucoma. Subjects with intraocular pressure &gt;24 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Are taking any excluded medications that cannot be discontinued at Visit 1. History of substance abuse or dependence within the past year, excluding nicotine and caffeine. Have a positive urine drug screen for any substance of abuse or excluded medication.
