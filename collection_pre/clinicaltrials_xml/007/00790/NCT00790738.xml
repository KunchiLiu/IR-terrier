	<brief_title>Liothyronine (T3) for Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder is a debilitating illness, and is characterized by depression episodes that dominates the longitudinal course and are most difficult to treat. Controlled trials with monotherapy mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate show little to no efficacy and antidepressants may offer no additional efficacy. Recently there has been a growing interest in the use of quetiapine in bipolar depression. However, a successful treatment may take up to 8 weeks, and full remission is achieved in only 50% of patients. Thyroid hormone augmentation strategies have been used in unipolar depression with good results, but there is a paucity of its efficacy in bipolar depression (BD). To our knowledge there are no controlled studies regarding the efficacy of thyroid augmentation in BD. The present study proposes to evaluate the efficacy of T3 as an augmentation to treatment as usual in the treatment of BD. We plan to enroll patients with bipolar disorder I or II who are currently presenting with depressive symptoms. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups - liothyronine or placebo Results will provide information on the possible role of thyroid hormone augmentation in the treatment of patients with bipolar depression, and may contribute to alleviate the burden of this disabling condition.</detailed_description>
