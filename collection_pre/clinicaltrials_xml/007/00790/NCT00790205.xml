	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial designed to assess the cardiovascular outcome of long-term treatment with sitagliptin used as part of usual care compared to usual care without sitagliptin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) having a history of cardiovascular (CV) disease and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.5% to 8.0%. Primary hypothesis A is that sitagliptin, when used as part of usual care, is non-inferior to usual care without sitagliptin with regard to the risk of developing a confirmed event in the primary CV composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) plus. If hypothesis A is satisfied: hypothesis B is that sitagliptin, when used as part of usual care, is superior to usual care without sitagliptin with regard to the risk of developing a confirmed event in the primary CV composite endpoint.</brief_summary>
