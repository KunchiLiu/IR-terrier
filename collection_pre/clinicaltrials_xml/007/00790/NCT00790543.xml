	<detailed_description>It is estimated that between 15-20% of children with Crohn's disease will develop complications that can require surgery within the first three years of diagnosis. The purpose of this study for children with a new diagnosis of Crohn's disease is to identify biomarkers found in the blood or stool to help predict which children are at risk of developing complications. A total of 2000 children with newly-diagnosed Crohn's disease will be enrolled within 30 days of diagnosis. Up to 28 medical sites in the United States and Canada will participate in the study.</detailed_description>
