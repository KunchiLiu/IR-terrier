	<brief_summary>This study aims to examine whether providing tube feeding with a formula enriched with omega-3 fats is better than traditional standard tube feeding in terms of preserving nutritional status, improving immune function and reducing medical complications following major upper Gut cancer surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Enteral Nutrition Enriched With Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) in Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title A double blinded randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of an enteral nutritional supplement enriched with Eicosapentaenoic acid on long term nutritional status post operatively specifically the maintenance of lean body mass, and its potential impact on quality of life as well as examining the stress response and immune function and in patients undergoing surgical treatment of esophageal cancer. Investigational medicinal Product(s): Prosure (Abbott Laboratories) Comparator: Ensure Plus (Abbott Laboratories) Study Objectives To examine whether prolonged supplementation with a nutritional supplement enriched with Eicosapentaenoic acid is superior to standard nutritional products in terms of promoting anabolism and improving quality of life in patients undergoing surgical treatment of esophageal cancer. Study Design - Prospective randomized controlled trial. Primary Endpoints: - Quality of life Scores using EORTC Questionnaires - Nutritional status on day 21 post oesophagectomy and/or total gastrectomy(specifically lean body mass) and at out patient follow up Secondary Endpoints: - Effects on the immuno-inflammatory response to surgery - Post operative Clinical outcome including SIRS, sepsis and organ failure</detailed_description>
