	<brief_title>Single Complete Compression Ultrasonography to Rule Out Deep Vein Thrombosis During Pregnancy and Postpartum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single distal and proximal leg veins compression ultrasonography has been shown to safely rule out the diagnosis of DVT when negative. The safety of this strategy has never been verified in pregnant or postpartum women. It could however be limited in that clinical setting, because of modified hemodynamics, hampered observation conditions, lack of respiratory modulation, higher proportion of isolated iliac deep vein thromboses. The objective of the EDVIGE study is to assess the safety of this diagnostic strategy during pregnancy and post-partum.</detailed_description>
