	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the safety of sterile becaplermin gel compared with sterile placebo gel treatment 12 months or more after the last dose was administered in 1 of 2 double-blind trials [neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the study drug (PDGF-DBFT-003 and PDGF-DBFT-005].</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Safety Follow-up of Becaplermin or Placebo Gel Following Treatment of Chronic, Full Thickness Diabetic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-visit, retrospective study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety of becaplermin gel 100 mcg/g versus placebo gel. Patients previously enrolled in protocol PDGF-DBFT-003 or PDGF-DBFT-005 were evaluated during a single-study visit in which retrospective safety data were collected. Recurrence data on the Target Ulcer were also obtained. The maximum number of patients in this study was the sum of patients enrolled in the 2 previous trials. The investigators made every effort to contact all patients enrolled in the previous double-blind trials in order to get follow-up information on as many patients as possible. If the patient was deceased, the cause of death, if known, was collected by the investigator (where permitted by the local authorities). After evaluation of the entrance criteria, demographic data, significant new intercurrent illnesses, a current medication profile, therapies received for the treatment of any diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer and surgeries in the last 12 or more months were collected and recorded. A questionnaire was used by the investigational staff to elicit patient information. At the visit, a complete physical examination was done (special attention was given to assess the presence of any malignancies), the feet were carefully examined and the footwear was assessed. The site of the Target Ulcer treated in the previous double-blind trial was assessed by an independent dermatologist.and photographs of the heel, back, inside and outside surfaces of the foot, as well as a distance photograph of the foot, were taken. Parameters such as major changes in the general health, (i.e., hospitalizations, major illnesses, and past surgeries), and past as well as present histories of any malignant diseases were carefully assessed. Of primary interest were the examination of previously treated ulcer site(s) and the Target Ulcer limb in general, for recurrences and/or new ulcerations; their treatments and outcomes; and any other relevant changes to the previously treated ulcer and the surrounding skin. Observational study - No study drug administered</detailed_description>
