	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Uniglide™ Mobile Bearing Unicondylar Knee System (investigational device)is not inferior when compared to the Uniglide™ Fixed Bearing Unicondylar Knee System (control device currently cleared) as measured by the Composite Clinical Success (CCS) endpoint.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uniglide™ Mobile Bearing Unicondylar Knee System vs the Uniglide™ Fixed Bearing Unicondylar Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthritic knees are the most common cause of long-term disability resulting in decreased mobility and increased pain. After other treatments for pain relief and return to activities of daily living fail, knee joint replacement is often the best option and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was introduced as an appropriate treatment for management of osteoarthritis when disease effects only a portion of the knee joint. This study is a prospective, comparative, randomized, double blind (patient and post-operative evaluator), multi-center clinical study under a common protocol to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Uniglide Unicondylar Mobile Bearing knee implant system.</detailed_description>
