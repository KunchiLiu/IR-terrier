	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to assess the impact on response to Herceptin-based therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. Tumor specimens from primary breast cancer will be analized for several biological factors potentially involved in Herceptin sensitivity. Tests that will be performed include: FISH analyses of EGFR, HER-2, HER-3, C-MYC, PTEN, MET, IGFR-1. Immunofluorecence of P95HER2. Mutation analyses of EGFR, HER-2, MET, C-MYC, PTEN, KRAS, PIK3CA, IGFR-1. Immunohistochemistry of the same biomarkers.</brief_summary>
