	<brief_title>Motor Learning of a Planning Task in Stroke Patients: the Maze Paradigm Measured Through Time and Error as Variables</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 post-stroke patients were comprised to the experimental group (EG) and 20 health subjects were included to the control group (CG. Inclusion criteria: chronic stroke, single stroke event, lesion in anterior circulation, right handed subjects, MEEM over 23 points. The task consisted in a maze paradigm, made by pencil and paper, with the non affected side for EG and left upper extremity for CG. The instruction was given to the subjects to complete the task as fast as possible. The study consisted in three phases: acquisition (AQ)with 30 trials, transfer (TR, short retention (R1)and long term retention (R2 both with 5 trials.</detailed_description>
