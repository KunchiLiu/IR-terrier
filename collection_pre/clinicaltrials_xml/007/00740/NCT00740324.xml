	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the additional administration of scopolamine butylbromide, glucagon or NPO-11 following a single intragastric dose of NPO-11 during endoscopy in healthy adult men. The safety will be evaluated based on adverse events and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed with NPO-11 + scopolamine butylbromide or glucagon, and following additional administration of NPO-11. The efficacy will be evaluated based on changes in the frequency of gastric peristalsis classification after the initial dose and the additional dose, and on the presence or absence of gastric peristalsis at each evaluation point.</brief_summary>
