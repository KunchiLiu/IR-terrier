	<brief_summary>This study is conducted in Europe. The main objective of the study is to assess the safety of self-titration in type 2 diabetic patients on antidiabetic tablets who are receiving insulin for the first time. The study will also look at the blood glucose control, frequency of dose adjustment, clinic visits, and time spent training patients to self-titrate. The objective of diabetes management is to achieve blood glucose levels as close as possible to normal in order to avoid late stage diabetic complications. Self-titration (where patients adjust insulin dosage themselves) offers the potential for better blood glucose control than titration only at clinic visits. In recent years treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom has moved from hospitals to GP surgeries or local clinics. Patients with type 2 diabetes, in general, have not been trained in self-titration to the same degree as patients with type 1 diabetes. Less experience in self-titration could impact the level of blood glucose control and outcome for these patients. Data from this study will be pooled with data from NN304-3714 (NCT00825643) and will be reported in the final study report for NN304-3714.</brief_summary>
