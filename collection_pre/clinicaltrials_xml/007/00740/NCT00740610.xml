	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how the body processes a drug), and activity of GS-9450 in preventing liver damage due to scarring, or fibrosis, caused by Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (also known as NASH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Activity of GS-9450 in Adults With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multicenter study investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of multiple oral doses of GS 9450 in adults with NASH. Approximately 110 subjects 18 75 years of age with elevated ALT (&gt; 60 U/L at screening), fatty liver on screening ultrasound, and biopsy-proven NASH will be randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to one of five parallel treatment groups (22 subjects per treatment group) as follows: GS-9450 1mg by mouth (PO) once daily, GS-9450 5 mg PO once daily, GS-9450 10 mg PO once daily, GS-9450 40 mg PO once daily, or Matching placebo PO once daily Qualifying subjects will be stratified by the presence/absence of type 2 diabetes (i.e., on/off oral diabetic medication at entry) and by geographic region (US and France). Following randomization, subjects will return within five business days later for a baseline visit, at which time they will be dispensed study medication and enter a 4-week treatment phase. Upon completion of the treatment phase, subjects will enter a 4 week off-treatment follow-up period. Each subject's participation in the study will last up to approximately 12 weeks (inclusive of screening, treatment phase, and off-treatment follow-up period).</detailed_description>
