	<brief_summary>The major cause of premature death in renal transplant recipients is cardiovascular disease. Sitagliptin stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon release, two central mechanisms in PTDM by interaction with a hormone system (incretins) that just recently it has become possible to modulate by drugs. Sitagliptin therefore is an interesting additional drug for the treatment of posttransplant diabetes mellitus in transplanted patients. The primary objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of sitagliptin on insulin secretion in renal transplant recipients. Secondary objectives are to study the effect on insulin sensitivity, fasting blood glucose, endothelial function, CsA/Tac blood concentrations.</brief_summary>
