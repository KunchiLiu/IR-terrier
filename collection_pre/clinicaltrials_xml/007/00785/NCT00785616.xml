	<brief_summary>This study will enroll completers of a prior 24 week MEMS cap study of Kaletra adherence, conducted in 2005 - 2006, and repeat the MEMS monitoring for an additional 24 weeks in 2008/2009 on the current antiretroviral anchor drug. The goals of the study are to correlate long-term adherence with virologic outcome, and to explore the stability of MEMS cap adherence measurements over time.</brief_summary>
