	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown that bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck decreases with increasing physical handicap (EDSS-score) in MS patients. Possible explanations are less weightbearing exercise or less UV-exposure resulting in reduced vitamin D generation in the skin. Prevention of osteoporosis is a high priority, because treatment of the established disease remains sub-optimal. We have designed a double-blind randomised controlled trial of two years' duration including 90-100 persons with MS age 18-50 to assess whether supplementation with vitamin D, given as a weekly dose of 20,000 IU cholecalciferol, can prevent bone loss. The primary objective of this study is to determine changes in BMD over the 2 year study period comparing treatment and placebo groups. The most important secondary objective is to determine cytokine profiles in blood samples. We will also assess parameters related to vitamin D status and physical performance.</brief_summary>
