	<brief_summary>In the past two years, subjects participated in a medical research study using the investigational drug called 123I-Iodine meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG)(pronounced "123 I oo dine-meta ioo doo ben zul gwan nid deen"). The sponsor of that study (GE Healthcare) is now interested in gathering data concerning heart failure subjects and cardiac events, since they were enrolled in the original study. There will be no injections of radioactive imaging agents or repeat imaging studies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject was a Heart Failure subject who signed informed consent for MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C. The subject was administered 123ImIBG in MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C. The subject completed the late planar imaging assessments (at a minimum) required by the protocols for MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C. The subject agrees to allow the investigator access to medical records, including those relating to subject death should this occur. The subject withdrew or was withdrawn from MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C. The subject was considered losttofollowup (6 months without contact) in MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C.</criteria>
