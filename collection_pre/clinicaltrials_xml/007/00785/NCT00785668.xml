	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of AER 001 Administered as a Dry Powder in Asthmatic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design - Single centre, single dose PK/safety study in male and female asthmatic subjects. - Approximately 10 subjects will be dosed. - Treatments will be administered by dry powder inhalation using a handheld device - Subjects will attend the Unit for screening and if eligible return to the Unit on the day of dosing (Day 1). Subjects will be required to stay overnight in the Unit and will be discharged on Day 2. - On study Day 1, subjects are to receive a single administration of AER 001. N.B. Screening will take place within 28 days prior to administration of AER 001. Primary objective: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of AER 001 administered as a dry powder in mild to moderate asthmatics. Secondary objective: To investigate the safety of AER 001 administered as a dry powder in mild to moderate asthmatics.</detailed_description>
