	<brief_title>A Study of IMC-A12 in Patients With Tumors Who No Longer Respond to Treatment or Who No Treatment if Available</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 administered weekly in patients with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histopathologicallydocumented, measurable, advanced primary or recurrent solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. ECOG performance status score of ≤ 2 at study entry Able to provide written informed consent Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months Adequate hematologic functions, as defined by: ANC ≥ 1500mm3, hemoglobin level ≥ 10 gm/dL, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Adequate hepatic function, as defined by: total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x the ULN, AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 x the ULN or ≤ 5 x the ULN if known liver metastases Adequate renal function, as defined by a serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x the ULN Ejection fraction within the normal institutional limits Use of effective contraception per institutional standard, if procreative potential exists At least 28 days must have elapsed from major surgery, prior chemotherapy, prior treatment with an investigational agent or device, prior radiation therapy (palliative radiation therapy is allowed), an open biopsy, or a significant traumatic injury to allow for adequate recovery. Ongoing side effects due to these agents must be ≤ grade 2 prior to entering the study. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed from nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, or monoclonal antibody (not targeting the IGFR) therapy to allow for adequate recovery. Ongoing side effects due to these agents must be ≤ grade 2 prior to entering the study. Accessible for treatment and followup. Patients enrolled in this trial must be treated at the participating center. Any concurrent malignancy other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with a previous malignancy but without evidence of disease for ≥ 3 years will be allowed to enter the trial. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stenting or myocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise patient safety or limit compliance with study requirements, patients with symptomatic brain metastases Serious or nonhealing active wound, ulcer or bone fracture Know HIVpositive History of hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorder within 9 months Proteinuria ≥ 1+ by routine urinalysis (patients with a protein value of ≤ 500mg confirmed by a 24hour urine collection are eligible) Pregnant (confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [βHCG]) or breast feeding History of prior treatment with other agents specifically targeting IGFRs Known diabetes Inability or unwillingness to interrupt steroidal or hormonal therapy for the duration of treatment with IMCA12 Positive antiIMCA12 antibody response History of allergic reactions to monoclonal antibodies or other therapeutic proteins Employees of the investigator or study center with direct involvement in this study or other studies under the direction of the investigator or study center, as well as family members of the employees.</criteria>
