	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether, in patients diagnosed with Vertical Heterophoria, the symptoms of dizziness, headache and / or anxiety are reduced or eliminated when a kind of correction called vertical prism is added to the patient's normal eye glass prescription. The experiment will involve giving the patient two pairs of glasses (one pair containing the baseline prescription with vertical prism (Standard Treatment Glasses) and the other pair containing the baseline prescription but without vertical prism (Placebo Glasses)) to demonstrate which pair of glasses is most effective in reducing the symptoms of dizziness, headache and / or anxiety in these patients.</brief_summary>
