	<brief_summary>Egg-banking would considerably simplify the logistics and means by which oocytes could be donated. These banks would make it easier to immediately provide oocytes that would be compatible to the recipient, shortening or even eliminating the problem of long waiting lists. Egg-banking would also allow the oocytes to be effectively quarantined, drastically diminishing the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in a fashion analogous to semen banks. The most essential prerequisite for a successful egg cryo-banking program is to have an efficient oocyte cryopreservation technology. Recent studies, including our own experience, have indicated that vitrified oocytes preserve intact their potential to fertilize and further develop into competent embryos, giving high clinical results as well as high survival rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate impact of the establishment of an egg-banking in our ovum donation program. Oocyte cryopreservation is carried out by Cryotop method. The study includes oocyte donation cycles conducted with fresh and vitrified oocytes. Recipients are allocated randomly into each group ("fresh vs. vitrified cycles"). Main outcome measures include survival, fertilization, embryo development and clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
