	<brief_summary>The drug being studied, fesoterodine fumarate helps prevent the bladder neck opening at unwanted times and has been shown to help patients with overactive bladder syndrome pass urine less frequently than before treatment. It is postulated that this drug will also prove effective in elderly patients (aged &gt; 65 years) and that the ability to change dose between 4 and 8mg will allow each patient to have an optimised treatment.</brief_summary>
