	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether one glaucoma eye drop is less likely to cause changes to the surface of the eye (conjunctiva) than another. The investigators plan to determine this theory by comparing the results when a patient is using two different prostaglandins, Xalatan and Travatan Z. (Both of these drops are presently on the market and are approved by the FDA for the treatment of eye pressure). Because this study will be masked, the clinician who reviews the study results will not know what study drop each patient has been using.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two groups will be entered into this study: group 1 will be naive to treatment and group 2 will be using Xalatan for at least one month. Both groups will be using one drop at bedtime of Xalatan in the right eye and one drop at bedtime of Travatan Z in the left eye.</detailed_description>
