	<brief_summary>Studies in the past have shown that yoga could relieve stress which is the most common trigger for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. Breathing exercises in yoga are found to influence the autonomic nervous system (particularly parasympathetic) and thus reduce palpitations. This study hypothesizes that patients with atrial fibrillation might benefit by practicing yoga. Yoga may also help to better control heart rate and rhythm when used in combination with usual medical management.</brief_summary>
