	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate family-led interventions for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients' symptoms (i.e., pain and thirst) that will involve ICU patients' family members in the non-pharmacological management of these symptoms. This family involvement may help to ameliorate not only patients' symptoms but also the families' symptoms and promote family satisfaction with ICU care.</brief_summary>
