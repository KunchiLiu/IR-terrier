	<brief_summary>Teduglutide is an investigative medicine being evaluated as a possible treatment for people with parenteral nutrition (PN) dependent Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). Teduglutide is similar to a protein the body makes. When people have SBS, their bodies do not make enough of the protein and they have trouble getting nutrients and fluids from the food they eat and drink. This study was designed to provide evidence of efficacy, safety, and tolerability of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg daily in SBS subjects.</brief_summary>
