	<brief_title>The Efficacy of GLP - 1(7-36) Amide for Glycemic Control in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients whom on admission to the ICU (surgical, burn, &amp; cardiac) who are expected to receive intensive insulin therapy for at least 72 hours are eligible to be enrolled. Once enrolled, the patients will be randomized to one of two groups: the experimental (intravenous GLP-1 infusion for 72 hours) or control groups (intravenous 0.9% NaCl infusion for 72 hours) in a double masked fashion. While enrolled, all patients will receive standard-of-care insulin therapy. Both groups will be maintained on the standard ICU specific protocol for glucose control.</detailed_description>
