	<brief_summary>Background: - Up to 30% of children and adolescents with Crohn's disease have decreased bone strength, or decrease bone density, called osteopenia. - Bisphosphonates are a group of drugs that have been well studied and found to be effective in the treatment of osteopenia in menopausal women. - Zoledronate is a very potent third generation bisphosphonate, that is safe and easy to administer, and has been found effective in the treatment of menopausal women with osteopenia. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that zoledronate can improve bone density in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease with osteopenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate for Osteopenia in Pediatric Crohn's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This study is recruiting 40 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 18, who have a proven abnormal bone density as measured on a special type of x-ray called a DEXA-scan. - Participants are allocated at random to one of two groups: either treatment with zoledronate, or a placebo. - Neither the participants or the physicians are aware of which group each participant is in. - Participants are followed every three months for one year, and assessed with blood tests, urine tests, physical examination, diet questionnaire and exercise questionnaire. - Participants have a repeat DEXA scan at 6 and 12 months after beginning the study. - Once all participants are enrolled and followed for one whole year, we will compare the bone density of the group treated with zoledronate with the group treated with placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients aged 6 to 18, diagnosed with Crohn's disease with osteopenia, a minimum of 6 months of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. (Osteopenia was defined for the purposes of this study as: Zscore lumber spine BMD by DEXA of 2.0 or less, or 1.5 and a risk factor (either steroid use for 6 months or more or decrease of 0.5 zscore in the preceding 12 months).) renal dysfunction, insufficient calcium or vitamin D intake, current medication or condition affecting bone metabolism, documented fracture, previously diagnosed bone disease, documented intolerance/hypersensitivity to bisphosphonates, previous treatment with bisphosphonates within the last 6 months.</criteria>
