	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether brief use of an externally implantable tissue expansion device following excisional skin cancer surgery will significantly reduce the diameter of the final wound defect, and hence the length of the final linear primary closure. The secondary objective is to assess the functional benefits, if any, associated with use of the tissue expander.</brief_summary>
