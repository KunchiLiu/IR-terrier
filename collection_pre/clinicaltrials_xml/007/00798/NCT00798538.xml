	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, cost and effectiveness of interventions designed to integrate buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence into HIV primary care in ten HIV care centers in the U.S. In the site led by Dr. Altice, we compare two models of providing HIV care and buprenorphine treatment. Assignments are based on participants' city of residence. In the onsite (integrated care) model, participants receive buprenorphine, substance abuse counseling and HIV care at one location: the Waterbury Hospital Infectious Disease Clinic. In the off-site model (non-integrated care) buprenorphine induction, substance abuse counseling, and HIV care will be provided at separate locations: the Community Health Care Van (CHCV), the Yale AIDS Program, and patients' own HIV providers, respectively. Data is collected from interviews with participants, reviews of medical records, and surveys and interviews with clinicians.</brief_summary>
