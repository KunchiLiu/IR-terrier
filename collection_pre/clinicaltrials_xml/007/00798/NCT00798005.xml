	<brief_summary>Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (PAOD) is a condition caused by ischemia in the legs due to atherosclerotic disease affecting the larger arteries of the legs. Chronic PAOD can be regarded as a marker of generalized atherosclerosis. PAOD threatens the survival of an extremity and often causes lifelong disablement from a painful leg. The clinical consequences of PAOD include pain on walking (claudication), pain at rest and loss of tissue integrity in the distal limbs.A variety of medical therapies have been investigated for patients with PAOD. There is currently no evidence to suggest that any medical therapy is effective for patients with rest pain and/or ischemic ulcers. Also, the use of intramuscular angiogenic VEGF-A gene transfer has recently demonstrated a improvement in clinical and hemodynamic status in patients with severe PAOD</brief_summary>

Poor/not candidates for revascularization Exclusion criteria 1. Previous or current history of malignant disease. 2. Positive cancer screening (liver, prostate, colon, cervix, breast, lung) 3. Successful lower extremity surgery (bypass/angioplasty of the leg to be treated) within 3 months prior to the first administration of study treatment [Day 1]). 4. Patients planned to undergo amputation of target limb within 1 month following the first administration of study treatment. 5. Patients with a history of severe renal failure. 6. Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL (176 µmol/L) or estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL. 7. Serious concomitant medical conditions not adequately controlled (other than severe PAD), 8.
