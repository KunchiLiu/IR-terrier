	<brief_title>Vorinostat and Bortezomib as Third-line Treatment in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains inadequate. Vorinostat is a novel agent that inhibits the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Bortezomib is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the advantages of combining these two agents in the treatment of NSCLC</detailed_description>
