	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to assess the role of pyloric drainage procedure on altering the reflux effect on the quality of life in patients who underwent esophagectomy. Researchers hypothesize that the patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomies without pyloric drainage experience less reflux symptoms and therefore have a better quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life After Esophagectomy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery is considered curative for patients with esophageal cancer. The minimally invasive approach was developed such that laparoscopy and thoracoscopy replace large abdominal and thoracic incisions. For both open and minimally invasive procedures, patients have many adjustments to overcome in order to regain quality of life that is within the norm. In a recent study on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) after curative surgical resection, symptoms of reflux was the only variable that worsened with statistical significance. The study plan is to retrospectively compare two groups of patients: those who underwent esophagectomy with pyloric drainage procedure and those who did not. The study will be done using all MD Anderson patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomies, in which pyloroplasty and pyloromyotomy are not standard procedures. Clinically relevant data and demographic information will be collected retrospectively for the two groups including age, gender, Body Mass Index, level of anastomosis, and time elapsed since surgery. All patients will be interviewed via telephone. At least two attempts will be made to contact each patient.</detailed_description>
