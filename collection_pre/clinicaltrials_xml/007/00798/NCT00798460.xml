	<brief_title>Efficacy of Clevudine Plus Lamivudine for Lamivudine-resistant Chronic Hepatitis B Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lamivudine with adefovir combination therapy has been known as effective antiviral therapy for lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B patients. It is superior to adefovir monotherapy since the incidence of viral breakthrough of combination therapy used to be less than that of adefovir monotherapy in lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B patients. Clevudine, which is being marketed in Korea, is a nucleoside analogue of the unnatural beta-L configuration that has potent activity against HBV. It has demonstrated potent antiviral efficacy and significant biochemical improvement after 24 weeks of therapy. We hypothesized that clevudine plus adefovir combination therapy for lamivudine resistant patients might be as effective as the lamivudine plus adefovir combination therapy. In detail, we designed to perform this clinical study comparing the combination of clevudine and adefovir with lamivudine plus adefovir in lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B patient. Total treatment duration of both groups will be 12 months, and compare the efficacy of antiviral effects of these drugs.</detailed_description>
