	<brief_summary>Participants with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) will be randomized to SCH 727965 or gemtuzumab ozogamicin. All participants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will receive SCH 727965. Part 1 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with AML and participants with ALL. Part 2 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with AML who experienced disease progression after standard treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin during Part 1.</brief_summary>
