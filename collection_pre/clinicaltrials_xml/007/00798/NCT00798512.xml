	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to detect new ischemic lesions after carotid artery stenting (with the Cristallo Ideale stent), in patients with high grade carotid artery stenosis, by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), using the endovascular proximal flow blockage (Mo.Ma device) for cerebral protection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. ≥ 18 years old; 2. Eligibility for carotid artery revascularization; 3. A significant stenosis in symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% Diameter Stenosis (%DS) or asymptomatic ≥ 80 %DS as defined by angiography. Symptomatic is defined as a carotid artery stenosis associated with ipsilateral TIA, amaurosis fugax, ischemic stroke or retinal infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment. 4. Suitable clinical conditions to perform DWMRI. 5. Written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site. 1. Female with childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test. 2. Lifeexpectancy less than 6 months. 3. Underlying disease of the carotid artery other than atherosclerosis (e.g. vasculitis, traumatic dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia). 4. Prior stenting in the target vessel; 5. Patients with chronic or recurrent atrial fibrillation. 6. Patient has had a Myocardial Infarction within 72 hours prior to the procedure. 7. Patient experienced a stroke within 4 weeks prior to the procedure. 8. History of severe disabling stroke according to the modified Rankin scale &gt; 4. 9. Severe renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL). 10. Severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease, which might impede a safe introduction of a 9Fsheath for the use of a Mo.Madevice. 11. Any known allergies and / or intolerances to the following: ASA, Clopidogrel, Statins, Heparin, Nitinol, contrast agents (that cannot be adequately premedicated). 12. Patient currently participating in an investigational drug or device study which has not reached the primary endpoint yet or which clinically interferes with the DESERVE study endpoints. 13. Any planned major surgery within 30 days after the study procedure. 14. In the investigators opinion patient has a severe comorbid condition(s) that could limit the ability to participate in the study. Angiographic exclusion criteria: 15. Totally occluded internal carotid artery considered as the target vessel. 16. Multiple internal carotid artery stenoses or lesion longer than 4 cm (whichever occurs) that cannot be covered by one (1) stent. 17. Severe ostial stenosis of the common carotid artery. 18. The presence of ipsilateral intracranial stenosis that requires treatment. 19. Contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid arteries associated with a poor collateral flow through the circle of Willis. 20. An aortic arch anatomical complexity that may preclude the safe placement of the Mo.Ma device including particularly, the impossibility to navigate a stiff guide wire into the external carotid artery.</criteria>
