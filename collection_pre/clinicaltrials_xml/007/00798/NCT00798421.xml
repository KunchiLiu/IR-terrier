	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether influenza can be reliably transmitted from children to susceptible contacts in a health care setting. The goal is to develop a transmission that can then be used to assess interventions to prevent transmission Research objectives: To develop a model to investigate the frequency of influenza transmission from an infected child to a susceptible health care worker Research Hypotheses: Influenza viruses can be transmitted from infected children to exposed health care workers</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CHildren with influenza infection presenting to ED will be identified by RAT. Healthy healthcare worker subjects will expose themselves and perform specific activities with the child. subjects will be followed by diary card, clinical symptom scores and virology swabs to assess frequency of transmission</detailed_description>
