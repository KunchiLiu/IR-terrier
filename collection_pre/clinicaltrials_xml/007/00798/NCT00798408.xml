	<brief_summary>We propose to critically evaluate the effects of energy-yielding fluids and solids on acute appetite variables, daily food intake, and specific endocrine and metabolic response to food in the elderly. The results of these studies will provide further evidence to support that nutrition may provide safe and effective non-pharmacological therapies to counter the compromised regulation of energy balance experienced by many elderly people.</brief_summary>
