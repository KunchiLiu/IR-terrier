	<brief_summary>The objective of the randomised part of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BI 1356 plus metformin compared to BI 1356 or metformin alone given for 24 weeks to drug naive or previously treated (4 weeks wash-out, 2 weeks placebo run-in) type 2 diabetic patients with insufficient glycaemic control. For the open-label part of the study the objective is to estimate the efficacy and safety of BI 1356 and metformin in type 2 diabetic patients with very poor glycaemic control for 24 weeks</brief_summary>
