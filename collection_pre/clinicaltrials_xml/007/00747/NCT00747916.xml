	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and side effects of the CryoSpray Ablation(TM) System (CSA(TM) System) to treat neoplastic lesions on the parietal pleural surface.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy, and Side Effects Study of Interventional Cryotherapy in the Pleural Space("ICE PLS")</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a pilot study consisting of an estimated 10 subjects with biopsy-proven metastatic cancer in the parietal pleural surface treated with CryoSpray at dye marked metastatic foci. Initial treatment dosimetry will be up to 3 cycles of 10-40 second sprays. If necessary, dosimetry changes may occur after 3 subjects are treated and observed. It is unknown if dosimetry will need to be increased to enhance effectiveness. The PI may increase dosimetry by 1 cycle after each subject is treated and observed as a conservative approach to efficacy determination. If disease exists bilaterally, only one side will be sprayed.</detailed_description>
