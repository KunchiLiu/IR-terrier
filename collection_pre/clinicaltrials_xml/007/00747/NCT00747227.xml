	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new investigational modified light transmission monofocal intraocular lens compared to a conventional intraocular lens (IOL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of a Violet Visible Light Blocking Intraocular Lens (IOL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational IOL will be found to be safe and effective with respect to visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity and complications and will be similar to results for the ZA9003 control eyes. Complication rates and adverse event rates will be within the FDA grid for posterior chamber IOLs.</detailed_description>
