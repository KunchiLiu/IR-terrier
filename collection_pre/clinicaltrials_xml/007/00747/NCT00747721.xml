	<criteria>Written informed consent obtained from the patient's legal representative according to local regulations before starting any study procedures other than prescreening Patients sedated and ventilated in ICU for whom sedation is expected to be clinically required for at least 24 hours, as determined by the responsible physician Prescribed light to moderate sedation (target RASS = 0 to 3) Acute severe intracranial or spinal neurological disorder due to vascular causes, infection, intracranial expansion or injury Uncompensated acute circulatory failure at screening (severe hypotension with mean arterial pressure(MAP) &lt; 55 mmHg despite vasopressor and inotrope therapy) Heart rate (HR) &lt; 50 beats/min for longer than 5 min between screening and starting study treatment Atrioventricular (AV)conduction block IIIII (unless pacemaker installed) Severe hepatic impairment (e.g. bilirubin &gt; 101 μmol/L) Need for continuous muscle relaxation Any condition which would significantly interfere with the collection of study data Burn injuries or other conditions requiring regular anesthesia or surgery Use of centrally acting alpha2 agonists or antagonists within 24 hours prior to starting the study (e.g. dexmedetomidine, clonidine, tizanidine, apraclonidine and brimonidine) Known allergy to dexmedetomidine or any excipients of the study treatment Patients who have or are expected to have treatment withdrawn or withheld due to poor prognosis Patients receiving sedation for therapeutic indications rather than to tolerate the ventilator (e.g. epilepsy) Patients unlikely to require continuous sedation during mechanical ventilation (e.g. GuillainBarré syndrome) Patients who are unlikely to be weaned from mechanical ventilation; e.g. diseases/injuries primarily affecting the neuromuscular function of the respiratory apparatus such as clearly irreversible disease requiring prolonged ventilatory support (e.g. high spinal cord injury or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)</criteria>
