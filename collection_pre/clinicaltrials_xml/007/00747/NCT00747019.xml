	<brief_title>Prosocial Behavior and Exercise Among Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although only a small percentage of older adults engage in habitual physical activity, previous studies have demonstrated interventions that include cognitive-behavioral strategies can enhance long-term, independent physical activity. In addition, there are episodic charity events, such as charity walks, that attract large numbers of participants of all age ranges to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity. These actions are a form of prosocial behavior, defined as voluntary, intentional behavior that results in benefits for another. The opportunity to help others seems to be a motive in inspiring these individuals to at least engage in one session of moderate physical activity. Thus, the current research project contemplates whether prosocial behavior may be implemented as a viable behavioral incentive for long-term physical activity. Both the Prosocial Behavior Physical Activity (PBPA) group and the Physical Exercise (PE) group will receive a cognitive-behavioral intervention to teach participants the behavioral skills necessary to engage in long-term (9-month) independent physical activity. Both programs will provide supervised exercise sessions so that participants learn how to safely and effectively engage in physical activity, and both programs will help participants set goals for activity and overcome barriers to exercise. However, in PBPA group, participants will be able to also earn boxes of food for donation to a charity based upon their physical activity.</detailed_description>
