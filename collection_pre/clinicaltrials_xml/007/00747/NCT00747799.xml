	<brief_summary>This study is a phase II clinical study. Recurrence after radiotherapy patients who are failure of radiotherapy in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were treated by cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with Sorafenib as first-line treatment. The objective response(complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)), Disease Control Rate , safety profile, tolerability will be evaluated according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.</brief_summary>
