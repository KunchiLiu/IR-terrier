	<brief_title>IGFD Registry: A Patient Registry for Monitoring Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Increlex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data collected for a patient will be those that exist in the patient's medical record as part of standard medical care. No additional patient procedures or activities are mandated by this study. The specific data to be collected at each visit and the schedule of data collection are listed in a schedule of assessments. The collection of safety events is considered essential to the Registry. The website will provide the opportunity to report the occurrence of targeted adverse events (AEs), other important events considered to be related to Increlex administration and serious adverse events (SAEs).</detailed_description>
