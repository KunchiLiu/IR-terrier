	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if, once a favorable dose of TI Inhalation Powder is established for either a type 1 or 2 patient, based on a average diabetic meal, the patient's favorable dose can be used safely, regardless of change in meal carbohydrate content. Patients were randomly assigned to various carbohydrate loads (0%, 50%, 100%, 150% or 200%). The 100% carbohydrate load was determined based upon their standard insulin dose for their normal meal.</brief_summary>
