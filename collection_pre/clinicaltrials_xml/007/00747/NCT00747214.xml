	<brief_title>A Study Comparing CRx-102 Plus Disease-modifying Anti-rheumatic Drug (DMARD) Therapy to Placebo Plus DMARD Therapy in RA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to: • Compare the response of CRx-102 plus DMARD therapy to placebo plus DMARD therapy in lowering CRP levels in rheumatoid arthritis subjects. The secondary objectives of this study were to: - Evaluate the changes in inflammatory cytokines in subjects treated with CRx-102 plus DMARD therapy to placebo plus DMARD therapy. - Evaluate the efficacy of CRx-102 plus DMARD therapy to placebo plus DMARD therapy using ACR-20 and DAS28 indices as well as fatigue scales.</detailed_description>
