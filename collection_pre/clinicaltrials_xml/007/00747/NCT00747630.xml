	<brief_title>Evaluating the Efficacy of a Video Based Intervention to Educate Teen Moms About Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Teenage mothers are asked to participate in the study and then randomized into an intervention or control group. Both groups take a multiple choice survey and then are randomized to either watch a video about FAS or not. After the video (or not for the controls) they then take a post video short answer survey. The survey results are then scored and statistical analysis performed to determine whether the video intervention increased their knowledge about FAS and their likelihood to drink alcohol during pregnancy.</detailed_description>
