	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Intravenous Lipotecan® (TLC388 HCl for Injection) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipotecan® is a drug product of TLC388 HCl, which is a potent camptothecin analog with cytotoxic activities against a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro and anti-tumor activities in several xenograft models with human tumor cell lines. Structurally, TLC388 HCl is related to other camptothecins, but it has been chemically modified to improve stability and potency, and to minimize toxicities.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients defined by age ≥18 years. Pathologically confirmed advanced solid tumors for which standard therapy proven to provide clinical benefit does not exist or is no longer effective Evaluable disease, either measurable on imaging or with informative tumor marker(s), by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrolment. Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate birth control (barrier methods with spermicides, oral or parenteral contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices) during the entire duration of the study, or the patient must be surgically sterile (with documentation in the patient's medical records). Previous malignancy, except for nonbasalcell carcinoma of skin or carcinomainsitu of the uterine cervix, unless the tumor was treated with curative intent more than 2 years prior to study entry. Receipt of more than 3 prior regimens of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to baseline. Receipt of radiotherapy to &gt;25 % of bone marrow. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to baseline. Concomitant treatment with, or anticipated use of, pharmaceutical or herbal agents which are potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes unless approved by the Sponsor. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would jeopardize patient safety, interfere with the objectives of the protocol, or limit patient compliance with study requirements, as determined by the Investigator.</criteria>
