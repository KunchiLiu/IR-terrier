Anti-histaminic, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are forbidden. The patient is requested to evaluate his state of symptoms by recording in a diary - the pain or feeling of facial oppression; - nasal dripping anterior or posterior; - nasal congestion. SCALE 0 = no symptom 1. = mild symptom: clearly perceptible, but easily tolerated 2. = moderate symptom: clear awareness of the symptom, that is annoying but tolerable 3. = severe: symptom very annoying, difficult to tolerate, interfering with the ordinary life Four measures per day (2 for administration of the therapy - before/after) of which the median will be used; plus an evening measure "retrospective" of the past 12 hours. If possible it will be assessed the status of paranasal sinuses before and after the treatment with a CT scan. The treatment intervals is the week. After baseline and start of treatment, are planned two control visit. The subject will complete the study at the first control visit without symptoms.
