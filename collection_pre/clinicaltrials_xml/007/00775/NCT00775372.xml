	<brief_title>Bioequivaelnce Study of Clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL Powder for Oral Suspension Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence, single-dose, crossover fully replicated, bioavailability study on clarithromycin formulations comparing clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL powder for oral suspension of Ranbaxy Laboratories with BiaxinÂ® granules 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed conditions A single oral dose of clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL was administered during each period under supervision of a trained Medical Officer. During the course of study, the safety parameters including vital signs, physical examination, medical history, clinical laboratory and safety tests (haematology, biochemical parameters) were assessed and, clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology &amp; biochemical parameters) were performed again at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
