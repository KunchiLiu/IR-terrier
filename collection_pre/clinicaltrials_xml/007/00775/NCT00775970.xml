	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether walking exercise after dietary treatment of obesity is associated with a decrease of the daily spontaneous physical activity and\or with an increase of the time spent in sedentary activities. Our hypothesis is that the practice of walking as an exercise during the phase of weight stability following the dietary treatment of obesity leads to a reduction of spontaneous physical activity and\or to an increase in the time spent in sedentary activities.</brief_summary>
