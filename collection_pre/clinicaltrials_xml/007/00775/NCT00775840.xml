	<brief_title>Efficacy of Candesartan on Symptomatic Heart Failure in Treating Diabetic and Hypertensive Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart diseases are the number one cause of death in developed countries and in particular chronic or congestive heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients older than 65 years. It is still increasing in prevalence and, in spite of significant advances in therapy, mortality rates remain high: 30% to 40% of patients with advanced disease, and 5% to 10% of patients with mild symptoms will die within 5 to 10 years. A relevant proportion of the heart failure patients (30 - 50%) suffering from edema and dyspnea have normal or minimally impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (preserved left ventricular ejection fraction) with diastolic abnormalities in echocardiography. Features of diastolic dysfunction are the stiffness, the decreased compliance and the impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. As a result, the left ventricle has a limited filling capacity during a normal left atrial pressure. Hypertension and/or diabetes are the most predisposing conditions whereas left ventricular hypertrophy is regarded as the linking intermediate pathological condition. Moreover, recent studies showed that patients with symptomatic heart failure and an ejection fraction greater than 40% have a poor prognosis with relatively high mortality and hospitalization rates. Thus, in hypertensive patients, diastolic dysfunction has shown to be a predictor of morbidity. Diastolic dysfunction is also a frequent finding in type 2 diabetes without symptoms and signs of heart disease. As long as it is independent of ischemic heart disease, it is presumably due to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Once aggravated to heart failure, diastolic dysfunction often coexists with systolic dysfunction as a consequence of coronary artery disease with a limited coronary reserve. This study will determine whether pharmacological intervention into the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System exerted by the Angiotensin-Receptor Blocker Candesartan on top of an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor-based therapy may lead to a significant drop of N-terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide. This neurohormonal laboratory marker is sufficient enough to simultaneously indicate the improvement of the causing diastolic dysfunction and associated heart failure symptoms as assessed by objective echocardiographic and clinical parameters. Total time for participants in this study is approximately 26 weeks.</detailed_description>
