BCLC stage A can occasionally be included provided that other treatment options are unavailable Measurable disease: At least one measurable lesion (longest diameter ≥20 mm on conventional CT or MRI scan; ≥ 10 mm on spiral CT) according to RECIST criteria that has not been previously locally treated by irradiation, surgery, ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolisation Confirmation of HCC disease by histology (preceding liver resection or fine needle biopsy within the last 12 months); Liver Function: Child A and B Tumor extent: CLIP Score ≤ 3 ECOG Performance Status 02 (=KarnofskyIndex ≥ 60%) Patient had received any prior systemic treatment (possible exception: sorafenib for a maximum of 3 months, last dose received at least 28 days before study inclusion) Patient had a major surgery, local ablative treatments (RFA, PEI), or transarterial chemoembolisation therapy within 4 weeks prior to randomisation Presence of a secondary malignancy either at the time of screening or in the past 5 years: An exception from this rule can be made in patients that were treated in curative intention within the last 3 years and are without any evidence of recurrence of this malignancy. History or presence of central nervous system (CNS) disease (i.e., primary brain tumor, malignant seizures, CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis) or other mental illness. Clinically serious infections or uncontrolled infection (including HIV infection), increased risk for acquisition of opportunistic infections Chronic treatment with systemic steroids or another immunosuppressive agent Inadequate organ functions, characterised by: cholestasis with elevated levels of bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3x UNL (can be improved by biliary drainage if necessary) and/or elevated transaminases (ALAT/ASAT) ≥ 5 x UNL, hypoalbuminemia &lt; 2.5 g/dl, renal impairment (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x UNL ), inadequate Hematology: Platelets &lt; 75.000, ANC &lt; 1500, hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 mg/dl, inadequate coagulation status, namely INR &gt; 2 or Quick &lt; 50%, aPTT &gt;50 sec in the absence of any drugs interfering with coagulation such as warfarin, phenprocoumon, NMH or UFH.

Patients with unhealed gastrointestinal ulcerations or wounds Patients with a history of one of the following: bowel perforation, colon diverticulitis Any relevant findings on screening colonoscopy History of any thromboembolic events (except for portal vein infiltration and/or thrombosis) Allergic reactions or intolerance to previous drug exposure to RAD001 or bevacizumab; having received any of the study medications within the last 3 years before randomisation Allergy or intolerance against CHOcell products or other recombinant human or humanised antibodies Patients with an increased risk for the development of lymphoma or other malignant diseases, especially concerning the skin Patients with rare hereditary disorders like galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption</criteria>
