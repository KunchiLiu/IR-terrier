	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving clofarabine together with temsirolimus may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving clofarabine together with temsirolimus works in treating older patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine and Temsirolimus in Treating Older Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the complete response rate in older patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia when treated with low-dose clofarabine and temsirolimus. Secondary - To determine the tolerability and safety of this regimen. - To determine the duration of response. - To determine the duration of survival. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Induction therapy: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues for 1-2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Maintenance therapy: Patients achieving morphologic complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each month. Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
