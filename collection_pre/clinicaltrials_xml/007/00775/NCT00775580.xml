At the discretion of the investigator(s), these volunteers may be enrolled if the medication is not anticipated to alter study integrity. 7. Regular smoking of more than 5 cigarettes daily or the daily use of nicotinecontaining products beginning 3 months before study medication administration through the final evaluation. 8. If female, the subject is lactating or has a positive pregnancy test at screening and prior to each of the treatment periods. Females must use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study period and for one week after the study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or her partner are: oral contraceptives/patches, progestin injection or implants, condom with spermacide, diaphragm with spermacide, IUD, vaginal spermicidal/hormonal suppository, surgical sterilization of themselves or their partner(s) or abstinence.
