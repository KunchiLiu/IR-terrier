	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Different Methods of Support With Stopping Smoking (PORTSSS/Stop Together Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is evidence from other studies that telephone helplines are effective in helping individuals to stop smoking. This study will investigate whether or not two interventions that have been proven effective in other contexts are effective when offered via telephone helplines. The two interventions which will be tested are (1) additional proactive counselling via telephone(several calls from a trained smoking cessation advisor over a certain period) and (2) the offer of Nicotine Replacement Therapy. This trial will determine whether or not: (1)additional (proactive) telephone support for smoking cessation delivered to users of the National Health Service (NHS)Smoking Helpline, is more effective than standard support given by the helpline, and (2) whether the offer of free Nicotine Replacement Therapy influences rates of stopping smoking in individuals receiving either standard (reactive) or proactive telephone support. Current smokers over 16 years of age will be recruited by helpline staff with the appropriate consent. Participants will then be randomised into one of four groups: (i) usual care delivered by the helpline (called the Together Programme) (ii) usual care plus a programme of proactive telephone counselling (iii) usual care AND the offer of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) (iv) usual helpline support, proactive telephone counselling AND the offer of NRT. The researchers will not be aware of which group participants have been allocated. The results will determine if the use of proactive telephone counselling is effective in helping individuals to stop smoking. It shall also find out if the offer of NRT medication via a telephone helpline assists individuals in their efforts to stop smoking.</detailed_description>
