	<brief_summary>A media lab study will be conducted to determine the mechanism by which podcasting may exert an effect. This study will examine both physiological (heart rate, skin conductance, etc.) and psychosocial (knowledge, perceived control, elaboration, etc.) measures in participants listening to a podcast on health versus reading health content on the Web. We hypothesize that podcasting will create a greater physiological response than the Web. There will also be more elaboration in the podcasting group. Podcasting will produce greater feelings of control. Changes in knowledge will be greater in the Web group.</brief_summary>
