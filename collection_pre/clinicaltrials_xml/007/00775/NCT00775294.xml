	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to look at how the body handles the drug maraviroc. It will measure the amount of maraviroc in blood, semen, saliva and in the rectum of men. The aim is to understand how much of the drug (taken by mouth) reaches the oral, reproductive and intestinal tracts. It is believed that the presence of this drug in these areas may be beneficial in preventing the AIDS virus (HIV) from being passed from one person to another. The study will take samples of blood, saliva, semen and rectal mucosal tissue to measure drug levels. This study will also collect information on side effects.</brief_summary>
