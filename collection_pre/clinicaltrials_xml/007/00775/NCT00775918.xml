Females of child bearing potential must use a 'medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study period and for one week after the study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or her partner are: oral contraceptives/ patches, progestin injection or implants, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, IUD, vaginal spermicidal or hormonal suppository, surgical Sterilization of themselves or their partner(s) or abstinence. Females taking oral Contraceptives must have taken them consistently for at least three months prior to receiving study medication. i) Alcohol, grapefruit beverages or foods or caffeine beverages or foods beginning 24 hours before each study medication administration through each study confinement period.
