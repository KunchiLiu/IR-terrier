	<brief_title>Comparative Effect of Nebivolol vs. Metoprolol on Insulin Sensitivity and Fibrinolytic Balance in Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Test the hypothesis that nebivolol treatment decreases PAI-1 antigen and activity and improves fibrinolytic balance compared to metoprolol treatment in individuals with metabolic syndrome. 2. Test the hypothesis that nebivolol treatment improves insulin sensitivity compared to metoprolol treatment in individuals with metabolic syndrome.</detailed_description>
