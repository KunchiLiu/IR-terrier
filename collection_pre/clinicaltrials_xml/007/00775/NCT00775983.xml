	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, blinded clinical trial comparing overnight laminaria versus same-day Dilapan for cervical preparation for surgical abortions occurring between fourteen and eighteen weeks gestation. Comparisons will be made between procedure time, need for additional dilation, occurrence of complications, and patient and provider satisfaction. Hypothesis: Cervical preparation for surgical abortion, between fourteen and eighteen weeks gestation, with same-day Dilapan is non-inferior to cervical preparation with overnight laminaria within a five-minute difference. Primary objective: Determine differences in procedure times Secondary objectives: Examine complications, and need for additional dilation between early second-trimester surgical abortions performed after cervical preparation with same-day Dilapan versus those performed after cervical preparation with overnight laminaria</brief_summary>
