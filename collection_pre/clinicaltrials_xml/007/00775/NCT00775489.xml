	<brief_summary>Patients that have consented to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: control group or nasal steroid group. Patients in the control group will receive normal saline inhaler. Patients in the study group will receive steroid inhaler Follow-up visits are: baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6 after starting the spray. Intraocular pressure will be recorded on all visits.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic and topical ophthalmic steroids have long been associated with ocular effects, such as glaucoma or cataracts. Periocular steroid injections and steroids applied to periocular skin have also been reported to increase intraocular pressure (IOP) and raised IOP is the major risk factor for glaucoma. Approximately 18 to 36% of the general population are corticosteroid responders. This response is increased to 46 to 92% in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Allergic rhinitis affects up to 30% of adults and 40% of children in the United States. Topical nasal steroids are the most effective treatment option.Nonallergic rhinitis is a common disease that affects approximately 17 million persons in the United States; approximately 22 million have a combination of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis.Topical nasal steroids have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis and are considered first-line empiric therapy.With the perceived safety of nasal steroids, their use for the treatment of upper respiratory allergy has become more common.However, inhaled and nasal steroids might be absorbed systemically. Although the systemic absorption of inhaled and nasal steroids has been established, the clinically relevant ocular side effects are poorly defined. A large prospective study in 1995 by Samiy et al reported no statistically significant increase of IOP in 187 patients without glaucoma taking inhaled steroids for various pulmonary conditions. Similarly, a large case-control study in 1997 cases suggested that the presence of nasal steroid use in patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma or OHT versus nonglaucomatous patients was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.59-1.77). However, the number of patients taking continuous high-dose nasal steroids was too small for statistical analysis. In 1998, a small prospective study of 26 non-glaucomatous patients revealed no evidence of OHT or cataracts after prolonged use of nasal steroids after endoscopic sinus surgery (mean follow-up, 8.8 ± 3.6 months; range, 3-19 months). A study of 61 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis taking nasal fluticasone for 1 year showed no increased risk for glaucoma.However, no information was described regarding their glaucoma risk status before steroid use in this study. Six cases of increased IOP associated with combined nasal and inhaled steroid use in non-glaucomatous patients have been reported. Considering the large number of patients on nasal steroids; It is surprising that no one has investigated if nasal steroid use is contraindicated in glaucoma patients.</detailed_description>
