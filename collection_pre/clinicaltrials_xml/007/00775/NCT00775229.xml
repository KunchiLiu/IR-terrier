	<brief_title>Naltrexone in the Treatment of Trichotillomania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of Naltrexone in trichotillomania. Forty subjects with DSM-IV trichotillomania will receive 8 weeks of double-blind Naltrexone or placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that Naltrexone will be effective and well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania compared to placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</detailed_description>
