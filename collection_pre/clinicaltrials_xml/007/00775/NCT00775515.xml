	<brief_summary>Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate, an pelvic organ of men. Prostatitis can cause great discomfort which varies but can include pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, a vague sense of discomfort, a feeling of malaise and fatigue, fever, burning on urination, pain on reaching orgasm, and bleeding. In many men the symptoms of prostatitis can be chronic. It is estimated that in the United States chronic prostatitis is responsible for as many as two million doctor visits a year. The disease can be ruinous, interfering with work, intimacy, and other things. The causes of chronic prostatitis are not understood. The treatments commonly used, including antibiotics and prostate massage, work poorly. We now have evidence that laparoscopic prostatectomy can eliminate the misery of chronic prostatitis. This trial aims to quantify and better characterize the effect of laparoscopic prostatectomy on the symptoms of chronic prostatitis.</brief_summary>
