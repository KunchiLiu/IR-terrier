	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if it is a feasible arrangement to have women receive their second and third birth control injection (with Depo-Provera) at a pharmacy compared with receiving it a Planned Parenthood Clinic. Compliance with returning for injections as well as patient satisfaction with the method, providers, and location where injection was received will be assessed and compared between the two sites. The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in return rates for injections at either the pharmacy or the clinic site.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women who want to use or are currently using Depo-Provera for contraception will be randomized to receive their next two injections either back at the Planned Parenthood clinic or at a local pharmacy where pharmacists are trained to give injections. After each injection, women will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their attitudes about the method of birth control, their providers, and the location where they received the injection.</detailed_description>
