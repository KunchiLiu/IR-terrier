	<brief_summary>This pilot study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of chemo-radiotherapy comprising a regimen of FOLFOX6 chemotherapy plus SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres (chemo-radiotherapy, also known as "chemo-SIRT"), in combination with the biologic therapy Bevacizumab (Avastin), for the first-line treatment of patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma in whom surgical resection is not feasible.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Unequivocal and measurable CT evidence of liver metastases which are not treatable by surgical resection or local ablation with curative intent. ECOG performance status 0 1. Adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function. Evidence of ascites, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, main portal vein tumor involvement or thrombosis as determined by clinical or radiologic assessment. Any extrahepatic metastases other than metastases in the lungs and/or bones and/or abdominal or hilar lymph nodes. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not allowed.
