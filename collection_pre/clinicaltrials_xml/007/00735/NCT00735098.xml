	<brief_summary>Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequent causes of physical disability and pain among adults. Recent evidence suggests that shorter exercise programs that incorporate kinesthesia, balance and agility (KBA) techniques may result in more rapid symptom relief and functional improvements in comparison to traditional therapeutic exercise. KBA techniques are designed to improve dynamic joint stability by using a series of activities which challenge balance and coordination. To determine the independent effects of KBA training on functional abilities, it is necessary to test it as a training program unto itself. The proposed clinical trial is designed to do this by using three training groups: KBA only; lower extremity strength training only; and a combination of the two. The total exercise time and intensity of each condition will be approximately equal. A non-exercise group will control for any effects related to the testing procedures and the passage of time. Community volunteer men and women age 50 and over with physician diagnosed symptomatic knee OA will participate.</brief_summary>
