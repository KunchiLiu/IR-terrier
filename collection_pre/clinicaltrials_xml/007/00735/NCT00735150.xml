	<brief_summary>We are inviting you to participate in a study of how people who have had genetic counseling for breast/ovarian cancer risk feel about certain reproductive technologies, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and prenatal genetic diagnosis (PND), that may reduce the chances of passing increased risk onto one's children. We would also like feedback from patients who have been to our clinic in the past on the best ways to talk about PGD and PND during genetic counseling sessions. We are seeking both the opinions of people who are interested in these technologies and those who are not. It does not matter whether you have heard of PGD or PND before - you can still participate. Your past experience with genetic counseling is valuable to us in deciding how to communicate this information during sessions.</brief_summary>
