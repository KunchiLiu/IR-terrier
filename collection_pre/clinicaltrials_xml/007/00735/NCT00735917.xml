	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well saracatinib works in treating patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Saracatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saracatinib in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the 6-month survival of biomarker-positive patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving AZD0530 (saracatinib). II. To determine the adverse events of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the response rate in patients treated with this drug. II. To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. To explore the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD0530 with optional tumor biopsies, pharmacokinetic studies, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans in a subset of patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>
