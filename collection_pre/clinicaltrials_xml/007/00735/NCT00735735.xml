	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of Substance P in saliva, in patients with severe chronic low back pain and in subjects without it. In addition, to explore a possible cutoff point, in order to define normal and pathological levels of Substance P in saliva. The ultimate objective would be to design a measurement method for use in routine clinical practice.</brief_summary>
