	<brief_title>Macugen Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients must receive the first injection of Macugen intravitreal in at least one eye for treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The decision to prescribe Macugen will necessarily precede and will be independent of the decision to enroll patient into the study. If both eyes of a patient receive injection Macugen, only one eye will be included in the study. If both eyes receive first injection Macugen after initiation of the study, only the first treated eye will be included in the analysis. If one eye has already received Macugen when the study starts and the second eye receives injection after the study initiation, the second eye will be included in the analysis. The study was prematurely discontinued due to delay in meeting pre-defined protocol recruitment milestones on August 30, 2010. There were no safety concerns regarding the study in the decision to terminate the trial.</detailed_description>
