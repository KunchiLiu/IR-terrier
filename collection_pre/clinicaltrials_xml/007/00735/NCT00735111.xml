	<brief_title>Do Self-Rated Performance Status Scores Correlate With Health-Care-Provider-Scores?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) is a highly validated and essential measuring tool across the cancer population. The scale relates to purely physical ability and covers 11 stages, ranging from normal health to death, with each stage scored as a percentage. The score is determined by the health-care provider and is based on observation and narrative patient descriptions. The purpose of this study is to compare the scores rated by the health-care provider to the scores that patients assign to themselves.</detailed_description>
