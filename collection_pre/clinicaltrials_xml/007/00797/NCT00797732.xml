	<brief_summary>This study is a pilot randomized, sham-controlled trial of acupuncture for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients with dysphagia after chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The following hypotheses will be evaluated: Aim 1. HNC patients will be willing and eligible to participate in a clinical trial of acupuncture, and be adherent to protocol acupuncture and baseline and follow-up outcomes testing. Aim 2. At 20 weeks post CRT and 6 months following the acupuncture treatment: a) the MDADI total score and its sub-scores will be higher in active acupuncture vs. sham control; b) the time-to-removal of the feeding tube will be shorter in the active acupuncture vs. sham control; c) body weight recovery will increase faster in active acupuncture vs. sham control. Aim 3. At 20 weeks post CRT, the plasma Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β1 level measured in patients treated with acupuncture will demonstrate trends of a decreased level when compared with a group of similar patients treated with sham acupuncture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Acupuncture Treatment for Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIMS: Aim 1. To assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining HNC patients with dysphagia into a randomized sham-controlled trial of acupuncture. Aim 2. To collect preliminary data on the efficacy of acupuncture in changing scores of HRQOL in post CRT head and neck cancer patients. Aim 3. In a subset of HNC subjects treated with both active and sham acupuncture, to collect objective measures on swallowing functions using Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS); salivary flow production; and plasma Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β1, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 13 levels.</detailed_description>
