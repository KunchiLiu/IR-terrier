	<brief_summary>SCH 900518 is a potent oral inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease which disrupts hepatitis C virus (HCV) polyprotein processing. SCH 900518, when added to the current standard of care (SOC), peginterferon-alfa plus ribavirin, would likely increase the proportion of patients achieving undetectable HCV-RNA levels and sustained virologic response (SVR). In this study, SCH 900518 would be used in combination with low doses of ritonavir to enhance the levels of SCH 900518 within the body and reduce the number of daily SCH 900518 tablets required. The purpose of this study is to identify the optimal dose and schedule (once or twice a day) of SCH 900518 plus ritonavir in previously untreated patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C when given in combination with SOC. The study compares SOC to 6 experimental arms. In the experimental arms, SOC plus SCH 900518 doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily will be explored. The benefits of a 4 week lead-in with PegIntron and ribavirin prior to the addition of SCH 900518 will also be explored.</brief_summary>
