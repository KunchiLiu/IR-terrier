	<brief_summary>This is a randomized control trial to determine the efficacy of a multi-modal intervention in improving smoking cessation processes of care and patient outcomes in community-based primary care practices. Our Overall Goal is to advance science related to the use and impact of the Internet in health services delivery, specifically smoking cessation, by targeting primary care clinical microsystems. A clinical microsystem is defined as the smallest functional healthcare unit. A clinical microsystem is not simply equivalent to a clinical team of doctors and nurses, but also the panel of patients cared for by the providers and the processes of care that are used.</brief_summary>
