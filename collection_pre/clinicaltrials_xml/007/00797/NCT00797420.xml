	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of a Fluconazole Loading Dose in Infants and Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label study to investigative the pharmacokinetics and safety of a fluconazole loading dose in infants and toddlers &lt; 2 years of age with suspected sepsis. There will be two treatment groups: single fluconazole loading dose 25 mg/kg; fluconazole loading dose 25mg/kg followed by 12 mg/kg daily for total of 5 days. There will be three age cohorts within each group: pre-term &lt; 30 week EGA infants &gt; 48 hours and &lt; 31 days; &gt; 30 weeks EGA infants &gt; 48 hours and &lt; 31 days; infants ≥ 31 days and &lt; 2 years of age. The study requires administration of fluconazole over 1-5 days depending on treatment group followed by 1 week of safety monitoring. Six to eight 100 µL PK samples will be obtained over the 5 days of drug administration. The risks are reasonable vs. the benefits and have been minimized appropriately. There may be benefit to the subjects (administration of empirical antifungal therapy), and information from the study may benefit a large number of other infants and toddlers with suspected or proven fungal sepsis. There is a data analysis plan.</detailed_description>
