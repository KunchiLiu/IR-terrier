	<brief_title>Effect of Prime Solution on Fluid Balance After Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty patients scheduled for elective primary and single cardiac surgery include in this prospective study. Patients with preoperative coagulation disorders, or renal or hepatic failure, are excluded. Before admission to the operation theatre, the patients allocate in random order to receive one of the following solutions during the extracorporeal circulation: 1. Ringer-acetate solution 2. 6% HES solution (Tetraspan®) During the 1 postoperative day we register hemodynamic changes, fluid balance, fluid extravasation, plasma ion concentration, modified thromboelastography, and kidney function.</detailed_description>
