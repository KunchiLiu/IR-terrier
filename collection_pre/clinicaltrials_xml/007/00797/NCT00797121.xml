	<brief_title>Preoperative Biliary Drainage for Resectable Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative biliary drainage(PBD) or not, is a Hot Spot issue in the management of Hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Surgeons from Japan tend to perform PTBD(Percutaneous Transhepatic Biliary Drainage) before a definite operation until the total bilirubin(TB) lower than 85μmol/L. For some patients needed to perform extended curative resection, PVE(Portal Vein Embolization) is performed and thus the duration of PBD may be around six weeks and the final TB is lower than 34μmol/L. Some tend to perform a definite curative operation in a short time after diagnosis. There is no RCT research on the effect of PBD for the resectable Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma patients to date.</detailed_description>
