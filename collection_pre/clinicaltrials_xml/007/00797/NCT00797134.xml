	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to characterize and correlate diabetic macular edema (DME), i.e. increased retinal thickness, measured by Optical Coherence Tomograph (OCT), and retinal visual function. The secondary objectives of this study are the analysis and characterization of DME progression over time (between two visits), and the comparison of OCT data obtained with different devices. The results of this study will be used exclusively for scientific purposes.</brief_summary>
