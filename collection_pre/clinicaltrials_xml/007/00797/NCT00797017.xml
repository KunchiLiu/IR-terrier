	<brief_title>Study on Impact of Fentanyl Matrix on Improvement of Pain and Functioning in Spinal Disorder-related Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, open-label, non-interventional study. The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of fentanyl matrix on improvement of pain and functioning after 8-week treatment of fentanyl matrix in the patients who complained of spinal disorder-related chronic pain in clinical practice according to the investigator's discretion. The primary endpoint is a percent of pain intensity difference between baseline and week 8 of the study. Each patients will evaluate their pain intensity every 28 days during the 8 weeks. The secondary objectives are to observe the change in the following variables after administrating fentanyl matrix; K-ODI (Korean version - Oswestry Disability Index) score, sleep disturbance, disturbance of activities of daily living and disturbance of social activities. In addition, Investigator and patient global assessment, patient preference, CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression - Improvement) and Adverse Events will be investigated.
