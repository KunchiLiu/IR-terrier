	<brief_title>Misoprostol in Termination of First Trimester Missed Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To compare the effectiveness of oral versus vaginal misoprostol prior to surgical termination of first trimester missed abortion as cervical priming agent , the difference of cervical dilatation immediately prior to operation , the duration of operation and side effects between two treatment groups. Design: This study was conducted as randomised study. Setting: Maternity Teaching Hospital in Hawler/ Kurdistan/ Iraq. Population: Over a period of six months from the first of January to the thirtieth of June, 2008, one hundred women were included in this study. They were cases of first trimester abortion (6-12 weeks). Method: Patients were randomly selected for the type of treatment they received. The first group (oral) were assigned to receive 400 micrograms of misoprostol orally as preoperative cervical priming agent, where as the second group (vaginal) were allocated to have treatment either with vaginal misoprostol to receive 400 micrograms vaginally. Main outcome measure: Oral versus vaginal misoprostol as cervical ripening agent prior to termination of first trimester missed abortion. Keywords: First trimester, missed abortion, misoprostol, cervical ripening, oral, vaginal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients were cases of first trimester missed abortion. They have uneventful history apart from history of slight vaginal bleeding, with normal general examination. Gynecological examination revealed no vaginal bleeding or discharge with no dilatation of the internal os with enlarged uterus. Cases with suspected or proven ectopic pregnancy, history of Caesarean section, medical diseases, a known hypersensitivity to a drug, smokers, patients with abnormal results of investigation and the presence of vaginal bleeding were excluded from the study.</criteria>
