	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine the testosterone serum levels in male patient with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The objective is to determine if low levels exist in this population and if it correlates with length of mechanical ventilation. Hypothesis: Serum testosterone levels in mechanically ventilated male patients are significantly decreased from normal levels and correlate with disease severity and outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives 1. To confirm and quantify the presence of hypotestosteronemia in critically ill male patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation. 2. To correlate serum testosterone levels with disease severity, short-term outcomes, and survival in mechanically ventilated male patients. 3. To determine if demographic patient characteristics, such as age, admitting diagnosis, or the presence of co-morbidities, affect serum testosterone levels during mechanical ventilation.</detailed_description>
