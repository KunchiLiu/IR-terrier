	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a handheld Colonoscopy Force Monitor(CFM™), a push-pull force and torque measuring device, that grips the shaft of the colonoscope and wirelessly transmits and records all the forces applied by the endoscopist during colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Handheld Colonoscopy Force Monitor by Expert Endoscopists in the Performance of Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy requires a skilled endoscopist to use visual and tactile information to advance and withdraw the instrument through a series of fixed and stationary loops. To develop and maintain the skills necessary to perform colonoscopy safely and effectively requires extensive training and ongoing education. Quantification of tactile information provides the opportunity to understand the "feel" used by the endoscopist to perform colonoscopy. The identification of force application patterns has the potential to enhance training and improve performance. CFM™ is a handheld device that uses load cells to transform applied force to electric signals and to transmit wirelessly the signal to a computer for storage and visual display. The device is designed so that the endoscopist maintains a conventional hand position and uses an electronically controlled grip and release mechanism to fix the position on the instrument. Several expert endoscopists from multiple institutions will use the CFM™ to perform colonoscopy. The data will be recorded and analyzed for differences by patient characteristics(e.g. gender, age, pain sensation, surgical history) and by endoscopist.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male or female Age: 3075 years ASA Class I or II All ethnic and racial groups will be included Colonic pathology that in the opinion of the endoscopist could interfere with the colonoscopy. Examples include: colonic stricture, poor preparation, obstructing tumor.
