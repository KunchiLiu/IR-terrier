	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PF-04629991 in healthy subjects. Dose exploration will proceed in a step-wise manner, beginning with low doses not expected to have significant biological effects and proceeding to doses approximating or exceeding the anticipated therapeutic level. Doses to be explored may be limited by tolerability, and will not exceed levels previously shown to be tolerable in animals.</brief_summary>
