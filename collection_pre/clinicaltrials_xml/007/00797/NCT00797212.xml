	<brief_title>A New Glucose Meter With Alternative Site Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The blood glucose monitoring system may be used for alternative site testing. The blood glucose results obtained by subjects with samples taken from the palm and forearm were compared with fingerstick capillary blood glucose results obtained from subjects by an HCP. Product labeling was evaluated for comprehension of performing alternative site testing as well as for additional meter features. User feedback about the system and its features was obtained.</detailed_description>
