	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine of creatine will prevent or treat the muscle toxicity side effect of statin drug therapy, whose symptoms are aching, cramping, and weakness. This is tested in patients who have had this side effect from 3 different statin drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Creatine in Preventing Muscle Aching From Cholesterol-Lowering Statin Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle toxicity is the most common limiting side effect of statin therapy. Biochemical studies have suggested the presence of intramuscular creatine deficiency in patients with muscle toxicity. This is a test of oral creatine supplementation in statin intolerant subjects as a method of preventing the onset of this side effect as well as resolving these symptoms when present during statin therapy.</detailed_description>
