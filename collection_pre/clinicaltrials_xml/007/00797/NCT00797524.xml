	<brief_summary>The main objective of this observational study is to characterize and correlate functional and structural changes at the retinal level using the Retinal Leakage Analyzer (RLA) and the Optical Coherence Tomograph (OCT). To show if it is possible to use OCT as an indirect measurement of leakage, this study will check, in a primary analysis, for OCT changes between fluorescein leaking and non-leaking areas (identified by Retinal Leakage Analyzer). As a secondary objective, changes in RLA and OCT over time (between two consecutive visits) will be analyzed and characterized. The results of this study will be used exclusively for scientific purposes.</brief_summary>
