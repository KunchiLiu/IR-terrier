	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the use of topical cyclosporine 0.05% and sodium carboxymethylcellulose 0.5% for the treatment of dry eye disease in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Twenty HIV-positive-patients were selected from the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Hospital. Dry eye diagnosis was based on a dry eye questionnaire (Ocular Surface Disease Index - OSDIÂ®), Schirmer I Test, break up time and 1% rose bengal staining of the ocular surface. The patients were divided into two groups with ten patients. Group I received sodium carboxymethylcellulose 0.5% drops and group II received sodium carboxymethylcellulose 0,5% drops and topical cyclosporine 0.05% for six months.</brief_summary>
