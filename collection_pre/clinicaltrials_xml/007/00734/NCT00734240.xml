	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of ISIS 353512, to evaluate the blood concentration and rate elimination of ISIS 353512 from the blood, and to evaluate the effectiveness of ISIS 353512 in lowering a protein in the blood associated with inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of Single and Multiple Doses of ISIS 353512 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a Phase 1, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study conducted at a single center to 1)evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of ISIS 353512 administered intravenously and subcutaneously, 2)evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of single and multiple doses of ISIS 353512 administered intravenously and subcutaneously, and 3)evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ISIS 353512 in lowering constitutive levels of c-reactive proteins in healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
