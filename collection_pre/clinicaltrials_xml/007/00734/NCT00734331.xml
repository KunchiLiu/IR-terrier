	<brief_summary>There is a reciprocal relationship between the central nervous system and the immune system. Stimulation of the vagus nerve results in secretion of acetylcholine (Ach) which decreases secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acetylcholine esterase is an enzyme that neutralizes Ach and thus, involves in regulation of Ach levels, and in the cholinergic tone and inflammatory state. MicroRNAs (miRs) are evolutionarily conserved, RNAs that regulate gene expression. The investigators hypothesized that miRs controlling systemic communication processes function in one tissue in response to signals (i.e. neuronal, hormonal or others) from another. Specifically, the investigators hypothesized that miRs control the inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel diseases through regulation of expression of messenger RNA of AchE.</brief_summary>
