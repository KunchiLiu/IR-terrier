	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Protective Effect of α-Keto Acid With Low-protein Diet on Renal Function in PD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residual renal function (RRF) is associated with cardiovascular complication, nutritional status, incidence of peritonitis, and quality of life in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Therefore, RRF is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity in PD patients. Previous studies have suggested that dietary protein restriction supplemented with compound keto/amino acids may slow the loss of RRF in chronic kidney disease patients. However, there is very few reports to address the effect of compound keto/amino acid supplementation in RRF in PD patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect of compound α-Keto Acid plus low protein diet in RRF in PD Patients.This is a randomized, open-label, prospective study. 100 patients who meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be randomized into α-Keto Acid group or control group at the ratio of 1:1. α-Keto Acid group will use compound α-Keto Acid plus low protein diet, while control group will use normal protein diet.Compound α-Keto Acid dosage is 0.1/kg/d daily. The effect of compound α-Keto Acid plus low protein diet in RRF will be evaluated after 1 year treatment.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patients on PD at least one month prior to study entry. 2. Subjects of either sex, more than 20 years old, the range of age is 20 to 75 year old. 3. Residual GFR ≥3 ml/min/1.73m2. 4. Residual urine volume ≥ 500 ml/24h. 5. No history of taking αKeto Acid within 2 weeks. 6. Subjects who agree to participate in the study and sign the informed consent. 1. History of peritonitis or other infection within one month. 2. History of taking drug which may affect amino acid metabolism within one month. 3. Incapable of following study requirements to control diet. 4. With severe cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, dyscrasia, psychiatric disorder, alcohol or drug abuse. 5. Participation in another clinic trial within one month prior to screening.</criteria>
