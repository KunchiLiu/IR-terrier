	<brief_title>Survivorship of the Press Fit Condylar (P.F.C.) Sigma Fixed Bearing Knee With a Cobalt Chrome Tibial Tray</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the survivorship of the P.F.C. fixed bearing knee system using a cobalt chrome tibial tray and moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert at 5-Years. The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate additional clinical outcomes to provide further information on the performance of the P.F.C. fixed bearing knee system using a moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert and cobalt chrome tibial tray.
