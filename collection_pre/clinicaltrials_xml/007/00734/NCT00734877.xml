	<brief_summary>Toward improving the therapeutic index of standard TT3 (S-TT3), the investigators will employ a randomized Phase III trial design to determine whether S-TT3 treatment-related toxicities can be reduced by 50% in TT3-Lite (L-TT3). Note: Randomization has been discontinued and accrual is closed to the L-TT3 arm. This trial is currently enrolling as a single-arm trial for patients to receive S-TT3.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major treatment-related toxicities in TT3 pertained to the high-dose melphalan 200mg/m2 (MEL200)-based tandem transplant approach, consisting of mucosal and other toxicities. For the TT4 trial, we are proposing to compare standard TT3 (S-TT3) to TT3-Lite (L-TT3). L-TT3 will employ various strategies aimed at improving the therapeutic Index of S-TT3 by reducing toxicities while maintaining the superior results reported for S-TT3 in terms of frequency and duration of CR, EFS, and. The following strategies will be utilized in L-TT3: - Applying only 1 instead of 2 cycles of induction and consolidation therapy prior to and after tandem transplant. This is supported by the well known association between prior exposure to mucotoxic therapies4, 5 and worse post-transplant mucositis, particularly when etoposide is used in the mobilizing regimen6 such as in VDTPACE. Note: Randomization has been discontinued and accrual is closed to the L-TT3 arm. This trial is currently enrolling as a single-arm trial for patients to receive S-TT3.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have newly diagnosed active MM requiring treatment. Patients with a previous history of smoldering myeloma will be eligible if there is evidence of progressive disease requiring chemotherapy. Patients must be either untreated or have not had more than one cycle of systemic MM therapy, excluding bisphosphonates and localized radiation. Participants must have lowrisk disease, as defined by any of the following: GEP risk score of &lt; 0.66 lack of GEPdefined TP53 deletion (Affymetrix signal &lt;727) No metaphase based abnormalities of 1q or 1p LDH &lt;360 U/L Rule out hemolysis, infection, and contact PI for Clarification Zubrod ≤ 2, unless solely due to symptoms of MMrelated bone disease. Patients must be at least 18 years of age and not older than 75 years of age at the time of registration. Participants must have preserved renal function as defined by a serum creatinine level of &lt; 3 mg/dL. Participants must have an ejection fraction by ECHO or MUGA ≥ 40% Patients must have adequate pulmonary function studies &gt; 50% of predicted on mechanical aspects (FEV1, FVC, etc) and diffusion capacity (DLCO) &gt; 50% of predicted. If the patient is unable to complete pulmonary function tests due to MM related pain or condition, exception may be granted if the principal investigator documents that the patient is a candidate for high dose therapy. Patients must have signed an IRBapproved informed consent indicating their understanding of the proposed treatment and understanding that the protocol has been approved by the IRB. High risk disease defined by highrisk gene array features as determined by any of the following: GEP risk score of ≥ 0.66 or Presence of GEPdefined TP53 deletion, or Presence of abnormalities of chromosome 1 (amp1q, del 1p). Poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other serious medical illness or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol. Platelet count &lt; 30 x 109/L, unless myelomarelated. Grade &gt; 2 peripheral neuropathy. Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol. Recent (&lt; 6 months) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, difficult to control congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or difficult to control cardiac arrhythmias. Evidence of chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive pulmonary disease. Patients must not have light chain deposition disease or creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dl No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been disease free for at least three years. Prior malignancy is acceptable provided there has been no evidence of disease within the threeyear interval or if the malignancy is considered much less life threatening than the myeloma. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy documented within one week of registration. Women/men of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.</criteria>
