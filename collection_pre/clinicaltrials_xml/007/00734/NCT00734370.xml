	<brief_summary>Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders, particularly for specific phobias as fear of heights and fear of flying (e.g. Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008). Recent technological advances (e.g. more realistic avatars) make research into the efficacy of VRET for participants with elevated agoraphobic symptoms desirable. Therefore, the aim of the present research proposal is to investigate the comparative efficacy of: 1. enhanced VRET making use of the latest avatar technology with 2. exposure in vivo in agoraphobic participants 3. wait-list control.</brief_summary>
