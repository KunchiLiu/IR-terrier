	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify whether changes in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over time as seen with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) imaging, can be used to predict vision loss and the advancement of AMD in people at moderate to high risk for progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AREDS 2 Ancillary Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to identify whether SDOCT patterns such as: drusen size, OCT reflectivity within drusen, photoreceptor (PR)change over drusen, microfoci of subretinal fluid (SRF), or retinal thickening are predictive of vision loss, progression of drusen, progression of photoreceptor loss over drusen, development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), or development of geographic atrophy (GA). The secondary objectives of this study are: 1. To define the relationship between SDOCT imaging, autofluorescence (AF)imaging, and color photographic or other fundus imaging of AREDS 2 patients in both a cross-sectional study of baseline data and a longitudinal study in data collected over the 5 year AREDS 2 study. 2. To compare the extent of geographic atrophy on SDOCT versus color photographs and autofluorescence. 3. To evaluate whether the SDOCT outcome measures differ significantly between AREDS 2 patients randomized to different oral supplements in the AREDS2.</detailed_description>
