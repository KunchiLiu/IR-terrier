	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop and implement evidence-based and family-oriented support for young carers and their families in Germany. Hypothesis is that families' own support mechanisms, combined with externally provided support that is determined by the families' specific needs, will help to overcome their burden and enable families to live in the way they wish to despite chronic illness. This will lead to a measurable increase in HRQOL of children concerned.</brief_summary>
