	<brief_summary>The aim of the proposed research is to measure the effect of drug-induced sedation on the functional connectivity between brain regions as indicated by EEG signal transmission within the human brain. The results of this study will help to identify the neurophysiological correlates of changes in conscious experience that occur during drug-induced sedation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cortico-cortical Connectivity During Midazolam Sedation in Humans; a TMS/EEG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the proposed experiments cortical areas will be stimulated using low frequency, low-amplitude transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy human subjects during wakefulness and during drug-induced responsive sedation and unresponsive sedation. Simultaneously, high-density electroencephalography (Hd-EEG) will be recorded to evaluate the temporal and spatial characteristics of evoked responses and induced rhythms over the cortex.</detailed_description>
