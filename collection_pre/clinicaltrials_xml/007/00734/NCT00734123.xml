	<brief_summary>The incidence of cardiovascular diseases is still high and further efforts should be done in primary prevention. The main objective is to quantify the burden of subclinical atherosclerosis using non-invasive techniques,and to study the impact of this assessment and consequent treatment in the progression of atherosclerosis and in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection of Atherosclerosis: a Randomized Trial in the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will perform non-invasive techniques (carotid Intima-Media Thickness, CAC score and ankle-brachial index) to individuals at intermediate cardiovascular risk.With these results, we will classify participants in: no atherosclerosis, mild, moderate and severe atherosclerosis, and therapeutic targets will be set according to pre-defined algorithms. The end-point will be the course of atherosclerosis measured by cIMT/CAC score (2 years) and the incidence of CVD at 5 years of follow-up.</detailed_description>
