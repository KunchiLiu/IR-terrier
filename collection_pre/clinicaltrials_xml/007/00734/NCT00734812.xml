	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether there is any difference in recovery time and return to normal activities following a laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) compared with total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). Both types of hysterectomies are commonly performed at our institution. Patients will be assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to have either a LSH or a TLH. Preoperatively, participants will complete a quality of life questionnaire (SF-36), a sexual function questionnaire (FSFI)and a 3 question questionnaire about urinary function (3IQ). Following surgery participants will be asked to keep a diary of pain symptoms and use of narcotics. The diary will be filled out daily until patients have resumed normal activities from prior to the surgery. The SF-36 will be completed again 6 weeks following the original surgery. 6 months following surgery participants will receive a copy of the SF-36 and the FSFI in the mail. They will also be asked questions about urinary symptoms and persistent vaginal bleeding.</brief_summary>
