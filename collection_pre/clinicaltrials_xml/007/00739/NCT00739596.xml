Men or women 18 years and older of African American background; self identified Patients with stage 2 hypertension. Patients must have a MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg at Visit 5 (randomization) Office blood pressure measured by cuff (MSSBP ≥ 200 mmHg and/or MSDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) at any visit. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives whichever is longer. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs belonging to the same therapeutic class (CCBs or thiazide diuretics) as the study drugs. Long QT syndrome or QTc &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females at screening. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL) Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control methods. The two methods can be a double barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method. 1.

Hormonal contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that includes an estrogen and/or a progestational agent. Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study and for 7 days after study drug discontinuation. 2. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL [and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. History or evidence of a secondary form of hypertension. Known KeithWagener Grade III or IV hypertensive retinopathy. History of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic cerebral attack (TIA), heart failure (NYHA Class IIIV), myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, or any percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the last 12 months.
