	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Age &gt;/= 30 years For women of child bearing potential, a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to index procedure (the test results must be negative to be eligible). Symptomatic leg ischemia by Rutherford/Becker Classification (category 2, 3 or 4) with a resting or exercise ABI &lt;/= 0.8. A single superficial femoral artery lesion with &gt; 50% stenosis or total occlusion. Stenotic lesion or occluded length within the same vessel (one long or multiple serial lesions) &gt;/= 4.0 cm to &lt;/= 15.0 cm, by visual estimate. The stenosis must be treatable with no more than two stents, minimizing the stent overlap whose combined length &lt;/= 170 mm. Reference vessel diameter (RVD) &gt;/= 4.0 mm and &lt;/= 6.0 mm by visual assessment. All lesions are to be located at least three centimeters proximal to the superior edge of the patella. Patent infrapopliteal and popliteal artery, i.e., single vessel runoff or better with at least one of three vessels patent (&lt; 50% stenosis) to the ankle or foot. The guidewire is across the target lesion(s) and located intraluminally within the distal vessel. Poor aortoiliac or common femoral "inflow" (i.e. angiographically defined &gt; 50% stenosis of the iliac or common femoral artery) that would be deemed inadequate to support a femoropopliteal bypass graft must be successfully treated prior to treatment of the target lesion. This can be done just prior to treatment of the target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as &lt;30% stenosis after either PTA or stenting of the inflow lesion. After treatment of the inflow lesion, if the peak to peak pressure gradient across the inflow lesion is &lt;/= 20mmHg and the peak to peak pressure gradient across the SFA target lesion is &gt;/= 20mmHg, then the patient will be included in the study. A patient with bilateral obstructive SFA disease is eligible for enrollment into the study. Eligibility for standard surgical repair, if necessary. A patient who requires a coronary intervention, should have it performed at least 7 days prior to the treatment of the target lesion. Patient or authorized representative must provide written informed consent and written HIPAA authorization prior to initiation of study procedures. Patient must be willing to comply with the specified followup evaluation schedule. Thrombophlebitis, uremia, or deep venous thrombus, within past 30 days. Receiving dialysis or immunosuppressant therapy. Thrombolysis of the target vessel within 72 hours prior to the index procedure where complete resolution of the thrombus was not achieved. Recent stroke within past 90 days. Femoral, iliac or aortic aneurysm or aneurysm in the SFA or popliteal artery within past 5 years. Required stent placement via a popliteal approach. Required stent placement across or within 0.5 cm of the SFA / PFA bifurcation. Procedures which are predetermined to require stentinstent placement to obtain patency, such as severe calcification which is resistant to stenting, or for instent restenosis. Significant vessel tortuosity or other parameters prohibiting access to the lesion or 90° tortuosity which would prevent delivery of the stent device. Previously deployed stent within the SFA of the target limb. Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®) or ticlopidine (Ticlid®), heparin, Nitinol (nickel titanium), contrast agent, that cannot be medically managed. Presence of thrombus prior to crossing the lesion Tissue loss due to ischemic disease (Rutherford/Becker category 5 or 6) Serum creatinine level &gt;/= 2.5 mg/dl at time of screening visit Known or suspected active infection at the time of the procedure Bleeding diathesis Presence of an aortic, iliac or femoral artificial graft Life expectancy less than one year, or any other factors preventing clinical followup. Use of cryoplasty, laser, or atherectomy devices on the target vessel at the time of index procedure Instent restenotic lesions at time of procedures. Restenotic lesion that had previously been treated by atherectomy, laser, or cryoplasty within 90 days of the index procedure. Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with procedures specified in the protocol or has difficulty or inability to return for followup visits as specified by the protocol. Patient is known to be pregnant, incarcerated, mentally incompetent, and/or alcohol or drug abuser. Patient is currently participating in any other investigational drug or medical device study that has not completed primary endpoint(s) evaluation or clinically interferes with the endpoints from this study or future participation in such studies prior to the completion of this study. Patient has had major surgical or interventional procedures unrelated to this study within 30 days prior to this study or planned surgical or interventional procedures within 30 days of entry into this study. Interventional procedures performed to the ipsilateral iliac artery to provide access will be allowed.</criteria>
