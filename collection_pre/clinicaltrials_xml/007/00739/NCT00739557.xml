	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the systemic inflammatory response caused when patients undergo thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (TAAA). In addition, this study will look at how the inflammatory response affects the post operative healing process and post operative complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Systemic Inflammatory Response of Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be invited to participate in this study prior to the TAAA repair procedure. Prior to the surgery, baseline blood and saliva samples will be collected. Following the surgery, blood and saliva samples will be collected for 48 hours. In addition, hemodynamic data (i.e. vital signs) will be collected for the first 48 hours. The patient data will be reviewed for the first 30 days for morbidity and mortality assessment.</detailed_description>
