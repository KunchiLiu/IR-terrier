	<brief_summary>Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) suffer from frequent and recurrent acute exacerbations (AECB) which are associated with enormous healthcare expenditures and significant morbidity, specifically an increased risk of death, a decline in pulmonary function and a significant change in quality of life. Bacteria appear to have an important role in acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis and COPD. Studies of acute exacerbations in COPD have shown a reduction in bacterial load with prolonged exacerbation-free interval. In addition, recent studies indicate that acquisition of a new strain of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa are responsible for many of these exacerbations. Chronic inflammation and bacterial infection predispose many patients to frequent and recurrent acute exacerbations. Mpex believes that intermittent administration of inhaled MP-376 in high risk patients will decrease the incidence of acute exacerbations by both by lowering the organism burden, and resultant inflammation, as well as pre-emptive eradication of any newly acquired bacterial strains.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of MP-376 to Prevent Acute Exacerbations in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MP-376 inhalation solution given daily for 5 days in a 28 day treatment cycle to COPD patients.</detailed_description>
