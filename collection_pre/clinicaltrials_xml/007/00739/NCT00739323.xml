	<brief_summary>An observational study to gather information about people who may have certain abnormalities in skin microcirculation and muscle metabolism and to determine whether these abnormalities affect wound healing. The study also examines the association of a specific type of cell with the rate of wound healing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impaired Wound Healing in Diabetic Foot Ulceration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An observational study which entails: medical history; physical examination; blood tests; MRI; microcirculation tests (two noninvasive tests: 1) a procedure that measures the resting blood flow of the skin and 2) a technique that introduces acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in the skin and measures the ability of the skin's vessels to dilate and increase blood flow); and macrocirculation tests (noninvasive ultrasound of arm). This study also involves 2 Visits to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. (Joslin-Beth Israel Deaconess Foot Center, Lowry Outpatient Laboratory, MRI Suite).</detailed_description>
