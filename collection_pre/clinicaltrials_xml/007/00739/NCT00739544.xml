	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify intraindividual as well as iatrogenic factors disposing for the development of chronic and acute pains after surgery for breast cancer in order to improve treatment and prevent the development of acute and chronic postoperative pains.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Pain After Operation for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery for breast cancer is followed by acute undesirable sequelae (pain, nausea, vomiting, psycho-social adaptation) and late sequelae with discomfort or more severe neuropathic pain problems in the surgical area due to nerve damage or adjuvant-/radiotherapy. The late sequelae occur in 30-50% of patients but the exact mechanisms (preoperative disposing factors, intraoperative nerve damage/inflammatory response), acute postoperative pain and psychosocial factors remain to be determined in large, detailed, well-described studies, including stratification to modern breast cancer treatment (sentinel node strategy/ radiotherapy/ chemotherapy). The present study will describe in detail preoperative psychosocial/genetic pain mechanisms, intraoperative technique, multi-modal anaesthesia and opioid-reduced analgesia with a detailed, early and late postoperative follow-up with neurophysiological assessment in the surgical area and randomised studies on preventive therapy.</detailed_description>
