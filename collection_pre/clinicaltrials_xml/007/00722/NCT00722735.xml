	<brief_summary>To compare the bacteriological eradication rates of Finafloxacin and Ciprofloxacin in female patients with uUTI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finafloxacin 300 mg Twice a Day (b.i.d.) Versus Ciprofloxacin 250 mg Twice a Day (b.i.d) in Patients With Lower Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with clinical signs and symptoms of uUTI who have a high probability of the required number of bacteria in their urine, measured by positive test for nitrite and /or leucocyte esterase by means of a dipstick will be enrolled in this study. Only these patients with bacterial count equal or more than 10e5 cfu/mL will be included in the efficacy analysis. At Baseline, patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive Finafloxacin 300 mg or Ciprofloxacin 250 mg, following a double-dummy design, ie Group 1 will receive Finafloxacin tablets + Ciprofloxacin placebo capsule while Group II will receive Ciprofloxacin capsule + Finafloxacin placebo tablets. The treatment will last in total 3 days. The microbiological results will be compared with the baseline microbiology. If the concentration of initial pathogen in the urine is equal or more than 10e3 cfu/mL in the post-therapy culture compared with the baseline , this will define a bacteriological eradication. Microbiological assessment will be performed as well. Evaluation of the bacteria reinfection or relapse will be performed, based on the microbiology results. The status of clinical improvement and cure will be considered additionally.</detailed_description>

Able to supply a midstream, clean catch urine sample for microbiological analysis. 4. The result of the dipstick should indicate a high probability of the required number of bacteria. 5. Be able to communicate with the study personnel. 6. Has given written consent to participate in the study. 1. Female patients having signs and symptoms of upper urinary tract infection (e.g. fever, flank pain) indicating complicated UTI. 2. Male patients 3.

Existence of any surgical or medical condition which might interfere with the distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug, i.e. impaired renal or hepatic function, diabetes mellitus, chronic symptoms of pronounced constipation or diarrhea or conditions associated with total or partial obstruction of the urinary tract. 10. Antibiotic intake 2 weeks before study enrolment. 11. Failed UTI therapy within 2 months before study inclusion. 12.

Clinically abnormal vital signs, ECG findings and safety laboratory results at Baseline. 14. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the use of fluoroquinolones. 15. History of tendon lesions or ruptures during quinolone treatment. 16. Any malignant disease or a history of malignant neoplasm other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, within the last 5 years before Baseline. 17. Current diagnosis or history of substance abuse. 18. Exposure to any of the investigational drugs 30 days prior to Baseline. 19. Pregnant or nursing woman, or woman of childbearing potential who is not using an effective contraceptive method during the study, e.g. oral (stable doses for at least 3 months prior to Baseline) or injectable (stable doses for at least 2 months prior to Baseline) contraceptives, intrauterine devices (for at least 2 months prior Baseline), doublebarrier method, contraceptive patch, female sterilization or condoms. 20. The patient, planned to be enrolled is an employee of any involved study investigator or any involved institution including the study sponsor. 21.
