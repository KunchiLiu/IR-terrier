	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Migration of C-Stem AMT is equal to the well documented Exeter prosthesis In Norway it is annually performed approximately 600 primary and 100 revisions THA. Osteolysis around the prosthesis is one of the major difficulties while performing revision surgery. C-stem is a triple tapered cemented prosthesis designed to increase the stress and strain of proximal femur and thereby decreasing osteolysis. We are planning til include 70 patients and randomize to C-stem AMT or Exeter prosthesis. Both prosthesis will be combined with previously non documented "Marathon" acetabular prosthesis. The result will be followed clinically and with RSA and DXA. Soft endpoint after 2 years</brief_summary>
