	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment for Morbid Obesity by Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the obese patient population, the frequency of patients presenting a severe morbid obesity (40 &gt;= BMI &lt;= 50), a super obesity (BMI &gt;50), a super super obesity (BMI&gt;60), and obese patients (BMI&gt;35) with a failure of gastric banding is constantly increasing. In these patients, the surgery risk is proportionate to the weight and / or gastric surgery records. This risk is high, in bariatric surgery, for gastric bypass procedure. This justifies the evaluation of new procedure to reduce the morbidity allowing the reduction of morbid /mortality associated with the intervention.</detailed_description>
