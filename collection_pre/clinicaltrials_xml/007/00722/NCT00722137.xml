	<criteria>• Male or female patients 18 years or older (the patient must be at least the legal age limit to be able to give informed consent within the jurisdiction the study is taking place) • Diagnosis of MCL (Stage II, III or IV) as evidenced by lymph node histology and either expression of cyclin D1 (in association with CD20 and CD5) or evidence of t(11;14) translocation, such as by cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients with a diagnosis of Stage I MCL will not be permitted to enter study. Paraffin embedded biopsy tissue block (preferably of lymph node origin) must be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation of MCL diagnosis prior to randomization. In China, a paraffin embedded lymph node biopsy tissue block must be sent for central confirmation of sample adequacy, prior to randomization At least 1 measurable site of disease No prior therapies for MCL Not eligible for bone marrow transplantation as assessed by the treating physician (e.g., age or the presence of comorbid conditions that may have a negative impact on the tolerability to transplantation). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ECOG status ≤2 (Attachment 1) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500 cells/µL, Platelets ≥100,000 cells/µL or ≥75,000 cells/µL if thrombocytopenia is considered by the investigator to be secondary to MCL (e.g., due to bone marrow infiltration or sequestration from splenomegaly). Alanine transaminase ≤3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate transaminase ≤3 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, Calculated creatinine clearance ≥20 mL/min. (Attachment 2) Female patients must be post menopausal for at least 1 year (must not have had a natural menses for at least 12 months), surgically sterile, or practicing an effective method of birth control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, doublebarrier method, contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) and have a negative serum βHCG or urine pregnancy test at screening. They must also be prepared to continue birth control measures for at least 6 months after terminating treatment. Male patients must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception (for themselves or female partners as listed above) for the duration of the study. All patients (or their legally acceptable representatives) must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the study. In order to participate in the pharmacogenomics component of this study, patients (or their legally acceptable representative) must have signed the informed consent form for pharmacogenomics research indicating willingness to participate in the pharmacogenomics component of the study. Acquisition of tumor sample collections is required for all patients (where available); all other sample collections are optional Excl criteria on EUCTR is as follows: Potential patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in the study: Prior treatment with VELCADE Prior antineoplastic (including unconjugated therapeutic antibodies), experimental or radiation therapy, radioimmunoconjugates or toxin immunoconjugates for the treatment of MCL. In the event that a patient has received doxorubicin for the treatment of any condition, other than MCL, the maximum dose and exposure received prior to entry into this study should not exceed 150 mg/m2. short course (maximum of 10 days, not exceeding 100 mg/day) prednisone or equivalent steroids are allowed to treat symptoms in patients with advanced disease who enter the screening phase and are waiting to be randomized. Major surgery (at the discretion of the treating physician and in consultation with the sponsor's medical monitor) within 2 weeks before randomization Peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of Grade 2 or worse (as per the investigators assessment) Diagnosed or treated for a malignancy other than MCL within 1 year of randomization, or who were previously diagnosed with a malignancy other than MCL and have any radiographic or biochemical marker evidence of malignancy. Patients with completely resected basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ malignancy are not excluded. Active systemic infection requiring treatment and patients with known diagnosis of HIV or active hepatitis B (carriers of hepatitis B are permitted to enter study) History of allergic reaction attributable to compounds containing boron, mannitol, or hydroxybenzoates Known anaphylaxis or immunoglobulin E (IgE)mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to any component of rituximab including polysorbate 80 and sodium citrate dihydrate Female or male patients of childbearing potential who will not use adequate contraception during the course of the study. Serious medical (e.g., pericardial disease, cardiac failure [New York Heart Association; NYHA Class III or IV, Attachment 12 or left ventricular ejection fraction; LVEF &lt;50%], active peptic ulceration, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease), or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study Concurrent treatment with another investigational agent.</criteria>
