	<criteria>Written informed consent HBsAgpositive candidates for HBVrelated liver transplant Treatment with antiviral therapy before transplantation as per treating physician's recommendation. (NOTE: It is expected that most patients will receive Lamivudine or Adefovir Dipivoxil pretransplant. In the case of antiviral resistance, an effective alternative antiviral agent(s) must be used.) Multiorgan transplantation recipients Liver retransplantation except for primary nonfunction Presence of a hepatoma (larger than 5.0 cm as a solitary node) or 2 to 3 multifocal nodes (larger than 3.0 cm each) (Milan Criteria) based on information available at baseline visit (CT scan, MRI). Patients requiring an OLT (Orthotopic Liver Transplant)due to fulminant hepatitis B OLT patients receiving a liver graft from a donor that is positive for HBsAg Patients using interferon pretransplant (as interferon cannot be used posttransplant) History of IgA (immunoglobulin A) deficiency History of hypersensitivity to blood products. HIV or HCV positive Use of an investigational product, or participation in another clinical trial during the course of the study (with the exception of qualityoflife or repository studies) Pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the course of the study</criteria>
