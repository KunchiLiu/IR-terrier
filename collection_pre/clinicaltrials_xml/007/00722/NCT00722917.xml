	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of TAK-379 in Adult Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease that has reached epidemic proportions. The global incidence of this disease is estimated to increase from 120 million individuals to over 200 million by the year 2010. In type 2 diabetes, multiple metabolic defects contribute to hyperglycemia. These include insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, and excessive hepatic glucose production. Nine classes of antihyperglycemic agents are currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glycosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glinides, glucagon-like peptide analogues, amylin analogues, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors). Each class acts by a unique mechanism on 1 or more of the metabolic defects. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited is developing TAK-379, a non-thiazolidinedione partial proliferator-activated receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 4.5 months.</detailed_description>

Diabetic gastroparesis that in the investigator's opinion is moderate or severe and hence may impair absorption of study medication. The subject has New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure. Has had coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior or at Screening.

History of drug abuse or a history of alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to Screening. Any other physical or psychiatric disease or condition that in the judgment of the investigator may affect life expectancy or may make it difficult to successfully manage and follow the subject according to the protocol.</criteria>
