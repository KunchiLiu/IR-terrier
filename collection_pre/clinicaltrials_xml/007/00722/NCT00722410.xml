	<brief_summary>Infection by Klebsiella pneumonia producing class A carbapenemases is a major clinical and public health problem in Israel and worldwide. The aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of alteration of the gut microflora by probiotics, alone or in combination with mechanical bowel cleansing, as a strategy to eradicate colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by CRKP. We hypothesize that administration of probiotics will decrease the rate of GI colonization by CRKP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotics for Eradication of Carbapenem Resistant Klebsiella Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CRKP colonization will be determined by culture and PCR of rectal swabs. The study will include 3 arms - no intervention, probiotics and mechanical bowel cleansing + probiotics. Followup examination of rectal swab samples for the presence of CRKP will be performed at 4 weeks and 12 weeks from study entry.</detailed_description>

Women with childbearing potential unless using adequate contraception (IUD, oral or depot contraceptive or barrier plus spermicide). 3. Subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding. 4. Subjects who will be unavailable for the duration of the trial, are likely to be noncompliant with the protocol, or who are felt to be unsuitable by the investigator for any other reason. 5. Subjects with chronic diarrhea (&gt;4 weeks). 6. Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease. 7. Subjects whose stool is positive for Clostridium difficile toxin. 8. Subjects receiving immunosuppressive treatment (i.e. corticosteroids; azathioprine or 6MP; cyclosporine; tacrolimus; OKT3, methotrexate; anti TNF agents; chemotherapy). 9. Subjects who underwent solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 10. Subjects with primary or secondary immunodeficiency disorders, including HIV. 11. Subjects with chronic advanced cardiac, respiratory, renal or liver disease. 12. Subjects with advanced malignant disease. 13. Subjects with severe acute organ failure. 14.
