	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this 5-year study is to determine whether a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention, demonstrated to be effective in reducing distress, enhancing coping, and maintaining health among HIV+ non-drug abusers (see Schneiderman and Antoni, 2000), can be effectively adapted for our target population of culturally diverse, HIV+, low-income "Recovering Drug Abusers" (RDAs). Since the late 1980s, members of our research team (i.e., Schneiderman, Antoni, Klimas, Fletcher) have been developing, refining and evaluating the effects of CBSM among HIV+ Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). In the early/mid 90s, we began to adapt and evaluate the effects of CBSM in other non-drug abusing subgroups that were emerging with increasing levels of HIV seroprevalence (e.g., pregnant women, African American and Hispanic men and women). After accumulating considerable support for the effectiveness of CBSM in these subgroups in the late 90s, our research team (i.e., Malow, Schneiderman, Antoni, Klimas, Page) turned its attention to developing the CBSM for one of the most neglected and understudied populations affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in this country: "inner city" minority drug abusers. With supplemental funding on two NIH grants to conduct formative stage1 pilot research, our project team has been able to develop and document the feasibility and potential promise of the CBSM approach adapted/translated for RDAs (CBSM-RDA). This application proposes to take the next logical step in continuing this work: conducting a 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12 month follow-up outcome study comparing CBSM-RDA with a matched attention, time and interest value Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition, in 225 male and 225 female HIV+ RDAs with respect to key biopsychosocial health endpoints: distress (i.e., depressive symptoms, and mood state), quality of life, drug abuse relapse, unsafe sex, Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (CART) medication adherence and health status indicators (e.g., Viral Load, CD4 count, physical symptoms).</brief_summary>
