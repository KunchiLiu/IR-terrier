	<brief_summary>The TODAY study group has prepared a protocol with the primary objective of collecting blood and phenotypic information to be used to explore relationships between candidate genes and type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular complications of insulin resistance. Participation in the genetics study includes a blood draw for analysis of diabetes type and DNA extraction, as well as collection of basic family and medical history. Appropriate informed consent and assent are obtained from all participants to extract DNA and send blood, genetic material, and medical history to the Central Repository of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The data are kept indefinitely by the Central Repository. The NIDDK will issue requests for proposals (RFP) throughout the scientific community for research that may help in the development of new diagnostic tests, new treatments, and new ways to prevent diabetes and other related comorbidities.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Diabetes by ADA criteria (laboratory determinations of fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, or twohour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL) documented and confirmed in medical record or a laboratory determination of HbA1c ≥ 7%. For asymptomatic patients diagnosed with diabetes with a normal fasting glucose but an elevated twohour glucose during an OGTT, the HbA1c must be ≥ 6%. BMI ≥ 85th percentile documented at time of diagnosis or at screening. Age &lt; 18 at time of diagnosis. Signed informed consent and assent forms as appropriate. Genetic syndrome or disorder known to affect glucose tolerance other than diabetes. Patient on medication known to affect glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity or secretion within 60 days of the time of diagnosis. If diagnosis is confirmed after the patient has been off the medication for 60 days, the patient may be included. Exclusionary medications include but are not limited to 1. inhaled steroids at dose above 1000 mcg daily fluticasone equivalent, 2. oral glucocorticoids, 3. antirejection or chemotherapy agents (e.g., tacrolimus, Lasparaginase), 4. atypical antipsychotics.</criteria>
