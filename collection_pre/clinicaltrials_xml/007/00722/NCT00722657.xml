	<detailed_description>The need of studies to develop programs of pharmaceutical attention for asthmatics was given because of the increase of incidence and prevalence of the disease in the population. This study had a descriptive, retrospective, transversal character with quantitative approach, which aimed to delineate the social-economics profile of the asthmatic patients that used the health service available at the Care Nucleon Medical Integrate (NAMI). The studied population was composed of 40 asthmatic patients who attended between April and May, during 2006. Data collection was performed through a semi-structured stereotypic questionnaire, with closed and opened questions. The age range of the interviewee between 0 to 5 years old represents the biggest percentage of patients, obtaining 60% of the answered questionnaires. According to social-economics conditions, 55% were illiterate or were learning to read, 75% were using some drug prescribed at NAMI, 72.5% deny completely the disease, 52.5% recognized the factors that triggered the asthmatic crisis and 55% said having often crisis. Seventy per cent (70%) of the interviewee showed some difficulty related to the use of the drugs; 47.5% have different problems related to the access to the medications. Through the analysis of the social-economics profile delineated of the asthmatics patients attended at NAMI, it could be revealed that the biggest part of the patients are people with little instruction, due to the social exclusion in which they are found; being the majority of them children of the female gender.</detailed_description>
