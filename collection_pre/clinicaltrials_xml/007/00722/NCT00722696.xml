	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate metabolic parameters in previously sedentary individuals before and after eccentric endurance training (hiking downwards).

Metabolic profiles will be obtained at baseline and after the 8 weeks period of eccentric endurance exercise.</brief_summary>
