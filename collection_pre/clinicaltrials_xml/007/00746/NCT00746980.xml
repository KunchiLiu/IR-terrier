	<brief_summary>Determine the effect that treatment with efalizumab has on scalp hair re-growth in younger adults affected by severe variants of alopecia areata, including alopecia totalis, alopecia universalis, and severe ophiasis variants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efalizumab in the Treatment of Alopecia, Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II trial (single-center, open-label, prospective study) where subjects with severe forms of alopecia areata, namely alopecia totalis, universalis, and severe ophiasis, will be treated with efalizumab (Raptiva), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD11a antibody that reversibly inhibits T cell activation and migration, weekly for 48 weeks. We will assess for effect on hair and body re-growth as well as record any serious adverse events such as serious infections, thrombocytopenia, development of malignancy, and severe arthralgias to monitor for safety outcome data. Subjects will have regular physical examinations and laboratory studies throughout the study, as well as telephone interviews.</detailed_description>
