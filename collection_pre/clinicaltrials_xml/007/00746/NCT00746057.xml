	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to explore the possibility to identify, at an early stage after a renal graft and from blood samples collected within first months after graft, a predictive transcriptional profile of long term occurence of graft operational tolerance or chronic rejection. The aim of the study is to determine an early transcriptional profile of chronic rejection in the transcriptome of mononuclear blood cells. Validation and predictivity of transcriptional analysis will be based on graft function and graft histology one year after transplantation.The other aim is to determine an early transcriptional profile of operational tolerance in the same patients using a DNA chip dedicated including two lists of genes discriminating tolerant patients who are stopped immunosuppressant treatment for over a year. To allow statistical analysis of 100 patients followed one year after graft, patients not assessable at one year due to early termination of study will be replaced.</brief_summary>
