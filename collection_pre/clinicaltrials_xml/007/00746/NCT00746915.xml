	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of the epidural injection procedure when combined with real-time multi-frequency bio-impedance measurements that collect data on the electrical bioimpedance characteristics of living human tissue on the path of the epidural needle.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Male or females 18 60 years of age 2. Imaging spine study (CT or MRI) in previous 3 months. 3. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class IIII 4. Patients undergoing elective standard pain relief treatment of Epidural Steroid Injection 5. Patients must be willing to participate in the study, and provide written informed consent 6. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during the screening and baseline visits or the patient must be surgically sterile or be at least one year postmenopausal 7. Women of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable method of birth control throughout the study such as: bilateral tubal ligation or the use of either a contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection, an intrauterine device, or an oral contraceptive that has been taken for at least three months, which the subject agrees to continue using during the study, or a doublebarrier method which must consist of a combination of any two of the following: diaphragm, cervical cap, condom or spermicide. 1. Any contraindications for epidural injection 2. Patient with severe scoliosis 3. Previous spinal surgery, or any additional surgical intervention in the level of epidural injection other than elective standard pain relief treatment of Epidural Steroid Injection. 4. Documented, known or per examination neurological deficiency in lower extremities. 5. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients 6. Patients who have participated in another study within 30 days of enrolment 7. Investigator's opinion that the patient is medically unfit or would be at major risk if enrolled into the study i.e. known coagulopathy or recent use of anticoagulants or anti aggregates. 8. Presence of fever, sepsis or infection near the point of insertion or an infection in the bloodstream which may "seed" onto the catheter 9. Patients with known Hypovolemia 10. Any known Anatomical abnormalities, such as spina bifida, meningomyelocele or scoliosis 11. Patient suffering problems of the central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis or syringomyelia 12. Patients with identified heartvalve problems 13. Patients excessively hirsute where the surface electrodes are to be placed that are unwilling to shave these areas.</criteria>
