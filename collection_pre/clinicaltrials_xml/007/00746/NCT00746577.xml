	<brief_summary>Purpose of the Study: The Richmond Behavioral Health Authority's Substance Abuse Services Division and Virginia Commonwealth University's Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies are working on an important research study to improve the quality of substance use disorder treatment services offered by RBHA and its contracted services providers. Specifically, this preliminary research will provide the information needed to conduct a planned series of program-specific interventions, designed to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices (EBPs) within specific programs. A major goal of the study is to better understand what factors influence the adoption of EBPs, and what adoption strategies work best for which types of staff, which types of programs, and under what conditions. Description of Staff Involvement: In this study, staff will be asked to complete questionnaires about themselves, their workplaces, and their perceptions about the services their organization provides. Some of these questionnaires will be given to staff when they first enter the study, and others may be given to staff before and about 9 months after a 3-day Practice Improvement Workshop (please note that each agency may or may not be selected to complete the workshop). Description of Client Involvement: Clients at each participating site will be asked to complete a brief survey about the services they receive at that site. This survey will occur at the initial timepoint, and at several later timepoints. This survey is confidential and anonymous.</brief_summary>
