	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to compare the pharmacodynamics (bronchodilation, onset and duration of action), of a single dose of formoterol fumarate in combination with mometasone furoate to placebo in children of 5-11 years with persistent asthma. The study will also assess the bronchodilatory effect of a single dose of formoterol fumarate alone and in combination with mometasone furoate delivered via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) to the bronchodilatory effect of formoterol fumarate delivered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Furthermore, pharmacokinetic assessments of plasma and urine will also be conducted throughout the study to assess systemic exposure following administration of the study medication.</brief_summary>

History of malignancy of any organ system within past 5 years. Predose change (increase or decrease) in absolute FEV1 of 15% at Visit 2, compared with value at screening. Hospitalized or had an emergency room treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation in the 1 month prior to Visit 1, or who had a clinical deterioration of asthma between Visits 1 and 2 that resulted in emergency treatment, hospitalization, or treatment with excluded asthma medication. Significant medication condition or situation. QTc &gt; 440 msec (boys) or &gt; 450 msec (girls) on electrocardiogram(ECG) assessment at screening. Upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to screening. Chronic conditions affecting the respiratory tract or chronic lung diseases.</criteria>
