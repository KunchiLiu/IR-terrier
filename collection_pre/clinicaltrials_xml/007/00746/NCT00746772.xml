	<brief_summary>Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease whose prevalence in the general population is 0.5 -2.2%.Oral lesions in OLP are chronic, rarely undergo spontaneous remission. Patients with OLP had significantly increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma, irrespective of the clinical type of OLP and therapy. there is currently no cure for OLP. Previous study demonstrated a decreased antioxidant defence and increased oxidative damage to lipids.DNA and proteins in lichen planus. This oxidative modifications point to pathophysiological alterations mainly within the basal cell layers of epidermis and at the dermoepidermal junction. Purslane is an excellent source of vitamin A,C and E and essential amino acids, has been described as a power food of the future because of its high nutritive and antioxidant properties. The purpose of the study was to determined the efficacy of Purslane in the treatment of oral lichen planus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral lichen planus is a chronic common inflammatory disorder affecting stratified squamous epithelia. The majority problem of OLP is development of oral squamous cell carcinoma , irrespective of the clinical type of OLP and therapy. Previous study demonstrated a decreased antioxidant defence and increased oxidative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins in lichen planus .This oxidative modifications point to pathophysiological alterations mainly within the basal cell layers of epidermis and at the dermoepidermal junction. So oxidative stress could be effective in pathogenesis of OLP. Purslane is an excellent source of vitamin A,C and E and essential amino acids, has been described as a power food of the future because of its high nutritive and antioxidant properties. Purslane also decreased the level of TNF-Î± and IL6, that are responsible for up-regulated adhesion molecules (in OLP lymphocyte T (T cell) recruited and retained in sub mucosa through receptors to endothelial adhesion molecule. and basal keratinocytes undergo apoptosis). The purpose of the study was to determined the efficacy of Purslane in the treatment of oral lichen planus.</detailed_description>
