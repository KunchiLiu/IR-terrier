	<brief_summary>Human Multidrug Related Protein 2 (MRP2) excretes several drugs and could therefore modulate their elimination. Individual's MRP2 activity is under genetic control. Thus it would be very useful to get an easily measurable biomarker reflecting individual's MRP2 activity. We aimed to investigate the ratio of urinary coproporphyrins I and III (UCP(I/I+III), known to be increased in patients with mutations in MRP2/ABCC2 gene.</brief_summary>
