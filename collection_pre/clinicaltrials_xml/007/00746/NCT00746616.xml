	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to gather clinical information on the safety and efficacy of the resurfacing devices in the young, active patient with advanced hip disease. Study enrollment has been temporarily suspended due to a change in the surgical technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durom(R) Hip Resurfacing System Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety will be evaluated based on the frequency and incidence of any device related adverse events or unanticipated adverse device events. The efficacy will be measured by comparing the overall functional performance based on the Harris Hip Score, implant survivorship, and radiographic parameters, including radiolucencies, osteolysis, stem subsidence, cup migration, and change in cup angle and a change in the femoral shaft angle.</detailed_description>

Patient has participated in the Informed Consent process and has signed and IRB approved Informed Consent. Patient with an acute, chronic, local or systemic infection. Patient who is skeletally immature. Patient with a severe muscular, neural or vascular disease that endangers the involved extremity. Patient with an insufficient acetabular or femoral bone stock in which good anchorage of the implants are unlikely or impossible, including but not limited to: patient with severe osteopenia patients with a family history of severe osteoporosis or osteopenia patients with osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis (AVN) with &gt; 50% involvement of the femoral head (regardless of FICAT grade) patients with multiple cysts of the femoral head &gt; 1cm Patient with total or partial absence of the muscular of ligamentous apparatus.

Contralateral Hip: Patient has had hip replacement, surface arthroplasty or endoprosthesis, within the past 12 months, unless already enrolled in this investigational study. Patient who is: a prisoner mentally incompetent a known alcohol or drug abuser anticipated to be noncompliant Patient who has participated in a study of any other investigational device (drug, device or biologic) within the past 12 months. Exception: previous enrollment in the Durom Hip Resurfacing System clinical study.
