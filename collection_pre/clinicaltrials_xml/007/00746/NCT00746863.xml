	<brief_summary>There are many ways to perform a suprapubic approach pubovaginal sling. Some surgeons inject local pain medical into the retropubic space before placing the sling, others do not. This study is to determine if injection of local pain medication into the retropubic space before placing a mid-urethral sling for urinary stress incontinence results in lower postoperative pain scores, lower use of postoperative narcotic medication and lower rates of urinary retention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Control Trial to Assess Postoperative Pain After Sling Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate if an injection in the retropubic space with a local acting anesthetic, Marcaine, (bupivacaine) at the time of mid-urethral sling placement will improve patients' reported post operative pain and decrease the use of narcotic pain medication. This study will include all female patients age 18 and older who will undergo a mid-urethral sling with or without anterior repair for the treatment of urinary stress incontinence by a member of the Division of Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery who consent to be in the study. Once patients have consented to participate in the study they will be randomized into two groups. One group will have the mid-urethral sling placed in the usual fashion with no injection of local anesthetic. The other group will have the mid-urethral sling placed after the retropubic space has been infiltrated with local anesthetic as previously described in the literature. Pain will be assessed with the use of a Visual Analog Scale during the hospitalization and the use of narcotic pain medication will be assessed during recovery and overnight in the hospital. Patients will be asked to record how often and what type of pain medication they use. Patients will also be asked to keep a log of their urination if they are discharged home with self catheterization. They will be asked to mail in their pain medication log and voiding diary (if needed) at a two-week post-operative. Outcomes will then be compared.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any female patient, age 18 or older, who elects to have a midurethral sling with or without an anterior or posterior repair at the University of North Carolina Hospitals by a member of the Division of Urogynecology. Any patient with a chronic pain syndrome, a contraindication to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as liver disease, abnormal coagulation, esophageal disorders or peptic ulcers or where pain evaluation is unreliable because of neurological disease and those on treatment with steroids/NSAIDs/opioids prior to surgery. Also excluded will be any patient who is having any other reconstructive pelvic surgery concomitantly or would require the placement of a suprapubic catheter. Patients electing to have their surgery with regional anesthesia, such as an epidural or spinal will be excluded. All minors, decisional impaired people, nursing mothers and nonEnglish speaking people will be excluded.</criteria>
