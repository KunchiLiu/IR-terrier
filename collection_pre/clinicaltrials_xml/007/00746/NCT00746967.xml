For subjects receiving hormone replacement therapy and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment, dosage of these must be stable at the start of this extension study and remain stable throughout. Subjects should continue to maintain a stable sexual relationship throughout the study. Excluded were subjects who experienced either treatmentrelated serious adverse events or significant treatmentrelated laboratory abnormalities in the previous study, and subjects who misused study medication and/or failed to adequately account for study medication in the previous study, or who were noncompliant with visits. Also excluded were subjects who were currently prescribed and/or taking nitrates or nitric oxide donors in any form (oral, sublingual, buccal, transdermal, inhalational or aerosols).</criteria>
