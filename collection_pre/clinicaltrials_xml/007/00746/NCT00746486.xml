	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a combination therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (12-16 mg/kg body weight (BW)/d) plus budesonide (9 mg/d) vs. ursodeoxycholic acid (12-16 mg/kg BW/d) plus placebo in the treatment of PBC. Depending on ALT values 6 mg/d budesonide are allowed. The study population will be patients with PBC at risk for disease progression. It is assumed that the combination therapy will result in a decrease of treatment failures after 3 years of treatment.</brief_summary>
