	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that having health care providers other than physicians within a "Groupe de MÃ©decine de Famille" conduct cardiovascular risk assessments and teach lifestyle interventions to primary prevention patients will increase the likelihood that patients will adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles. These objectives will be supported by providing subjects with a cardiovascular risk profile estimating the subject's risk of cardiovascular disease and teaching them how to use the resources related to lifestyle changes available on the www.myhealthcheckup.com Web site.</brief_summary>
