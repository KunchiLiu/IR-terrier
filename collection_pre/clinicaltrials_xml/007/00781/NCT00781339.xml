	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of NVC-422 on Bacteriuria in Catheterized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is a major healthcare problem in the U.S., accounting for approximately 40% of all hospital acquired infections. Microorganisms can colonize the catheter extraluminally or intraluminally, and are often protected in a biofilm environment. Nearly all patients catherized for 30 days or longer will develop bacteriuria, or the presence of bacteria in normally sterile urine. Ten to twenty percent of these patients will develop a symptomatic CAUTI. In a further 1-4%, the infection will spread into the kidneys or bloodstream, leading to potentially lethal bacteremia. Currently, there is no bladder irrigation solution that can reduce or eliminate CAUTI. A bladder instillation solution that can keep the bladder and catheter substantially free of bacteria and biofilm is expected to provide a practical and cost-effective means of minimizing CAUTIs. NVC-422 is a topical, non-antibiotic, fast acting, broad spectrum anti-microbial, which exhibits potential for the rapid decolonization of a range of urologic pathogens, including Escherichia Coli (E. coli), Enterococcus spp., P. mirabilis and others. In vitro studies with NVC-422 have also shown that it is capable of penetrating a biofilm and effectively killing the contained microbes.</detailed_description>
