	<brief_title>A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Masked, Single Center, Clinical Comparison of the Use of Systane Ultra in the Management of Dry Eyes in Bilateral Eyes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This comparison will be made between bilateral eyes of the same patient following excimer laser ablation using the FDA-approved LADARVision 4000 Excimer Laser System or the WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVEâ„¢ Excimer Laser System. Post operative questionnaires regarding the use of the drops will be compared. Tear osmolarity and tear breakup time will be evaluated using Tear Lab and OQAS II.</detailed_description>
