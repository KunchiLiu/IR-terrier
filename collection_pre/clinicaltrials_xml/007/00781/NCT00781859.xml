	<criteria>Presence of focal vitreomacular adhesion (i.e., central vitreal adhesion within 6mm Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) field surrounded by elevation of the posterior vitreous cortex) that in the opinion of the Investigator is related to decreased visual function (such as metamorphopsia, decreased visual acuity, or other visual complaint) Any evidence of proliferative retinopathy (including Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) or other ischemic retinopathies involving vitreoretinal vascular proliferation) or exudative AgeRelated Macular Degeneration (AMD) or retinal vein occlusion in the study eye. Subjects with any vitreous hemorrhage or any other vitreous opacification which precludes either of the following: visualization of the posterior pole by visual inspection OR adequate assessment of the macula by either OCT and/or fluorescein angiogram in the study eye. Subjects with macular hole diameter &gt; 400 μm in the study eye. Aphakia in the study eye. High myopia (more than 8D) in study eye (unless prior cataract extraction or refractive surgery that makes refraction assessment unreliable for myopia severity approximation, in which case axial length &gt;28 mm is an exclusion).</criteria>
