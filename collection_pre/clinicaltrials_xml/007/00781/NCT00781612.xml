	<brief_summary>This is a global, multicenter, open-label extension study. Participants receiving single-agent trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab emtansine administered in combination with other agents in a Genentech/Roche-sponsored study who completed the parent study or who continue to receive study drug(s) at the time of the parent study closure are eligible for continued treatment in this study.</brief_summary>
