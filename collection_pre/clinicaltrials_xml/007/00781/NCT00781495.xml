	<brief_title>Determinants of Insulin-induced Weight Gain in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin therapy is frequently needed to achieve adequate glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but often at the expense of weight gain. Insulin-induced weight gain is obviously undesirable in an already overweight population and may negatively affect blood pressure, lipid levels, inflammatory and fibrinolytic parameters, adipocytokines and also deter further optimization of insulin therapy. It is unknown what determinants predict insulin-induced weight gain in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study therefore, is to assess determinants of insulin-induced weight gain in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a retrospective and cross-sectional study (Jansen HJ et al., submitted) two extreme subgroups were identified (subjects with a weight gain above 80th percentile) and subgroup non-weight gainers (subjects with a weight gain below the 20th percentile). It was found that the gainers had less energy expenditure after initiation of insulin therapy than non-weight gainers. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to detect an association between energy expenditure and weight gain</detailed_description>
