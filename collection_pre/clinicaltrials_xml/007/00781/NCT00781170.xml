	<brief_summary>To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a autologous stem cell transplantation followed by a Melphalan/ Fludarabine based dose-reduced allograft from HLA-identical and HLA-compatible unrelated donor in patients with Multiple Myeloma. In those with non complete remission DLI and/ or new agents such as Bortezomib, Thalidomid or Lenalidomide can be used to upgrade remission.</brief_summary>
