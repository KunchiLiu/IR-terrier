	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, clopidogrel-controlled study of IV and oral PRT060128 compared to clopidogrel in patients undergoing non-urgent (including elective) PCI. After diagnostic angiography, patients scheduled for non-urgent PCI will be randomized to clopidogrel or to one of three dose levels of PRT060128.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Safety and Efficacy Study of PRT060128, a Novel Intravenous and Oral P2Y12 Inhibitor, in Non-Urgent PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient randomized in this trial will participate for approximately 12-24 weeks, including a Screening period of up to 2 weeks, the acute peri-procedural phase, and a 60-120 day chronic treatment phase. The chronic phase includes daily in-hospital assessments until 24 Hours or Discharge (whichever comes first), a telephone follow-up on Day 7-10 post-Discharge, outpatient follow-up visits on Days 30 and 60-67, [Day 90 and Day 120 (if treated for 120 days)] and a telephone follow-up 7 days following the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

Participation in a device trial prior to enrollment is acceptable Prior participation in any study involving PRT060128 Any condition which could interfere with, or the treatment for which might interfere with, the conduct of the study or which would, in the opinion of the Investigator, unacceptably increase the patient's risk by participating in the study. This would include, but is not limited to alcoholism, drug dependency or abuse, psychiatric disease, epilepsy or any unexplained blackouts</criteria>
