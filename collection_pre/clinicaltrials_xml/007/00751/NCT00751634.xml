	<criteria>Two or more days with core temperature â‰¥ 100.4F Approval of the patient's primary attending physician Need for core temperature measurement independent of the study. Admission to the NeuroICU [intensive care unit] for an underlying condition Evidence for an infectious cause of fever, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, CNS [central nervous system] infection or urinary tract infection. Expected death from any cause Known sensitivity to the device History of preadmission hypothalamic dysfunction or known temperature dysregulation Use of 2 or more vasopressor medications, since this may make a local skin reaction to the device more likely Hemodynamic instability</criteria>
