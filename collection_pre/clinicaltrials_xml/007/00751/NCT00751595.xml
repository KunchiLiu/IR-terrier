	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized, open label, phase II clinical trial directed at evaluating the immunogenicity (as a primary end-point) and the safety (as a secondary end-point), of the recombinant HIV-1 Tat vaccine in HIV-1 infected adult subjects, anti-Tat antibody negative, HAART-treated with chronic suppressed HIV-1 infection, CD4+ T cell counts &gt;= 200 cells/microliter, levels of plasma viremia &lt; 50 copies/ml in the last 6 months prior to the screening and without a history of virologic rebound. The immunogenicity of 3 or 5 immunizations of the two different vaccine doses (7.5 and 30 micrograms) of the Tat vaccine has been evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Trial of the HIV-1 Tat Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial was directed at evaluating the immunogenicity and the safety of the HIV-1 Tat protein-based vaccine. Anti-Tat antibody negative, HIV-1 positive subjects treated successfully with HAART have been screened and recruited for a 48-weeks study, including a period of 16 or 8 weeks treatment phase and a period of 32 or 40 weeks follow-up phase, in arm A or Arm B, respectively. One hundred sixty-eight subjects have been randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of the 2 arms (Arm A and Arm B) and each arm has been divided in the following groups: Arm A - Group I: 5 immunizations with Tat (7.5 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16; Arm A - Group II: 5 immunizations with Tat (30 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16; Arm B - Group I: 3 immunizations with Tat (7.5 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8; Arm B - Group II: 3 immunizations with Tat (30 microg) at weeks 0, 4, 8. Four vaccination regimens have been tested by intradermal administration of the Tat vaccine at two different doses (7.5 microg or 30 microg) in 5 or 3 immunizations.</detailed_description>

Specifically, persons with psychotic disorders, major affective disorders, suicidal ideation are to be excluded; Current use of psychotropic drugs prescribed for major psychotic disorders; Concomitant participation in any experimental study; Current or prior therapy with immunomodulators or immunosuppressive drugs and anticoagulant drugs within 30 days prior to study medication administration; Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days of study inclusion [NOTE: Medically indicated subunit or killed vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis A and B) are not exclusionary, but should be given at least 4 weeks away from HIV immunizations]; Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin in the past year; Previous participation in an HIV1 vaccine trial (subjects who despite their participation as placebo in a HIV1 vaccine trial have never been effectively administered with a HIV1 vaccine are eligible); Drug and/or alcohol abuse; Use in the last 6 months or concomitant use of anti CCR5 inhibitors and/or integrase inhibitors and/or fusion inhibitors; Pregnant or lactating women</criteria>
