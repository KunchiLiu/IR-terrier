	<brief_summary>A multi-center, randomized, parallel group, comparative, active controlled, safety assessor blinded trial in adult subjects comparing rocuronium plus sugammadex versus succinylcholine alone in subjects undergoing short surgical procedures in out-patient surgicenters. The primary objective was to evaluate changes in plasma potassium levels after treatment with rocuronium, sugammadex, or succinylcholine in adult subjects scheduled for short surgical procedures in out-patient surgicenters.</brief_summary>
