	<brief_summary>Umbilical cords contain immature blood cells, including a group of lymphocytes, that are important in the so-called natural immunity. We want to study the cytokine levels in umbilical cord NK cells and its regulation a family of newly identified small RNAs (microRNAs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>microRNA Profile in Umbilical Cord Blood NK Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our preliminary data pointed to the possibility of cytokine regulation by microRNAs in NK lymphoma and NK lymphoma cell lines. We want to use umbilical cord blood as controls for the biological significance in normal NK cell development.</detailed_description>
