	<brief_summary>Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for the greatest burden of the HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) epidemic in Peru. Current interventions that promote early identification and treatment of these diseases target a limited number of this population because they rely solely on peer education. To assess the use of the Internet as an alternative tool to reach this population the investigators propose to conduct an online randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of HIV-testing motivational videos versus standard public health text, both offered through gay websites. The methodology the investigators will use is divided in: (1) the development period, where the investigators will select gay websites for banner advertisement, create and refine effective recruitment messages and design the online survey and the video-based intervention (2) the intervention period, where participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized into a video or a standard public health text. The videos will be customized for three audiences based on self-identification: gay, non-gay and trans and will be framed within the health-belief model and the stages of change theory (3) in the outcome evaluation period we will compare the 'intentions to get tested' and 'time to HIV testing at the clinic' among MSM of each of the trial arms. If the Internet is an effective venue to reach MSM for HIV testing, Peruvian health programs that target this population may start considering the delivery of web-based interventions and other online prevention services to this under served and hard-to-reach population.</brief_summary>
