	<brief_summary>The intended purpose of this study was to determine whether Diamyd (rhGAD65 formulated in alum) is effective in preserving the body's own insulin producing capacity in patients recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Based on results from other clinical trials with the study drug it was judged unlikely this study would meet the intended primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Therefore the primary focus of this study was changed to ensure that safety data was available for at least 6 months following the last dose of active study drug. Thereafter the study was terminated.</brief_summary>
