	<brief_summary>This study will assess the - efficacy (response rate) of oral lenalidomide in the treatment of patients with symptomatic, previously untreated, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), - toxicity of lenalidomide in patients with CLL as well as time to progression, stable disease duration and, if responses are observed, response duration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Lenalidomide in Previously Untreated, Symptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, nonrandomized, single institution study in symptomatic, previously untreated CLL patients. Subjects will receive the study drug, lenalidomide, starting at 2.5 mg daily x 3 weeks (days 1-21) and escalating up to a target dose of 10 mg daily X 3 weeks (days 1-21) followed by 1 week off therapy (days 22-28) on a 28 day cycle. Although a maximal dose of 10 mg daily (days 1-21) will be targeted, if a patient is felt by the investigator to be benefiting from doses less than the target dose (i.e. 2.5 mg or 5 mg daily), the investigator may at his discretion choose to hold the patient at that dose without further escalation. For those patients who have progressive disease after cycle 3, further dose escalations as assessed by response and toxicity at the end of each escalated dose cycle to a maximum of 25 mg (days 1-21) will be allowed. Patients will be treated with lenalidomide until disease progression or 2 cycles past CR. (no maximum of cycles).</detailed_description>

In addition, sexually active WCBP must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree not to father a child and agrees to use a condom if his partner is of child bearing potential. Disease free of prior malignancies for ≥ 5 years with exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "insitu" of the cervix or breast Patients who fulfill any of the following criteria are not eligible for admission to the study: Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Pregnant or lactating females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide). Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline. Patients previously or currently receiving treatment with other anticancer therapy for CLL Lymphoproliferative disease other than CLL (includes patients with prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and those who have transformed to a more aggressive lymphoma, or Richter's syndrome). Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. Any prior use of lenalidomide.
