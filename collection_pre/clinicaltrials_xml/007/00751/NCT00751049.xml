	<criteria>Unilateral or bilateral primary open angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Open angle glaucoma appearing more than 6 months after cataract surgery is recognized as primary open angle glaucoma. (individuals requiring treatment bilaterally must fulfill eligibility criteria for both eyes.) IOP of 22mmHg or higher obtained during the prestudy period. Patients currently not treated or on singledrug treatment for the elevated IOP are eligible after a medication free period (washout) of: 1. 3 weeks for Badrenergic antagonists 2. 2 weeks for adrenergic agonists 3. 5 days for cholinergics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. History of acute angle closure. Severe trauma at any time. Intraocular surgery or argon laser trabeculoplasty within 6 months. Current use of contact lenses. History of severe dry eye syndrome. Ocular inflammation/infection with three months of inclusion. Any condition preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Unacceptable finding at prestudy ocular examination as specified in the Case Report Forms. In Investigator regards monotherapy insufficient with respect to optic nerve head and/or visual field status. Treatment of elevated IOP with any topical Badrenergic antagonist regularly for a period longer than 3 months and/or treatment at any time during 6 months prior to study start. Cardiac failure, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree of atrioventricular block. Bronchial asthma, history of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Having participated in any other clinical study within the last month.</criteria>
