	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease caused by an imbalance between natural defence mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa and microbes in the intestinal lumen. We hypothesise that an improvement or even normalisation of this balance may be achieved by the use of vaccines and dietary oats. The combined use of oral typhoid vaccine and cholera/ETEC-vaccine is supposed to stimulate mucosal defence factors, while dietary oats modifies the microbial environment inside the intestinal lumen. Or study aim is to show if such treatment brings symptom relief to patients with ulcerative colitis.</brief_summary>
