	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether low dose complex B-vitamins (folic acid,vitamin B6 and vitamin B12) can lower the risk of developing hyperhomocysteinemia in an apparently healthy population with low folate/B12 and high Hcy status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Low-dose Complex B-vitamins on Homocysteine and Framingham Risk Score Among Chinese Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperhomocysteinemia has been well known as an independent risk factor for CVD. Numerous studies have demonstrated that certain kinds of vitamin B(folic acid,vitamin B6 and vitamin B12)can reduce Hcy level and may prevent CVD. However, the majority of those studies has been conducted always used high dose vitamin in patient or high risk population. There is thus absence of data that the effectiveness of low dose complex B-vitamins on the apparently Chinese elderly population with relative sub-nutritional status. Our study is just focus on the aforementioned aspect.</detailed_description>
