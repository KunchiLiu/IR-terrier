	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the recombinant vaccine for safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults volunteers. Single dose, intranasally administered vaccine using an adenovirus-recombinant vector has provided a safe route for inducing protection in animals against pandemic influenza in preclinical studies. The vaccine is non-replicating, tissue culture based and designed for intranasal delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Adenovirus-vectored, Intranasal Pandemic Influenza Vaccine.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the AdhVN1203/04.H5 vaccine when administered intranasally in two doses with an interval of 28 days in healthy adults 19-49 years of age. The secondary objective is to evaluated the immunogenicity of the AdhVN1203/04.H5 vaccine at three different doses (10e8, 10e9 and 10e10 viral particles) when administered intranasally in two doses with an interval of 28 days in healthy adults 19-49 years of age.</detailed_description>
