	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents With Bulimia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to have an equal chance of either receiving CBT or SP. Participants will include both individuals with DSM-IV bulimia nervosa (BN), and patients with sub-threshold BN. Adolescent patients will be treated at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, with a target recruitment of 20 patients completing the study. Participants in both conditions will be assessed prior to treatment and at the end of treatment. This trial is intended to serve as a pilot investigation to determine the feasibility and utility of a larger controlled study in this population.</detailed_description>
