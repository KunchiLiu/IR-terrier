	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of administration of the oral beta-2 adrenergic agonist, albuterol, on respiratory muscle strength in individuals with cervical (neck) and high thoracic (upper back) spinal cord injury and to compare findings with those obtained in a demographically matched group that will receive placebo. Participation in this study will involve 12 weeks of pharmacological intervention during which participants will be randomized to receive either oral albuterol 4mg twice daily or placebo. All investigators and study participants will be blinded to randomization by our research pharmacy. Participation in the study will require study subjects to come to our lab for the total of 2 visits (at baseline and after week 12), during which a series of tests will be performed to assess their respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function.</brief_summary>
