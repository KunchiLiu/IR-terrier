	<brief_summary>When angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the blood vessels of the heart is the treatment for a Heart Attack, there is damage to the heart muscle that is caused by the sudden opening of the blood vessels. This is called "reperfusion injury". The cell death is due to inflammation and the generation of free radicals. The primary objective of this study is to determine if post-conditioning(four brief (30 second) PTCA balloon inflations) reduces damage to the heart muscle. This will be measured by heart enzyme tests-CK measurements- and by cardiac MRI.</brief_summary>
