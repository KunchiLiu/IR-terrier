	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Of Chinese Herbs In Osteoarthritis Of The Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of this project are: 1. To determine whether HLXL improves pain and/or function in patients with OA of the knee who continue to have symptoms despite receiving standard analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory treatment, 2. To identify an optimal dosage of HLXL, among three dosages, as determined by pain relief and/or functional improvement, in a dose-escalation, placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase II clinical trial, in conjunction with indicia of safety and tolerability in patients with OA of the knee who are receiving standard analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory treatment, 3. To explore mechanisms of action of HLXL, correlating changes in biological markers of suppression of systemic inflammation with changes in clinical response</detailed_description>
