	<brief_summary>This is a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled prospective clinical trial evaluating the impact of apple cider vinegar on serum HDL. 112 participants will be randomized to consume either 2 tablespoons of vinegar daily or a placebo containing a 2% balsamic vinegar solution in water. Baseline, two month and 4 month blood samples will be obtained for fasting lipids. The primary endpoint is met if HDL levels increase in the treatment arm versus baseline after 2 month intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Those older than 18 years of age Park Nicollet Health Services patient Because of a potential positive effect of vinegar on improving diabetes mellitus8 and the subsequent change in medication regime for diabetes diabetic patients will be excluded from this study.
