	<brief_summary>Specific aims: 1. To obtain pilot data on 4-week continuous quit rates associated with 10 weeks of treatment with topiramate or placebo or topiramate plus nicotine patch for smoking cessation. 2. To obtain pilot data on the effects of 10 weeks of topiramate versus placebo versus combination of topiramate plus nicotine patch on nicotine withdrawal symptoms, smoking satisfaction, and adverse effects during smoking cessation. 3. To obtain pilot data on weight gain over 10 weeks with topiramate versus placebo versus combination of topiramate plus nicotine patch for smoking cessation.</brief_summary>
