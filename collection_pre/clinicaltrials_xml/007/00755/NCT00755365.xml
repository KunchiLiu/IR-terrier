	<brief_summary>Mortality associated with pelvic fractures resulting from blunt trauma ranges between 6 and 18%. In cases where hemodynamic instability is also present, the mortality rate is significantly greater, and has been reported as high as 60%. There is no general consensus among traumatologists as to the initial management of this complicated subgroup of patients. It is largely debated whether emergent orthopedic fixation or angiographic embolization should be the first line of treatment for pelvic hemorrhage</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Angioembolization in the Management of Pelvic Fracture-Related Hemodynamic Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic fractures are not usually isolated injuries and it is common that these severely injured patients have concomitant abdominal or thoracic trauma further complicating their management. In situations where multiple sources of hemodynamic instability exist, the need to control hemorrhage quickly becomes imperative. In patients where emergent laparotomy or thoracotomy is indicated, the time until pelvic bleeding sources are addressed is prolonged. Some would argue that the best initial management of the pelvic fractures should be surgical stabilization, while others would support immediate angioembolization of actively bleeding pelvic vessels. The main drawback of angiographic embolization is that it occurs in a separate Angio Suite facility, with concerns being time lost to patient transport and an environment less capable of managing these extremely unstable patients. At Hershey Medical Center, ten patients suffering pelvic fractures with associated hemodynamic instability between 2003 and 2007 were managed with intraoperative angioembolization (in the Operating Room as opposed to the Angio Suite). Extensive review of published orthopaedic, trauma surgery, and radiology journals yielded no other literature regarding intraoperative angioembolization as a management approach for these patients. Whether or not this approach has been carried out at other medical institutions, it is undoubtedly rare and results have yet to be reported in widely available literature. This novel approach has the potential to stop pelvic bleeding sooner and in a more controlled environment, where surgical stabilization can also be accomplished simultaneously. Statistical analysis and review of these patients has not been done, but may possibly show improvements in survival, shorter length of hospital stay, less time to embolization, and decreased need for supportive measures such as blood or platelet transfusion.</detailed_description>
