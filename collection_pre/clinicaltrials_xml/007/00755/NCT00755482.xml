	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Aquamin F versus placebo on NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) dose reduction in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. Hypothesis 1: After 12 weeks of treatment, subjects taking Aquamin F will use significantly less NSAID medications for symptoms of osteoarthritis versus placebo alone.
