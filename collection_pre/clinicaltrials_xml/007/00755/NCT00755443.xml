	<criteria>Diabetic either noninsulin or insulindependent (according to World Health Organization Report) on pharmacologic treatment (insulin or hypoglycaemic agents) for at least 1 month, and presented de novo coronary stenoses in 1,2 or 3 native vessels with symptoms or objective evidence of ischemia. Stenoses had to be amenable for stent implantation, with vessel size smaller than 4.0 mm (as assessed visually on angiography) Impaired glucose tolerance without pharmacologic treatment, gestational diabetes or transient hyperglycaemia Stenoses located in saphenous bypass, arterial bypass grafting, unprotected left main or involving important side branches (&gt; 2 mm) that should be treated during the procedure Left ventricle ejection fraction &lt; 25% Prior treatment with intracoronary brachytherapy or other drug eluting stent at target site Restenotic lesions; known allergies to aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel acute coronary syndromes with persistent ST elevation &lt; 72 hours and/or CPK twice the upper normal limit NonST elevation acute coronary syndromes with CPK twice the upper normal limit Severe hepatic or renal disease (creatinin clearance &lt; 30 ml/min or hepatic enzymes twice the upper normal limit); and life expectancy &lt; 1 year</criteria>
