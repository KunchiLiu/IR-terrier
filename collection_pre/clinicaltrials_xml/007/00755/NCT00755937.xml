	<brief_summary>This registry is a multi-center, prospective, observational program that will gather and analyze data on subjects with Crohn's disease being treated with Remicade® as per approved product monograph in Canada. In contrast to a controlled clinical trial, there is no imposed experimental intervention and treatment with Remicade® is determined solely by the subject's physicians. Thus, the data captured and reported in this registry will reflect a "real world" approach to the treatment of Crohn's disease with Remicade®.</brief_summary>
