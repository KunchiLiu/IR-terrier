	<brief_summary>The current study investigates Welchol as add-on therapy to pioglitazone to improve glycemic control in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus not adequately controlled with pioglitazone monotherapy or pioglitazone in combination with either metformin or a sulfonylurea. The study will evaluate if Welchol add-on to pioglitazone therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious.</brief_summary>
