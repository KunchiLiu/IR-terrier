	<brief_summary>The goal of our research is to check the levels of D-Serine, Glycine, and other Glutamatergic amino acids, in patients with First Psychotic Episode (FPE). These patients are in the early stage of the disease, treated with neuroleptics for short periods of time, and are usually hospitalized for the first time. The hypothesis of the research is that we will find low levels of Glycine and D-Serine in these patients. Following an Anti-psychotic treatment we will expect these levels to return to the norm, and that this correction will be accompanied by a reduction of positive and negative symptoms. In addition, we will check the D-Serine and Glycine levels in the plasma of first degree relatives of the patients and a group of healthy subjects. The results of this study might support the hypothesis that the Glutamatergic system in involved in the pathology of Schizophrenia from it's early stages. In addition, we will check the levels of Oxytocin and Estrogen in the plasma of patients in FPE. Our hypothesis is that we will find low levels of Estrogen and High levels of Oxytocin in this group of patients. The results of the study might support the hypothesis that Estrogen and Oxytocin are involved in the pathology of Schizophrenia from it's early stages.</brief_summary>
