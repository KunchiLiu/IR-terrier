	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Combination With Gemcitabine, to Placebo in Combination With Gemcitabine, in Treatment of Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human pancreatic cancer overexpresses a number of important tyrosine kinase (TK) growth factors receptors and ligands, including expression of both PDGF and PDGF receptors. Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in pancreatic cancer. Masitinib is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-Kit (mast cell growth factor receptor), PDGF receptor, FGF receptor and to a lower extent the FAK kinases. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that masitinib can reverse resistance of pancreatic tumor cell lines to gemcitabine. Based on pre-clinical and phase 2 clinical studies, masitinib can be considered as a good candidate to use in combination with gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas 2. Chemo na√Øve patients with advanced/metastatic disease 3. Documented decision justifying non eligibility for surgical resection. The documentation of the non eligibility for surgical resection will be reviewed by an independent committee. 4. Men and women, age &gt;18 years 5. Men and women of childbearing potential (entering the study after a confirmed menstrual period and who have a negative pregnancy test), must agree to use two methods (one for the patient and one for the partner) of medically acceptable forms of contraception during the study and for 3 months after the last treatment intake. 6. Patient should be able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per protocol. 7. Patient should understand, sign, and date the written voluntary informed consent form at the screening visit prior to any protocolspecific procedures performed. Main 1. Patient treated for a cancer other than pancreatic cancer within 5 years before enrollment, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or in situ cervical cancer 2. Any condition that the physician judges could be detrimental to subjects participating in this study; including any clinically important deviations from normal clinical laboratory values or concurrent medical events Previous treatment 3. Any antitumor therapy (any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy) within 6 months prior to baseline 4. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to baseline</criteria>
