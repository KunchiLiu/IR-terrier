	<brief_summary>This was a study to measure the ability of desloratadine and levocetirizine to decrease nasal obstruction in subjects who had study-induced allergic rhinitis. Study participants had allergic rhinitis symptoms induced in a Vienna Challenge Chamber and then received desloratadine or levocetirizine for 8 days. After at least a 10 to 35-day washout period (time when no drug is given), subjects received the opposite treatment for 8 days. Subjects had their total nasal symptom measured.on the 8th day of each treatment period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 to 45 years of age Were free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with study evaluations. Demonstrated hypersensitivity to the grass allergen used in the chamber unless confirmed previously within 12 months. Hypersensitivity to the allergen was documented by a positive response to the skin prick test with a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the diluent control and by a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) class of &gt;=2 (rating scale 0 6). Had a history of SAR for at least 2 years, as diagnosed by the investigator, another physician, or subjectprovided history. Reported having shown therapeutic efficacy with previous use of an antihistamine (without a decongestant). At the screening allergen provocation, the subject had a nasal obstruction symptom severity score of at least moderate (&gt;=2) and a decrease from baseline in nasal airflow (mL/sec) measured by rhinomanometry of &gt;=30% within 2 hours of allergen exposure. Also, the subject had a nasal obstruction symptom severity score of none or mild (&lt;=1) prior to exposure to allergen. Women who were pregnant or nursing. Had a body mass index (BMI) &gt;=30 kg/m^2. Had asthma; were being treated with inhaled or oral corticosteroids, chromones, theophylline, leukotriene inhibitors, or shortacting inhaled Î²2agonists (except during or immediately after the allergen exposures); and could not go through the washout periods and the entire study without needing these medications. Developed wheezing or dyspnea during the screening allergen exposure. Had a respiratory infection during the 4 weeks prior to predose evaluations. Had any clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination that, in the investigator's judgment, could interfere with the study evaluation or affect subject safety. Had any history of or laboratory evidence of hepatic failure or renal failure with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) known to be &lt;30 mL/min. Had a known potential for hypersensitivity, allergic, or idiosyncratic reaction to the study drug or excipients. Had nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps and marked septum deviation, that significantly interfered with nasal airflow.</criteria>
