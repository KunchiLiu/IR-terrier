	<brief_title>Analysis of Cortical Excitability in Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are several brain areas responsible for neuropathic pain reported in functional image studies, including primary sensory cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate gyrus. However, it is few informations about the functional status of these areas. Besides, the reason of the individual variability about the developement of neuropathic pain remains unknown. It is lack of satisfactory explanation about why some people developed neuropathic pain in certain diseased situation (for example, type 2 diabetes), while others do not. We hypothesis that patients with neuropathic pain has abnormal cortical excitability and plasticity in certain brain area. Therefore developed neuropathic pain certain diseased condition while others not. Therefore, we will use multimodal electrophysiology tools,such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and contact heat evoke potential to monitor the cortical excitability and plasticity non-invasively.</detailed_description>
