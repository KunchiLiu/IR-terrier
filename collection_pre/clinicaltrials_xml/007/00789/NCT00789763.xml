	<brief_title>Phase I-II to Evaluate Efficacy/Safety of Sorafenib+Gemcitabine+Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety profile and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended Dose (DR) of Sorafenib in combination with Gemcitabine and Radiotherapy Definition of maximum tolerated dose (MTD): The MTD is defined as the highest dose level which can be given to 6 patients such that no more than 1 patient experiences a DLT . Definition of Recommended Dose (DR): Is the MTD Definition of Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT): DLT will be defined as any of the following occurring during the period of treatment and regarded as related to the combination regimen. - Grade 4 thrombocytopenia persisting greater than 4 days, or with bleeding requiring platelet transfusion - Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days - Febrile neutropenia (≥ 38.5oC) with an absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1000/mm3 - Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity related to the combination [occurring despite optimal supportive care, if applicable] except hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, deep venous thrombosis, or hyperbilirubinemia secondary to stent malfunction. - Hypertension that is symptomatic and not managed by maximal use of three different classes of antihypertensives, or any episode of malignancy hypertension (Detailed Dose Modifications and G-CSF use in case of febrile neutropenia will be outlined in the full protocol version) Phase II Primary objective: Activity profile evaluating Progression-free rates (PFR) at 6 months Secondary objective: Response rate Overall survival Toxicity profile</detailed_description>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment 5. General medical or psychological conditions that would preclude appropriate informed consent or compliance with the protocol. 6. Previous cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from NSCLC except cervical cancer insitu, treated basal cell carcinoma, superficial bladder tumors (Ta and Tis) or any cancer curatively treated &gt; 3 years prior to study entry 7. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs (within 30 days prior to study entry). 8. Concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy. 9. Therapeutic anticoagulation with Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin or with heparins or heparinoids. Low dose warfarin is permitted if INR is &lt;1.5 . Low dose aspirin is permitted . 10. Patients with any medical condition which could jeopardize their safety while his participation in the study . 11. Significant weight loss (&gt; or equal 10% body weight during preceding 6 weeks) 12.
