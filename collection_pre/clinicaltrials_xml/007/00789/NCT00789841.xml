	<brief_summary>We will study the total gastrointestinal transit time (GITT), gastric emptying and small intestine motility in NET patients before and after treated with somatostatin analogues and compare these to healthy subjects. For this we will use radio-opaque markers and the newly developed Motility Tracking System (MTS). Hypothesis: Patients with NET and carcinoid syndrome have decreased GITT, gastric emptying and small bowel transit time and an increase in phase III MMC activity compared to healthy subjects. Treatment with somatostatin analogues increase transit times and decrease phase III MMC activity and improves the clinical symptoms.</brief_summary>
