	<criteria>1. Patients with Asymptomatic Brugada syndrome. "Brugada syndrome" is defined as the presence of a TypeI Brugada electrocardiogram [coved STsegment elevation â‰¥2 mm (0.2 mV) in V1, V2 or V3] either spontaneously (at rest, in the baseline state or during a febrile episode) or following a standard drugchallenge test (with flecainide, ajmaline, procainamide, or pilsicainide) and recorded either with standard electrode position or with the precordial electrodes placed on the second or third intercostal space. Negative T waves in the precordial leads are not required to define a Type I electrocardiogram. "Asymptomatic patients" will be defined as patients without a history of cardiac arrest, a history of "arrhythmic syncope" or a history of "suspected arrhythmic syncope." Arrhythmic syncope" is a syncope occurring during documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias. "Suspected arrhythmic syncope" is syncope without documented arrhythmias believed to be caused by a tachyarrhythmia based on clinical judgment. In other words, patients with typical vagal syncope will be counted as "asymptomatic" and will be accepted to the registry whereas patients with a clinical history suggesting "syncope other than vagal syncope" will not be accepted to this Registry. Genetic confirmation (identification of a diseasecausing mutation) will not be required for establishing the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome but will be recorded when present. 2. Patients with Questionable Brugada Syndrome who are asymptomatic. Patients with "Questionable Brugada Syndrome" are defined as patients with type II or III electrocardiogram who have an inconclusive result during a drug challenge with a sodium channel blocker. "Asymptomatic" is defined as above. Genetic testing will not be required. However, patients with "Questionable Brugada" based on electrocardiographic criteria will be defined as "Patients with Brugada Syndrome" if a diseasecausing mutation is identified. 1. A history of cardiac arrest, "arrhythmic syncope" or "suspected arrhythmic syncope" (as defined above). 2. Evidence of organic heart disease. The evaluation considered mandatory for excluding heart disease will consist of electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and exercise stress testing. Additional tests will be performed only if clinically indicated. 3. Evidence of noncardiac disease likely to affect 5year survival.</criteria>
