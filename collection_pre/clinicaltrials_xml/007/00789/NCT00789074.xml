	<brief_summary>Varenicline (Champix) is a relatively new medicine that is effective in helping people to quit smoking. It is normally started 1-week before stopping smoking and used for up to 12-24 weeks. We are trying to find out if using varenicline for an extended time (4-weeks) before stopping smoking is better than the standard 1-week of use prior to stopping. The study will recruit 100 smokers who want to stop. They will be randomly allocated to receive varenicline(4−weeks) or placebo (3−weeks followed by 1−week of active treatment as indicated by standard prescribing practice), followed by a 12−week open label treatment period where all participants will receive varenicline.</brief_summary>
