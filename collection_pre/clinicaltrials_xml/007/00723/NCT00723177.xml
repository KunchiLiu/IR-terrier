	<brief_summary>Repeated use and/or abuse of opioid medications is generally associated with a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after cessation of drug administration. The present study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of AV411 to alter opioid-induced withdrawal symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIa Study of AV411, a Glial Activation Inhibitor, for Opioid Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid-induced cytokine release and glial activation has been proposed to directly contribute to the affective and physiological aspects of withdrawal. Furthermore, cytokine release following opioid administration has been hypothesized to be a limiting factor in both the duration and magnitude of opioid-induced analgesia. The two primary goals of our study are to assess AV411's ability to 1) reduce the opioid-withdrawal syndrome and 2) increase and prolong the analgesic effects of the mu-opioid agonist, oxycodone. To explore whether AV411 decreases opioid-induced glial cell activation, some participants assigned to the placebo and high dose AV411 groups (n = 6 for each dose condition) will be studied twice with [11C]PK11195, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer used to measure the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in the human brain. The PBR is a receptor located on the mitochondria of the microglia and can be used to examine microglial activation in various brain regions.</detailed_description>

(Individuals who have a positive PPD test and have a negative chest Xray, are not symptomatic for tuberculosis, and do not require antituberculosis therapy will be eligible to participate. Participants will be asked if they ever tested positive for tuberculosis. If so, they will not be given a PPD and a chest Xray and clinical history will be used for evaluation purposes).

Requirement for any of the following medications (current or within the past 4 weeks): psychotropics (including sedative/hypnotics, antidepressants, neuroleptics), anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, or antiretroviral medications,. Participants on any current psychoactive prescription medications will be excluded. Current dependence (by DSMIV criteria) on methadone, LAAM, or buprenorphine Participants for whom detoxification is not "clinically recommended" such as those with a significant history of overdose following detoxification Participation in an investigational drug study within the past 3 months Hypersensitivity to any of the medications used in this study Participants who are positive for HIV or chronic active hepatitis Metal implants or paramagnetic objects contained within the body which may interfere with the MRI scan, as determined in consultation with a neuroradiologist and according to the guidelines set forth in the following reference book commonly used by neuroradiologists: "Guide to MR procedures and metallic objects" Shellock Frank G., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Healthcare, Philadelphia, 2001.
