	<brief_summary>In the MDACC/BrUOG neoadjuvant trial with weekly paclitaxel followed by Fluorouracil Plus Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (FAC), the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in HER2(-) patients was 20%. The investigators' goal is to develop an induction chemotherapy regimen that will have a pCR rate above 30% in patients with HER2(-) disease. Based on a 1-sided 95% confidence interval using normal approximation with an expected pCR rate of at least 35%, approximately 28 patients are required for each cohort. With an assumed pCR rate of at least 35%, the investigators will have approximately 70% statistical power to conclude, with 90% certainty, that the pCR rate with the novel regimen exceeds 20%. The study will accrue approximately 60 patients in two cohorts with an inevaluable rate that does not exceed 10%.</brief_summary>
