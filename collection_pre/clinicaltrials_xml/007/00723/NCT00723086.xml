	<criteria>Patients who completed the 10 cycles of docetaxel administrations in the preceding XRP6976J/2101 study and wish to continue docetaxel administrations,and who have no alternative therapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer according to the Investigator's judgment. Continuation in the study would be detrimental to the patient's wellbeing Development of lifethreatening and/or toxic conditions not manageable by symptomatic care, dose reduction, or delay of dosing Obvious disease progression (rising prostate specific antigen, any increase of â‰¥ 20 % in the sum of the measurable lesion in comparison to the nadir value, and progression in nonmeasurable lesion) Patients treated with anticancer treatment other than study therapy after completion of 10 cycles of study treatment in the XRP6976J/2101 study</criteria>
