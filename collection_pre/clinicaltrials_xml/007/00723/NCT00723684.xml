	<brief_summary>Background: Electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback has been shown to offer therapeutic benefits to patients with ADHD in several mostly uncontrolled studies with relatively small sample sizes. It is unknown how EEG-neurofeedback affects brain functioning and exerts therapeutic effects in ADHD. This study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of EEG-neurofeedback in a scientific rigorously way and to study the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of EEG-neurofeedback. Objectives: 1. To investigate the efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback in reducing behavioral symptoms of ADHD. 2. To investigate whether EEG-neurofeedback is able to improve neurocognitive functioning. 3. To investigate whether EEG-neurofeedback is able to improve neural functioning. Study design: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled treatment study.Study population: 120 subjects with ADHD (age 8-15, IQ of 80 or more). Intervention: 60 subjects with ADHD receive 30 sessions EEG-neurofeedback, and 60 subjects with ADHD receive placebo EEG-neurofeedback. Main study parameter: ADHD-DSM-IV rating scale, rated by the investigator. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is EEG-Neurofeedback can reduce symptoms of ADHD.</brief_summary>
