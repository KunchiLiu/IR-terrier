	<brief_summary>The role of the dendritic cells, the most potent antigen presenting cells, in the establishment of chronic hepatitis C is not established. The study aims to define whether the dendritic cells are affected by the hepatitis C virus and whether that bears an impact on the antiviral immune response they generate. The hypothesis is explored by investigating a group of patients prior to and after the initiation of standard treatment for hepatitis C with pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin.</brief_summary>
