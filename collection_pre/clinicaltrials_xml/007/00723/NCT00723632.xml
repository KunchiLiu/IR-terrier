	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the costs associated with peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) plus ribavirin (Rebetol) treatment for chronic hepatitis C in the Czech Republic. Only costs associated with rescue medication, concomitant therapy, disease monitoring, and medical intervention costs recognized by the treating institution as treatment-related expenses will be included in the analysis.
