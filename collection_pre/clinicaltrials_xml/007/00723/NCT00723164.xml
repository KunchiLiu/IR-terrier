	<brief_summary>The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of fentanyl-midazolam premedication during sevoflurane induction pertaining to time to loss of eyelash reflex (LER), time and conditions of insertion of proseal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA), as well as cardio-respiratory data. Participants' anxiety level was also evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eighty adult patients undergoing minor surgery were randomized in a double-blind fashion. Each group received either a NaCL placebo (NaCl), or a premedication consisting of fentanyl 0,6 ug/kg and midazolam 9 ug/kg (FM), five minutes before tidal volume sevoflurane 8% induction with 6 L/min O2. Times to LER and LMA insertion were recorded. Adverse events were also noted. Systolic blood pressure (sBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (Vt) were recorded at one-minute intervals. End-tidal sevoflurane (EtSevo) and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) were noted immediately following LMA insertion. Anxiety levels (0-10 verbal scale) were registered before and after premedication. Patients were contacted 24 hours postoperatively and were asked if they remembered the mask being applied to their face.</detailed_description>
