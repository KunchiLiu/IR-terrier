	<brief_summary>This observational study is being conducted in patients receiving statin treatment as secondary prevention of coronary heart disease under the current standard of care in compliance with European guidelines. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the percentage of these patients that reach target LDL levels. Additionally this study will measure the patient's compliance to treatment as assessed by counting the returned tablets. Both assessments will be made at visits conducted 6-8 weeks after the first visit and 28-32 weeks after the first visit.</brief_summary>
