	<brief_summary>We propose to study the episode rate, duration, and quantity of HSV-2 genital shedding in patients taking standard, FDA approved, CDC recommended doses of acyclovir (400 mg PO BID) for HSV-2 suppression compared to taking no medication to better define the effect of acyclovir on short bursts of rapidly cleared HSV-2 shedding. This study will be a randomized, open label, cross-over trial. We hypothesize that short bursts of HSV-2 reactivation will not be suppressed by acyclovir.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial to Evaluated the Suppressive Effect of Acyclovir on Rapidly Cleared HSV-2 Reactivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to study the episode rate, duration, and quantity of HSV-2 genital shedding in patients taking standard, FDA approved, CDC recommended doses of acyclovir (400 mg PO BID) for HSV-2 suppression compared to taking no medication to better define the effect of acyclovir on short bursts of rapidly cleared HSV-2 shedding. This study will be a randomized, open label, cross-over trial. We propose to perform this study in two study populations. Cohort 1 will be comprised of 25 HSV-2 seropositive, HIV seronegative adults, and Cohort 2 will be comprised of 25 HSV-2 seropositive, HIV seropositive adults with a CD4 count&gt;250 cells/mm3. As suppression of HSV-2 using acyclovir is currently being studied in large, multi-center, international clinical trials as an HIV prevention strategy, these results will have broad implications for public health around the world.</detailed_description>
