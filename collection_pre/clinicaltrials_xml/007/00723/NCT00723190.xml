Presence of clinically significant abnormality on centrally interpreted electrocardiogram readings History or presence of a concomitant psychiatric disorder requiring psychotropic medication or a severe concomitant axis I or axis II disorder that could interfere with study assessments in the judgment of the Principal Investigator Presence of a disorder that would interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of clonidine Presence of alcohol or drug abuse.</criteria>
