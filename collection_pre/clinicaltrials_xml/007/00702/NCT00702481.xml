	<brief_title>Study of Nimotuzumab and Cisplatin/Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). EGFR pathway activation is associated with tumor growth, decreased apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis. These present a putative target for the use of EGFR inhibitors either in the form of small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies. Several studies have been advanced that suggest application of these targeted therapies show promising responses with little additional toxicity. The addition of EGFR monoclonal antibodies to radiation results in better response rates and locoregional control compared to radiation alone. Addition of EGFR monoclonal antibodies compared to chemotherapy alone also improves the response rates in patients with advanced HNSCC. Nimotuzumab is a humanized chimeric monoclonal antibody specific to the extracellular domain of EGFR. Several studies are ongoing and demonstrate promising efficacy of Nimotuzumab as monotherapy and in combination with radiation in HNSCC, and in combination with chemoradiation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. This phase II clinical trial examines the feasibility of EGFR inhibition using Nimotuzumab in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced unresectable HNSCC. Successful and safe incorporation of an EGFR monoclonal antibody into the concurrent chemoradiation paradigm used to treat locally advanced HNSCC will represent an important advance in the optimisation of treatment for this group of patients.</detailed_description>
