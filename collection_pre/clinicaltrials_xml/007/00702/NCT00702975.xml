One prior regimen (up to 4 cycles) of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for early stage disease will be allowed if completed at least 6 months prior to study entry. Known brain metastases (in case of clinical signs or symptoms of brain metastases radiological evaluation is mandatory). Prior treatment with bevacizumab or erlotinib.
