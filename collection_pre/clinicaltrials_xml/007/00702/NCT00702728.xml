	<brief_summary>This study is being proposed with the objective to assess the potential benefits of induced diuresis by furosemide with matched hydration therapy compared to standard hydration in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). It is expected that matched hydration will prove to be as effective as hydration alone, will avoid an overnight stay prior to the procedure, and thus will prove to be a less costly and more clinically manageable solution to the prevention of CIN.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induced Diuresis With Matched Hydration Compared to Standard Hydration for Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN) Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiocontrast agents (contrast) are widely used in coronary and peripheral vascular catheterization procedures. Although the use of these iodine-containing agents is vital for these procedures, it can be associated with adverse side effects. CIN is one of the most important adverse effects of contrast agents, and can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, intravenous hydration before the catheterization procedure is the only current treatment that has been shown to reduce the incidence of CIN. However, in patients with baseline impairments in renal function, hydration is commonly performed at a rate significantly lower than that shown to provide protection due to the fear of overhydration and pulmonary edema. Previous studies have used diuretics to increase urine output and prevent overhydration. In addition to the benefit of increased urine flow, loop diuretics, such as furosemide, should be expected to provide additive benefit against another potential mechanism of CIN, medullary ischemia, as they reduce sodium reabsorption, and consequentially oxygen consumption, of the kidney. While the results of their use have been mixed, it appears that furosemide was deleterious in patients who became dehydrated, i.e. those in whom the urine output was substantially greater than the rate of hydration they received. This problem may be overcome by a device, which is now available on the market, called the RenalGuard System. The System is capable of delivering saline solution to a patient in an amount matched to the volume of urine produced by the patient. The purpose of this matched fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension or fluid overload.The aim of the study is to compare furosemide-induced diuresis with matched hydration therapy compared to standard hydration.</detailed_description>
