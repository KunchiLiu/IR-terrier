	<brief_summary>The objectives of this trial were to investigate the feasibility and the optimal dose of a single administration of Org 36286 to induce monofollicular ovulation in women with WHO Group II anovulatory infertility and to assess the safety (including the absence of antibody formation) of Org 36286.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Optimal Dose of Org 36286 to Induce Monofollicular Ovulation in Women With WHO Group II Anovulatory Infertility (P07016)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, comparative trial to investigate the optimal dose of a single administration of Org 36286 to induce monofollicular ovulation in women with WHO Group II anovulatory infertility. Treatment injection was given on Day 1-3 after the onset of a spontaneous or progestagen induced withdrawal bleeding. After injection, ultrasound monitoring and sampling for serum hormones were done on treatment Days 3, 5, and daily from Day 7 to 21 or until a urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) peak was detected. From treatment Day 7 the urinary LH response was assessed to detect the preovulatory LH peak. In case of hyperstimulation, production of endogenous gonadotropins could be suppressed by giving daily injections of GnRH antagonist. Post-treatment assessments were done in the third week after the urinary LH peak. If no LH peak was detected, posttreatment assessments were performed four to five weeks after Org 36286 or placebo injection.</detailed_description>
