	<brief_title>Study of Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-Acquired Weakness (Handgrip Strength Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have generated the hypothesis that handgrip strength can be used to develop our understanding of the effects of critical illness on peripheral muscle strength. To begin to develop this hypothesis, a better understanding of the determinants of handgrip strength needs to be developed. As a result we propose to perform a prospective observational study examining the clinical factors that are associated with handgrip strength. Several clinical factors are known to be associated with increased risk of developing ICUAP while hospitalized: multiple organ failure, severe sepsis, female gender and treatments like steroids. As many of these risk factors are not modifiable, the opportunity to intervene is unclear. However, by attempting to better describe the spectrum of strength deficits experienced by critically ill patients we may better be able to dissect and prevent ICUAP.</detailed_description>
