	<brief_summary>TB-403 is a monoclonal antibody directed against Placental Growth Factor (PlGF). The antibody binds to PlGF and inhibits the binding to it's receptor, VEGF-1. By preventing this binding, growth of tumor vessels are inhibited and tumor growth prevented. In this study we are investigating the tolerability and safety of TB-403 in patients with solid tumors who receives multiple intravenous doses of TB-403.</brief_summary>
