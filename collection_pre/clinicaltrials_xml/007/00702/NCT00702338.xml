	<brief_summary>The objective of follow-up study P05713 is to evaluate whether corifollitropin alfa (Org 36286) treatment for the induction of monofollicular growth in women who underwent ovulation induction (OI) in base study P05693 (NCT00697255) is safe for pregnant participants and their offspring.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Base study P05693 (NCT00697255) was planned to include two separate stages (Ia+Ib and II). Stage Ia was open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (recFSH) would provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Stage Ib was open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=3) to explore whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose Human Chorion Gonadotropin (hCG) would provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Stage II was planned to be open-label and randomized (n=40) to evaluate whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by low dose recFSH (n=20) or hCG (n=20) would provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. P05713 is a follow-up (FU) study to prospectively monitor pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcome of women who became ongoing pregnant during base study P05693 (NCT00697255). For this trial, no study specific assessments will be required and no treatment will be administered, but information as obtained in standard practice will be used. Enrollment will begin when the first ongoing pregnancy resulting from the base study has been established (ultrasound â‰¥ 10 weeks after bolus injection of hCG).</detailed_description>
