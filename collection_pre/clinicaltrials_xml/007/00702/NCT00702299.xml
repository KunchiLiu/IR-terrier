	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving pemetrexed together with cisplatin and paclitaxel and giving them in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of intraperitoneal pemetrexed when given together with intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage III ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy comprising intraperitoneal (IP) pemetrexed disodium in combination with IP cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with optimally debulked stage III ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer in relation to the percentage of patients completing at least 6 courses of treatment. - To determine the toxicity and the tolerability of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - To observe 80% of these patients progression free at 18 months after initiation of chemotherapy. - To determine, as an exploratory endpoint, the median overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - To investigate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen at the determined MTD in these patients. - To conduct correlative studies on tumor tissue and blood from these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemetrexed disodium. Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intraperitoneally (IP) on day 1, cisplatin IP on day 2, and paclitaxel IP on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At least 10 patients are treated at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). Whole blood samples and tumor tissue specimens are obtained from patients at baseline and banked for future DNA, RNA, and protein studies related to prediction of disease progression and treatment resistance. Plasma and intraperitoneal fluid samples may also be collected from patients treated at the MTD for pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma concentrations of pemetrexed disodium by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry-HPLC. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
