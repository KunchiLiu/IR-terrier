	<criteria>Biochemical evidence of myocardial infarction as indicated by elevation of cTnT, presence of ECG ischemic changes, angiographic evidence of a primary coronary event, such as plaque erosion and/or rupture, fissuring, or dissection at coronary angiography, successful coronary revascularization of at least one culprit coronary vessel. Age&gt;80 years, current ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment, ejection fraction &lt;35%, infarction secondary to ischemia due to an imbalance of O2 supply and demand, ECG abnormalities that could affect the recognition of ST segment shift, recent or chronic infective or inflammatory diseases, malignancy, and myocardial infarction, surgery or trauma in the previous month.</criteria>
