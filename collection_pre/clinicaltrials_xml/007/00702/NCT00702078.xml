	<brief_summary>We want to improve the treatment of patients suffering from COPD (3-4) by early medical intervention in the patients home. A close cooperation between the hospital and the primary healthcare system will hopefully reduce hospitalisation, drug consumption and improve quality of life. Following up from the hospital and the primary healthcare in cooperation may lead to earlier detection and treatment of exacerbations in COPD. The main outcome variable will be number of hospitalizations assessed simply by counting. The second objective will be Quality of life and activation assessed by different questionnaires included in St.GeorgeÂ´s Respiratory Questionnaire.</brief_summary>
