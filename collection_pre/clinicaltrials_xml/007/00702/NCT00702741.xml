	<brief_title>Follow-up Study of ChondrogenÂ® Delivered by Intra-Articular Injection Following Meniscectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term safety of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (Chondrogen) has not yet been established. This 3-year follow-up study will provide additional data to gain understanding of the safety of the investigational agent. This study is designed to determine the safety of a single intra-articular injection of 50 million donor-derived hMSCs or 150 million donor-derived hMSCs in suspension with commercial sodium hyaluronan compared to an injection of vehicle (diluted hyaluronan) alone. The injections were performed under the initial study, Protocol No. 550.</detailed_description>
