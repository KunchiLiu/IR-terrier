	<brief_summary>Clinical trial objectives are to investigate the efficacy and safety of a single injection of 100 Î¼g Org 36286 in women weighing 60 kg or less to induce multifollicular development for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), using daily recFSH as a reference.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Investigate Efficacy and Safety of a Single Injection of Org 36286 for Ovarian Stimulation Using Daily Recombinant FSH as Reference (Ensure)(P05690/MK-8962-001)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, equivalence clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen with Org 36286, a recombinant gonadotropin applied to initiate and sustain follicular stimulation in COS for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). For this regimen, patients receive a single injection of Org 36286 and one week later, treatment is continued with daily recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. In the reference group patients receive daily injections of recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. Equivalence between the two treatment groups in the number of oocytes retrieved is the primary objective of this trial.</detailed_description>
