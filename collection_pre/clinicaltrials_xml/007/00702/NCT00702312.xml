	<brief_title>A Bengali Dietary Salt Study to Control Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conducted an exploratory study initially to learn about the East London Bangladeshi (ELB) kidney patients salt intake. Furthermore, we assessed their educational needs to inform the development and implementation of an educational programme to reduce dietary salt intake in line with the Department of Health recommendations for a good blood pressure control. The educational programme will be tested in a randomized controlled trial. We are interested in salt because studies have shown that salt is one of the causes of high blood pressure. Scientific studies have also shown that the longer a person has high blood pressure the more the damage to the kidneys.</detailed_description>
