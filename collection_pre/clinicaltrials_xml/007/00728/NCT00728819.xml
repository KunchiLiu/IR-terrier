	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different marketed PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) designs. Clotting rates, procedural bleeding and ease of catheter insertion will be compared. It is hypothesized that the non-tapered design has a lower clotting rate and is easier to place than the tapered design. Bleeding rates are expected to be about the same.</brief_summary>
