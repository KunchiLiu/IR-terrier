	<brief_summary>Research in test tubes suggests that may affect cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an important enzyme that is responsible for eliminating many drugs that cancer patients need to take, including dextromethorphan. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of PF-00299804 on the activity of CYP2D6, and how the human body handles dextromethorphan.</brief_summary>
