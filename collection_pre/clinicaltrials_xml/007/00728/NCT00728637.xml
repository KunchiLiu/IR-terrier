	<brief_title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Family Heart Health Educational Program (The FIT-Heart Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FIT Heart was a randomized controlled trial that tested a novel systems approach to increase adherence to national prevention guidelines among family members of patients hospitalized with CVD. Participants were blood relatives or cohabitants of patients hospitalized with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, aged 20-79 years, did not have established cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and spoke English or Spanish. Participants randomized to a special intervention group received behavioral counseling and education on diet and physical activity; personalized risk factor screening and immediate feedback; and reinforcement and follow-up throughout the year. The control group received a brief CVD prevention message in the form of a handout. All participants received standardized assessments of diet, lifestyle, and CVD risk factors at baseline and 1 year (94% follow-up). The main findings have been published showing the mean percent change in LDL-cholesterol level from baseline to 1-year improved in both groups and was not significantly different in the special intervention vs. control group (-1% vs. -2%; p=.64).</detailed_description>
