	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters and safety of a single dose of ST-246 400mg Form I versus ST-246 400mg Form V capsules in fed normal healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial of an Investigational Small Pox Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase I, double-blind, cross-over, single-dose study of the orally administered anti-orthopoxvirus compound, ST-246, to 12 healthy, fed volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 years. Subjects were randomized such that 6 subjects received either ST-246 Form I (monohydrate) followed 10 days later after a wash-out period by Form V (hemihydrate), and 6 subjects received ST-246 Form V followed by Form I, as for the previous group. Both forms of ST-246 were similar in the way they were manufactured. The only difference between Form I and Form V may be related to how it dissolves, and this may affect the way that it is absorbed in the human body. Information about any side-effects that may occur will also be collected in this study.</detailed_description>
