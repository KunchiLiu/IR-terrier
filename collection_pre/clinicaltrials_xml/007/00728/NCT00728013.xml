	<brief_summary>In summary, the CHILLAS study will be the first multicenter study performed in a Chinese population using a patient-level analysis to compare the effects and safety of intensive statin therapy with that of moderate statin therapy. Therefore, it will determine whether "lower is better", that is, whether LDL cholesterol lowering to a level of approximately 100mg/dl provides a benefit inferior to that of LDL cholesterol lowering to a much lower level; examine the role of inflammatory markers in predicting cardiac events and response to statin therapy; and evaluate the effects of statin therapy on regression of coronary atherosclerosis using IVUS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>China Intensive Lipid Lowering With Statins in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CHILLAS study is planned to evaluate whether intensive treatment with statins for 2 years results in a reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. A total of 1,600 patients will be randomly assigned to receive intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin, 20 or 40 mg/d, or equivalent dose of other statins) or moderate therapy (atorvastatin, 10 mg/d, or equivalent dose of other statins). Both groups receive dietary counseling. Over a 2-year follow-up period, the primary outcome measure is the time to occurrence of cardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary-artery bypass grafting, documented unstable angina or severe heart failure requiring emergency hospitalization, and stroke. The planned duration is between December 2006 and December 2009.</detailed_description>
