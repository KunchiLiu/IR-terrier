	<brief_summary>This prospective, randomized study will evaluate the performance of the Osseotite Certain Prevail implant when compared to that of the non-lateralized version of the implant. Study (null) hypothesis: the crestal bone changes that take place after placement and loading of the Osseotite lateralized implants will be the same as for a similar but non-lateralized Osseotite Certain implant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Certain Prevail Implants Used for the Preservation of Crestal Bone in Short Fixed Bridge Cases.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study in which qualified patients with partial edentulism will receive a short-fixed bridge restoration. Each implant site is randomized to receive either the Osseotite Certain Lateralized (test) or the Osseotite Certain Non-lateralized (control). All implants will receive a temporary prosthesis after two months of placement. Enrollment will include up to 20 patients (approximately 60 implants per center) at each participating study center.</detailed_description>
