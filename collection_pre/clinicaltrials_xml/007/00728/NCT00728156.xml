	<brief_summary>Patients with diabetes are more likely to develop furring of their coronary arteries and present with angina and heart attacks. Furthermore, after such an event, they have poorer outcomes (higher rates of death) and survivors are more likely to have recurring symptoms. Using a novel "clotting chamber" the investigators have shown that patients with diabetes are more likely to develop blood clots. This study will look at the role of different blood thinning medications in patients with diabetes. If successful, the investigators will provide evidence to conduct large clinical studies to look at the role of additional blood thinning medication in reducing heart attacks and strokes in patients with diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet-dependent Thrombosis: a Placebo-controlled Trial of Antiplatelet Therapy (Clopidogrel)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare the effect of Clopidogrel on platelet dependent thrombosis in patients with T2DM and CAD with placebo. The Badimon chamber, an ex vivo arterial injury model is used for this purpose. This model simulates the in vivo situation of high shear arterial wall damage and helps to quantify thrombus which is the sum endpoint of all haemostatic abnormalities seen in vitro.</detailed_description>
