	<brief_summary>This prospective, multicenter study evaluates the performance of the Osseotite Prevail implant when to support a short fixed bridge with immediate occlusal loading, providing the patient with the use of a temporary prosthesis until the final prosthesis is made. Study (null) hypothesis: This is an observational study in which no concurrent control group will be observed. Results of the study will be compared with the performance of other Osseotite implants from published Osseotite multicenter studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Osseotite Certain Prevail Implants Used to Support Short Fixed Bridges With Immediate Occlusal Loading.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, observational study in which all the patients will have implants placed and a provisional prosthesis attached within 24 hours of implant surgery. Each restorative case will consist of a posterior short span fixed bridge of four implants or less. The final prosthesis will be placed within five months or implant placement surgery. Overall success will be determined on the basis of procedural success, prosthesis success, and implant success.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients of either sex and of any race, 18 years of age or older patients for whom the decision has already been made to use dental implants for treating partial edentulism in the posterior mandible or maxilla using a short span fixed prosthesis of two to four units patients must be physically able to tolerate conventional surgical and restorative procedures requirements for implant placement include: at least 1mm bone will be available at the buccal and lingual aspect of the implant and at least 1mm of bone below the apex patients must agree to return to the clinic for each study followup visit requirements for prosthetic fabrication include: bone width at least 6mm and a bone height of at least 11mm patients with active infection or severe inflammation in the areas intended for implant placement patients with a &gt;10 cigarettes / day smoking habit patients with uncontrolled diabetes or metabolic bone disease patients with a history of therapeutic radiation to the head patients in need of bone grafting at the site of the intended study implant; if at the time of surgery some lateral voids need to be filled this is acceptable and does not exclude the patient from the analysis patients who are known to be pregnant patients with parafunctional habits with evidence of severe bruxing or clenching placement of implants into sites with less than sixteen weeks of postextraction healing; for 34 unit cases one implant site may have less than sixteen weeks of healing prior to implant placement type III or IV bone characteristics of the intended implant sites interarch distance of less than 7mm (planned location of implant seating platform to the apposing occlusal landmark)</criteria>
