	<brief_summary>EGAST 2008 is a prospective, non interventional, multicentric study (approximately 2000 isolates from 15- 20 sites). Objectives: - Comparison of antimicrobial susceptibility using disc-diffusion method - Assessing prevalence of beta-lactamase producing strains among clinical isolates obtained from hospital in-patients</brief_summary>
