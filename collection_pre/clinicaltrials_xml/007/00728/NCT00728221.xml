	<brief_summary>Ginseng has been used for many years in a wide array of anecdotal medicinal properties. Animal and limited clinical research points to the vascular effects of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG). The present project aims to assess the efficacy of KRG and contribution of its factionated components on various indices of vascular function in healthy individuals. Our primary objective is to compare the acute effects of KRG and placebo on endothelial function. Moreover, our secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of isolated KRG factions on arterial stiffness, blood pressure and vasoactive markers. We hypothesize that (1) consumption of KRG will cause an improvement in endothelial function in healthy individuals, as compared to placebo; (2) consumption of KRG will cause an improvement in arterial stiffness and blood pressure in healthy individuals, as compared to placebo; (3) the ginsenoside faction of KRG is primarily responsible for the anticipated vascular effects.</brief_summary>
