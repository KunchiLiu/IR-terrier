	<brief_summary>This study will examine the peritoneal tissue, serum and dialysate proteins of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with different types of peritoneal solute transport by differential proteomics techniques. This study will be performed to identify the molecular difference between different types of peritoneal solute transport and explore biomarker for early detection as well as early intervention of peritoneal ultrafiltration failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ultrafiltration failure (UFF) is an important cause of technical failure in PD patients. It may develop over time and is, therefore, especially important in longterm PD. However, the study on UFF is very limited so far, there are still lack of biomarker for early detection and intervention of UFF. Proteomics uses a rapidly evolving group of technologies to identify, quantify, and characterize a global set of proteins. It is characterized by high-throughput, high specificity and high-sensitivity. Therefore, proteomics has become a major focus of recent medical research. This study will examine the peritoneal tissue, serum and dialysate proteins of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with different types of peritoneal solute transport by differential proteomics techniques. Correlation analysis will be used for the relationship between clinical data and the differential proteins, as well as verification of the differential proteins in the peritoneal tissue, serum and dialysate of patients with UFF. This study will be performed to identify the molecular difference between different types of peritoneal solute transport and explore biomarker for early detection as well as early intervention of peritoneal ultrafiltration failure.</detailed_description>
