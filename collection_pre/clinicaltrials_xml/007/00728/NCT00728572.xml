	<brief_title>Logan Basic Technique Measured by Surface Electromyography (EMG)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LBT is a low force adjusting technique that focuses on the foundation segment of the spine, the sacrum, with application of contact on the sacrotuberous ligament which relieves fatigued and strained muscles, particularly intrinsic muscles of the back. Surface electromyography (EMG) is a method of analyzing the activity level of superficial muscles. It is convenient and advantageous when studying muscle relaxation which occurs in biofeedback studies</detailed_description>
