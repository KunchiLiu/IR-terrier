	<brief_title>Low-Dose Thalidomide as Adjuvant Therapy After Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous studies showed that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was as effective as liver resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the recurrence rates after RFA were relatively high. Adjuvant therapies maybe reduce the recurrence rate. Phase 1 and 2 studies showed that thalidomide was a safety and effective treatment for HCC, especially for small HCC with liver cirrhosis. So we proposed that low-dose thalidomide adjuvant therapy will improve the disease progress free survivals and overall survivals after RFA for HCC.</detailed_description>
