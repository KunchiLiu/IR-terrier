	<brief_summary>Study to compare PK of a new 100mg capsule with four 25mg capsules. This is required because we plan to have only single capsules administered in the later phase clinical trials but we have not had a 100mg strength before. As this is a new previously untested strength we need to ensure that the PK is similar to that achieved using 4 x 25mg. The study will also assess the effect of high fat food on the PK of the 100mg capsule. The study is planned to consist of a single part , with three dosing periods, periods 1-3 consisting of 16 subjects. There will be a week wash out between each dose. In the three dosing periods subjects will either received 4x25 mg GSK598809 capsule in a fasted state, 100mg capsule in a fasted state or 100mg GSK598809 capsule in a fed state. Subjects will return to the centre for follow-up 7-14 days after the final dose. It is expected that the total duration of the study should be approximately eight weeks.</brief_summary>
