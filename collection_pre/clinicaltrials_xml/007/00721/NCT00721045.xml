	<brief_summary>This is a dose-ranging clinical study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of 3 different doses of immunoselected, culture expanded, nucleated, allogeneic MPCs in subjects who have cardiomyopathy of both ischemic and idiopathic etiology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Dose-escalation Study to Assess the Feasibility and Safety of Transendocardial Delivery of Three Different Doses of Allogeneic Mesenchymal Precursor Cells (MPCs)in Subjects With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure subjects recruited will include those who have advanced heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class II to IV and a depressed ejection fraction (EF &lt; 40%). Baseline eligibility testing assessments will be completed within 28 days prior to cell delivery. Efficacy will be explored at 3, 6, and 12 months. This will be a single-blinded, dose-escalation, cohort study in 60 subjects allocated sequentially to 1 of 3 cohorts A, B, or C. Forty-five subjects will be randomized to receive transendocardial delivery of MPC treatment, and 15 subjects will be randomized to receive standard-of-care treatment without MPC administration. The fifteen subjects randomized to receive standard of care without needle injection will serve as the study's control population and will undergo mock mapping and verbal injection scripts.</detailed_description>

Cardiogenic shock defined as the need for intravenous inotropic support, an intraaortic balloon pump, or mechanical circulatory support at the time of cell injections. 8. Chronic AF or AF at the time of cell injections. 9. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease &gt;50%. 10. Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke as diagnosed by CT/MRI events within the last 3 months prior to enrollment. 11.

History of cancer prior to screening (excluding basal cell carcinoma). 22. Acute or chronic infectious disease, including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 23. Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study. 24. Treatment and/or an uncompleted followup treatment of any investigational. therapy within 6 months before procedure and intent to participate in any other investigational drug or cell therapy study during the 3year followup period of this study. 25. Active participation in other research therapy for cardiovascular repair/regeneration. 26. Prior recipient of stem precursor cell therapy for cardiac repair.</criteria>
