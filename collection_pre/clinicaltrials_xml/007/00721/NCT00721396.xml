	<brief_summary>Primary :1.To demonstrate a sufficient immune response of rMenB+OMV NZ, when given concomitantly with routine infant vaccines to healthy infants at 2, 4 and 6 and 2, 3 and 4 months of age, as measured by percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity (SBA) titer ≥1:5, at 1 month after the third vaccination Secondary :To demonstrate that immunogenicity of routine infant vaccines, when given concomitantly with rMenB+OMV NZ to healthy infants at 2, 3 and 4 months of age, was non-inferior to that of routine infant vaccines given without rMenB+OMV NZ. 2. To demonstrate that the immunogenicity of rMenB+OMV NZ when given concomitantly with routine infant vaccines was non-inferior to that of rMenB+OMV NZ given without routine infant vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. 3. To assess prevalence of meningococcal B antibodies over the study period by evaluation of SBA, at baseline and at 1 month after third vaccination, in subjects- received routine infant vaccine without rMenB+OMV NZ.</brief_summary>
