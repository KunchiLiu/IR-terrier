	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of using the demethylating agent 5-Azacytidine prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5-Azacytidine Prior to Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant in High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug, 5-azacytidine, is given daily intravenously for 7 days. After every 2 cycles study participants will have a bone marrow test to evaluate the effect of the 5-azacytidine on the Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Participants continue to get cycles of 5-Azacytidine until 2 bone marrow tests show the MDS has stopped responding to the treatment. At that time they will undergo a transplant if a donor is available.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients fulfilling the following criteria will be eligible for study entry: 1. Diagnosis of MDS according to WHO criteria 2. Intermediate2 or high risk by IPSS score 3. Clinically able to receive 5Azacytidine 4. Serum bilirubin levels &lt;/=1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range for the laboratory (ULN). Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis 5. Serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels &lt;/=2 x ULN 6. Serum creatinine levels &lt;/=1.5 x ULN 7. Negative serum pregnancy test prior to 5Azacytidine treatment for women of childbearing potential 8. Women and men of childbearing potential agree to use contraception while receiving treatment with 5Azacytidine 9. Potentially eligible for allogeneic transplantation 10. No prior allogeneic transplant 11. Age 18 to 70, inclusive. 1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to 5azacytidine or mannitol 2. Patients previously treated with 5azacytidine or deoxyazacytidine 3. Pregnant or breast feeding 4. Patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors</criteria>
