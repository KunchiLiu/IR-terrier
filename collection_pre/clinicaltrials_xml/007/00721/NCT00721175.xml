	<brief_title>Efficacy and Cost Analysis of Plastic Stent Compare to Metallic Stent in Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two types of biliary stents: 1) the plastic stent made from polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene; and, 2) the metal stent braided in the form of a tubular mesh from surgical-grade stainless steel alloy and designed to expand to a maximum diameter of 10 mm. The main drawback of the plastic stent is the relatively high occlusion rate, but its advantage is the lower cost. The use of a metal stent for hilar tumor has many theoretical advantages: 1) the flexible open-mesh design should allow drainage of secondary duct branches; and, 2) its larger diameter may provide better drainage and longer patency (~3-9 months). Whether one type of stent is superior in terms of adequacy of drainage or cost-effectiveness remains undefined. Therefore, we would conduct this study to assess the efficacy of drainage of endoscopically-inserted, unilateral, plastic stents vs. metallic stents in unresectable, complex, hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients.</detailed_description>
