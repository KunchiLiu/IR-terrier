	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate and refine a breast screening and diagnosis device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Digital X-ray and Ultrasound Technique for Improved Detection and Characterization of Breast Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The device produces 3-D mammograms and ultrasound pictures of the breast at the same time and in the same position. This should help make sure that any area on a mammogram can be easily found in the ultrasound when using the new device. The 3-D mammograms should provide better visualization of the suspected lesion and improve diagnostic accuracy.</detailed_description>
