	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of once daily [q.d] subcutaneous [s.c.] injections of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) with q.d. s.c. injections of Enoxaparin for the prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events [VTE] in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of AVE5026 in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, and to document AVE5026 exposure in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of AVE5026 as Compared to Enoxaparin for the Prevention of Thromboembolism in Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization had to take place just prior to the first study drug injection (randomization ratio 1:1). The total duration of observation per participant was 35-42 days from surgery broken down as follows: - 7 to 10-day double-blind treatment period; - 28 to 35-day follow-up period. Mandatory bilateral venography of the lower limbs had to be performed between 7 to 11 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
