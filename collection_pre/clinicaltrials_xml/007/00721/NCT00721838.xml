	<brief_title>Dietary Intake and Eating Behaviors in Adolescents Who Undergo Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dietary and eating behavior outcomes for adolescents who undergo bariatric surgery are virtually unknown. The main trial of the Teen-LABS consortium is not studying dietary intake and eating behavior before and after bariatric surgery. The consortium, however, provides a unique opportunity to investigate these issues in a large and diverse sample through the context of the proposed ancillary study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>19 years old or younger have a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 have attained or nearly attained physical maturity and have a history of unsuccessful, organized attempts at weight management. must demonstrate reasonable decision making abilities must also fit the following criteria: (1) no prior bariatric surgical procedure, (2) no physical illness not due to obesity, and (3) no fulltime special education (due to the high reading demand of study participation). Participants will be from all racial and ethnic groups and be both male and female. We will not exclude participants from this trial based on health status or medication usage. Instead, we will track medical conditions and medication usage at every assessment point throughout the investigation to assess the possible influence of these variables on changes in weight, dietary intake, and eating behavior.</criteria>
