	<brief_title>Lovastatin: Immunomodulatory Value Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the fact that HAART produces a decrease in HIV-1 replication and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and allows an increase in the CD4 T-cell count that leads to a diminution in the incidence of opportunistic infections and mortality, the cost and complexity of HAART regimens, the growing list of long-term side effects, and the eventual development of resistance have underscored the immediate need for additional therapeutic approaches. Statins exert pleiotropic effects through a variety of mechanisms, among which there are several immunological effects that are related and unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering activity. HIV-1 requires cholesterol and lipid rafts for several key stages of its replication cycle; statins-mediated depletion of cholesterol alters the capacity of a cell to form lipid rafts and decreases the HIV-1 infectivity. On the other hand, statins may exert significant modulator effects in the balance of the cytokine network, and alter the activity of Rho GTPases and LFA-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules. Preliminary studies showed that statins (Lovastatin) had anti HIV-1 activity, and that its administration was safe and efficient to control HIV-1 infection in chronically infected individuals who did not receive HAART (in terms of decreasing viral load and increasing CD4 T-cell count). Because very limited clinical data are available on this topic, this study will be conducted.</detailed_description>
