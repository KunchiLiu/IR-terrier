	<brief_summary>Although a large number of obese patients develop high blood pressure, the cause is unknown. The purpose of this study is to look at the effect of high fatty acids (a type of fat) in the development of high blood pressure in obese people.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FFA Hypertension and Inflammation in Lean and Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies indicate that increased levels of a circulating fat (free fatty acids or FFAs) increases blood pressure, impairs endothelial (vascular) function, and increases inflammatory markers in subjects with and without diabetes. The effects of FFA on blood pressure and vasculature have not been fully investigated. A group of 12 obese nondiabetic, normotensive subjects will be admitted to the Grady Clinical Research Center (GCRC) on separate 4 occasions. Research subjects will receive, in random order, a 8-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of Intralipid 20% at 40 mL/h (a fat solution), 8-hour IV infusion of normal saline at 40 mL/h, 8-hour IV infusion of dextrose (sugar) 10% at 40 mL/h, and a 8-hour intravenous (IV) infusion combination of Intralipid 20% and dextrose 10% at 40mL/h.</detailed_description>
