	<brief_title>A Study to Determine if Technosphere速 Inhalation Powder (FDKP) Causes ECG Changes (QTc) Following the Medication's Inhaled Administration.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo- and active-controlled cardiac safety study in 48 healthy subjects (both male and female subjects) designed to assess the effect of FDKP on cardiac repolarization, if any, following introduction of Technosphere速 Inhalation Powder via inhalation. Each trial subject will be administered 20 mg of FDKP, 40 mg of FDKP, 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin (active), and placebo in a crossover design during an 11 day in-patient stay.</detailed_description>
