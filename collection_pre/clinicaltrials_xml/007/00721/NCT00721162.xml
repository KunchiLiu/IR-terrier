	<brief_title>Study of Ramucirumab in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current chemotherapies used to treat ovarian cancer participants include doxorubicin, topotecan, and paclitaxel, to mention a few. Doxorubicin was studied in ovarian cancer participants that were refractory to paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy agents. Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important regulator of angiogenesis and is likely an important therapeutic target in persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. VEGF is overexpressed in ovarian tissue and may be the most important single tumor angiogenic factor. Phase 1 studies currently nearing completion with ramucirumab have demonstrated safety and tolerability at clinically relevant doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in ovarian cancer participants. Therefore, ImClone Systems plans to conduct a Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab in participants with platinum-refractory persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each participant must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study: 1. The participant has recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via a pathology report 2. The participant has at least one unidimensionalmeasurable target lesion [≥ 2 centimeter (cm) with conventional techniques, or ≥ 1 cm by spiral computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy 3. The participant has recovered to Grade ≤ 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (NCICTCAE v3.0) from the effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other targeted therapies for ovarian cancer, with the exception of alopecia or peripheral neuropathy (which must have resolved to Grade ≤ 2). Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to the first dose of study medication, or hormonal therapy discontinued at least one week prior to the first dose of study medication. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted 4. The participant has completed at least one platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease, and must have at least one of the following: a platinumfree interval of &lt; 12 months after the final dose of primary platinumbased therapy, progression during platinumbased therapy, or persistent disease after platinumbased therapy 5. The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 01 at study entry 6. The participant has adequate hematological functions [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1200 cells/microliter (uL), hemoglobin ≥ 9 grams/deciliter (g/dL), and platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/uL] 7. The participant has adequate hepatic function [bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 times ULN, or ≤ 5.0 times ULN if the transaminase elevation is due to liver metastases] 8. The participant has adequate renal function [serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (measured or calculated) ≥ 60 milliliters/minute (mL/min)] 9. The participant's urinary protein is ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA). If urine dipstick or routine analysis indicated ≥ 2+ proteinuria, then a 24hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate &lt; 1000 milligrams (mg) of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study 10. The participant has adequate coagulation function, as defined by international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN if not receiving anticoagulation therapy. Participants on fulldose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin, and if on warfarin must have therapeutic INR and have no active bleeding (defined as within 14 days of first dose of study medication) or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (example, tumor involving major vessels or known varices) 11. For participants who have received anthracycline therapy, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be within normal institutional range by a pretreatment echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan 12. If sexually active, the participant is postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception in the opinion of the investigator 13. The participant is ≥ 18 years of age 14. The participant has a life expectancy of ≥ 3 months 15. The participant is able to provide informed written consent and is amenable to compliance with protocol schedules and testing 1. The participant has a concurrent active malignancy, other than adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or other noninvasive carcinoma or in situ neoplasm. A participant with previous history of malignancy is eligible provided that she has been diseasefree for &gt; 3 years 2. The participant has received a noncytotoxic regimen (usually called targeted therapy such as bevacizumab) for recurrent or persistent disease. (Participants may have received a noncytotoxic regimen as primary treatment.) 3. The participant has received radiotherapy for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer within 3 weeks (21 days) prior to the first dose of study medication 4. The participant has received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis other than for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer within the last 3 years. [Prior radiation for localized cancer (for example, of the breast, head and neck, or skin) is permitted, provided that it was completed &gt; 3 years prior to the first dose of study medication, and the participant remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.] 5. The participant has received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor, other than for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer &lt; 3 years prior to the first dose of study medication. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer is permitted, provided that it was completed &gt;3 years prior to the first dose of study medication, and that the participant remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease 6. The participant has undergone major abdominal surgery within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to first dose of study medication 7. The participant has a suspected impending bowel obstruction, based on clinical or radiographic criteria 8. The participant has received any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor discontinued therapy within 1 week (7 days) prior to first dose of study medication 9. The participant has received any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, within 3 weeks (21 days) prior to first dose of study medication 10. The participant has received previous treatment with ramucirumab 11. The participant has participated in clinical trials of experimental agents within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to first dose of study medication 12. The participant has a history of uncontrolled hereditary or acquired bleeding or thrombotic disorders 13. The participant has an ongoing or active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months, Grade ≥ 2 peripheral vascular disease, poorly controlled hypertension despite standard medical management poorly controlled thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorder, psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, or any other serious uncontrolled medical disorders in the opinion of the investigator 14. The participant has any history of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Screening for central nervous system (CNS) involvement for testing asymptomatic participants is not required 15. The participant has known human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndromerelated illness 16. The participant is pregnant [confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) test] or lactating</criteria>
