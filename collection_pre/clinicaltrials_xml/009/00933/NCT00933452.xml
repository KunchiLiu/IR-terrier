	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Duloxetine in Chinese Han Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open, parallel assignment (low-dose, moderate-dose and high-dose), inpatient, sequential-group pharmacokinetics study of single oral administered and multiple oral administered to healthy Chinese male and female subjects at a single investigational site. All subjects are from the Chinese Han race. Approximately 36 healthy male and female Chinese subjects will participate in this study. One half of the subjects enrolled in each dose group will be female. Twelve subjects will be enrolled in each of 3 dose level groups. Safety will be evaluated from self-reported adverse events, scheduled physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory test results. Single-dose blood samples (5 mL) will be obtained within 2 hours before test article administration and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after test article administration. Multiple-dose (subjects of moderate dose group finished first step single-dose 30mg trial, one week later, will be repeatedly administered duloxetine 30 mg 7days) blood samples (5 mL) will be obtained at 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th day before test article administration (to test the valley concentration)and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after last test article administration (7th day). Cross-over (subjects of high dose group finished first step single-dose 60 mg generic duloxetine trial, one week later, will be administered single-dose innovator duloxetine 60 mg) blood samples will be obtained as same as first step.</detailed_description>
