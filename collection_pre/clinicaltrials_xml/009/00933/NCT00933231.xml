	<brief_summary>This is a multicentre study examining the use of Advagraf-minimization strategy and/or the use of an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system in reducing chronic rejection in renal allografts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Standard Versus Low Dose AdvagrafÂ® With or Without Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEi)/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) on Histology and Function of Renal Allografts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of the following 4 treatment groups.: 1. Standard dose Advagraf with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) antihypertensive therapy 2. Standard dose Advagraf without ACEi/ARB antihypertensive therapy 3. Low dose Advagraf with ACEi/ARB antihypertensive therapy 4. Low dose Advagraf without ACEi/ARB antihypertensive therapy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is the recipient of a first or second deceased or living donor renal transplant (one kidney only) Subject must have at least one HLAmismatch with the donor. HLA identical donorrecipient pairs are not eligible Subject understands either English or French If female and of childbearing potential, subject has a negative pregnancy test and utilizes adequate contraceptive methods Presence of donor specific antibody Subject who is currently participating in a study with investigational drug, or who has received investigational drug within three months prior to randomization. Observational studies are acceptable Subject who has lost a previous graft for immunological reasons less than one year from transplant Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding Subject receives a kidney lacking preimplantation biopsy Subject has significant disease (e.g. malignancy or uncontrolled infection) or disability (e.g. cognitive defect) which prevents understanding of, or adherence to the protocol Subject who in the opinion of the Investigator, require ACEi/ARB therapy posttransplant for any indication Subject who requires induction with Thymoglobulin, Campath, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) or any biological induction agent other than basiliximab. Unplanned posttransplant use of these prohibited drugs for clinical indications posttransplant is allowed Subject has plans to become pregnant within 2 years posttransplant Subject who has a positive Tcell or Bcell crossmatch. Subjects with a weakly positive Bcell crossmatch that tests negative following DTT reduction are acceptable Subject who has a requirement for maintenance immunosuppressant therapy with the exception of low dose steroid or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). A subject who is on low dose tacrolimus maintenance therapy will be eligible provided the tacrolimus is withheld at least 1 week prior to transplant</criteria>
