	<brief_title>Magnesium Chloride Versus Placebo in Patients Who Have Had a Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis being tested is that these six treatments will improve muscle weakness and lead to an improvement in functioning/activities of daily living as measured by the 100-point Barthel index, three months after their last treatment versus their baseline measure, and that the mean difference between the treatment and placebo groups of patients will be at least three points in this index.</detailed_description>
