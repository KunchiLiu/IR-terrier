	<brief_summary>The optimal strategy to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) of less than 48 hours' duration is still controversial. The investigators performed a controlled single-center trial to compare electrical and pharmacological (propafenone) cardioversion to restore the sinus rhythm in selected patients with acute atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
