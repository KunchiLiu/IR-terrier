	<brief_summary>Dose finding part: A phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety of combined sorafenib and everolimus treatment in patients with relapsed solid tumors (finished). Extension part:Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS mutation after ≥ 1st relapse (recruiting)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SORAVE - Sorafenib and Everolimus in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose finding part: Patients will be recruited to receive combination of defined sorafenib dose (2x400mg) with increasing dose of everolimus (2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg). There will be a run-in phase of 14 days of everolimus followed by combination sorafenib+everolimus starting from day 15. The combination will be continued as long as it is tolerated by the patient and the patient benefits from the treatment according to RECIST criteria. The maximal tolerated dose will be establish in 3+3 design. Patients will be recruited sequentially at least 14 days apart. The next dose level according to 3+3 design will be initiated if all patients on the previous dose level reach day 29. Extension part: Patients will be treated with a dose of 7,5 mg Everolimus for 14 days (run-in phase) and sorafenib 2x 400 mg until progression</detailed_description>
