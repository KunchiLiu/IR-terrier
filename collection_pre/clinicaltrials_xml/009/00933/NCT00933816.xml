	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of the combination therapy of sorafenib with hepatic arterial infusion of low dose cisplatin and fluorouracil on patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Phase I), and to evaluate the efficacy of this combination therapy in the recommended dose (Phase II).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sorafenib In Combination With Low-dose 5-fluorouracil/Cisplatin (FP) Intraarterial Infusion Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase I, there will be 9 to 18 patients enrolled. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive escalated dose of cisplatin and fluorouracil until the MTD is reached. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. Sorafenib will be administered orally at a dose of 400mg bid for 28 days in the all patients. Cisplatin at the dose of 10-20mg/m2 will be administered at day 1 and day8, and fluorouracil at the dose of 170-330mg/m2 will be administered continuously at day1-day5, and day8-day12 via the implanted catheter system. A cycle is defined as 28 days and 3 cycles of this combination therapy will be continued. At the end of each cycle, adverse effect will be evaluated and dose escalation will be determined. In Phase II, there will be 28 patients enrolled. Time to progression of this combination therapy at the recommended dose will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
