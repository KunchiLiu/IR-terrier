	<brief_summary>Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, and fludeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography - computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) are three modalities that generate non-invasive, functional images of tumors and normal tissues based on physiologic properties including perfusion, vascular permeability and glucose metabolism. Demonstrating that these parameters are associated with clinical outcome, either efficacy or toxicity, could enhance the ability to select patients for different treatment strategies and improve the therapeutic ratio.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo functional imaging studies, DCE-MRI pre-treatment (twice) and after 1 week of Radiation Therapy (RT) and PET scans - pre-treatment and after 1 week of RT. Parotid gland saliva production will also be measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up.</detailed_description>
