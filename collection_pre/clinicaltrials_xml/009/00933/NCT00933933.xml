	<brief_summary>To test blood specimens using a new investigational test that detects antigen and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Results will be compared to an approved HIV antibody test and supplemental testing performed to determine HIV status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Diagnostic HIV Ag/Ab Combo Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All specimens collected under separate specimen collection protocols or obtained from specimen suppliers will be provided to the clinical sites performing the investigational HIV test. This includes 6252 specimens collected from normal healthy individuals (7B5-02-05Z01-01: Collection of Specimens Used in Abbott Laboratories In Vitro Diagnostic HIV and Hepatitis Assays Clinical Studies)and from specimen suppliers. 588 specimens from HIV-infected pediatric subjects and 448 pregnant females at risk for HIV infection collected under protocol (7B5-02-05Z01-02: Collection of Pediatric and Pregnant Female Specimens Used in the Abbott Laboratories In Vitro Diagnostic HIV Assay)and from specimen suppliers. All specimens were previously collected and frozen, except for a subset of 586 specimens from normal healthy population and 55 specimen from pregnant females at risk for HIV infection which were collected under separate specimen collection protocols and tested as fresh specimens during the study. In addition, 83 specimens that were HIV antigen positive, 1121 specimens that were HIV-1 antibody positive, 201 specimens that were HIV-2 antibody positive, and 1409 specimens from US at risk for HIV infection or from HIV-2 endemic area were all obtained from specimen suppliers, except for 11 pediatric specimens collected under a separate protocol (7B5-02-05Z01-02: Collection of Pediatric and Pregnant Female Specimens Used in the Abbott Laboratories In Vitro Diagnostic HIV Assay).</detailed_description>
