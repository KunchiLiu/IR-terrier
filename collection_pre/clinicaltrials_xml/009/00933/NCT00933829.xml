	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this prospective, randomized study is to compare cosmetic outcomes between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures in truncal and extremity lacerations in the pediatric and adult population. Secondary outcome measures include wound complications such as infection and wound dehiscence at the initial visit; and parental satisfaction and keloid formation after three months post repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Cosmetic Outcomes of Lacerations Repaired Using Absorbable Versus Non-absorbable Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though there some studies showing good outcomes using absorbable sutures in skin closure in clean surgical wounds, ED based studies still need to be conducted to convince ED physicians that the use of absorbable sutures to close the skin in traumatic lacerations are just as acceptable as traditional non-absorbable sutures. Use of absorbable sutures confers several advantages over non-absorbable sutures. For one, patients do not need an additional physician visit either in the office, or more often that not, in the emergency department. These visits add to ED overcrowding, prolonged length of ED stay and are often not reimbursed if seen in the emergency department. Moreover, adult patients need to miss work or school and children often have to miss school or daycare to have these sutures removed. The potential to avert another traumatic experience from suture removal in children who had been restrained for suture placement is another advantage of using absorbable sutures over non-absorbable sutures.</detailed_description>
