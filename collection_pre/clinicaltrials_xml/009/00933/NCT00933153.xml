	<brief_summary>Researchers will measure weight, height, hand grip strength and quality of life information of Meals on Wheels (MOW) clients who are considered to have nutrition problems. Participants will randomly be put into a group that receives either typical meals from Meals on Wheels or Ensure Plus supplements with their meals. Three months later the same data will be collected again. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of providing oral nutritional supplements (ONS) to MOW clients with or at risk of malnutrition on nutritional status over a 3-month period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) in a Meals-on-Wheels Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While it is well known that older adults are at increased nutritional risk and that nutrition intervention, such as oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) is beneficial in this population, there is limited research on the effect of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in the Meals on Wheels population. This prospective randomized controlled trial will determine the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in addition to daily meals from Meals on Wheels on weight status, hand grip strength, quality of life, and malnutrition screening scores in MOW clients with or at-risk of malnutrition over a 3-month study period.</detailed_description>
