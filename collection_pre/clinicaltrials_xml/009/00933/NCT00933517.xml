Patient has histologically confirmed, nonmetastatic breast cancer, with a clinical tumour diameter of ³ 2 cm HR negative and Her2 negative. Clinical stage II and IIIa. Patients not previously treated by surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy.· Haematology: o Neutrophil count ≥1.5x109/Lo Platelet count ≥100x109/Lo Leucocyte count &gt; 3,000/mmo Hb&gt; 9g/dl· Hepatic Function:o Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time the upper normal limit (UNL)o ASAT ≤ 2.5xUNL in absence of liver metastases, or ≤5xUNL in presence of liver metastases ALAT ≤ 2.5xUNL in absence of liver metastases, or ≤5xUNL in presence of liver metastases Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 time the upper normal limit (UNL)· Renal Function· Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min and serum creatinine ≤1.5xUNL· Metabolic Function o Magnesium ≥ lower limit of normal. o Calcium ≥ lower limit of normal. Patient with no progressive heart disease, and for whom anthracyclines are not contraindicated (normal FEV). Patient has signed the consent forms for participation before inclusion in the trial.

Patients have already undergone surgery for their disease or have had primary axillary dissection. Patient has already been treated for new breast cancer. Patient is a ward. Patient has a history of second cancer, with exception of in situ cervical cancer or basocellular skin cancer which is regarded as cured. Patient has another disease which is deemed incompatible with the patient being included in the protocol. Heart or kidney failure, medullary, respiratory or liver failure.

History of allergy to polysorbate 80. Concomitant treatment with a trial drug, participation in another clinical trial within &lt; 30 days or previous chemotherapy. Patient with no fixed address in the next 6 months or living at a distance from the treatment centre so it is difficult to check her progress.
