	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two insertion techniques of large size ProSeal laryngeal mask airway. We hypothesized that insertion of ProSeal laryngeal mask airway with 90-degree rotation would reduce the contact surface between the device and pharyngeal wall and make it easy to advance the device over the smooth angle against the posterior pharyngeal wall.We compared the success rate and incidence of complication of the standard technique with the rotational technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Rotational Insertion Technique for ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ProSeal laryngeal mask airway is not easy to be inserted due to its larger cuff especially in Asian population. First-time insertion success rate was lower and more time was required to achieve an effective airway even in well-trained physician. A number of techniques have been described to improve the insertion success rate. However, these techniques are only recommended to be used as backup when the digital or introducer tool techniques fail. We hypothesized that insertion of ProSeal laryngeal mask airway with 90-degree rotation would reduce the contact surface between the device and pharyngeal wall and make it easy to advance the device over the smooth angle against the posterior pharyngeal wall.We compared the success rate and incidence of complication of the standard technique with the rotational technique.</detailed_description>
