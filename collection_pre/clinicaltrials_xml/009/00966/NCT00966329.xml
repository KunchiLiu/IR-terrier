	<brief_summary>Patients with HIV-1 infection on HAART regimen including 2 NRTI/NtRTIs plus one of the following : 1 PI/ritonavir or ATV/unboosted or 1 NNRTI, will be randomized to switch from the NNRTI/PI to maraviroc (300 mg /12 h) or to continue with the same approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switching the Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) or Protease Inhibitor (PI) to Maraviroc in HIV Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 48 week randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, proof-of-concept pilot clinical trial. Patients with HIV-1 infection on HAART regimen including 2 NRTI/NtRTIs plus one of the following : 1 PI/ritonavir (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir /ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir) or ATV/unboosted (in a regimen without tenofovir) or 1 NNRTI (nevirapine or efavirenz). Patients will be randomized to switch from the NNRTI/PI to maraviroc (300 mg /12 h) or to continue with the same approach. The primary endpoint would be the percentage of patients who maintain virological suppression at week 48.</detailed_description>
