Any visible skin disorder, abnormal skin pigmentation, fissure or injury of the skin, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the results of the trial. History of dermatological disease or medical conditions (in particular, any immunosuppression) which could, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude topical application of the investigational products and/or interfere with the evaluation of the test site reaction. History of clinically relevant psoriasis, chronic dermatitis or urticaria. Clinically relevant abnormal findings from the physical examination. Pregnant (verified by betaHCGtest in urine) and/or nursing women. Any suspicion or evidence of current alcohol or drug abuse or history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last three years.

Subjects having used nicotine products other than cigarettes within the three months preceding the trial. Participation in the treatment phase of a clinical trial within 30 days prior to the treatment phase of this trial, or within 10 times the respective elimination halflife of the investigational drug. Subjects who cannot avoid, throughout the duration of the trial, any swimming, any washing of the lower back (i.e., the areas which to be patched and/or irradiated during this study), usage of sauna or any intense physical activity that might result in excessive sweating.
