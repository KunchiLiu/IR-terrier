	<brief_summary>The investigators prospectively studied the effect of aspirin on platelet function in 106 stable outpatients 6 months after successful percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Participants were randomized in a double-blind, double-crossover study (80 or 500 mg per day for 6 months).T</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-related Effect of Aspirin on Laboratory-defined Acetylsalicylic Acid Resistance and Clinical Outcome After Coronary Stenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is widely used in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. There is controversy regarding the prevalence of aspirin resistance in patients with coronary artery disease and the effect of dose on resistance. Our primary aims were to determine the degree of platelet responsiveness to aspirin, and to study the influence of dose on platelet inhibition and clinical outcomes after coronary stenting.</detailed_description>
