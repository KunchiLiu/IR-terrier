	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is 1) to study the clinical application of 3D/4D ultrasound for fetal scanning during pregnancy; 2) ) to study the clinical application of 3D/4D ultrasound for pelvic scanning; 3) to demonstrate how to optimally display the different organs. 4) to correlate our findings with other diagnostic tools like MRI, CT; 5) to correlate our findings with clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The 3-Dimensional Ultrasound for Fetal Anomaly Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective studies of patients that coming to the ultrasound (US) unit in Sheba Medical Center from November 2007 for diagnostic US examination. Patients will receive information of the study (printed and oral) and will ask to sign informed consent to act as a research subject and permission to use personal heath information for research. Studies is performed using commercially available ultrasound equipment (Voluson 730 Expert, General Electric Healthcare, Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria) with volumetric abdominal RAB 4-8 MHz and volumetric transvaginal RIC 5-9 MHz transducer probes. During the examination of the patient pictures and 3D/4D volumes will acquired either by static 3D or 4D Volume or STIC (Spacio Temporal Image Corelation), Contrast Imaging in plane C (VCI-C) with and without Doppler (Color, Power and High Definition) and with B-flow. Image quality will be assessed in various modes. For optimizing the image volumes manipulations will be performed by positioning of the</detailed_description>
