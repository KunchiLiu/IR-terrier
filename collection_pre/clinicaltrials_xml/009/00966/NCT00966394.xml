	<brief_summary>Attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD) affect 6% of school-aged children. Few studies reported higher prevalence of caries and restorations among children with ADHD. Methylphenidate is the drug of choice to treat ADHD. according to the medical literature methylphenidate can cause xerostomia. Our study will investigate saliva parameters (such as quantity, bacteria in saliva, buffer capacity), oral hygiene and diet habits and their influence on caries among children with ADHD and among healthy children. Our hypothesis is: - Children with ADHD will have more caries. - Children with ADHD will have more detrimental oral hygiene and diet habits. - There will be a difference in the saliva parameters between children with ADHD and healthy children.</brief_summary>
