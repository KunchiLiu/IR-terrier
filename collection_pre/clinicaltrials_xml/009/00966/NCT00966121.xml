	<brief_summary>Both propranolol and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) are effective for prevention of variceal rebleeding. Recently several studies compared the efficacy of EBL alone and with a combination of propranolol and EBL. However, the results of recent studies showed discrepancy. This study is performed to compare the efficacy and safety of EBL alone and EBL combined with propranolol in patients without previous history of endoscopic variceal treatment.</brief_summary>
