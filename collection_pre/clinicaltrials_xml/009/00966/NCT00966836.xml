	<brief_summary>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of long-term graft failure in heart transplant recipients. Although several immune-mediated and metabolic risk factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CAV, no effective therapy is currently available to treat established CAV and prevent its adverse outcomes. Therefore, the main clinical strategy is based on prevention and treatment of factors known to trigger its development. Although the mechanism is vague, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is believed to play a key role in CAV progression. Two strategies involving administration of specific anti-CMV agents are recommended for prevention of CMV infection/disease: universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy. The pros and cons of the two strategies are still debated, in the absence of randomized studies addressing graft-related outcomes and viral mechanisms of graft damage, and without any clear evidence of superiority of either approach. The investigators conceived this randomized prospective project to compare the effect of preemptive anti-CMV strategy with universal anti-CMV prophylaxis on CMV infection and on one-year increase in coronary intimal thickening. Patients will be additionally randomized to receive either mycophenolate mofetil or everolimus, in light of the possible anti-CMV properties of everolimus.</brief_summary>
