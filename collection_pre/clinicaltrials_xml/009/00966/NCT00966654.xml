	<brief_summary>This research is being done to see if giving a hormone called GLP-1 can improve heart function and reduce length of stay in the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit (CSICU) in people who have non-emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of GLP - 1 (7-36 Amide) on Myocardial Function Following Coronary Artery Bypass (CABG) Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After CABG surgery, a condition known as hyperglycemia or high blood sugar often occurs even in patients who have never been diagnosed with diabetes. This high blood sugar can lead to complications after surgery such as infections at the site of the incision. Additionally, if there is any cardiac muscle injury either prior to or during surgery, the injured cardiac muscle can not use glucose (the body's fuel and energy source) as well as it did prior to the injury. This reduced ability to use glucose slows the cardiac muscles ability to repair itself and provide the normal pumping force and function needed to circulate the blood throughout the body. This inability to repair itself and/or provide the normal pumping force and function can make it difficult for the patient as well as increase the length of stay required in the CSICU. GLP-1 has the ability to lower blood sugar and help cells use glucose for fuel and energy but when the blood sugar becomes low its glucose lowering ability decreases. In this study, we want to see we want to see if GLP-1 may help keep the blood sugar within normal limits and reduce or eliminate the need for insulin. We will also see whether it will help the heart recover more quickly.</detailed_description>
