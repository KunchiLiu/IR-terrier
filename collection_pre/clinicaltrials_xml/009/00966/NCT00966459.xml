	<brief_summary>In this study, 20 COPD patients will undergo a high-resolution/multi slice CT scan and lung function tests to obtain patient specific geometries of the central and peripheral small airways and patient specific boundary conditions. With Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the investigators will be able to reconstruct the geometry and measure the resistance of the peripheral airways. In a later stage, CFD will be used to simulate the reaction of the airways on various inhalation medications.</brief_summary>
