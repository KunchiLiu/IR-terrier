	<brief_title>Traction Assisted Polypectomy of the Intestine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to facilitate the ablation of lesions (polyps, adenomas) in the large (and small) intestine by using a traction assisted technique. The traction will be performed by using a haemoclip connected to surgical suture materials. The haemoclip will be fixed to the intestinal mucosa next to the lesion and a loop will be mounted to perform an endoscopic mucosal resection. The aim of the study is to show the feasibility of this technique.</detailed_description>
