	<brief_summary>In patients who are suspected to have variceal bleedings, pharmacologic therapy with vasoactive drugs such as terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide is recommended as soon as possible, even before endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the efficacies of these drugs are same or not. This study is performed to compare the efficacy of terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide in patients with variceal bleeding for the control of variceal bleeding in combination with endoscopic therapy.</brief_summary>
