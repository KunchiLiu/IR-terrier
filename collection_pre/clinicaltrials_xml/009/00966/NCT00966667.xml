	<brief_title>Health Behaviors in Patients Who Have Finished Treatment for Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To characterize patterns and identify predictors of post-treatment physical activity and dietary changes made by colorectal cancer survivors. Secondary - To identify the affective and cognitive effects of post-treatment physical activity and dietary changes in these patients. - To identify these patients' preferences regarding diet and physical activity health promotion programs. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients complete surveys at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. A randomly selected subset of 84 patients also receive an activity monitor to be use at each of the 3 time points. The acceptability of their use is assessed and whether activity levels change across the 3 time points and the extent to which they are convergent with self-reported physical activity are examined. During each survey, questionnaires are administered to assess the following areas: physical/medical characteristics (self-reported), self-efficacy for physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and dietary fat intake; outcome expectations for physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and dietary fat intake; physical activity and diet behavioral self-regulation; illness representations (causal attributions and controllability of recurrence); perceived risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence; emotional representations of CRC (cancer-related anxiety and worry about cancer recurrence); healthcare provider recommendations to alter physical activity and dietary intake; social influence from important others; current physical activity and dietary intake; and diet and physical activity program preferences. Patients who received the activity monitor are asked feedback on acceptability of them. Measures of sociodemographics and disease/treatment characteristics (via medical chart review) are recorded.</detailed_description>
