	<brief_title>Drug-Drug Interaction Study of VX-809 and VX-770 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease resulting from defects to a gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects approximately 70,000 children and adults worldwide (30,000 in the United States) and is the most common fatal genetic disease in persons of European descent. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is in the mid-30s. Though the disease affects multiple organs, most morbidity and mortality is caused by progressive loss of lung function. This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study of orally administered VX-809 and VX-770 in healthy subjects. The study will evaluate safety and tolerability of co-administration of VX-809 and VX-770 in healthy volunteers. Enrollment is planned for 24 subjects at 1 clinical site. Subjects will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo during three 14-day treatment periods separated by 14-day washout periods. In Treatment Period 1, subjects randomized to study drug will receive VX-809 every 24 hours. In Treatment Period 2, subjects randomized to study drug will receive VX-770 every 12 hours. In Treatment Period 3, subjects randomized to study drug will receive VX-809 every 24 hours and VX-770 every 12 hours. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo during all treatment periods.</detailed_description>
