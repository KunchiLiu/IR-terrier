	<brief_summary>Regulation of ghrelin, growth hormone and growth factors at high altitude and their change during ascent to high altitude has not been studied in depth yet. The study includes 33 volunteers (12f) investigated at sea level, 4 days after ascent to 3440m and 14 days after ascent to 5400-5900m. The investigators hypothesized that during ascent growth hormone levels would increase to compensate for the higher energy needs at high altitude.</brief_summary>
