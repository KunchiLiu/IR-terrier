	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether cash transfers (conditional and unconditional) can improve health and social outcomes amongst children living in vulnerable households in Manicaland, eastern Zimbabwe. The study hypotheses are: 1. Cash transfers will increase the percentage of vulnerable children aged 0-4 years with a birth certificate. 2. Cash transfers will increase the percentage of vulnerable children aged 0-4 years with up-to-date vaccinations. 3. Cash transfers will increase the percentage of vulnerable children aged 6-12 years attending primary school at least 80% of days per month.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cash transfer programmes provide cash to families caring for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). Conditional cash transfer programmes require families to comply with conditions relating to child health, education and general social welfare in order to receive the cash. We plan to evaluate conditional and unconditional cash transfer programmes in Manicaland, eastern Zimbabwe - a predominantly rural area with high HIV prevalence. We will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Ten existing study sites that represent four socio-economic strata - subsistence farming areas, roadside trading settlements, large-scale agricultural estates (tea estates and forestry estates) and small towns - have been identified as part of a separate, ongoing cohort study. Each site has been divided into 3 smaller, socio-economically homogenous clusters providing a total of 30 clusters that will form ten matched triplets. One site from each matched triplet will then be randomly assigned to one of three study arms - conditional cash transfer arm, unconditional cash transfer arm, and standard social services arm. Data on the primary endpoints will be collected using a rapid, baseline census of all households in the study clusters. This will take approximately 3 months to complete. The cash transfer programmes will commence, in the appropriate intervention arms, shortly after completion of baseline data collection. A similar follow-up census will take place two years after initiation of the intervention. The cash transfer interventions will be delivered by a local NGO called Diocese of Mutare Community Care Programme (DOMCCP), who work in partnership with Catholic Relief Services Zimbabwe. The baseline and follow-up censuses will be managed and conducted by the Biomedical Research and Training Institute Zimbabwe (BRTI) and Imperial College London. Data will also be collected from children in a sample of households from each of the study clusters as part of the ongoing Manicaland Cohort Study, which is a parallel study conducted by BRTI and Imperial College London. This data will also be used to evaluate the cash transfer programmes.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A household will be defined as vulnerable and thereby eligible for inclusion in the programme if there are children &lt;18 years resident in the household at baseline AND household is in the poorest quintile of households (20%) at baseline OR household contains one or more orphans at baseline OR the household head is under 18 years of age at baseline OR household contains a chronically ill member OR household contains a disabled member A household will be defined as individuals that live within the same homestead and eat from the same pot. Households already receiving cash transfers for orphans or vulnerable children (OVC) will not be eligible to enroll in the pilot programme. During the trial, households that do not qualify at baseline but whose conditions later change such that they become eligible to participate in the pilot will not be able to enroll.</criteria>
