	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well A6 works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. A6 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A6 in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the activity of A6, as measured by the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate and objective tumor response (complete or partial) rate, in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v3.0. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the duration of PFS and overall survival. II. To identify biomarkers of drug effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore whether genes identified as being up- or down-regulated by exposure of human PBMCs to A6 in vitro are also up- or down-regulated following treatment of patients with A6 in vivo. II. To explore whether there is an association between the expression of candidate A6 receptors in the tumor prior to treatment with A6 (as determined by IHC) and response and PFS. III. To explore whether there is an association between change in expression of candidate biomarkers in PBMCs between 0-24 hours following the first dose of A6 and response and PFS. IV. To explore whether there is an association between change in expression of candidate biomarkers in PBMCs over the course of the first one month cycle (course 1) and response and PFS. V. To determine whether there is an association between plasma A6 levels measured on days 2 (24 hours after the first dose and 4 hours after the second dose) and 8 (prior to injection of A6) of course 1 and levels of expression of candidate biomarkers in PBMCs collected on the same days. VI. To explore whether there is an association between plasma A6 levels measured on days 2 (24 hours after the first dose and 4 hours after the second dose) and 8 (prior to injection of A6) of course 1 and response and PFS. VII. To explore whether there is an association between candidate serum biomarkers and response and PFS over the course of A6 treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive A6 subcutaneously once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
