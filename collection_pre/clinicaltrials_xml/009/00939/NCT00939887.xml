	<brief_summary>This is a subject blind, investigator and sponsor open, randomized study consisting of 2 parts. Up to 15 healthy subjects will be included in the study. In the first part of the study the test retest reliability of the radiotracer [11C] PF 04767135 binding in man will be assessed. In the second part of this study, using [11C] PF 04767135, kappa opioid receptor occupancy (RO) will be assessed in up to three cohorts of subjects.</brief_summary>
