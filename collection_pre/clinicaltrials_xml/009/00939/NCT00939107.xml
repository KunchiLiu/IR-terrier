	<brief_summary>Introduction: The McKenzie method as well as spinal manipulation is commonly used for the treatment of low back pain throughout the western world. Recently, the need for studies testing the effect of treatment strategies to specific diagnostic subgroups of patients has been emphasized. The present study aims to compare the effectiveness of the McKenzie method and chiropractic manipulation, information, and advice for patients with clinical signs of persistent symptoms originating from a diskus in the low back. Methods: After clinical screening 350 patients with or without leg pain who presented with centralization of symptoms or signs of disc herniation were randomized to the McKenzie group or the manipulation group. The outcome measures, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, 11 point numerical pain scale, 6 point global perceived change scale, and quality of life (Short Form-36) were assessed at baseline, at end of treatment, and at 2 and 12 months follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 1998, Cherkin et al. published a study showing no difference between outcomes following the McKenzie method, chiropractic manipulation, or the provision of an educational booklet for the treatment of patients with acute non-specific low back pain. Recently, the need for studies testing the effect of treatment strategies to specific diagnostic subgroups of patients has been emphasized. The present study aims to compare the effectiveness of the McKenzie method and chiropractic manipulation, information, and advice for patients with clinical signs of disc-related symptoms for duration of more than 6 Weeks.</detailed_description>
