History of application of tattoo(s) within the past 30 days. 8. History of body piercing(s) within the past 30 days. 9. Females who are pregnant or lactating. 10. History of hypersensitivity to topiramate or any anticonvulsant medication. Conditions upon screening which might contraindicate or require that caution be used in the administration of topiramate, including: 1.
