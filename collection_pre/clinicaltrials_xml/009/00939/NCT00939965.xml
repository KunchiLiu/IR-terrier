	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors plan better treatment for patients receiving isotretinoin. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of isotretinoin in treating young patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isotretinoin in Treating Young Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To investigate the feasibility of implementing individualized dosing of isotretinoin in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma after course 1 of treatment, based on isotretinoin pharmacokinetics and toxicity. - To minimize the large inter-patient variation in plasma concentrations of isotretinoin. - To ensure that patients are not exposed to potentially sub-optimal plasma concentrations of isotretinoin during long-term treatment, particularly for patients who are not able to swallow isotretinoin capsules. Secondary - To obtain preliminary data on the potential impact of isotretinoin therapeutic monitoring on clinical response and toxicity in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected at baseline and during courses 1-3 for pharmacokinetic studies and determination of each patient's individual therapeutic-dose level requirement. Genotyping to identify genes that metabolize enzymes is conducted via PCR. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
