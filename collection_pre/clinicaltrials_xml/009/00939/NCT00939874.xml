	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if low bone mineral density (a measurement of how thick and strong bones are) improves in adults with HIV infection who switch their HIV medication tenofovir to another HIV medication raltegravir. Hypothesis:That Bone Mineral Density (BMD) will improve in osteopenic or osteoporotic patients switching from ART including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (r/PI) to ART including RAL+r/PI.</brief_summary>
