	<brief_title>Laparoscopy Versus Laparotomy for Colorectal Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For all patients, colorectal endometriosis will be confirmed preoperatively by clinical examination, transvaginal sonography, rectal endoscopic sonography and magnetic resonance imaging.Among patients with an indication of surgery, the intensity of dyschesia and other gynecological or digestive disorders will be evaluated pre-operatively using a visual analogue scale. Quality of life will be assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The allocation of the surgical route will be conducted by lottery the day before surgery. Patients will be reviewed postoperatively at 1 month and a new assessment of symptoms will be made at 6 months. The duration of the study will be 7 months for the patient and 24 months in total.If considering the two surgical routes as equivalent, with a delta score (after-before surgery) = ±2, standard deviation = 1.55, risk α=2.5%, risk β=10%, and taking into account that prevalence of dyschesia in the study population is 63%, 52 patients will be included.</detailed_description>
