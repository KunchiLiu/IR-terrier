	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Crizotinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of crizotinib and to see how well it works in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or anaplastic large cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crizotinib in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors or Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of crizotinib administered orally twice daily to children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). - To define and describe the toxicities of this drug when administered on this schedule. - To characterize the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. Secondary - To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of this drug within the confines of a phase I study. - To obtain initial phase II data on the antitumor activity of this drug in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma or ALCL. - To preliminarily examine the relationship between response to treatment and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene status (e.g., the presence of a mutation, duplication, amplification, and/or translocation) in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma or ALCL. - To preliminarily examine the relationship between minimal residual disease status and clinical response to treatment in children with ALCL. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive oral crizotinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Plasma and whole blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic analysis. Tumor tissue (from patients with neuroblastoma) and bone marrow and/or peripheral blood (from patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma) samples are collected for further correlative laboratory studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
