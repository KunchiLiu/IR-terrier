	<criteria>Planned cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with the implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) into the lens capsule. History of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. History of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), mild, moderate, or severe, in the study eye as defined by the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale. Able to understand and sign an informed consent approved by an IRB/IEC. Central subfield macular thickness less than or equal to 320 Î¼m in the study eye prior to cataract surgery. Absence of clinically significant macular edema in the study eye as detected by clinical exam. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Signs of vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membrane in the study eye as detected by the reading center or Investigator. Current or previous ocular disease other than diabetic retinopathy in the study eye that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have confounded the assessments of the macula, the retina, or central vision. Planned multiple procedures for the study eye during the cataract/IOL implantation surgery (eg, trabeculoplasty, corneal transplant). Corneal transplant in study eye. Baseline cumulative corneal fluorescein staining score (ie, sum of scores for all 5 corneal regions) for the study eye greater than or equal to 5, or baseline corneal fluorescein staining score in any single region for the study eye greater than or equal to 3. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
