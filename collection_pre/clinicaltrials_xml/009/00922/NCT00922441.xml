	<brief_title>A Therapeutic Exploratory Clinical Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy of Fimasartan (BR-A-657•K) During 24 Hours in Patients With Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study, Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that the Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study, Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed in high dose. A Randomized, Double-blind, Valsartan-referenced, Parallel Grouped, Therapeutic Exploratory Clinical Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy of Fimasartan(BR-A-657•K) during 24hoursby dose in Patients with Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension. Approximately 90 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in 5 centers nationwide. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups. Subjects will take test/control drug for 8 weeks of treatment period. If subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1 week of wash-out period. Group I : Fimasartan 60mg group. Group II : Fimasartan 120mg group Group III : Valsartan 80mg group</detailed_description>
