	<brief_title>Art Therapy for Caregivers of Young Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplant for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Test the effects of an art therapy intervention on emotional distress in caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for cancer. - Describe pro-social interactions of caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for cancer. - Describe the illness experience of caregivers and how it is impacted by the art therapy intervention. - Describe the caregivers' current health-related quality of life and life meaning prior to pediatric patients initiation of bone marrow transplantation for cancer. - Determine the effect size for calculating the sample needed for a randomized clinical trial. OUTLINE: Caregivers undergo art therapy over 60 minutes once a week for 6 weeks. Each session comprises developing trust through the expression of support, affirmation, and collaboration; creating intimacy through attunement; exploring affective states; integrative processing through the creation of an autobiographical narrative; and identifying opportunities for continued exploration and resources that support the client, should that exploration become necessary. Caregivers also complete a Meaning of Life Questionnaire and a Family Quality of Life Scale at baseline and at the end of week 6.</detailed_description>
