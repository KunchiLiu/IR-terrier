	<brief_title>Cesarean Postoperative Pain Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a significant difference between Cesarean patients' perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of three postoperative pain management methods identified by obstetrical patients. Participants will be introduced to study by anesthesia personnel in labor and delivery. The subject will be informed of the desire for their input on their perceived satisfaction with their chosen method for post-operative pain management and will be asked to participate in an anonymous survey by their second day after surgery. They will be informed that this is voluntary. Method of post-operative medication administration will be determined by attending physician to be either: epidural, IVPCA, or oral medication. Methods will be initiated in recovery room or the operative suite. Subjects will be identified on a postpartum admission log and a screening log will be created for study purposes. Informed Consents will be obtained. The screening log entries will be numbered corresponding to a numbered survey. The screening log will contain demographic and other patient identifiers including age, ethnicity, parity, presence of labor prior to cesarean, admission status of baby, cost associated with method and presence of rescue drugs and costs of rescue drugs and method services. Refusal information, exclusion criteria, and time/date of survey completion will also be recorded. This log will be maintained under lock and key.</detailed_description>
