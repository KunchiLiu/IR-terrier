	<brief_summary>This study is being done to provide an alternative to bone scanning with technetium-99m (99mTc) labelled diphosphonates, and to document the safety of {18F}-Sodium Fluoride (Na18F) as a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging radiopharmaceutical. Since the current availability of 99mTc was severely reduced because of the Chalk River shut down, alternative approaches to done scanning are needed. PET imaging with Na18F is one alternative approach to providing this critical clinical service.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Pilot Study of 18F-Sodium Fluoride (Na18F) Whole Body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans for Imaging Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18F-Sodium Fluoride (Na18F) PET imaging is a nuclear medicine procedure, and its principal radiopharmaceutical, Na18F, has been used for scanning the skeleton for the spread of cancer for more that 30 years, but has not been approved by Health Canada because less expensive alternate drugs have been available (99mTc diphosphonates). Given the sudden and drastic change in the availability of 99mTc, an acceptable alternative for 99mTc-diphosphonates is needed as soon as possible.</detailed_description>
