	<criteria>Male patients age 20 years or older Histological or cytological confirmation of NSCLC of adeno histology. If sputum is the only available sample, a second positive test is necessary for cytological confirmation Locally advanced or metastatic on or after firstline chemotherapy. Imaging evidence of disease progression can be either chest X ray, CT or MRI assessment on measurable lesions. If no measurable lesion is available, evaluable lesions are acceptable</criteria>
