	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan in Hypertension Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that the Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed in high dose. A Randomized, Double-blind, Losartan-controlled, Parallel Group Comparison Dose Titration Clinical Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan (BR-A-657•K) 60mg~120mg in Patients with Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension. Approximately 480 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in 24 centers nationwide. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the following 2 groups. Subjects will take test/control drug for 12 weeks of treatment period. And Extensin study have 12 weeks in treatment period. If subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1 week of wash-out period. If the hypertension is not controlled well, there is a possibility of dose titration. Group I : Fimasartan group. Group II : Losartan group</detailed_description>
