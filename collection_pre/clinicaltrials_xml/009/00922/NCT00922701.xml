	<brief_summary>The development of glucose-sparing strategies able to provide an efficacious ultrafiltration profile represents one of the modern goals of peritoneal dialysis therapy. The study hypothesis is to evaluate the possibility to formulate peritoneal dialysis solutions containing L-carnitine as an osmotic agent to partially replace glucose.</brief_summary>
