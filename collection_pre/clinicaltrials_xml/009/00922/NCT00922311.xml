	<brief_summary>Study objective: To investigate the potential anti-proteinuric efficacy of aliskiren, a novel direct renin inhibitor (DRI), in addition to angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) patients at risk of developing progressive renal failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aliskiren for Proteinuric IgAN Despite Angiotensin Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label pilot study in which IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria despite maximum dose of ARB treatment will be assigned to receive Aliskiren. There is the optional addition of other anti-hypertensive agents to achieve an optimal target blood pressure of &lt;130/80 mmHg.</detailed_description>
