	<brief_summary>16-week, open-label, multi-center pilot study. Insulin pump naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes who are not achieving glycemic targets (screening A1C ≥ 7.0%) on an established regimen of either: 1) ≥ 2 OAs (Cohort A), 2) basal insulin ± OAs (Cohort B), or 3) basal-bolus insulin ± OAs (Cohort C) will initiate basal-bolus therapy with an insulin pump using a rapid-acting insulin analog.</brief_summary>
