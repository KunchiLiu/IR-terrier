	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well image-guided radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy works and compares it to external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with localized spine metastasis.

	<brief_title>Image-Guided Radiosurgery or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Localized Spine Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility of successfully delivering image-guided radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with spine metastases in a cooperative group setting. (Phase II) (completed as of 8-30-11) - Determine whether image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT (single dose of 16 Gy) improves pain control (as measured by the 11-point Numerical Rating Pain Scale [NRPS]) compared to conventional external beam radiotherapy (single dose of 8 Gy). (Phase III) Secondary - Determine whether image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT improves the rapidity of pain response and increases the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) compared to conventional external beam radiotherapy, as measured by the NRPS. (Phase III) - Compare adverse events associated with these treatment regimens, as measured by NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria. (Phase III) - Evaluate the long-term effects (24 months) of image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT on the vertebral bone (e.g., compression fracture) and the spinal cord, as measured by MRI. (Phase III) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase II study (completed as of 8-30-11) followed by a randomized phase III study. Patients enrolled in the phase III portion are stratified according to the number of spine metastases to be treated (1 vs 2-3) and the type of tumor (radioresistant [including soft tissue sarcomas, melanomas, and renal cell carcinomas] vs other). - Phase II: Patients undergo 1 high-dose image-guided radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment over 60 minutes. (completed as of 8-30-11) - Phase III: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo 1 high-dose image-guided radiosurgery or SBRT treatment over 60 minutes. - Arm II: Patients undergo 1 standard-dose external beam radiotherapy treatment over 5 minutes. Patients undergo MRI of the treated spine at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months*. Patients enrolled in the phase III portion also complete the Numerical Rating Pain Scale at baseline, at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after randomization, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. NOTE: *Patients enrolled in the phase II portion undergo MRI at baseline and at 3 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of localized spine metastasis at the C1 to L5 levels by a screening imaging study (bone scan, PET, CT, or MRI), meeting any of the following criteria: Solitary spine metastasis Two contiguous spine levels involved No more than 3 separate sites (e.g., C5, T56, and T12) involved No more than 2 contiguous vertebral bodies involved at each separate site Other visceral metastasis, and radioresistant tumors (including soft tissue sarcomas, melanomas, and renal cell carcinomas) are eligible No myeloma or lymphoma Epidural compression allowed provided there is ≥ 3 mm gap between the spinal cord and edge of epidural lesion Paraspinal mass allowed provided it is ≤ 5 cm in the greatest dimension and contiguous with spine metastasis Has undergone MRI of the involved spine within the past 4 weeks to determine the extent of spine involvement No spine metastasis that is not planned to be treated per protocol No rapid neurologic decline Mild to moderate neurological signs, including radiculopathy, dermatomal sensory change, and muscle strength of involved extremity 4/5 (lower extremity for ambulation or upper extremity for raising arms and/or arm function), allowed No spine instability due to compression fracture, frank spinal cord compression or displacement, or epidural compression within 3 mm of the spinal cord No more than 50% loss of vertebral body height No bony retropulsion causing neurologic abnormality PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Zubrod performance status 02 Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Must be ambulatory No medical contraindications to an MRI of the spine No allergy to contrast dye used in MRI or CT scans The patient must have a score on the Numerical Rating Pain Scale of ≥ 5 within 1 week prior to registration for at least one of the planned sites for spine radiosurgery Documentation of the patient's initial pain score is required Patients taking medication for pain at the time of registration are eligible PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Concurrent pain medication allowed No prior radiotherapy to the index spine No chemotherapy for ≥ 24 hours before, during, and for ≥ 24 hours after completion of radiosurgery</criteria>
