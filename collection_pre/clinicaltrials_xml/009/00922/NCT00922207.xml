	<brief_summary>This 3 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of PEGASYS alone, or in combination with Adefovir or Entecavir in patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. Patients will be randomized to receive 1)PEGASYS 180 micrograms sc weekly for 48 weeks + placebo from weeks -4 to 2;2)PEGASYS 180 micrograms sc weekly for 48 weeks + Adefovir from weeks -4 to 2; or 3)PEGASYS 180 micrograms sc weekly for 48 weeks + Entecavir from weeks -4 to 2. Treatment will be followed by 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up.The anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
