	<brief_summary>The primary objective for the Phase I portion of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and for the Phase II portion of the study is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives are response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Dasatinib Plus Ixabepilone in 2nd or 3rd Line Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Phase I portion of the study, patients will receive study treatment according to the assigned dose level. Ixabepilone will be administered over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Dasatinib will be administered continuously starting on Day 1, Cycle 1 once daily (QD). Three patients will be enrolled at dose level 0 and observed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for 1 course of treatment. Dose escalation or reduction will depend on the number of patients experiencing DLT as follows: - If 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the next higher dose level. - If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level. - If 2 of 3 or 3 of 3 patients experience a DLT, then 3 patients will be enrolled at the next lower dose unless 6 patients have already been treated at that dose. - If ≥2 of 6 patients experience a DLT at that dose level, then the MTD is considered to have been exceeded. At that point, 3 patients are treated at the next lower dose. - If no more than 1 of the 6 patients experiences a DLT, then the dose level will be escalated 1 level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experience DLT, and above which ≥2 of 6 patients experience DLT. In the Phase II portion of the study, dasatinib and ixabepilone will be administered at the MTD determined during Phase I. Dasatinib will be started on Day 1, Cycle 1 and will be administered continuously once daily. Ixabepilone will be administered over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be treated with both agents for up to 8 cycles, after which stable or responding patients are eligible for monotherapy with dasatinib at the investigator's discretion in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient must meet each of the following criteria to be considered eligible for inclusion in this study: 1. Patient has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent including form according to institutional guidelines. 2. Patient has histologicallyproven breast cancer. 3. Patient has locally recurrent or metastatic disease, measurable or non measurable by RECIST criteria. 4. Patient has HER2negative disease or disease that is refractory to HER2 directed therapy. 5. Patient is female or male ≥ 18 years of age. 6. Patient has(ECOG)performance status of ≤ 2. 7. Patient must have received at least 1 but no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients may have received neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. These prior regimens can not have included ixabepilone or dasatinib. A line of chemotherapy will be defined as one or more agents used continuously or discontinuously (i.e., allowing a break or chemo holiday) without the addition of a new agent. Hormonal therapy will not be considered a line of therapy. 8. Prior chemotherapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to study treatment start (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin), and the patient must have recovered from all associated toxicities (except for alopecia and neuropathy grade 1 according to CTCAE, v3.0 classification). 9. Radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, and hormonal/endocrine therapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment start. Any major surgery must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to study treatment start. 10. Patient has adequate organ, metabolic and bone marrow function as follows: 1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 × institutional ULN 2. AST, ALT ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN 3. Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate ≥ institutional LLN. (Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to dasatinib administration.) 4. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × institutional ULN 5. Hematologic function: ANC ≥ 1500/mm3. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3. Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL 6. PT and PTT &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN 11. Ability to take oral medication (dasatinib must be swallowed whole). 12. Concomitant medications: 1. Patient agrees to discontinue St John's Wort at least 5 days prior to starting dasatinib therapy and while receiving dasatinib therapy. 2. Patient agrees that IV bisphosphonates will be withheld for the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia. 3. The use of CYP3A4 inducers, inhibitors, and substrates; medications that prolong QT interval; antacids; H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors; and medications that inhibit platelet function and anticoagulation should be avoided during dasatinib therapy. These are restricted therapies that are permitted with caution when medically indicated. 13. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the start of study treatment. 14. Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use and utilize an adequate method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study treatment is stopped. A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be considered not eligible for inclusion in this study: 1. Patient has had prior treatment with ixabepilone, dasatinib, or both. 2. Patient has had more than 2 prior lines of chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. A line of chemotherapy will be defined as one or more agents used continuously or discontinuously (i.e., allowing a break or chemo holiday) without the addition of a new agent. Hormonal therapy will not be considered a line of therapy. 3. Patient has received a cumulative dose of &gt; 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or &gt; 600 mg/m2 of epirubicin. 4.
