	<brief_title>Comparing the Effects of Conivaptan and Diuretics on Plasma Neurohormones and Renal Blood Flow in Patients With Chronic Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To define the hemodynamic, neurohormonal and renal responses to intravenous conivaptan in patients with chronic stable heart failure (HF), and compare these responses to those after intravenous furosemide. 2. To define the hemodynamic, neurohormonal and renal responses to the combination of the two drugs (conivaptan and furosemide).</detailed_description>
