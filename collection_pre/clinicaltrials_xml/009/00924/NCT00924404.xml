	<criteria>We now have two arms to this study. Group I: Immunocompetent subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis 56 Adult subjects (18 or older) presenting to the ENT(ears, nose, throat) clinics who meet the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Definition of CRS: Presence of at least 2 of the following 4 signs/symptoms for 12 weeks or longer despite medical management: Anterior and/or posterior mucopurulent drainage Nasal obstruction Facial pain, pressure, and/or fullness Decreased sense of smell In addition, objective evidence of sinus mucosal disease must be demonstrated on sinus CT imaging or direct endoscopic examination. Cystic fibrosis Fungal sinusitis Immunocompromised status (use of long term oral steroids (&gt; 30 days), AIDS, active malignancy or chemotherapy) Known Ciliary disorders Sinonasal tumors Pregnancy Group 2: CRS with antibody deficiency 56 Adult subjects (18 or older) presenting to the Allergy clinic who meet the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Definition of CRS: Presence of at least 2 of the following 4 signs/symptoms for 12 weeks or longer despite medical management: Anterior and/or posterior mucopurulent drainage Nasal obstruction Facial pain, pressure, and/or fullness Decreased sense of smell In addition, objective evidence of sinus mucosal disease must be demonstrated on sinus CT imaging or direct endoscopic examination.
