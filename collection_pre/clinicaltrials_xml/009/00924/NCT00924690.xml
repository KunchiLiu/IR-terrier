	<brief_title>Colon Cancer Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this research is to develop and test potential intervention messages which can be used to help increase colon cancer prevention behaviors. Two sets of intervention messages will be developed: generic and behavioral. Using a randomized control design the investigators will evaluate the behavioral messages among women. This message testing protocol will help them determine if the messages are relevant, acceptable, comprehensible, memorable, and motivating for the target audience. The investigators' hypothesis is that the behavioral messages will receive more positive ratings than the generic messages. If so, they will be used to promote cancer screening and physical activity in future intervention studies.</detailed_description>
