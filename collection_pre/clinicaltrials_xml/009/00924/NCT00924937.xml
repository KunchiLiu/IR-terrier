	<brief_title>CORonary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil and Cardiovascular PREVention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trial involving 1002 patients with coronary disease that are undergoing one of two diets in a randomized design (two groups; Mediterranean Diet 502 patients, Low Fat 500 patients) for 7 years. The two diets are: a)Low fat diet: &lt;30% fat (12-14% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA); 6-8% polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ; &lt;10% SAT) and b) Mediterranean Diet: &gt;35% fat (22% MUFA; 6% PUFA ; &lt;10% SAT). Primary Objective: Combined apparition of hard cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, revascularization, ischemic stroke, documented peripheral artery disease or cardiovascular death) after a median follow-up of 7 years. Secondary Objectives: Those related in the Outcome Measures section of this webpage</detailed_description>
