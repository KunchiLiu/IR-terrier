	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new drug- sorafenib, which is to be administered at the same time as standard treatment, which includes hormonal therapy and external beam radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Sorafenib With Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy to Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leuprolide acetate (a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist) and Bicalutamide (an anti-androgen) are hormonal agents which are commonly used to reduce testosterone blood level for prostate cancer treatment. Intensity modulated external beam radiotherapy is a standard treatment for localized prostate cancer. Previous studies have shown that combining hormonal therapy and radiation is more effective than radiation alone. Unfortunately, significant percentages (50-75%) of patients still relapse. Sorafenib reduces the growth of cancer cells and has proven effective in the treatment of solid tumors including kidney and liver cancer. This drug is approved by the FDA for treatment kidney and liver cancer. The study investigators believe that adding sorafenib to standard treatment, comprising hormonal therapy and radiation, might be more effective then standard hormonal therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically confirmed intermediate or high risk prostate adenocarcinoma. Intermediate risk disease comprises T2b/c tumors, Gleason 7 histology, or PSA 1020. High risk tumors comprise T34, Gleason 8 or higher histology, or PSA greater than 20. Age &gt; 18 years. Life expectancy of greater than 5 years. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function. No pelvic lymph node metastases based on pelvic CT scan or MRI. No bone metastasis. A whole body bone scan is required to rule out metastatic disease. Any previous, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, or more than 4 weeks of androgen deprivation hormonal therapy for the treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sorafenib or other agents used in this study. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C. Patients receiving anticoagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will not be allowed to participate.</criteria>
