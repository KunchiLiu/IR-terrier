	<brief_summary>Background: The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with B cell lymphomas or leukemias that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-CD19 incorporated in the retrovirus. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-CD19 cells) cause tumors to shrink. Eligibility: - Adults age 18-68 with B cell lymphomas or leukemias expressing the CD19 molecule. Design: Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-CD19 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.} Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy and the anti-CD19 cells. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAR T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy for Patients With B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: - We have constructed a retroviral vector that encodes an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes the CD19 antigen. This chimeric receptor also contains the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta. The retroviral vector can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this CAR to T cells with high efficiency (&gt; 50%) without the need to perform any selection. - In co-cultures with CD19-expressing target cells, anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of IFN-y and IL-2. - We have developed a process for cryopreserving the cell product which may lead to the ability for this product to be manufactured at a central location and shipped to other institutions for treatment of a broader patient population OBJECTIVES: - Primary objectives - With the approval of amendment S, determine the safety and feasibility of the administration of cryopreserved anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes with a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen in patients with Bcell lymphomas. ELIGIBILITY: Patients of 18 years of age or older must: - have a CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy of any type - be a non-responder to, or recurred after one or more standard chemotherapy-containing regimens for their malignancy - currently require treatment due to progressive malignancy - deemed to be incurable by standard therapy Patients may not have: - a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation - CNS disease DESIGN: - PBMC obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5 X 109 cells) will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell proliferation. - Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 108 to 5 X 108 cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD19 CAR. - With the approval of amendment S, patients will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (NMA) for lymphocyte-depletion, followed by cryopreserved anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells. - Patients will be followed until disease progression - Patients who have responded to treatment and then progress may receive one retreatment</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patient must have a CD19expressing B cell malignancy. Patients with Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, Primary Mediastinal Bcell lymphoma, and Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma transformed from follicular lymphoma must have measurable disease after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens one of which must have contained doxorubicin and rituximab. 2. Confirmation of diagnosis of B cell malignancy and positivity for CD19 confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology of the NCI. The choice of whether to use flow Cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily available tissue sample in each patient. Immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies, flow Cytometry will be used for peripheral blood, fine needle aspirates and bone marrow samples. 3. Patients must have indications for treatment for their B cell malignancy at the time of enrollment on this trial. 4. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 70. 5. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney. 6. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document. 7. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1. 8. Life expectancy of greater than three months. 9. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four months after treatment. 10. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus. 11. Serology: 1. Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.). 2. Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of antigen by RTPCR and be HCV RNA negative. 12. Hematology: 1. Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3) without the support of filgrastim. 2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/mm(3). 3. Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl. 4.
