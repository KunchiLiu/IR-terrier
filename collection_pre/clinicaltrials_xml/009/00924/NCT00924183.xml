	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to compare a new symptoms rating questionnaire, called the Vancouver Semi-Structured Interview for Depression (V-SID), to the traditionally used questionnaires.

	<brief_title>Measuring Response to Depression Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is sometimes associated with difficulties in thinking skills. Recent evidence suggests that in those people who have thinking difficulties, effective treatment and improvement of depression can also result in improved thinking skills. Therefore, a test of thinking skills is included in this study. This study will also evaluate three other potential indicators of treatment response: cortisol, cytokines, and grip strength.</detailed_description>
