	<brief_summary>This study will be a small randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to improve physical function and reverse muscle atrophy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The investigators will also determine the mechanism by which NMES affects muscle hypertrophy and physical function. The proposed study will be the first step in demonstrating that NMES training is an effective alternative to highly intense volitional exercises (VE) in individuals with RA. After baseline testing, 60 individuals with RA will be randomly assigned to a 16-week NMES program or highly intense VE program. Both programs will be applied based on the best current clinical evidence. Subjects will be re-assessed after intervention. Groups will be compared for differences in performance-based and self-reported lower extremity function, muscle volume, muscle strength, proportion and area of type I and II muscle fibers, fat content, and muscle oxidative capacity from pre- to post-intervention. Changes in physical function, muscle volume, and muscle strength will be correlated with proportion and area of type I and II muscle fibers, fat content, and markers of muscle oxidative capacity.</brief_summary>
