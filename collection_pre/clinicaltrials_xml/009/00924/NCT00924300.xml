	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this protocol is to test the feasibility and utility of obtaining magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in healthy children and also in children who have a psychiatric or developmental disorder. Secondary objectives are to examine and compare typical and atypical motor, sensory, and cognitive functioning as recorded by MEG, and to identify subpopulation groups for which MEG may be optimal in order to establish feasibility of future hypothesis-driven MEG research.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Test the Usefulness of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Imaging of Cognition in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy children and those who have a psychiatric or developmental disorder will undergo MEG recording to evaluate whether such children are candidate MEG subjects. Essentially, this feasibility study will examine whether children can remain still enough, complete simple tasks, and produce neurophysiologically consistent responses that would warrant full size studies.</detailed_description>
