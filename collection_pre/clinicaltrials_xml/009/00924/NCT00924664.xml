Female patients of child bearing potential: must not be pregnant or lactating, and must be abstinent or use adequate contraception (2 forms of birth control, one of which must be a barrier method), and must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening (within 30 days prior to Baseline) and a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline prior to initial dosing Male patients must agree that they and their female spouses / partners will use adequate contraception (2 forms of birth control, one of which must be barrier method) or be of non childbearing potential. Females of child bearing potential and males must be willing to use approved methods of contraception from commencement of screening procedures until 16 weeks after the last dose of IV study medication. Patient must be able to comply with lifestyle guidelines, scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures Patient has been treated in a parent tanezumab double blind CLBP study Patient has completed the Preferred Rollover Time Point visit of the double blind CLBP parent study or has been withdrawn for lack of efficacy. At least eight weeks but no more than 12 weeks have elapsed since the last study medication infusion in the parent study. Patients are permitted to enter the extension study up to 12 weeks after their last dose of study medication in their parent study (or 4 weeks after the End of Treatment visit) Failed screening in a parent tanezumab double blind CLBP study Withdrawn from a parent tanezumab double blind CLBP study for an adverse event Pregnant women, lactating mothers, women suspected of being pregnant, and women who wish to become pregnant during the course of clinical study Use of any investigational medication within 30 days prior to Baseline (3 months for any investigational biological other than tanezumab) or plans to receive an investigational medication other than the study medication during the course of this study Patients who exited the parent double blind CLBP study because of lack of compliance, protocol violation (including not meeting entrance criteria), no longer willing to participate (for reasons other than lack of efficacy), or were lost to follow up in the parent double blind study Patients who were randomized into the parent study in violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria but who were not withdrawn from the parent study; Any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the patient at increased safety risk or otherwise make the patient unsuitable for this study</criteria>
