	<brief_summary>To measure and compare pain associated with venipuncture and peripheral intravenous catheter insertion among pediatric emergency department patients randomized to treatment with one of three different pain-reduction strategies: J-Tip速 jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine, J-Tip速 jet injection of sterile saline, or application of 4% lidocaine topical cream. The investigators hypothesize that J-Tip速 jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine will provide superior local anesthesia compared to saline or lidocaine cream.</brief_summary>
