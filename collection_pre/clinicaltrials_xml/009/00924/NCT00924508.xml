	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether occlusion of triamcinolone 0.1% cream (TAC) with hydrogel patch improves its efficacy in treating eczema. A secondary objective is to determine whether eczema improves under occlusion with hydrogel patch alone, without TAC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydrogel Patch for the Treatment of Eczema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a 6-week, open label, bilaterally-controlled single center study involving 30 subjects age 13 and older with eczema. The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether occlusion of triamcinolone 0.1% cream (TAC) used to treat eczema with hydrogel patch improves its efficacy. A secondary objective is to determine whether eczema improves under occlusion with hydrogel patch alone. All subjects will have 3 target lesions of similar severity followed throughout the study. Patients will apply hydrogel patch alone to the first lesion, TAC 0.1% cream to the second lesion, and TAC 0.1% cream occluded by hydrogel patch to the third lesion. All treatments are twice a day for a maximum of 4 weeks or until lesions are cleared. The modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score will be used to evaluate each lesion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject has signed the informed consent form and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form; 2. Male or female subject at least 12 years of age; subjects under 18 years of age will need parental or official guardian consent. 3. A diagnosis of eczema with at least three lesions no larger than 7 by 7 cm on either the trunk, arms, or legs that would serve as target lesions. The lesions must be wide enough apart so that there is no overlap of hydrogel patches. All three lesions must have at least 5 out of 12 points on the modified EASI scale. Each of the three lesions must have no greater than 1 point difference from each other on the modified EASI score. (If the subject can identify specific eczema lesions that are more pruritic, recalcitrant and/or tend to initiate the itchscratch cycle, then those lesions will be preferentially selected as the target lesions.) 4. Any additional diagnoses must, in the investigator's opinion, not preclude the subject from safely participating in this study or interfere with the evaluation of the subject's eczema; 5. Subject is able to completely discontinue the use of any medication or therapy (other than study medications) for relief of eczema in the target areas to be treated; 6. Subject is able to completely discontinue the use of any systemic medication or therapy (e.g. oral medications, phototherapy, herbal remedies, or acupuncture) for relief of eczema; 7. Subject must be reliable and mentally competent to complete study measurements; 8. Subject is able to understand and agrees to comply with study requirements, attend study visits, and comply with the restrictions during the study. 1. Subjects with exclusively hand, face, foot, and/or groin dermatitis 2. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the test medications; 3. Pigmentation, extensive scarring, or pigmented lesions in affected areas that would interfere with evaluation of efficacy parameters; 4. Clinically infected eczema at baseline. 5. Any evidence of atrophy in the areas selected for treatment with topical corticosteroid; 6. Subjects requiring any other medication (topical or systemic) that may affect the course of the disease during the study period (e.g. oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, sedating antihistamines). Inhaled steroids will be permitted. 7. Topical therapies (other than nonprescription emollients) on potential target lesions within one week of starting study treatment; 8. Systemic therapy, phototherapy, or a systemic investigational therapy for eczema within 30 days prior to study entry; 9. Subject is considered unreliable as to medication compliance or adherence to scheduled appointments as determined by the investigators.</criteria>
