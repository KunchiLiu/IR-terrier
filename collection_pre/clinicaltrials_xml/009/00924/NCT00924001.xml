	<brief_summary>Background: - This study will use cells called DMF5 to treat patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread beyond the primary tumor site). - The DMF5 cells were first obtained from a tumor of a patient with melanoma with HLA-A201 tissue type. The tumor cells were grown in the laboratory, and when the laboratory-grown cells were given back to the patient, the patient's tumors shrank dramatically. In laboratory tests, DMF5 cells were also shown to shrink mouse melanoma tumors. Objectives: -To determine whether preparatory chemotherapy followed by infusion of DMF5 cells is a safe and effective for shrinking melanoma tumors. Eligibility: -Patients with metastatic melanoma and tissue type HLA-A201 who are 18 years of age or older. Design: - Patients have a preparatory regimen of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by infusion of DMF5 cells and then high-dose interleukin. The chemotherapy, interleukin and cells are given intravenously (through a vein). - Patients have frequent blood tests to look for the side effects and response to treatment. - Patients may be asked to have a tumor biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor tissue) to examine the effects of treatment on the immune cells in the tumor. - Patients have a physical examination, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and laboratory tests 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then monthly to evaluate the tumor. - The first group of patients participates in the Phase I portion of the study, called the dose escalation phase. This phase will determine the highest safe dose of DMF5 cells. There will be three dose levels of DMF5 cells, with the first patients enrolled getting the smallest dose and then increasing the dose when the preceding level has been shown to be safe. - Patients in the Phase II portion of the study receive DMF5 cells at the highest dose found to be safe in Phase I, to test the effectiveness of the treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: In previous trials in the Surgery Branch, a 51 percent objective response rate has been observed in heavily pre-treated patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing adoptive cell transfer therapy utilizing a non-myeloablative preparative regimen followed by administration of autologous tumor-reactive lymphocytes and subsequent treatment with high-dose aldesleukin. However, in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing metastasectomy, recovery of adequate numbers of tumor specific T lymphocytes from surgical specimens is possible in approximately half of all patients, thus limiting the application of adoptive cell transfer therapy. Murine models performed in the Surgery Branch have demonstrated solid tumor regression in mice treated with allogeneic tumor specific T cells combined with a preinfusion lymphodepleting regimen. We have identified a tumor specific lymphocyte cell line (DMF5) used previously in an autologous adoptive cell transfer protocol that was associated with an objective clinical response in that patient. In subsequent preclinical testing of this lymphocyte population, we have demonstrated high specificity against HLA-A 0201 positive melanoma cell lines as well as the common shared melanocyte differentiation antigen MART-1:27-35. We have expanded this lymphocyte population to provide up to 30 individual allogeneic cell transfers to HLAA 0201 positive patients with metastatic melanoma. In this trial we want to test our hypothesis that objective tumor regression can be achieved with the DMF5 allogeneic T-cell product using a non-myeloablative regimen followed by cell transfer and high-dose aldesleukin. It should be emphasized that this protocol is designed to test whether highly melanoma reactive allogeneic lymphocytes can mediate cancer regression. The DMF5 cell line is a limited reagent only available for the treatment of up to 30 patients. However, if this treatment results in cancer regression, it will represent an important step in our development of an allogeneic T-cell receptor engineered universal effector cell line for the treatment of patients with cancer. Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the administration of the DMF5 allogeneic T-cell product in patients receiving the non- myeloablative conditioning regimen, and aldesleukin. To determine whether this allogeneic tumor-specific lymphocyte cell line, hereafter referred to as DMF5, infused in conjunction with the administration of high-dose aldesleukin may result in objective clinical tumor regression in eligible HLA-A 0201 positive patients with metastatic melanoma receiving a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen. To determine the in vivo survival of the infused cells following the non-myeloablative regimen, via analysis of the sequence of the variable region of the T cell receptor or flow cytometry (FACS). Eligibility: Patients with metastatic melanoma who are greater than or equal to 18 years of age, HLA-A 0201 positive, do not have suitable autologous tumor reactive TIL cells available, and are able to tolerate high-dose aldesleukin. Design: Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regiment consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day times 2 days intravenous (IV)) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day IV times 5 days). Patients will receive intravenous adoptive transfer of the tumor reactive lymphocyte cell line DMF5 (after its expansion in interleukin-2 and OKT3) followed by high-dose intravenous (IV) aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours for up to 15 doses). Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four to six weeks after treatment and then monthly for approximately 3 to 4 months or until off study criteria are met. The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design. The protocol will proceed in a phase 1 dose escalation design, with three cohorts. Should a single patient experience a dose limiting toxicity at a particular dose level, three more patients would be treated at that dose to confirm that no greater than 1/6 patients have a DLT prior to proceeding to the next higher level. If a level with 2 or more DLTs in 3-6 patients has been identified, three additional patients will be accrued at the next lowest dose, for a total of 6, in order to further characterize the safety of the maximum tolerated dose prior to starting the phase II portion. If a dose limiting toxicity occurs in the first cohort, that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If 2 DLTs are encountered in this cohort, the study will be terminated. Once the MTD has been determined, the study then would proceed to the phase II portion, and initially, 9 total patients will be administered the therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. The plan will utilize a Simon two-stage optimal phase II design. If 0 of the 9 patients experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 1 or more of the first 9 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 30 evaluable patients have been enrolled. This design has the ability to distinguish a 5% response rate (p0=0.05) from a 25% response rate (p1=0.25), with 10% probability of falsely "accepting" the DMF5 cell therapy approach (alpha=0.10), and 10% probability of incorrectly discarding this strategy as if it were unacceptably poor (beta=0.10). This design also has 63% probability of stopping early (at 9 patients) if the true response rate is 5%.</detailed_description>
