A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the control for the skin prick test or at least 7 mm larger than the control for the intradermal test; In order to enter the placebo leadin period, the subject must have a score of at least 6 on a 24hour reflective TNSS completed during Visit 2; Is in general good health as determined by screening evaluations and the judgment of the Investigator; If female of childbearing potential, is not pregnant (confirmed by negative urine pregnancy test), nonlactating, and will use reliable birth control measures throughout the study.

Evidence of any unstable or clinically significant, hematopoietic, malignant, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, or autoimmune disorder/condition/disease that in the opinion of the Investigator could place the subject at increased risk of complications, interfere with study participation, or confound any of the study objectives; Presence or history of ocular herpes simplex, cataracts, or glaucoma; Inability to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles; Respiratory tract infection within two weeks prior to screening; Infection requiring oral antibiotic treatment two weeks prior to screening; Significant pulmonary disease and/or active asthma requiring daily medication; Signs or symptoms of nasal polyps, deviated septum, or any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may result in erroneous study data; Known intolerance (hypersensitivity or serious adverse reaction) to corticosteroids; History within the last 5 years or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse; Current use of therapies or medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants and others. See Section 8.1, Prohibited Medications) that would affect assessment of the effectiveness of the study drugs; Unable to withhold any prohibited medication (see Section 8.1, Prohibited Medications); Use of any of the following prior to the start of the singleblind placebo leadin visit (Visit 2) within the time periods specified: Time prior to Visit 2 Intranasal or systemic corticosteroids 30 days Ocular corticosteroids 30 days Intranasal cromolyn 14 days Leukotriene inhibitors 14 days Loratadine10 days Intranasal or systemic antihistamines (including sleep and diet aids and cold preparations) 3 days Has received any investigational drug or participated in an investigational research study within 30 days of entering this study; Documented evidence of acute or significant chronic sinusitis, as determined by the investigator; Rhinitis medicamentosa; Planned travel outside the study area for a substantial portion of the study period.</criteria>
