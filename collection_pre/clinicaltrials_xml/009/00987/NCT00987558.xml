	<brief_title>Effect of Repeated Administration of Eslicarbazepine Acetate on the Pharmacokinetics of Simvastatin in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single centre, two-way crossover, randomised, open-label study in 24 healthy volunteers. The volunteers will receive an oral single-dose of simvastatin 80 mg on two occasions ─ once administered alone and once after treatment with an oral once-daily dose of 800 mg of ESL for 14 days ─, separated by a washout period of 3 weeks or more</detailed_description>
