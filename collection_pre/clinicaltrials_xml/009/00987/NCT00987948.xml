	<brief_summary>High levels of HIV infection within blood monocyte/macrophages (a type of white cells in the bloodstream) increases risk of dementia in HIV-infected individuals. Maraviroc (Selzentry) is a HIV medication that works by blocking the entry of HIV in cells including monocytes/macrophages that use a receptor called CCR5. The study hypothesis is that the addition of Maraviroc to a HIV antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected individuals with high levels of HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages will lead to a decrease in the levels of infected monocyte/macrophages and to decrease in brain inflammation as studied by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS, a form of MRI study).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection as documented by ELISA and confirmed by either Western blot, HIV1 culture, HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA by RTPCR or bDNA at any time prior to study entry. Receipt of ARV medication uninterrupted for &gt; 1 year leading up to the screening period with demonstrated HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml for a period of 1 year." Willingness for both males and females of childbearing potential to utilize 2 effective contraception methods (2 separate forms, one of which must be an effective barrier method), be nonheterosexually active or have a an exclusive vasectomized partner from screening throughout the duration of the study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study drugs. Age &gt;18 years. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent The following laboratory parameters documented within 30 days prior to study entry: Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 Absolute neutrophil count &gt;500 Platelet count &gt;40,000 AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;5 x ULN Creatinine &lt;1.5 x ULN Lipase &lt;2.0 x ULN Estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min. HIV DNA within peripheral blood mononuclear cells &gt; 100 copies/mL Not currently receiving Maraviroc as part of ARV regimen Past or present HIV opportunistic infection of the brain, learning disability, head injury with prolonged loss of consciousness or cognitive sequelae, or other nonHIV risk factor that may impact cognitive performance. Any factor that precludes MRI scan including presence of metal or exposure to metal work (e.g., metal grinder/worker) and claustrophobia History of seizure disorder History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, angioplasty or cardiac surgery Current malignancy or history of past malignancies excluding basal cell CA Any immunomodulator, HIV vaccine, or investigational therapy within 30 days of study entry. Any vaccination within 30 days of study entry. Requirement for acute therapy for other AIDSdefining illness or other serious medical illnesses (in the opinion of the site investigator) within 14 days prior to study entry. Other chronic illnesses including diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and endocrinopathies, except subjects on stable physiologic replacement therapy for low testosterone or thyroid levels Known hypersensitivity to Maraviroc Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to participate in the study Current active substance or alcohol dependence Pregnancy or breastfeeding, intent to become pregnant during the course of the study.</criteria>
