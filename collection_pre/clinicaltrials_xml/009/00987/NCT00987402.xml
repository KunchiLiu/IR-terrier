	<brief_summary>Surgical site infections (SSI) constitute a significant health-economic and clinical challenge. The investigators conducted a cluster-randomized, cross-over study to compare the efficacy of plain soap and water (PSW), used ubiquitously across sub-Saharan Africa for surgical hand preparation, to alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR), with SSI rates as the main outcome measure. A total of 3317 patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated surgery were included in the study and followed up for 30 days.</brief_summary>
