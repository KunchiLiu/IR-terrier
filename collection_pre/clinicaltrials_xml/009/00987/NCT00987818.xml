	<brief_summary>The adequacy of early empiric antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in determining the outcome in patients with severe sepsis. The duration of adequate antibiotic therapy in these patients however is less clear. Duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with sepsis in the ICU based on inflammatory markers has not been extensively studied. Procalcitonin (PCT) is an acute phase protein that has prognostic value in critically ill patients and can be used to monitor disease activity in sepsis and systemic inflammation. This study will examine the effect of PCT guided antibiotic therapy compared with conventional antibiotic therapy on treatment duration in patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU.</brief_summary>
