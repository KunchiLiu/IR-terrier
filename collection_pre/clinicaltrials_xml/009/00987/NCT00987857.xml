	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Screening tests may help doctors find cancer cells early and plan better treatment. It is not yet known whether endoscopy every 2 years is more effective than endoscopy only as needed in finding esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett esophagus. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying endoscopy every 2 years to see how well it works compared with endoscopy only as needed in monitoring patients with Barrett esophagus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopy Every 2 Years or Only as Needed in Monitoring Patients With Barrett Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish whether endoscopic surveillance every 2 years or endoscopy at need only is superior in terms of overall survival and, if neither is superior, whether endoscopy at need only is non-inferior to surveillance every 2 years in patients with Barrett esophagus. Secondary - To estimate the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance every 2 years as compared to endoscopy at need only. - To establish whether there is a significant difference between endoscopic surveillance every 2 years or endoscopy at need only in terms of the incidence of esophageal cancer, gastric or esophageal cancer, or all cancers. - To establish whether there is a significant difference between endoscopic surveillance every 2 years or endoscopy at need only in terms of the time to diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. - To establish whether there is a significant difference between endoscopic surveillance every 2 years or endoscopy at need only in terms of the stage of esophageal adenocarcinoma at diagnosis using TNM staging. - To establish whether there is a significant difference between endoscopic surveillance every 2 years or endoscopy at need only in terms of morbidity and mortality related to endoscopy, esophageal surgery, and other endoscopy-related interventions (e.g., ablation). - To establish whether there is a significant difference between endoscopic surveillance every 2 years or endoscopy at need only in terms of the frequency of endoscopy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age at diagnosis (&lt; 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), length of Barrett metaplasia segment including tongues (&lt; 2 cm vs ≥ 2 cm and ≤ 3 cm vs &gt; 3 cm and ≤ 8 cm vs &gt; 8 cm), and newly diagnosed disease (defined as the date of endoscopy confirming Barrett metaplasia was within the past 4 months) (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo surveillance endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies taken every 2 cm. Patients undergo endoscopy every 2 years for a total of 6 endoscopies over 10 years. - Arm II: Patients undergo endoscopy as needed over 10 years. All patients may undergo urgent endoscopy if they develop dysphagia, unexplained weight loss of &gt; 7 lb, iron-deficiency anemia, recurrent vomiting, or worsening upper gastrointestinal symptoms. All patients complete a questionnaire that includes a quality-of-life measure and questions about medication at baseline, every 2 years, and following key events (e.g., diagnosis of any cancer or high-grade dysplasia).</detailed_description>
