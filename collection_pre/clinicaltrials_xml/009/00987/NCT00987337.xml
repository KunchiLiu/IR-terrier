	<brief_summary>The primary objective for this study is to determine if the addition of filibuvir to a standard regimen of peginterferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) significantly increases the proportion of subjects who achieve a sustained viral response (SVR) compared to peginterferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) therapy alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age. HCV seropositive. HCV RNA &gt;10,000 IU/mL at screening. HCV Genotype 1. Subjects infected with a nongenotype 1 strain or mixed genotypes are not eligible. Treatment na√Øve (no prior treatment with IFN alfa +/ RBV regimens or investigational antiHCV agents). Liver biopsy within two years (24 months) of Screening with noncirrhotic fibrosis classification. For those subjects with liver biopsy outside of the time window or for those subjects with no history of liver biopsy, a biopsy must be performed prior to randomization. Ultrasound within 6 months of Screening for 1) those subjects with bridging fibrosis or 2) those subjects with AFP &gt;50 and &lt;100 ng/mL with no evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. For those subjects with an ultrasound conducted outside the 6month time window, an ultrasound must be performed prior to randomization. Coinfection with either HIV or HBV. Evidence of severe or decompensated liver disease. Subjects with liver disease unrelated to HCV infection. Preexisting medical condition that makes the subject unsuitable for treatment with pegIFN/RBV therapy per product labeling. Laboratory abnormality at Screening that makes the subject unsuitable for treatment with pegIFN/RBV therapy per product labeling. Abnormal ECG suggestive of clinically significant cardiac disease or QTc&gt;450msec. History of organ transplant. Contraindicated medications being taken by the subject at the time of randomization that must be continued during the study period, including potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic range and CYP3A4 inducers. Active alcohol or substance abuse sufficient, in the Investigator's judgment, to prevent adherence to study medication and/or follow up. Pregnant or nursing females. Males whose female partner is pregnant.</criteria>
