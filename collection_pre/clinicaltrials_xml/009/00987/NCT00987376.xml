	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer imaging using traditional anatomic modalities including CT, MR, and ultrasound is limited. Improvement in current imaging modalities or development of new ones should be a priority in prostate cancer research. Optimal treatment varies considerably for patients with different staging characterizations and new imaging methods that more accurately stage patients could lead to more appropriate treatment. The objective of this study is to obtain preliminary, comparative data on new, promising imaging methods for prostate cancer. PET/CT imaging using 11C-choline,11C-acetate, and Y86 or 18F-Adenosylcobalamin and MRI spectroscopy (MRS) of prostate cancer will be compared. Direct comparison of these imaging methods has never been done and Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins are uniquely able to conduct such a trial as an inter-SPORE collaboration.</brief_summary>
