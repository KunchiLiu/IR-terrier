	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized study is to determine which treatment option, either paclitaxel-eluting balloon, paclitaxel-eluting stent or plain balloon angioplasty is the most effective in the treatment of restenosis after implantation of "Limus"-eluting stents, (LES).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Paclitaxel-eluting Balloon, -Stent vs. Plain Angioplasty for Drug-eluting Stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of drug-eluting stents (DES) has led to a drastic reduction of restenosis rates compared to bare metal stents (BMS), but 5% to 10% of patients receiving DES are still in need of revascularization of the treated vessel. Two important families of drugs are used for stent coating: paclitaxel belonging to the taxane family, and the "limus"-family such as sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus, biolimus A9 and pimecrolimus. Data regarding the optimal treatment of in-DES-restenosis is very limited. Implanting a new DES for in-DES-restenosis has been reported to be associated with re-restenosis rates as high as 43%. Several recent well published studies have shown a substantial reduction of restenosis using paclitaxel-eluting balloons (PEB) for de-novo lesions and BMS-restenotic lesions. The objective of this randomized trial is to assess the hypothesis, that PEB are non-inferior to paclitaxel-eluting-stents (PES) for restenosis in "limus"-eluting-stents (LES), and both, PEB and PES, are superior to plain angioplasty in patients with restenosis after initial LES implantation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with ischemic symptoms or evidence of myocardial ischemia in the presence of ≥ 50% restenosis after prior implantation of LES in native coronary vessels. 2. Written, informed consent by the patient or her/his legallyauthorized representative for participation in the study. 3. In women with childbearing potential a negative pregnancy test is mandatory. 1. Age &lt; 18 years. 2. Cardiogenic shock. 3. Acute STelevation myocardial infarction within 48 hours from symptom onset. 4. Target lesion located in the left main trunk or bypass graft. 5.
