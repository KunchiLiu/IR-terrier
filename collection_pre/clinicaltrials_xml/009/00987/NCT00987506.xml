	<criteria>All patients enrolled in the study must : be at least 18; be covered by Social Security agree to be enrolled in the study (sign the informed consent after reading the information letter). In addition, the Xience V endoprothesis implantation must be performed following the LPPR indications here under : Treatment of coronary heart disease attributable to de novo lesions (reference vessel with a 2.5 to 3.5 mm) of native coronary arteries, solely in the following groups of patients : patients with diabetes ; lesions of small vessels (diameter &lt; 3 mm); long lesions (longer than 15 mm) ; stenosis of proximal anterior intraventricular septum . The use of the Xience V stent is limited to one per patient, except : in case of acute occlusive dissection where three stents, maximum, may be covered ; for the pluritroncular diabetic patient, in case a bypass is contraindicated : a stent per artery, with a limit of three per patient, may be covered. Pregnant women Patients with: a non cardiac vital prognosis endangered during the year following the implantation ; less than 72 hours myocardial infarction ; lower left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 % ; an allergy to the platelets antiaggregant treatment, to heparin, chrome cobalt alloy, or to the angiography contrast medium ; a stenosis of the unprotected common trunk; a lesion with calcifications that cannot be predilated; a thrombus that can be detected by angiography on the lesion to be treated ; an intrastent restenosis. Are also excluded : patients having had an angioplasty with implantation of an endoprothesis on the same vessel; patients having had an angioplasty with implantation of an endoprothesis during the 6 previous months ; Patients unable to keep a treatment associating aspirin and thiénopyridines for at least 6 months; Patients residing abroad or who cannot be monitored according to the modalities of the study ; Patients unable to give on their own free will their informed consent ; On the other hand, in absence of clinical validation, the other subgroups of at risk patients (notably bifurcation lesions and pluritroncular lesions) cannot be considered , taken alone, as indications for the use of Xience V.</criteria>
