	<brief_summary>The investigators have previously shown that depletion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) enhances the alloreactivity of T lymphocytes, as attested by an accelerated GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in mice. The investigators thus propose a clinical trial to test whether Treg-depleted donor lymphocytes infusion (dDLI) could induce an improved graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect in patients refractory to standard DLI (stdDLI) for treatment of relapse after HSCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amplifying Graft-Versus-Tumor Effect by Donor Regulatory T-Cell Depletion Before Donor Lymphocytes Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have previously shown that depletion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) enhances the alloreactivity of T lymphocytes, as attested by an accelerated GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in mice. We thus propose a clinical trial to test whether Treg-depleted donor lymphocytes infusion (dDLI) could induce an improved graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect in patients refractory to standard DLI (stdDLI) for treatment of relapse after HSCT. dDLI is administered after failure of 1 or several previous stdDLI of at least 107 CD3+ cells/kg, defined after a minimal follow-up of 2 months after the last injection. The absence of previous clinical manifestations of GVHD is required to be included. To prepare dDLI, CD25+ Treg are depleted from donor leukaphereses using anti-CD25 magnetic microbeads and a CliniMACS device (MYLTENYI). In order to evidence the potential effect of dDLI, the dDLI cell dose is adjusted to be below or equal to the maximal cell dose previously received in stdDLI. No comparison is planned in the analysis.</detailed_description>
