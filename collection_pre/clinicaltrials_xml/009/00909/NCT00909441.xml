	<brief_summary>Title of Study: Sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in biopsy proven node positive breast cancer. Objectives of the study: Primary objective 1. Evaluate the accuracy of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients presenting with positive nodal disease, proven by ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary objectives 1. Evaluate the technical success of sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 2. Evaluate the accuracy of clinical examination and ultrasound examination of the axilla in identifying the presence of residual disease in the axilla following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in biopsy proven node positive breast cancer patients. Number of patients: N = 300 Population: Patients with unresected breast cancer that are eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy that present with biopsy proven positive axillary nodes. Study duration: From February 2009 to February 2012 - 3 years</brief_summary>
