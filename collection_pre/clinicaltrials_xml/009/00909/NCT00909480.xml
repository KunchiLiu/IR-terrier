	<criteria>Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months Stable treatment with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) with or without one other OAD (sulphonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones or dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitors) for at least 3 months Subject is insulinnaive (shortterm insulin treatment of up to 14 days is allowed) HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) 7.09.0 % (both inclusive) by central laboratory analysis (one retest within one week is allowed) Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 35.0 kg/m^2 Any contraindication to insulin detemir or insulin glargine according to the local labelling Receipt of any investigational product within 4 weeks Anticipated change of dose of any systemic treatment with products, which in the Investigator's opinion could interfere with glucose metabolism (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) Clinically significant diseases which, in the Investigator's opinion may confound the results of the trial or pose additional risk in administering trial product Any other condition that the Investigator feels would interfere with trial participation or evaluation of results</criteria>
