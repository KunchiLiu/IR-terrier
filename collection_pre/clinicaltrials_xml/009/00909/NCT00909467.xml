	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative Disease represent conditions with increased risk for pulmonary hypertension. However, the exact prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in these conditions is not known. The effects of pulmonary hypertension on the clinical picture and the symptoms of patients in these conditions needs also further exploration. This exploratory study is designed to describe the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in the population with such hematologic diseases, and the stages of pulmonary hypertension as well its effect on exercise capacity at time of diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Recognition of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Myelodysplastic and Myeloproliferative Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For early recognition of pulmonary hypertension exercise doppler echocardiography will be used in all patients. Patients with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure at rest or during exercise (estimated by echocardiography), or with decreased exercise capacity (as a potential sign of pulmonary hypertension) are advised to undergo right heart catheterisation. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and six-minute walk distance measurement are performed to measure exercise capacity. The described work-up of patients allows precise and objective hemodynamic and clinical evaluation.</detailed_description>
