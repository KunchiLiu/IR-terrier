	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: I. To measure MP optical density (MPOD) spatial profiles in two groups (experimental and placebo) of 50 subjects each (N = 100), during an L + Z supplementation period of 12 months. II. To test the hypothesis that increases in MP (via 12 mg daily L + Z supplementation) will result in significantly improved visual performance under disability glare conditions. III. To test the hypothesis that increases in MP (via 12 mg daily L + Z supplementation) will result in significantly reduced photostress recovery times. IV. To test the hypothesis that increases in MP (via 12 mg daily L + Z supplementation) will result in improved contrast enhancement.</brief_summary>

Corrected visual acuity (ETDRS): better than 20/60 BMI &lt;20 or &gt;30 Age &lt;20 or &gt;40 years Smokers Current or history of relevant diseases (such as AMD) Corrected visual acuity worse than 20/60 Inability to reliably perform MPOD measurements by HFP or any of the other ophthalmic tests of the study. Any condition likely to interfere with normal gastrointestinal absorption of xanthophylls. Current use of xanthophyll containing supplements Use of xanthophyll containing supplements in the past 6 months Participation in any other study during last 1 month. Blood donation during the last 3 months. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to xanthophylls. Regular intake of medications or supplements, which the principal investigator deems likely to confound the study outcomes. Suspected lack of compliance with any requirements of the study. Childbearing potential and unwillingness to refrain from acceptable anticonceptive measures (not including abstinence). Current pregnancy or breast feeding Any relevant abnormalities in the routine laboratory tests</criteria>
