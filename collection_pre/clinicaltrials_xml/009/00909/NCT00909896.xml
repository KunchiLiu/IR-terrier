	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy of robotic approach for staging of endometrial cancer as compared to an equivalent abdominal approach. The primary objective is to measure and compare postoperative pain at rest at several time points between two groups of patients undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy approach for staging of endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Post Operative Pain in Endometrial Cancer Robotic Versus Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to measure and compare postoperative pain at rest at several time points (24 +/-4hours, 48 +/-4hours, and 72 +/-4hours) between the two groups of patients undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy approach for staging of endometrial cancer. Post operative Quality of Life will also be collected at several time points. The total amount of post operative opioid requirements during the first 24hours between patients undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy approach surgery. The survival status every four months for the first two years will be monitored, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. The primary endpoint is the mean difference in post operative pain VAS scores reported by subjects at rest at the following time points: 24+/-4, 48+/-4, and 72+/-4 hours between both groups after surgery has been completed.</detailed_description>
