	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating women with early stage breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the freedom from local and regional failure in women with early stage breast cancer treated with accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy. - To determine the acute and late toxicity of accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy using previously published toxicity scales. Secondary - To measure cosmesis using the Harvard cosmesis scale in patients who have undergone lumpectomy. - To identify co-variates responsible for poor cosmetic outcome in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients who have undergone lumpectomy undergo either intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost and hypofractionated, accelerated whole breast irradiation (AWBI) OR 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT)/intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) boost and AWBI. Patients who have undergone mastectomy undergo hypofractionated, accelerated chest wall irradiation. - Intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost and AWBI (post-lumpectomy): Patients undergo intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost twice daily for 2 days (total of 4 fractions). Beginning 5-21 days after completion of brachytherapy, patients undergo AWBI once daily 5 days a week for approximately 2 weeks (total of 11 fractions). - 3D-CRT/IMRT boost and AWBI (post-lumpectomy): Patients undergo 3D-CRT/IMRT boost twice daily for 2 days (total of 4 fractions). Patients also undergo AWBI as above before or after boost radiotherapy. - Accelerated chest wall irradiation (post-mastectomy): Patients undergo accelerated chest wall irradiation once daily 5 days a week for approximately 2 weeks (total of 11 fractions). Patients who have undergone lumpectomy undergo frontal digital photography of the breasts at baseline, immediately before the initiation of radiotherapy, and then annually for 3 years after completion of radiotherapy. These patients also complete the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale at baseline and at 3 years after completion of radiotherapy. Physicians complete the Harvard Cosmesis scale at baseline and at 1 and 3 years after completion of radiotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 1, 4, and 8 and then every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
