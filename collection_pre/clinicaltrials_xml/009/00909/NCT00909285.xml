	<brief_summary>Current diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made by clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments. Routine structural neuroimaging evaluation is based on nonspecific features, such as atrophy, which is a late feature in the progression of the disease. Therefore, developing new approaches for early and specific recognition of Alzheimer disease at the prodromal stages is of crucial importance. In the present study the investigators would like to examine if combined treatment with TMS and cognitive training (CoTra) for several weeks can produce a sustained improvement in cognitive and behavioral symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A number of in vivo neuroimaging techniques, which can be used to reliably and noninvasively assess aspects of neuroanatomy, chemistry, physiology, and pathology, hold promise.</brief_summary>
