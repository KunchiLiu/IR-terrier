	<brief_summary>In this study we want to investigate if combination therapy with rituximab (R) + dexamethasone (DXM) is superior to monotherapy with DXM in patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Before treatment molecular studies - gene expression profiling - are performed to characterize at the molecular level those patients responding adequately to the treatment as compared to those obtaining a minor or no responses. The hypothesis is that combination therapy is superior to monotherapy as defined above. Using gene expression studies up-front the hypothesis is that this method may be able to predict the response to treatment.</brief_summary>
