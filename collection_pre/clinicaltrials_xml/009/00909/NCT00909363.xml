	<brief_title>Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome is an X-linked disease characterized by immunodeficiency, eczema and thrombocytopenia; a milder form of the disease known as X-Linked thrombocytopenia also exists. The thrombocytopenia in both WAS and XLT is characterized by: severe thrombocytopenia with platelet counts frequently less than 10-30,000/ul; small platelets which may be dysfunctional; and, as a result, a high rate of serious bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage. Because eltrombopag has been shown to be remarkably efficacious in substantially increasing platelet counts in a high percentage of ITP patients, this study seeks to effectively treat patients who exhibit similar pathologies, as well as evaluate the state of platelets in patients with WAS and relate it to clinical bleeding. It also aims to demonstrate whether eltrombopag administered daily will enhance stem cell function, increase platelet production and platelet count, and reduce bleeding in patients with WAS.</detailed_description>
