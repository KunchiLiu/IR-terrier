	<brief_summary>Many pregnant women have an ultrasound done of their fetus in the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy. Some have a transvaginal sonography while others have a transabdominal one, depending on clinical parameters such as weight, scars etc. In the transvaginal ultrasound there is some amount of version of the fetus done by the examiner to maintain a better aspect of the fetus, while this is not done in a transabdominal sonography. The objective of this trail is to determine whether having a transvaginal ultrasound as opposed to a transabdominal one has an association to adverse perinatal outcomes.</brief_summary>
