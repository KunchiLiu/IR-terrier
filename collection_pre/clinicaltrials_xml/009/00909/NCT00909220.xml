	<brief_title>Using Affective Differences to Predict Response to Behavioral Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder is a serious form of depression that may be treated with psychotherapy. However, up to 40% of adults with depression do not show reduced symptoms when treated with cognitive therapy or behavioral activation (BA), two common forms of psychotherapy. Certain indicators are generally linked with a successful outcome of psychotherapy—demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidity, and treatment adherence—but no factors reliably predict outcomes of psychotherapy in individuals. This study will test whether two characteristics related to the way people process emotions, affective asymmetry and affective reactivity, can predict whether people with depression will improve with BA therapy. Both depressed and healthy participants will be recruited for this study. Participation in this study will last 31 weeks. All participants will complete baseline assessments at Weeks 1 and 2. Depressed participants will then begin receiving 16 weekly sessions of BA therapy. All participants will be assessed again after 8, 16, 17, and 28 weeks. Assessments will include the following: a urine toxicology screening; interviews on mental and physical health, family and childhood experiences, and current mood and functioning; computer tasks; recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) activity; recordings of reaction to a startle probe; recordings of electromyography (EMG) activity; recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA); and measurement of blood pressure.</detailed_description>
