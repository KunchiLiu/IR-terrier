	<brief_summary>This study is a multicentre, open label, non-randomized phase I study. The main objectives of the study are to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug at different dose levels in the patients with Advanced Breast Cancer. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and safety of Paclitaxel Nanoparticle will also be simultaneously assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female patients with histopathologically /cytologically confirmed advanced breast cancer, refractory / recurrent* to previous anthracycline treatment as adjuvant or first line therapy for metastasis. Patients with ER/PR ve or ER/PR receptor status unknown (defined as no histopathological evidence for confirmation of ER/PR status) Patients must be of 1865 years of age (inclusive of both) Patients with ECOG performance status between 0 2 Patients with at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST Patients with ER/PR positive status. Patients who demonstrate HER2 over expression will be excluded. Alternatively, the patients enrolled should have previously received trastuzumab. HER2 over expression should be demonstrated by IHC 3+, IHC 2+ or with FISH/CIS. Patients with known history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or any other taxane or compounds chemically / biologically related to paclitaxel or excipients. Patients requiring any concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy immunotherapy, therapy with biologicals or radiotherapy for the disease. (Patients requiring local radiotherapy for non target bone lesion will be included). Patients with known CNS lesions (brain metastasis or carcinomatous meningitis).</criteria>
