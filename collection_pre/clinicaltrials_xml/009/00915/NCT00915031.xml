	<brief_summary>Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLP) has gained widespread acceptance as a standard treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the enhanced visualization and precise dissection afforded by the robotic platform, two major comorbidities affect a significant number of men: incontinence and erectile function. Urinary continence and erectile function It is commonly believed that the most important factor affecting continence is preservation of the external urinary sphincter complex which lies just below the prostate. Trauma to the urethral tissue itself after it is transected from the prostate and damage to the autonomic nerves that control this sphincter may lead to sphincteric dysfunction. In addition, dissection of the bladder may lead to bladder irritability which also plays a role in incontinence. Surgical removal of the prostate also causes significant inflammatory damage to the pelvic floor which likely delays recovery of urinary continence. The same trauma issues apply to sexual function. One possible method to protect the nerves and other tissues from operative trauma may be the use of local hypothermia (cold-ischemia) to the pelvis. Local tissue hypothermia using ice, ice slush, or cold irrigation has been safely and routinely used for decades in humans during brain, heart, and kidney surgery to minimize organ damage. Yet, this technique has never been applied to prostate surgery. We will accomplish local cooling of the pelvis using a cooling balloon inserted into the rectum. The cooling balloon is powered by an FDA approved cooling system developed by Innercool therapies. Temperatures of 57-86 degrees F (22+/-8 degrees C). References 1.
