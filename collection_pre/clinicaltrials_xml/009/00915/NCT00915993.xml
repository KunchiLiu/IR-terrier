	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI in predicting response to sunitinib malate in patients with stage IV kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI in Predicting Response to Sunitinib Malate in Patients With Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Correlate tumor vascular permeability by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) with clinical outcome in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib malate. - Correlate genetic and histologic characteristics of the primary tumor with vascular permeability by DCE-MRI. Secondary - Correlate genetic and histologic characteristics of the primary tumor with clinical outcome in patients treated with sunitinib malate. - Collect tissue samples for potential future exploratory analyses of pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic parameters. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and after the first 4 weeks of sunitinib malate. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic analysis and for analysis of angiogenic growth factor levels. Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline for mutation analysis and for assessment of angiogenesis histology by IHC.</detailed_description>
