	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, controlled, open, two-armed, two-period cross-over, multi-centre phase II/III study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of once-daily oral modified-release hydrocortisone in comparison to conventional thrice-daily oral hydrocortisone tablets in patients with adrenal insufficiency</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Once-daily Oral Modified Release Hydrocortisone in Patients With Adrenal Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenal insufficiency is a disease with more than 80% 1-year mortality before the availability of synthetic glucocorticoids. Current replacement therapy has improved this dramatically, but recent data suggest that outcome is still compromised. Patient receiving replacement therapy with hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate have compromised quality of life, reduced bone mass, increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality that is more than twice the mortality rate in the background population. Circulating cortisol levels follow a distinct diurnal pattern with high levels in the early morning and low trough values around midnight. Using available formulations for replacement therapy this circadian rhythm is had to mimic and also during the active time of the day high peaks and low troughs occur. In this trial a newly developed novel dual-, controlled release formulation of hydrocortisone that has in healthy volunteers been able to mimic the circadian pattern of circulating cortisol was studied in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease).</detailed_description>
