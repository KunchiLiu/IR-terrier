	<brief_summary>This is an open-label (both the physician and healthy volunteer know which treatment will be administered), single-dose, 4-period study to characterize the pharmacokinetics (process by which JNJ-31001074 is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body) and effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-31001074. The study consists of three phases: a screening phase to determine eligibility, an open-label 4-period treatment phase and an end-of-study/early withdrawal assessment phase.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Characterize the Pharmacokinetics and Effect of Food on JNJ-31001074 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (both the physician and healthy volunteer know which treatment will be administered), randomized (treatment order determined by chance), single-dose study to characterize the pharmacokinetics (process by which JNJ-31001074 is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body) and effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-31001074. The study consists of three phases: a screening phase to determine eligibility, an open-label treatment phase and an end-of-study/early withdrawal assessment phase. During the screening phase, healthy volunteers will be evaluated to see if they meet selection criteria as specified in the protocol. Healthy volunteers who meet these criteria will report to the study center on Day -1 to begin treatment. The open-label treatment phase will consist of 4 periods. In each period, volunteers will receive one of the following treatments: Treatment A 1 mg JNJ-31001074, Treatment B 3 mg JNJ-31001074, Treatment C 10 mg JNJ-31001074, and Treatment D 10 mg JNJ-31001074. Treatment A, B and C will be administered under fasting conditions (no food or beverages for 10 hours prior to dosing) and Treatment D will be administered after a high-fat meal. The order in which volunteers will receive each treatment will be determined in a random fashion (like flipping a coin). Each treatment will be separated by a 7-14 day washout period. Multiple blood and urine samples will be collected for 72 hours after each dose. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the volunteer's participation. Volunteers will be instructed to report any adverse events that occur up to 30 days after their last dose of study drug. The maximum study duration for each volunteer is expected to be 66 days. JNJ-31001074 1, 3 or 10 mg will be administered orally on Day 1 of each of the 4 treatment periods (dose depends on participant's treatment sequence)</detailed_description>
