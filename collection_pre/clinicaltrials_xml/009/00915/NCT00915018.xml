	<brief_summary>This study is investigating the effects of an experimental drug (neratinib) in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of women who have not received previous treatment for erbB-2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The study will compare the effectiveness of each regimen in shrinking tumors and extending the lives of women with erbB-2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. The study will also compare the safety of the two regimens and as well as the quality of life of subjects receiving either regimen.</brief_summary>
