	<brief_summary>This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial will evaluate the impact of adding everolimus to the combination of weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of women with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either paclitaxel/bevacizumab/everolimus (Treatment Arm 1) or paclitaxel/ bevacizumab/placebo (Treatment Arm 2). Patients will be evaluated for response to treatment every 8 weeks; responding and/or stable patients will continue treatment, with re-evaluations every 8 weeks, until tumor progression or intolerable toxicity occurs. Outcomes will be assessed for each treatment arm separately. This trial is not intended to compare treatment arms primarily. Any such analyses are exploratory and will be conducted without adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Female or male patients &gt;=18 years of age. 2. Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, locally unresectable or metastatic. 3. No prior chemotherapy for MBC. Patients may have received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including taxanes and/or bevacizumab) as long as treated was completed &gt;12 months prior to relapse. Prior hormonal therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting will be permitted. 4. Prior hormonal therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting is permitted. Estrogen receptor positive patients should be considered candidates for chemotherapy. 5. HER2negative breast cancer, defined as follows: FISHnegative (FISH ratio &lt;2.2), or IHC 01+, or IHC 23+ AND FISHnegative (FISH ratio &lt;2.2). 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1. 7. Adequate hematologic function, defined by: 路 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/mm3 Platelet count &gt;=100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL 8. Adequate liver function, defined by: 路 AST and ALT &lt;=2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;=5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases Total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x ULN 9. Adequate renal function, defined by: 路 Serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;=40 ml/min 10. International normalized ratio (INR) &lt;=1.5 or prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal limits (WNL) of the institution (if patient is not on anticoagulation therapy). Patients receiving anticoagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin are eligible if the INR is stable and within the therapeutic range prior to study treatment initiation. 11. Adequate lipid profile: total cholesterol &lt;=300 mg/dL OR &lt;=7.75 mmol/L and fasting triglyceride 2.5 x ULN. Note: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded,the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication. 12. Patients with proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by either: 路 Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ration &gt;1.0 at screening or Urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;=2+ (patients discovered to have &gt;=2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must demonstrate &lt;1 g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible). 13. Measurable disease by RECIST criteria. 14. Life expectancy &gt;=12 weeks. 15. Ability to swallow oral medications. 16. Adequate cardiac function, defined by baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value &gt;= normal per institutional guidelines by MUGA scan or echocardiogram (ECHO). 17. Adequate recovery from recent surgery. Major surgical procedure &gt;28 days from study entry Minor surgical procedure &gt;7 days from study entry (Portacath placement excepted patients can start treatment &lt;7 days after portacath placement.) 18. Patients with previous history of invasive cancers (including breast cancer) are eligible if definitive treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to initiating current study treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease. 19. Patient must be accessible for treatment and followup. 20. All patients must be able to understand the investigational nature of the study and give written informed consent prior to study entry. 1. Patients with active brain metastases or meningeal metastases. Patients who have had brain metastases resected, or have received brain radiation therapy &gt;4 weeks prior to study entry are eligible, if they meet all of the following criteria: 1) residual symptoms &lt; grade 2, 2) no dexamethasone requirement, and 3) followup MRI shows regression of lesions after treatment and no new lesions appearing. 2. Previous treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus) or antiangiogenesis agent unless: in the adjuvant setting, and &gt;=12 months prior to recurrence. 3. Previous radiotherapy for metastatic disease completed &lt;2 weeks prior to study treatment initiation. 4. Patients who are current receiving systemic cancer therapy or have received previous systemic therapy within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (e.g. chemotherapy, antibody therapy, targeted agents). 5. Women who are pregnant or lactating. All patients with reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception from time of study entry until at least 3 months after the last administration of study drug. 6. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt;100 mmHg, despite optimal medical management. 7. Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers from 72 hours prior to initiation of study treatment until the end of treatment with everolimus. 8. Cardiac disease, including: congestive heart failure (CHF) &gt; Class II per New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification; unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or newonset angina (i.e., began within the last 3 months), or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; symptomatic CHF, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy. 9.

Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation such as: severe impaired lung functions as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN. 17. History of any other disease, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an investigational drug, or that might affect interpretation of the results of this study, or render the subject at high risk for treatment complications. 18.
