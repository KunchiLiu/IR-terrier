	<brief_summary>Growth hormone (GH) and Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion are altered in acromegaly and type 2 Diabetes Mellitis (DM). The secretion of GH is mediated by central hypothalamic hormones (GH Releasing Hormone and somatostatin) as well as peripheral factors providing feedback inhibition (IGF-I and glucose, among others). The purpose of this study is to compare growth hormone suppression after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to growth hormone suppression after recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) administration. This study will recruit participants with active acromegaly, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and healthy control subjects. Each participant will undergo a screening evaluation, and three subsequent visits. Each participant will receive a placebo subcutaneous injection, OGTT, and administration of rhIGF-I, on separate visit days. Glucose, insulin, GH, bioactive IGF-I and IGF-I binding proteins will be measured after each intervention. Results will be compared between the three groups. It is predicted that the administration of rhIGF-I will demonstrate GH suppression in all healthy subjects and subjects with type 2DM. Some acromegaly subjects may demonstrate GH suppression in response to IGF-I administration, but not to the degree seen in healthy subjects or type 2 DM. OGTT will demonstrate suppression of GH in normal subjects, and will show attenuated suppression in type 2 DM and a failure of suppression in acromegaly.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Active acromegaly due to excess GH produced by a pituitary adenoma. Patients must have an elevated IGFI compared to age and gender matched controls (as supplied by the laboratory) and fail to suppress GH to below 1 ng/ml after a standard 75g oral glucose tolerance test. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, defined by elevated fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl (verified by two historical measurements), or plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load, or a random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl. 1. Acromegaly Group Current medical therapy for acromegaly including dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogues, or growth hormone antagonists. For subjects on current therapy the following washout periods may be used: Cabergoline: 4 weeks Bromocriptine: 1 week Sandostatin LAR: 3 months Shortacting octreotide: 1 week Lanreotide: 3 months Pegvisomant: 4 weeks Subjects with a history of surgical therapy for treatment of acromegaly must have verification of active disease with verified elevated IGFI for the subjects' age and gender compared to healthy controls (as supplied by the laboratory) (two measures) as well as a failure to suppress GH to below 1 ng/ml after OGTT. Current treatment for insulin resistance or type 2 DM including oral or injection medications. Fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl at screening evaluation. Evidence of hepatic or renal disease defined as elevated transaminases, elevated serum creatinine. Pregnancy or breast feeding. 2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus group Patients taking noninsulin medications for diabetes treatment will be excluded. Diagnosis of acromegaly. Evidence of hepatic or renal disease defined as elevated transaminases, elevated serum creatinine. Pregnancy or breast feeding. 3. Healthy Control Group History of diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, history of acromegaly. Fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl at screening evaluation. Evidence of hepatic or renal disease defined as elevated transaminases, elevated serum creatinine. Pregnancy or breast feeding.</criteria>
