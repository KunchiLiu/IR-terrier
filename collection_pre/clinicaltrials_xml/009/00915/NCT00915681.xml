	<brief_summary>Legalon® SIL will be administered to patients with amatoxin poisoning diagnosed by history, gastrointestinal symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, and/or diagnostic assay (should one become available). Patients may or may not also demonstrate abnormalities in bilirubin and/or creatinine. Treatment consists of a 5 mg/kg loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg/day via continuous infusion. The treating physician is expected to administer supportive therapy of his/her choosing but consistent with best practices. Legalon® SIL will be stopped when coagulopathy is no longer present, and when liver function tests have returned significantly towards the normal range. Patients will be followed 7-14 days after the end of Legalon® SIL therapy with follow up lab studies.</brief_summary>
