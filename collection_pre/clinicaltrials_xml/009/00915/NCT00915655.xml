	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (what body does to medication), safety, tolerability, and efficacy (effectiveness) of darunavir with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv) administered once daily, in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen consisting of other antiretrovirals (ARVs) ie, 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in treatment-naive (never treated before) HIV-1 infected adolescents aged from 12 to &lt;18 years and weighing at least 40 kg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Antiviral Activity of Darunavir + Ritonavir in HIV-1 Infected Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, Phase II study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv) administered once daily, in combination an investigator-selected background regimen (2 NRTIs), in treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adolescents over 48 weeks. A total of 12 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be considered treatment-naive if they have never received treatment with an ARV medication, including both investigational as well as commercially available ARVs indicated for the treatment of HIV-infection and ARVs for the treatment of hepatitis B infection with anti-HIV activity. The investigator-selected background regimen will consist of 2 NRTIs, either zidovudine/lamivudine or abacavir/lamivudine, whichever is approved and marketed or considered local standard of care for adolescents aged from 12 to &lt;18 years in a particular country. The study will consist of a 4-week screening period, a 48-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. Safety, efficacy, resistance (reduction in effectiveness of a medication), pharmacokinetic analyses, and pharmacodynamic (what medication does to body) analyses will be performed at Week 24 (primary analysis) and Week 48 (final analysis). Patients who will complete the 48 weeks of treatment with DRV/rtv and who will continue to benefit from this treatment, will have the opportunity to continue this treatment until they no longer benefit from the medication, until DRV is commercially available or can be accessed from another source (eg, access program, government program) or until the development program is discontinued.</detailed_description>
