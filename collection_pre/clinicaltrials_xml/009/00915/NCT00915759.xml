	<criteria>Active duty US Army Soldiers eligible for care at WRAMC. Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the preoperative examination, and have signed and informed consent. The lower age limit of 21 years is intended to ensure documentation of refractive stability. Subject must expect to be located in the greater Washington DC area for a 12 month period postoperatively. Consent of the subject's command (active duty) to participate in the study. Access to transportation to meet followup requirements. Any reason to be excluded for PRK. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding or intend to become pregnant during the study. Female subjects will be give a urine pregnancy test prior to participating in the study to rule out pregnancy. [Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications to refractive surgery in general, including PRK, whether participating in this study or not]. Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the medications used in the postoperative course. Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the examinations. Anterior basement membrane dystrophy. History of recurrent epithelial erosion. Significant dry eye (symptomatic with Schirmer test &lt; 5 mm at 5 minutes). Other corneal epithelial disorder or healing abnormality. Patients with unusually tight eyelids close to the eyeball making it difficult and/ or painful to insert anything (e.g., ProKera) between the eyelid and globe.</criteria>
