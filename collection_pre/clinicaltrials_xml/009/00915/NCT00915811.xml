	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of conditioning with fludarabine, busulphan and thymoglobuline in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders (MDS/MPD) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) undergoing haematopoietic stem cell allograft with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (or bone marrow) from HLA compatible sibling donors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient Selection 1. Availability of a HLA compatible sibling donor 2. Age &gt;18 years 3. Myelodysplastic Syndromes with IPSS Intermediate2 or High. 4. Poor risk acute myeloid leukaemia, de novo or transformed from MDS 5. Ineligibility for standard conditioning allograft due to age or coexisting morbidities Donor selection 1. Related donors compatible for HLAA, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by molecular typing. Patient selection 1. Cardiac insufficiency requiring treatment or symptomatic coronary artery disease. 2. Hepatic disease, with AST &gt; 2 times normal. 3. Severe hypoxaemia, pO2 &lt; 70 mm Hg, with decreased DLCO &lt; 70% of predicted; or mild hypoxemia, pO2 &lt; 80 mm Hg with severely decreased DLCO &lt; 60% of predicted. 4. Impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 2 times upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance &lt; 50% for age, gender, weight). 5. Patients who have received previous treatment with Thymoglobuline 6. HIVpositive patients. 7. Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding due to risks to foetus from conditioning regimen and potential risks to nursing infants. 8. Life expectancy severely limited by diseases other than MDS or MPD. 9. Serious concurrent untreated infection 10. Patients with limited life expectancy for other reasons 11. Serious psychiatric/ psychological disorders 12. Absence of /inability to provide informed consent Donor selection 1. Age &gt;75 years, unless independently assessed to be medically fit to donate 2. Donors who for any reason are unable to tolerate the leukapheresis procedure and cannot undergo anaesthesia for marrow harvest. 3. Donors who are HIVpositive, or hepatitis B or C PCR positive. 4. Donors who are medically unsuitable to donate</criteria>
