	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and late toxicity of dose escalated radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate and seminal vesicles in the treatment of high risk prostate cancer. All eligible patients with high risk prostate cancer who are going to have primary radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate seminal vesicles with or without concurrent hormonal therapy will be approached regarding study entry.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Pelvic Nodes Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian men and is the third most common cause of cancer death.1 Locally advanced prostate cancer (clinical T3/T4) is uncommon in North America because of earlier diagnosis following widespread PSA testing and patient information campaigns. However, in the past decade the term high-risk prostate cancer has been developed to include the previous locally advanced disease and patient with T1/T2 disease with poor prognostic features (either a high Prostate Specific Antigen or high Gleason score). The risk of involvement of pelvic lymph nodes by prostate cancer for certain subgroups of intermediate risk and most high risk prostate cancer may be substantial. The long term results of conventional dose (66-70 Gy) external beam radiation therapy for intermediate and locally advanced prostate cancer have been disappointing. The combination of hormonal therapy and radiation therapy or radiation therapy dose escalation are the two strategies which have been evaluated and are now used to improve these results.</detailed_description>
