	<brief_summary>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common infection among women that is associated with considerable morbidity and health-care cost. 75% of women will suffer of Candida infection for at least one time in their life. 20% of women who suffer from VVC will have ≥ 4 episodes of VVC during the one year prior to the survey. 80% of these VVC are caused by Candida albicans. Current treatments, based on imidazoles, face many failures or recurrences. The type of probiotic Lactobacillus may participate in the prevention of recurrent vulvo-vaginitis in reducing the proliferation of intestinal Candida albicans, its adherence to the vaginal walls, the potentiation of its propagation. The primary objective of this study was to investigate if our supplementary treatment could improve the initial cure rate after vaginal econazole therapy.</brief_summary>
