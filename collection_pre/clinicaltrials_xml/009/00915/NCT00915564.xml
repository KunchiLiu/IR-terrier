	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state (constant concentration of medication in the blood) TMC435 (150 mg, once a day) on the steady state pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) of R- and S-methadone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between TMC435 and Methadone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention) drug-drug interaction (TMC435 versus methadone) study. Approximately 12 hepatitis C virus-negative opioid-dependent participants on stable maintenance therapy (for at least 30 days before screening) will be enrolled in the study. The study will consist of 3 phases: 1) Run-in phase: during this phase, participants will take individualized (dose of methadone will be adjusted for each participant between a range of 30 and 150 mg daily) dose of methadone from Day -14 (14 days before the first intake of TMC435) till Day -1 (1 day before the first intake of TMC435), which will be supervised by the medical staff. 2) 7 days treatment phase: during this phase, the participants will take 150 mg dose of TMC435 once daily from Day 1 to Day 7 orally (by mouth) plus the individualized dose of methadone which will be supervised by the medical staff. 3) Follow-up phase: during this phase, the participants will continue to take only the individualized dose of methadone for 30-32 days. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, cardiovascular safety, physical examination and alcohol breath test. The total study duration will be of 22 days excluding screening and follow-up phase.</detailed_description>
