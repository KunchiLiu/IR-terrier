	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response to treatment and safety of paliperidone extended-release (mechanism to dissolve a drug over time in order to be released slower and steadier into the blood stream) in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 4 Study to Evaluate Response to Treatment and Safety of Paliperidone Extended-Release in Participants With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center (conducted in more than one center) study to explore response to treatment and safety of flexible dose of paliperidone extended-release (ER) in participants with schizophrenia. During the study period, dose of paliperidone ER will remain within the range of 3 to 12 milligram per day and will be administered for 12 months. Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants may be included in the study. Participants may switch to any effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral antipsychotic medication without dose adjustment or if required, cross-dose adjustment may be done. Maximum 4 weeks of switching period is allowed. Use of anticholinergic (opposing the actions of the acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) drugs will not be restricted. Response to treatment will be evaluated primarily through total Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
