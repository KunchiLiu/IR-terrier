	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to discover how often certain bacteria are found in the rectum at the time of a prostate needle biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer. Certain bacteria are of importance because they can cause serious infection. Antibiotics that urologists commonly use to prevent these bacteria from causing infection are no longer effective. Many physicians around the world are noting increased infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria. Therefore; despite treating patients who are to undergo prostate biopsy with antibiotics, certain patients are being readmitted to the hospital with a serious infection. In order to study the incidence of these particular bacteria, the best method is to culture the bacteria at the time of the biopsy. This involves one rectal culture swab just prior to needle biopsy of the prostate. Once the incidence of these bacteria is known we may take steps to prevent the serious infections that occur as a result of prostate biopsy.</brief_summary>
