	<brief_summary>This open-label, rater-blinded extension study will enroll patients who have relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and who participated in one of three prior Genzyme-sponsored studies of alemtuzumab [CAMMS223 (NCT00050778), CAMMS323 (NCT00530348) also known as CARE-MS I, or CAMMS324 (NCT00548405) also known as CARE-MS II]. The purposes of this study are: 1. To examine the long term safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab treatment in patients who received alemtuzumab as their study treatment in one of the prior studies. 2. To examine the safety and efficacy of initial alemtuzumab treatment in this study for patients who received Rebif速 (interferon beta-1a) as their study treatment in one of the prior studies. 3. To determine if and when further alemtuzumab treatment is needed, and the safety and efficacy of this "as needed" treatment. This applies both to patients who received alemtuzumab for the first time in one of the prior studies or for the first time in this extension study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Extension Protocol for Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Participated in Genzyme-Sponsored Studies of Alemtuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alemtuzumab treatment will either be on a fixed schedule of two treatment cycles a year apart for patients who received Rebif速 in one of the prior Genzyme-sponsored studies of alemtuzumab or on an as needed schedule (e.g. due to documented evidence of resumed MS activity) for patients who have already completed a fixed schedule of treatment with alemtuzumab in one of the prior Genzyme-sponsored studies. There is no comparison treatment in this study. All patients will be required to return to their study site every 3 months for neurologic and other assessments. In addition, safety-related laboratory tests and surveys will be performed at least monthly. Participation in the extension study will last 48 months from enrollment. Study duration may be extended per protocol amendments to allow patients to remain in the study through the time of drug approval or until a long term follow up study is available in each respective country.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1.Received alemtuzumab in CAMMS323 or CAMMS324, completed the 2year study period, and have not subsequently received disease modifying treatments (other than glatiramer acetate or interferon beta); or 2.Received Rebif速 in CAMMS323 or CAMMS324, completed the 2year study period, and have not subsequently received alternative disease modifying treatments (other than glatiramer acetate or another interferon beta); or 3.Participated in CAMMS223. NOTE: Criteria 1 and 2 above mean that patients who enrolled in CAMMS323 or CAMMS324 but did not complete the 2year study period or went on to receive nonstudy drug DMTs after randomization are not eligible for inclusion in the Extension Study. Patients who enrolled in CAMMS324 after participation in CAMMS223 must meet criteria 1 or 2 to be eligible for inclusion in the Extension Study. Any alemtuzumab patient from CAMMS223, CAMMS323, or CAMMS324 who has received alemtuzumab offlabel (ie, outside of one of the prior Genzymesponsored studies), or is participating in any other investigational study, unless approved by Genzyme. In addition, these patients must be screened for disqualifying safety concerns before receiving alemtuzumab retreatment. Any Rebif速 patient from CAMMS223, CAMMS323, or CAMMS324 who meets any of the following criteria. In addition, these patients must be screened for disqualifying safety concerns before receiving alemtuzumab treatment. a)Does not wish to receive alemtuzumab; b) Ongoing participation in any other investigational study, unless approved by Genzyme; c)Has received alemtuzumab offlabel (ie, outside of one of the prior Genzymesponsored studies); d)Known bleeding disorder or therapeutic anticoagulation; e)Diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura or other autoimmune hematologic abnormality; f)History of malignancy, except basal cell skin carcinoma; g)Intolerance of pulsed corticosteroids, especially a history of steroid psychosis h)Significant Autoimmune disorder (other than MS); i)Major psychiatric disorder or epileptic seizures not adequately controlled by treatment; j)Active infection or high risk for infection k)Unwilling to use a reliable and acceptable contraceptive method during and for at least 6 months following each alemtuzumab treatment cycle (fertile patients only).</criteria>
