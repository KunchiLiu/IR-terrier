	<brief_title>Open-Label Study of Teduglutide for Subjects With PN-Dependent Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some people with SBS need to infuse parenteral nutrition (PN) in order to live. Although PN can save lives, it can lead to some serious side effects such as infection or liver damage. The risk for those effects increases the longer people are on PN. Teduglutide is an investigative medicine being evaluated as a possible treatment for people with PN-dependent SBS. Teduglutide is similar to a protein the body makes. When people have SBS, their bodies do not make enough of the protein and they have trouble getting nutrients and fluids from the food they eat and drink. We want to see if teduglutide can help decrease the amount of PN needed because the body is doing a better job of taking up what it eats and drinks. We also want to find out how safe teduglutide is and record any side effects.</detailed_description>
