	<brief_title>Effects of Music Therapy on Breastfeeding Among Mothers of Premature Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Music therapy has been shown to have positive effects in several areas such as mental health, special education, rehabilitation and social development. Its use as a means to facilitate communication and expression of emotional contents was shown to be able to promote relief of anxiety, fears and tensions. However, in the maternal and child health area there are still few studies demonstrating the contribution of this therapy in the promotion of health and no study evaluating specifically the impact of this intervention on the rates of breastfeeding in mothers of premature newborns.</detailed_description>
