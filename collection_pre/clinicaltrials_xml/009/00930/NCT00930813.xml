	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Lutonix Catheter for treatment of stenosis of the femoropopliteal arteries by direct comparison to standard balloon angioplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LEVANT I, The Lutonix Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon for the Prevention of Femoropopliteal Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LEVANT I trial will enroll patients presenting with clinical evidence of claudication or critical limb ischemia and an angiographically significant lesion in the femoropopliteal arteries. Patients will be randomized to treatment with either the Lutonix Catheter or standard balloon angioplasty after predilation.</detailed_description>
