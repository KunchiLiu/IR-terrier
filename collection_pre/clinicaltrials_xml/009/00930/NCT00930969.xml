	<brief_summary>The purpose of ST Detect study is to evaluate whether naturally occurring spontaneous coronary events and exercise induced cardiac ischemia, give rise to detectable changes on intracardiac electrogram (EGM) signals in patients that are indicated for an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) who have coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
