	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety, extent and route of [3H] BMS747158 radioactivity eliminated (mass balance) in urine and feces of healthy male subjects. The safety of [3H] BMS747158 administration will also be assessed, as well as pharmacokinetics of [3H] BMS747158 and metabolite identification.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of [3H] BMS747158 in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label study will enroll up to seven healthy male subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive 100 (±20) μCi of [3H] BMS747158. Subjects will undergo blood, urine, and fecal collections to evaluate [3H] activity for a minimum of 7 days post-dose. Safety will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).This Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label study will enroll up to seven healthy male subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
