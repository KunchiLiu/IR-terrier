	<brief_summary>The endomicroscopy is an adaptation of traditional optical microscopy in the digestive endoscopy. Furthermore, with the integration of a miniaturized laser confocal microscope to a videoendoscope, it's possible to study the digestive mucous by "optical biopsy". This monocentric, non randomized and prospective study uses the Intra-ductal confocal endomicroscopy for the characterization of pancreas and bile duct tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-ductal Confocal Endomicroscopy for Characterization of Pancreas and Bile Duct Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: Obtain a tissular characterization of a biliary or pancreatic stenosis with a confocal microscope which is in direct contact of the stenosis during the Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP). Secondary objectives: - Compare the result of this "optical biopsy" to a conventional biopsy. - Tolerance</detailed_description>
