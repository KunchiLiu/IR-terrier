	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine if the amount of fat and saturated fat in the diet contributes to the development of a condition called fatty liver disease in the absence of changes in weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Diet Composition on Liver Fat and Glucose Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver and associated inflammation. This condition is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Diets high in saturated fat result in fatty liver, insulin resistance and liver injury in animal models. Dietary composition may contribute not only to hepatic fat accumulation and insulin resistance but may also promote inflammation leading to chronic liver disease in humans. This study will test the hypothesis that a diet high in fat and saturated fat contributes to liver fat accumulation, insulin resistance and inflammation by comparing the effects of a four-week, weight stable high fat/high saturated fat diet (55% calories from fat/25% saturated fat) with a four-week, weight stable low fat/low saturated fat diet (20% fat/8% saturated fat) in overweight and obese subjects.</detailed_description>
