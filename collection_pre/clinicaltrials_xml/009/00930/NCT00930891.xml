	<brief_summary>Despite the fact that a substantial response rate may be obtained in small-cell lung cancers (using double-drug chemotherapy: cisplatin-etoposide, PE), a cure remains an exception. More aggressive regimens remain controversial and recent attempts at increasing dose-intensity have been restricted to patients with a more favourable presentation. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody which binds to VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor). In association with double-drug standard chemotherapies, it has been proven that bevacizumab can improve survival of previously untreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), compared to chemotherapy without bevacizumab). Such promising effects on NSCLC deserve to be tested on small-cell lung cancers. In this trial (IFCT-0802), standard chemotherapy (PCDE or PE) will be compared to experimental treatment (PCDE or PE + bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg) for previously untreated SCLC patients.</brief_summary>
