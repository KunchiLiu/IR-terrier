	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infecton (UTI) is a very common problem in young healthy women, afflicting approximately one-half of women by their late 20's. One of the most common antibiotics used to treat UTIs is Trimethoprim-sulfa (TMP-SMX), usually for total of three days. However, concerns about increased antibiotic resistance have led to increased interest in studying other antibiotics for UTI. An alternative antibiotic which is also FDA approved for the treatment of UTIs is fosfomycin (Monurol). The effectiveness of fosfomycin in curing UTIs when given as a single dose is not well studied. The purpose of this research study is to determine what the cure rates are with a single dose of fosfomycin versus the more standard 3-day course of TMP-SMX.</brief_summary>
