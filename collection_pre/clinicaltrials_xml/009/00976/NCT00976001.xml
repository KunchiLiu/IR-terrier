	<brief_summary>This is a randomized follow-up study after discharge from a stroke unit after a first stroke. The patients are randomized either to follow-up at a special out-patient stroke unit or with their general practitioners. The hypothesis is that follow-up with specialists is superior to follow-up with general practitioners. Endpoints are mortality, recurrent stroke and handicap measured with different scales.</brief_summary>
