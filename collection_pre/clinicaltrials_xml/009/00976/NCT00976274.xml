	<brief_summary>Five factor consisting of Metabolic syndrome is closely linked by insulin resistance. Until now, several studies have been performed about effects of Korea red ginseng on hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but not metabolic syndrome. The investigators hypothesize that Korean red ginseng could improve each constituents of metabolic syndrome, arterial stiffness, and inflammatory markers. The aim of this study is to determine effects of Korean red ginseng on cardiovascular risks in subjects with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The details of study objective are followed by these: - comparison of blood pressure before and after Korean red ginseng administration - comparison of metabolic indicator before and after Korean red ginseng administration - comparison of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers before and after Korean red ginseng administration - comparison of arterial stiffness before and after Korean red ginseng administration</detailed_description>
