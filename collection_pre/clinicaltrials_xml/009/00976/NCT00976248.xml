	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of RAD001(Everolimus) and the highest dose of this drug that can be given to people safely. RAD001(Everolimus) is a drug that works by preventing cells in the body from growing and dividing. Information from basic and Phase I clinical research studies suggests that RAD001 also may help to prevent tumor growth in people with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.</brief_summary>
