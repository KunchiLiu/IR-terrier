	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether GSK1521498 attaches to sites in the brain called mu-opioid receptors that are involved in the liking reactions to palatable high fat and high sugar foods. We hope that blocking these receptors may modify certain behaviours that may lead to obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>[11C]Carfentanil PET Study of GSK1521498</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This imaging study will be an open-label, non-randomised PET receptor occupancy study in healthy male volunteers. The degree and time course of μ-opioid receptor occupancy (RO) following single oral doses of GSK1521498 will be estimated by [11C]carfentanil displacement. Previous pre-clinical and human PET studies indicate that [11C]carfentanil is selective for the μ-opioid receptor and can be used to estimate μ-opioid receptor occupancy in vivo. The PK/PD relationship between plasma concentrations of GSK1521498 and μ-opioid RO will be described. Potential relationships between μ-opioid RO and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) endpoints, measured in a food reward paradigm, will be assessed as an exploratory aim. Additionally, the PK/PD relationships between plasma concentrations of naltrexone (a generic μ-opioid receptor antagonist), μ-opioid receptor occupancy, and fMRI measures of reward processing will also be investigated.</detailed_description>
