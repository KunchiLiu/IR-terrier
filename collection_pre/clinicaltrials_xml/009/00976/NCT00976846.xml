	<brief_summary>The proposed study seeks to determine the appropriate balance between the removal of undesirable small molecular substances (urea, creatinine, phosphate) and large molecular substances (ß2-m) and the retention of important substances (e.g.albumin) for the Baxter Xenium XPH dialyzer type under defined therapeutic conditions of olHDF primarily concerning filtration flow rates in relation to blood flow/plasma water flow rates. Furthermore the possibility of the removal of certain protein-bound substances shall be investigated together with the impact of increasing ultrafiltration on the parameters of the micro-inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Performance and Compatibility of the Baxter Dialyzer Xenium XPH 210 During On-line Hemodiafiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new high flux dialyser membrane Xenium XPH 210 from Baxter will show an considerably increased removal of ß2-Microglobulin with olHDF in post dilution mode together with a markedly increased removal of small molecules (urea, creatinine, phosphate). The loss of albumin will depend on the treatment modalities. However, the albumin permeability is tolerable over the whole range of total filtration rate selected and applied to the patients. Together with the albumin loss into the filtrate/dialysate a small amount of albuminbound substances is detectable. Parameters of micro-inflammation can be influenced by an increasing convective part of the treatment.</detailed_description>
