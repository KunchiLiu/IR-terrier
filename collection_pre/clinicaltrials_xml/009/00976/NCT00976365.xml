	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain evidence from test article with efficacy in Metastatic Breast Cancer patients. The average of all changes from baseline to post-treatment evaluations in global health/quality of life (QoL) subscale assessed by self-administered European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The test article is extracted from many natural herbals, in which most or their components have been shown to have anti-tumor activity. A study in 2004 showed the test article could have strong immunomodulatory effect on the antigen-stimulated proliferation response (PR) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T-cells from recurrent aphthous ulcerations (RAU) patients and suggested that it might be a potential immunoceutical agent for treatment of RAU. Subsequent study in 2005 also suggested the test article as a potential immunoceutical agent for treatment of RAU because the result showed it could modulate the antigen-stimulated cytokine production by T-cells isolated from RAU patients. Another study in 2005 showed the test article also had a broad-range tumor killing function and provided a molecular basis underlying therapeutic activity. It was also suggested in this study will could be a potential and promising cancer therapeutic or preventive agent. The aim of this current study is to explore the safety and efficacy of the investigational product with 20 ml, 3 times per day (daily dose: 60 ml) for a total of 24 weeks in the patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to conventional treatment modalities.</detailed_description>
