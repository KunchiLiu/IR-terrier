	<brief_summary>This observational study looks at Carotid Stenosis in two groups of subjects using a non-invasive procedure, B-mode ultrasound. One group of subjects has had long-term intensive lipid altering therapy (lowering LDL-C plus raising HDL-C). The second group of patients has been on conventional "standard of care" treatment for carotid stenosis. The study will look at the Carotid Intima-media Thickness (CMIT) in both groups. Hypothesis: CIMT will differ between the two groups, such that the CIMT will be less in the subjects on intensive lipid altering therapy.</brief_summary>
