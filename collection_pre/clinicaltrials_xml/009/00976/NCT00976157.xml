	<brief_summary>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is a recently described molecule that plays an important role in myeloid cell-activated inflammatory responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolutional change of soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of clinically diagnosed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and its correlation with response to treatment and outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serial Changes in sTREM-1 During Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, interventional study conducted between August 2006 and August 2007 in MICU in Mackay Memorial Hospital, 35 patients with clinically diagnosed VAP were investigated. sTREM-1 was measured in BAL samples using ELISA at the onset, 4th - 5th and 7th - 9th day of clinical diagnosis of VAP.Of these 35 patients, 27 had positive BAL culture. The sTREM-1 levels in BAL fluid were measured and compared between patients with positive BAL culture and negative BAL culture. Serial changes in sTREM-1 levels were evaluated in relation to patient outcome.</detailed_description>
