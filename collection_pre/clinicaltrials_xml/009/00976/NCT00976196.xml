	<brief_title>Platelet Hyperreactivity Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PHP study aims to delineate gene products involved in high on-treatment platelet reactivity in aspirin-treated cardiovascular patients using a system biology approach that include proteomics analysis of selected platelet sub-fractions in patients displaying extreme phenotype. Main objective: - to characterize the proteome profile of platelet hyperreactivity in aspirin-treated cardiovascular patients Secondary objectives: - to characterize the platelet hyperreactivity phenotype in cardiovascular patients treated with aspirin - to determine genetic polymorphisms associated with platelet hyperreactivity</detailed_description>
