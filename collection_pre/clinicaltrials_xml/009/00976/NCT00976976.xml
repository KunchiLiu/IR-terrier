	<brief_summary>Despite the improvement of surgical resection as primary curative treatment for gastric cancer, more than 70% of patients with stage IIIB and IV disease undergoing radical primary tumor resection relapse and die within 5 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further improve the treatment for gastric cancer in this population. Recently reported phase III study comparing capecitabine/cisplatin (XP) versus 5-FU/cisplatin (FP), XP showed better activity and tolerability compared with FP. To improve treatment outcomes of XP chemotherapy, the investigators performed a phase I-II study of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Phase I-II study of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (Kang et al, Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 22,328.2003). The docetaxel/capecitabine/cisplatin (DXP) chemotherapy was highly active for the 1st-line chemotherapy of AGC. These findings and experience encourages the investigators to design the adjuvant trial of DXP chemotherapy in patients with resected gastric cancer. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant DXP in this patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Docetaxel, Capecitabine and Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous in phase II study of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin,total 40 pts with measurable disease, median 6 cycles of chemotherapy, there were 4 confirmed complete responses (CRs) and 23 confirmed partial responses (PRs), with the overall response rate of 67.5% (95% confidence interval, 52.7 ~ 82.3) in intention-to-treat analysis. Ten patients underwent surgical resection after 4 ~ 9 cycles of chemotherapy. Four pathologic CRs were identified. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1 to 28), median time to progression was 7.7 months, and median overall survival was 16.9 months. The DXP chemotherapy was highly active for the 1st-line chemotherapy of AGC (Kang et al, Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 22,328.2003).</detailed_description>
