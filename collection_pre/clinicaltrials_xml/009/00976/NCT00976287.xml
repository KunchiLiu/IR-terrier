	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation via hepatic artery in the treatment of liver cirrhosis. Liver function was monitored by serum examination. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT) and albumin (ALB) were examined at pre-transplantation, and 3 days to 2 years post-transplantation. Child-Pugh scores and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with liver cirrhosis were randomly separated into two groups. Autologous MSCs were infused to patients using interventional method via hepatic artery for One group. The catheter was inserted to proper hepatic artery. After the catheter placed at proper hepatic artery was confirmed by angiography, autologous bone marrow MSCs were infused slowly for 20-30 minutes. The control group accepted conserved therapy.</detailed_description>
