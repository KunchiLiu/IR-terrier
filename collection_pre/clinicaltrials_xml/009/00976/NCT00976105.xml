	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to see whether the drug is safe and well tolerated when given to overweight or obese but otherwise healthy volunteers for 10 days. Up to 4 groups of people will be given the drug at variable strengths. The blood levels of the drug will be measured and the effects on mood and cognition (the mental processes involved in awareness, learning and judgement) will be assesed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Repeat Dosing of GSK1521498</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to test a new drug which may be used for treating eating behaviour and patterns that some overweight and obese patients find difficult to control. The drug works by inhibiting the effects of messenger molecules called opioids, e.g. endorphins. These opioids are naturally produced within the human body and control hunger, thirst, and the pleasurable feelings we relate to eating food. The drug attaches to opioid binding sites in the brain, known as mu-opioid receptors; this blocks the natural effect of opioids which may reduce the craving to eat fatty or sugary foods. Single doses of the drug have been given to humans and showed it was safe. Now the drug will be given every day for 10 days to check that the drug is safe and tolerated when given repeatedly. The study is in two parts: Part A: people will receive a sleeping tablet to make them sleepy (or a dummy drug) and will complete some questionnaires and simple tests including computer exercises to test the effect of this tablet on mood and cognition. This information will be used to help judge what is happening in Part B. Part B: requires staying in the unit for 10 days to receive a tablet every day and complete questionnaires and other tests to check for any mood and cognitive changes. Various other assessments will include effects on eating behaviour, pain measures and changes in body composition (content of fat, muscle and water).</detailed_description>
