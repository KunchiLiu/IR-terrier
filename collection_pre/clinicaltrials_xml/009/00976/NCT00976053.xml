	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion PET with pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion SPECT in a near-simultaneous, head-to-head comparison in the same patient. The investigators hypothesize that pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion PET will prove superior to pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion SPECT as a first-line diagnostic test for higher-risk patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who present with symptoms consistent with possible worsening of their CAD.</brief_summary>
