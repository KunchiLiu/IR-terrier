	<brief_title>Clinical Outcome of Pacemaker paTIents According to Pacing Modality and Primary INDications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective of the OPTI-MIND study is to collect data on two-year all-cause mortality in a general population implanted with a PM according to current clinical practice. Additionally, the study aims to stratify the outcome by both known patient-related risk factors and by physiologic pacing mode setting (a specifically defined PM programming). Stratification will be done for pre-specified classes of patients on the basis of their primary rhythm disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients implanted with a current Boston Scientific pacemaker (all ALTRUA models) or any future commercially available Boston Scientific PM families according to international and local guidelines for pacemaker implantation; Patients who are willing and capable of providing informed consent, participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an approved clinical investigational centre; Patients whose age is 18 years or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and national law. Unable to be followed up by the participating centres for a period of two years; Current device implanted for more than 15 days; Women of childbearing potential who are, or plan to become, pregnant during the time of the study (method of assessment upon physician's discretion); Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that would directly interfere with the current study, except when the patient is participating in a mandatory governmental registry or extensions/amendments of the current protocol. Each instance should be brought to the attention of the sponsor to determine eligibility.</criteria>
