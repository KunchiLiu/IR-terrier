	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in comparison to sitagliptin, as an add-on treatment to metformin, in obese (body mass index [BMI] greater than or equal to 30 kilogram per square meter [kg/m^2]) type 2 diabetic patients less than 50 years of age, over a period of 24 weeks of treatment. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of lixisenatide, in comparison to sitagliptin, as an add-on treatment to metformin on a composite endpoint of glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight, at Week 24. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide, in comparison to sitagliptin, as an add-on treatment to metformin on absolute changes in HbA1c values and body weight; fasting plasma glucose (FPG); plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and proinsulin during a 2-hour standardized meal test; insulin resistance assessed by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); beta cell function assessed by homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta); to evaluate safety, tolerability, and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed for at least 1 year at the time of screening visit, insufficiently controlled with metformin at a stable dose of at least 1.5 gram/day (g/day) for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit Patients with obesity (BMI greater than equal to [&gt;=] 30 kg/m^2) and aged from 18 years to less than 50 years Exclusion criteria HbA1c less than (&lt;) 7.0 percent (%) or HbA1c greater than (&gt;) 10% at screening Type 1 diabetes mellitus Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method FPG at screening &gt;250 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (&gt;13.9 millimole/ liter [mmol/L]) Weight change of more than 5 kg during the 3 months preceding the screening visit History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic conditions that predispose to MTC (for example, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes) History of metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis within 1 year prior to screening Hemoglobinopathy or hemolytic anemia or receipt of blood or plasma products within 3 months prior to the time of screening Within the last 6 months prior to screening: history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization Known history of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the time of screening Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) or vital signs at the time of screening that in the judgment of the investigator or any subinvestigator could have precludes safe completion of the study or constrains efficacy assessment such as major systemic diseases, presence of clinically significant diabetic retinopathy or presence of macular edema likely to require laser treatment within the study period Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled hypertension at the time of screening with a resting systolic or diastolic blood pressure &gt;180 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or &gt;110 mmHg, respectively Laboratory findings at the time of screening : Amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) laboratory range; alanine aminotransferase (ALT): &gt;3 times ULN; total bilirubin: &gt;1.5 times ULN (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome); hemoglobin &lt;11 gram/deciliter and/or neutrophils &lt;1500 per cubic millimeter (mm^3) and/or platelets &lt;100 000/mm^3; positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or Hepatitis C antibody (HCAb), positive serum pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential, and calcitonin &gt;=20 picogram per milliliter (pg/mL) (5.9 picomole per liter) Patients who are considered by the investigator or any subinvestigator as inappropriate for the study for any reason (for example, impossibility to meet specific protocol requirements [such as scheduled visits, being able to do selfinjections], likelihood of requiring treatment during the screening phase and treatment phase with drugs not permitted by the clinical study protocol, investigator or any subinvestigator, pharmacist, study coordinator, other study staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol) Use of other oral or injectable antidiabetic or hypoglycemic agents than metformin (for example, sulfonylurea, alpha glucosidase inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, exenatide, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors, insulin) within 3 months prior to the time of screening History of bariatric surgery, antiobesity treatment, or unstable diet within 3 months prior to the time of screening Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical application or inhaled forms) for one week or more within 3 months prior to the time of screening Use of any investigational drug within 3 months prior to screening Clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease associated with prolonged nausea and vomiting, including (but not limited to): gastroparesis, unstable (that is, worsening) and not controlled (that is, prolonged nausea and vomiting) gastroesophageal reflux disease requiring medical treatment, within 6 months prior to the time of screening Any previous treatment with lixisenatide (for example, participation in a previous study with lixisenatide) Allergic reaction to any glucagon like peptide1 (GLP 1) agonist in the past (for example, exenatide, liraglutide) or to metacresol History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to sitagliptin Moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance inferior to 50 milliliter/minute [mL/min]) Additional exclusion criteria at the end of the runin phase: informed consent withdrawal; lack of compliance during the singleblind placebo runin period (&gt;2 injections missed or &gt;2 capsules missed); and patient with any adverse event which could have precludes the inclusion in the study, as assessed by the investigator</criteria>
