	<brief_summary>Obesity is an important public health problem in the United States. The investigators hypothesize that stomach injections of botulinum toxin A (BTA), delivered through an endoscope using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), may cause delayed gastric emptying, satiation, and reduction in body weight. This protocol is designed to study the effects and safety of gastric BTA injections. Subjects are randomized to receive placebo or one of two different doses of BTA injected into the stomach during one endoscopy, performed via the mouth. Gastric emptying, satiation, symptoms, psychological dimensions of eating behavior, and caloric intake are recorded before and after injections, and subjects are seen in follow-up for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
