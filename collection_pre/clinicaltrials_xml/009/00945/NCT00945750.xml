	<brief_summary>This study will determine whether the CT formulation of famotidine taken with and without water is bioequivalent to the FCT formulation. The primary hypothesis is that the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of a single dose of famotidine 20 mg CT without water are equivalent to a single dose of famotidine 20 mg FCT with water.</brief_summary>
