	<brief_title>Newly Designed Fully Covered Metal Stent for the Benign Biliary Stricture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benign biliary strictures (BBS) are usually managed with plastic stents, whereas placement of uncovered metallic stents has been associated with failure related to mucosal hyperplasia. Fully covered self-expanding metal stent(FCSEMS) placement was reported as a useful method for BBS. However, stent migration was a frequent complication of CSEMS placement. Recently, flared end FCSEMS was developed to decrease stent migration, and anchoring CSEMS was newly developed.</detailed_description>
