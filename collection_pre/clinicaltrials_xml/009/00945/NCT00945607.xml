	<brief_title>Guided Relaxation Training for the Reduction of Self-Reported Stress in Individuals With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of self-reported stress in individuals with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Subjects will be randomized to either the standard of care (SOC) arm or the intervention arm. The principle investigators will be blinded to the arm assignment. The intervention utilized will be six weekly on-site GRT sessions. In addition, subjects will be provided with a CD utilizing a standardized GRT script and music for home use twice daily during the study period. During the intervention period, they will also be provided with a diary and required to keep a record of date and time of CD utilization at home. The subjects will also be required to record their stress level before and after each of the two home sessions. The sessions must be at least 4 hours apart. The SOC arm will consist of an education session with the nurse or nurse practitioner and supportive care / symptom management as needed. This group will also be required to keep a daily diary in which they record their stress levels twice daily, at intervals separated by at least 4 hours.</detailed_description>
