	<brief_summary>A diet with the multiple beneficial characteristics of whole grains and, more in general, of "healthy cereals" favorably influences glucose and insulin metabolism in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the long term effects of a diet containing "healthy cereals" versus a control diet, on glucose and insulin metabolism in subjects with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
