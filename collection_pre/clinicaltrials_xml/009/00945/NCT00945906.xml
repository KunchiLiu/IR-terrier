	<brief_summary>Congenital deficiency of factor XIII is an extremely rare inherited disorder associated with potentially life-threatening bleeding. Factor XIII Concentrate is given to patients whose blood is lacking factor XIII. Factor XIII Concentrate works by assisting blood in the usual clotting process, thereby preventing bleeding. In this study, patients will be treated with FXIII Concentrate (Human) and followed closely to determine that they receive the dose of FXIII Concentrate (Human) that will best minimize the chance of bruising and bleeding. The purpose of the study is to provide FXIII Concentrate (Human) to patients until the product becomes commercially available in the United States.</brief_summary>
