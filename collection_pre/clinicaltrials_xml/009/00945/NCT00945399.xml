	<brief_summary>CARTIPATCH® is an Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation product including functional cells in a matrix, indicated for the treatment of isolated osteocartilaginous lesions. The submitted protocol is a Phase III multicentric, prospective, controlled and randomized clinical trial, sponsored by TBF Génie Tissulaire, France. The main objective of the protocol is to compare the clinical improvement of the IKDC subjective score between the microfracture-treated group and the CARTIPATCH® chondrocyte graft-treated group , 18 months following surgery. Several secondary objectives were determined. The microfracture procedure will be conducted in one operative step, during arthroscopy and CARTIPATCH® procedure will be conducted in two operative steps: 1. Arthroscopy to collect cartilage; 2. Implantation following arthrotomy about 6 weeks following arthroscopy. Both groups will follow the same rehabilitation program.</brief_summary>
