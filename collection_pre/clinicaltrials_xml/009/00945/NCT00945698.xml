	<brief_summary>The use of lipid-based nutrients (LNS), such as Nutributter or fortified spread (FS), have been associated with improved growth and development outcomes among infants in Ghana and Malawi. Modified versions of such supplements have been developed to improve their nutrient density and quality and to lower their costs. Such modified products have proven acceptable to infants and their guardians in Malawi and Ghana. In the present trial, the investigator aim to identify the lowest growth-promoting daily dose of modified LNS. Additionally, the investigators will test a hypothesis that LNS that does not contain milk promotes growth as well as milk-containing LNS when given for 12 months at a 10-40 g daily dose to 6-18 month old infants in rural Malawi.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Linear Growth Failure in Infants and Young Children With Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (iLiNS-DOSE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six-month old healthy infants are identified through community surveys in the study area. 1920 infants meeting set criteria are randomised into receiving the following intervention between 6 and 18 months of age: 1) standard treatment from 6-18 months (i.e.no supplements, with delayed intervention between 18-30 months of age (ST-DI), 2) 10 g / day milk-containing LNS (LNS-10gM), 3) 20 g / day milk-containing LNS (LNS-20gM), 4) 20 g / day milk-free LNS (LNS-20gNoM), 5) 40 g / day milk-containing LNS, (LNS-40gM) 6) 40 g / day milk-free LNS (LNS-40gNoM). The families receive the food supplements at 2-weekly intervals and the participants undergo a morbidity evaluation weekly, a limited development assessment at 4-weekly intervals and anthropometric evaluation at 26-week intervals and laboratory analyses at enrollment and at 18 months. Growth outcome analyses are done at 18 and at 42 months of age.</detailed_description>
