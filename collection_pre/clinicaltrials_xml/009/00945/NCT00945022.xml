	<brief_summary>Following waking up from surgery performed under general anesthesia, patients are suffering from discomforting oral dryness, and moreover, they are not allowed drinking for 24 hours. The current management involves the wetting of patient's lips using wet bandage. This action is dependent on the presence of a family member or a nurse, which is not always possible. Many patients describe the oral dryness as a suffering, added to the suffering anyway entailed by surgery. The investigated Lipsus device is intended for oral wetting, relieving patient's suffering and minimizing the dependence on continuous presence next to patient's bed.</brief_summary>
