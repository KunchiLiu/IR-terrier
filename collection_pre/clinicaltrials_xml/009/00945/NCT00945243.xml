	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, prospective, outcomes study. In this study, the Zero-P PEEK implant will be used in patients undergoing ACDF for treatment of SCDD at a single level between C3 and C7. The cohort will be followed over time to twenty-four (24) months after surgery. Up to fifteen (15) sites will participate in this study. This is not a controlled study.</brief_summary>
