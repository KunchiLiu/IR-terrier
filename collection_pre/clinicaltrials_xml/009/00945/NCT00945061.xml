	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether a single dose of radiation therapy is more effective than implant radiation therapy for 5 days in treating patients with recurrent breast cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying implant radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with radiation therapy during surgery in treating patients with recurrent breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the in breast recurrence rate following repeat radiation to the breast with Mammosite® brachytherapy or intraoperative radiotherapy in patients with recurrent ipsilateral breast cancer. - To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from partial breast re-irradiation using different techniques, including both physician- and patient-rated scales. - To determine patient satisfaction of partial breast re-irradiation as it pertains to their overall treatment experience, as measured by a questionnaire. - To determine if there are patient factors which limit a patient's suitability to receive partial breast re-irradiation delivered by a particular technique. - To evaluate tylectomy wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast re-irradiation. - To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence rates. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to which modality is best suited for the patient. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. All patients undergo excisional biopsy or needle localization removal of the tumor. Patients with margins &lt; 2 mm undergo re-excision of the biopsy cavity. - Group 1: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation delivered as a single intra-operative radiation dose to the tumor bed. - Group 2: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation delivered by Mammosite® brachytherapy consisting of 10 fractions over 5 days. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month after completion of radiotherapy, and then at follow-up visits. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma of the breast (ductal, medullary, papillary, colloid [mucinous], or tubular) meeting the following criteria: Lesion size ≤ 3 cm treated with a tylectomy and whole breast irradiation (with or without tumor bed boost) Unifocal breast cancer recurrence Negative resection margins with ≥ a 2 mm margin from invasive and in situ cancer or a negative reexcision Patients with clinically and radiographically negative axillas should not undergo an axillary lymph node dissection unless they did not have prior axillary lymph node sampling (i.e., previous cancer was DCIS) No invasive lobular carcinoma, extensive lobular carcinoma in situ, extensive DCIS (≥ 3 cm), or nonepithelial breast malignancies such as lymphoma or sarcoma No multicentric carcinoma (tumors in different quadrants of the breast or tumors separated by ≥ 4 cm) No palpable or radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary, ipsilateral, or contralateral supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary lymph nodes unless these are histologically or cytologically confirmed negative No extensive intraductal component by the Harvard definition, i.e., more than 25% of the invasive tumor is DCIS and DCIS present in adjacent breast tissue No distant metastatic disease No Paget's disease of the nipple No skin involvement No known BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations Hormone receptor status not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Menopausal status not specified No collagen vascular disorders, i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or dermatomyositis No psychiatric, neurologic, or addictive disorders that would preclude study participation No other malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics At least 5 years since prior radiotherapy No chemotherapy within 2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy Concurrent hormonal therapy allowed</criteria>
