	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how well the Stereo Navigator Biopsy Accessory for the PEM Flex solo II PET Scanner works for performing breast biopsy on suspicious lesions. This study will also allow the doctors to describe the features of PEM detected lesions and the results obtained using the PEM guided biopsy and will compare the time it took to complete a pre-operative work up using PEM versus MRI in patients with a suspicious breast lesion resulting in cancer.</brief_summary>
