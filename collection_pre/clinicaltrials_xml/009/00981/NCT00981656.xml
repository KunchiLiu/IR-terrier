	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, mitomycin C, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy given together with chemotherapy works in treating patients with stage I bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the rate of freedom from radical cystectomy at 3 years. Secondary - To evaluate the rate of freedom from radical cystectomy at 5 years. - To evaluate the rate of freedom from the development of distant disease progression at 3 and 5 years. - To evaluate the rate of freedom from progression of bladder tumor to stage T2 or greater at 3 and 5 years. - To evaluate disease-specific survival and overall survival. - To evaluate the incidence of acute and late pelvic toxicity. - To evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach in preventing the recurrence of any local bladder tumor. - To evaluate the potential value of tumor histopathology plus molecular genetic, DNA content, and urine proteomics parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for tumor control with this treatment approach. - To collect American Urological Association symptom scores at baseline and at 3 years. OUTLINE: Beginning within 10 weeks of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy once daily 5 days per week during weeks 1-7 (34 fractions). Patients also receive 1 of 2 radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimens concurrently with radiotherapy. - Regimen I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1-3 of weeks 1, 3, and 5. - Regimen II: Patients receive mitomycin C IV on day 1 of radiotherapy and fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-5 of weeks 1 and 4. Patients with a persistent tumor on re-evaluation may undergo radical cystectomy. Tissue, blood, and urine samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and other analysis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) diagnosis of carcinoma of the bladder within 105 days prior to registration. Patients with operable tumors that are primary high grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder exhibiting histologic evidence of invasion into the lamina propria (disease clinical stage T1) or a high grade stage Ta urothelial carcinoma without hydronephrosis. Patients with disease involvement of the prostatic urethra with urothelial carcinoma and have no evidence of stromal invasion of the prostate. If the patient's initial tumor was a high grade Ta urothelial carcinoma then his/her recurrent tumor must be a high grade stage T1 urothelial carcinoma to be eligible. Patients must have a high grade urothelial carcinoma stage Ta or T1 that has recurred within 540 days after completion of the initial treatment (transurethral resection bladder tumor [TURBT] and intravesical bacillus CalmetteGuerin [BCG] immunotherapy) or have presented to a participating urologist who judged BCG therapy is contraindicated because this patient may be immunocompromised or because the patients refuses BCG therapy No confirmed tumorrelated hydronephrosis No pN+ or &gt; T1 disease No histologically or cytologically confirmed node metastases If radiologic evaluation of a lymph node is interpreted as "positive", this must be evaluated further either by lymphadenectomy or by percutaneous needle biopsy No evidence of distant metastases Patients for whom radical cystectomy is the standard next therapy per urologic guidelines, in the judgement of the participating urologist, are eligible Must have an adequately functioning bladder as judged by the participating urologist and radiation oncologist and have undergone a visibly complete restaging TURBT by the participating urologist that shows (or is present on the outside pathology specimen) a T1G2 or T1G3 tumor with uninvolved muscularis propria in the specimen and, if on prostatic urethral biopsy mucosal carcinoma is present, there is no evidence on biopsy in the prostatic stroma of tumor invasion PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Zubrod performance status 01 White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 4,000/mm^3 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,800/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL (transfusion or other intervention allowed) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 25 mL/min (for patients receiving cisplatin, GFR &gt; 60 mL/min) Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Able to tolerate systemic chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy and a radical cystectomy (if necessary), in the opinions of the urologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist No prior or concurrent malignancy of any other site or histology (except for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, T1a prostate cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix) unless the patient has been diseasefree for ≥ 5 years No severe, active comorbidity including any of the following: Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure that required hospitalization within the past 6 months Transmural myocardial infarction that occurred within the past 6 months Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding any study therapy at the time of registration Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects AIDS based upon the current Centers for Disease Control definition (HIV testing not required) No prior allergic reaction to cisplatin, mitomycin, or 5fluorouracil PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior systemic chemotherapy for bladder cancer Prior chemotherapy for a different cancer allowed No prior radiotherapy to the region of this cancer that would result in overlap of radiotherapy fields No concurrent drugs that have potential nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity (e.g., aminoglycoside)</criteria>
