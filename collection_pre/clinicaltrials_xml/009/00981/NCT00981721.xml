	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out to see how single and multiple doses of cediranib are handled by the body (that is how they are absorbed, broken down and got rid of from the body) by measuring levels of drug in the blood in Chinese patients with advanced solid malignancies. The study will also assess the tolerability of 20 or 30 mg cediranib in Chinese patients and how the tumour responds to treatment with cediranib.</brief_summary>
