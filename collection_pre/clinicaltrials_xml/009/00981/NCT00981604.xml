	<brief_title>Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) Versus Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, randomized clinical trial involving patients who present to the hospital with an indication for cholecystectomy. We will offer enrollment to several institutions provided they receive institutional approval. This will be a definitive trial design. Based on our operative times with SILS compared with our recent experience in standard laparoscopy, a sample size of 60 patients will give us a power of 0.8 with an Î± of 0.05. After the procedure, both groups will be managed in the same manner per routine care. They will be discharged when tolerating a regular diet and their pain is well-controlled on oral pain medication.</detailed_description>
