	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Spectra/Becker 80 Adjustable Breast Implants in women who are undergoing primary or revision breast augmentation. Safety information on the rate of complications, such as infection, will be collected and used to help determine device safety. These implants are investigational devices. Approximately 450 patients at sites across the United States will be enrolled in this research study by up to 30 sites. These patients will be implanted with Spectra/Becker 80 implant and monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spectra Breast Implant Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval Applications (PMA) and in April 1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date. A Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November 1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants. In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information. In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision subjects. Every subject implanted had to be part of an Adjunct Study, in addition to being offered participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects. The Adjunct Study devices included the round MemoryGel, Becker Expander/Prosthesis and the Lumera implants. In order to be implanted with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical trial. A PMA for Mentor's MemoryGelâ„¢ Silicone Gel-Filled breast implants (which did not include the Becker Expander/Breast Implants) was subsequently filed with FDA in December 2003, and approved in November 2006 (P030053). As a condition of approval of P030053, new enrollment in Mentor's Adjunct Study has ceased, and women no longer have access to the Becker Expander/Breast Implants or any Adjustable Gel-Filled implants. The Spectra/Becker 80 Adjustable Breast Implants were not included in the Adjunct Study. This study is designed to study the safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Spectra/Becker 80 Adjustable Breast Implants for primary breast augmentation or augmentation revision.</detailed_description>
