	<brief_summary>The National Health Service (NHS) stop smoking service at the Central Lancashire NHS Trust serves a diverse population of smokers, with a very good quit rate and high standards. However, clinical experience predicts that some clients are unlikely to succeed through the NHS smoking cessation program. This special population has difficulty quitting for a variety of reasons. Some relapse over the course of the following two years and return repeatedly to the service. Others, for instance those with health problems, may be highly motivated to quit, but unable to resist their cravings. The purpose of this study is to determine if EFT makes a difference in quit rates with the most challenging population of clients.</brief_summary>
