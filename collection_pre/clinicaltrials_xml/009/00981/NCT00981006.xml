	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy on the transplantation of autologous human cardiac-derived stem cells (hCSCs) with the controlled release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to severe refractory heart failure patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy concordance with reduced left ventricular dysfunction (15%≦LVEF≦35%).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autologous human stem or progenitor cells of different lineage have been subjected to clinical trials in the past to treat patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although human stem or progenitor cells transplantation had functional benefits in the recovery in experimental myocardial infarction, the major barrier limiting its clinical application is the death of the most of the transplanted cells and poor cardiac differentiation in the host environment. Using the identical technique as clonally cell isolation from experimental animals, we generated human cardiac-derived stem cell (hCSC) enriched Es-marker genes with mesenchymal features. hCSCs included in cell populations accelerating proliferation in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on plastic plates are generated from human heart tissues through endomyocardial biopsy. Giving a patient their own hCSCs is an investigational procedure that has been approved by the committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan for this study. hCSCs have excellent potential to proliferate and regenerate to cardiomyocyte compared with other cells, e.g. myoblasts, bone marrow mononuclear cells and bone marrow stem cells, already evaluated in preliminary experiments on the repair of injured heart muscle. bFGF possesses properties to promote stem cell proliferation, and formation of sufficient microvascular network created by bFGF is critical for long-term survival of transplanted donor cells. This will be the first trial on the use of autologous hCSCs for the treatment of refractory heart failure with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. This trial is translational pilot study for looking into the safety and efficacy on the use of autologous hCSCs with the controlled release of bFGF using a gelatin hydrogel sheet.</detailed_description>
