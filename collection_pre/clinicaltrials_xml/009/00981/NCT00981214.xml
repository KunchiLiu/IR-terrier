	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aptalis' (formerly Eurand) pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) microtabs in pediatric participants under age 7 with cystic fibrosis (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pancreatic Enzyme Product in Pediatric Participants With Cystic Fibrosis and Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study sample will consist of evaluable participants, all of whom will be children younger than 7 years of age. Participants will receive EUR-1008 (APT-1008) Microtabs formulation. The study design involves a 4-day screening period, a 7-day dose stabilization period, and a 7-day treatment period (excluding an end-of-study evaluation). The optimal dose of EUR-1008 (APT-1008) Microtabs, determined during the dose stabilization period, will be used during the treatment period. Participants are instructed to consume a predefined diet.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants less than 7 years of age Participants who have pancreatic insufficiency documented by a fecal elastase level less than 100 micrograms per gram (mcg/g), or if not documented, the fecal elastase test must be done at the screening visit Participants who have a need of de novo treatment with pancreatic enzymes or be able to be switched from an existing treatment Participants who have a body mass index greater than the twenty fifth percentile for children 2 years and older Participants with a weight for height index greater than the twenty fifth percentile for children less than 2 years of age Participants with diagnosis of CF based upon the following criteria: Have 2 clinical features consistent with CF and Have either a genotype with 2 identifiable mutations consistent with CF or a sweat chloride concentration that is more than 60 milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L) by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis Participants who are clinically stable with no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection Participants with fibrosing colonopathy Participants allergic to pork or other porcine PEPs Participants with any respiratory condition that in the investigator's opinion would result in an intervention requiring hospitalization or intensive pulmonary treatment during the trial Participants with any acute systemic administration of an antibiotic for any reason in the previous 4 weeks; however, a low stable dose of an antibiotic (such as azithromycin 250 or 500 milligram [mg] up to 3 times per week) is allowed. Moreover, chronic treatment (that is, daily for at least 1 month) with an inhalatory antibiotic (for example, colistin, tobramycin, or ceftazidime) is allowed Participants who have hepatic insufficiency as defined by a history or presence of ascites, or a serum albumin level of less than 3.0 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL), or coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio that is greater than 1.7 Participants with hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria Participants participating in an investigational study of a drug, biologic, or device not currently approved for marketing within 30 days prior to screening visit Participants with history of or current screening evaluation of hyperglycemia as defined by an 8hour fasting serum glucose equivalent to 126 mg/dL or more, or of cysticfibrosisrelated diabetes as determined according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Consensus Conference of January 1999 (Section IX Part II), that is: Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) greater than126 mg/dl (7.0 milli mole [mM]) on two or more occasions FBG greater than 126 mg/dl (7 .0 mM) plus casual (without regard to time of day or last meal consumed) glucose level greater than200 mg/dl (11.1 mM) Casual (previously called random) glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mM) on two or more occasions with symptoms Participants with any solid organ transplant or surgery affecting the bowel Participants using an enzyme preparation in excess of 10,000 lipase units/kg/day Participants with an acute dose of any steroid in the previous 2 weeks; however, low chronic doses of a steroid (less 0.5 mg/kg every other day) will be allowed Participants with any condition that would, in the investigator's opinion, limit the patient's ability to complete the study Participants with history of or current screening determination of distal ileal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), or any clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of DIOS (that is, constipation, abdominal pain, anorexia, early satiety, recurrent vomiting and palpable fecal mass) on physical examination Participants who are unable to discontinue excluded concomitant medications over the course of the study</criteria>
