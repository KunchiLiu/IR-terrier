	<brief_summary>Nelarabine has shown significant activity in patients with T-cell malignancies. This study will determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the combination of nelarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with first bone marrow relapse of T-ALL, or first relapse of T-LL.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients to be enrolled in the doseescalation portion of this study must have Tcell ALL or Tcell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) in first relapse or must have failed primary induction chemotherapy (ie, never attained a complete remission following an initial course of standard therapy for TALL or TLL). Patients to be enrolled in the cohort expansion portion of this study (ie, those treated at the recommended phase 2 dose) must have Tcell ALL in first relapse or must have failed primary induction chemotherapy (ie, never attained a complete remission following an initial course of standard therapy for TALL). TLL patients are not eligible for the cohort expansion phase. Patients with Tcell ALL must have greater than 25% blasts in the bone marrow with or without extramedullary disease. Patients with Tcell LL must have recurrent disease, documented by clinical or radiographic criteria, as well as histologic verification of the malignancy at original diagnosis. Patients with Tcell LL enrolled in the phase I doseescalation study are not required to have measurable disease; however, patients enrolled in the phase II cohort expansion at the MTD must have measurable disease. Patients may have CNS 1 or CNS 2 disease but not CNS 3. ECOG 02 or Karnofsky ≥ 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age; Lansky ≥ 50% for patients ≤16 years of age. Patients may be enrolled on study regardless of the timing of prior Intrathecal therapy; however, they MAY NOT BEGIN TREATMENT ON THIS PROTOCOL UNTIL A MINIMUM OF 7 DAYS HAS ELAPSED SINCE PRIOR INTRATHECAL THERAPY. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed since administration of nitrosureas. At least 12 weeks must have elapsed since administration of craniospinal or hemipelvic radiation. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test confirmed within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Female patients with infants must agree not to breastfeed their infants while on this study. Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of contraception approved by the investigator during the study and for a minimum of 6 months after study treatment. Adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age. If the serum creatinine is above these values, the calculated creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR must be ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73m2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN for age. If the total bilirubin is elevated, patient will still be eligible if the conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin ≤ ULN for age. ALT ≤ 5x ULN of normal for age. Adequate cardiac function defined as shortening fraction of ≥ 27% by echocardiogram or ejection fraction ≥ 45% by gated radionuclide study. No evidence of dyspnea at rest No exercise intolerance A pulse oximetry ≥ 94% at sea level (≥ 90% at altitude ≥ 5000 feet) if there is clinical indication for determination. Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must be capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the study. All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent. Patients with Down syndrome are excluded. Patients with preexisting Grade 2 (or greater) peripheral motor or sensory neurotoxicity per the CTCAE 3.0 as determined by the treating physician or a neurologist. Patients with a history of prior venoocclusive disease (VOD) or findings consistent with a diagnosis of VOD, defined as: conjugated serum bilirubin &gt;1.4 mg/dL AND unexplained weight gain greater than 10% of baseline weight or ascites AND hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain without another explanation, OR reversal of portal vein flow on ultrasound, OR pathological confirmation of VOD on liver biopsy. Previous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation. Patients with a prior seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsant therapy are not eligible to receive nelarabine. For the purposes of this study, this includes any patient that has received anticonvulsant therapy to prevent/treat seizures in the prior two years. Positive blood culture within 48 hours of study enrollment. Fever above 38.2 within 48 hours of study enrollment with clinical signs of infection. Plan to administer nonprotocol chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy during the study period. Any significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up, or interpretation of study results.</criteria>
