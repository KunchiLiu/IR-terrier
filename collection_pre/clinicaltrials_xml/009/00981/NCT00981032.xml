	<brief_summary>The investigators' aim is to implement an intervention to increase aspirin prophylaxis use among patients that is patient initiated, optimizes use of physician and staff time, appropriately compensates staff, provides clinicians with tools necessary for managing aspiring prophylaxis, and ensures continuous management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Aspirin Use Among Adults at Risk for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention addresses a fundamental question of how clinicians need to be directly involved in motivating behavior change (i.e., aspirin prophylaxis). While complex behavior change likely demands high levels of involvement, a single simple action (aspirin prophylaxis) may not require such complex interactions. We propose to compare the effectiveness of three models of care in a rigorous randomized controlled trial that will consist of a 3-arm, within-clinic design in which patients will be randomized to either the physician-initiated, the patient-initiated model, or to a control group in which usual care is delivered. In a patient-initiated model, patients are active participants in their own care and receive a pre-visit summary that contains an individualized risk assessment and patient education. In the physician-initiated model, patients receive the pre-visit summary and the physician uses a clinical decision support tool through the electronic health record that details the patient risk of CVD. The specific aims of the proposed work are to compare the reliability and overall effectiveness of two different methods for motivating patients to take aspirin to prevent stroke and heart attacks as well as to develop a plan for translating the intervention into a process that is suitable for a paper-based clinic.</detailed_description>
