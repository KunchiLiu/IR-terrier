	<brief_title>Steroids After Laser Trabeculoplasty for Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SLT is used to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma, but it is not know whether the choice of eyedrops administered in the post-operative period affects SLT efficacy. Practitioners commonly use steroid drops, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drops, or no drops at all. This is a randomized, single-center, prospective, masked clinical trial to determine whether the choice of eyedrop affects efficacy of SLT in glaucoma patients.</detailed_description>
