	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to study the effects of three forms of bariatric surgery: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Gastric Banding. The surgery is not part of the clinical trial. If your insurance does not cover the procedure, then you are responsible for payment of the surgical process. We are doing pre and post surgery testing to provide a better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on metabolic function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucose Homeostasis Pre and Post Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery is the most effective weight loss therapy for obesity. Moreover, the early improvement in insulin sensitivity and the resolution of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery has led to the hypothesis that bariatric surgery has specific beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis beyond weight loss alone. However, this hypothesis has never been adequately evaluated in human subjects. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to provide a better understanding of the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on insulin action and pancreatic beta cell function.</detailed_description>
