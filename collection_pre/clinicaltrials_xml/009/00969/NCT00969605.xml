	<brief_summary>Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a closed loop ventilation mode that can act both as pressure support (PSV) and pressure controlled (PCV) ventilation. Weaning with ASV shows promising results mainly in post-cardiac surgery patients. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to test the hypothesis that weaning with ASV could reduce the weaning duration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when compared with PSV.</brief_summary>
