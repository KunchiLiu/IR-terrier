	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Sertraline After Low Dose Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open, one arm, single sequence, 3-period, dose escalating study for healthy volunteers are investigated. Ten subjects may be enrolled. Subjects receive baseline [11C] sertraline PET. Period 1 Subjects receive 5 mg of sertraline every day. After 6 day of medication, pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed. Period 2 Subjects receive 25 mg of sertraline every day. After 6 day of medication, pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed. Period 3 Subjects receive 50 mg of sertraline every day. After 6 day of medication, pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed.</detailed_description>
