	<brief_summary>Once a child has been anaesthetised and is fully asleep, a special airway tube called a laryngeal mask is often inserted into their mouth to help with their breathing. This tube is removed just before the child wakes up. A new type of airway tube, called an i-gel airway, has been developed for children, which is hoped will be easier to insert, safer once in position, and will be less likely to cause a sore throat after the anaesthetic than a standard laryngeal mask. The adult i-gel airway has been available for adults since 2007, and early trials have shown very encouraging results.</brief_summary>
