	<brief_summary>Introduction: Human face with its bony and muscular structures has singular and peculiar characteristics. It may be classified in three types, associated with the variation of shape and craniofacial configuration, both in vertical and horizontal planes, directly affecting dental occlusion, face harmony, orofacial musculature and oral functions. Aim: to correlate cephalometric with anthropometric and facial analysis findings on determining the facial type. Method: 105 leukoderm adults were involved, 34 male and 71 female aging between 20 and 40 years old. Data were collected in December 2006 in an orthodontic clinic located at Belo Horizonte- MG, Brazil. Cephalometric findings to determinate facial types were compared to seven anthropometric facial measurements, three anthropometric facial proportions and three anthropometric facial indices, in addition to facial type identification through clinical facial analysis of photographs.</brief_summary>
