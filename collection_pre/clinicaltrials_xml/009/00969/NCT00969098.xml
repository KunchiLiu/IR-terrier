	<brief_summary>Recently, a few small trials have shown promising results on value of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography imaging in response assessment in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma. These studies considered different parameters in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) analysis, mainly the standardized uptake value and volume-based parameters such as total glycolytic volume.</brief_summary>
