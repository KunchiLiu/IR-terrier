	<brief_summary>Observations in patients with growth hormone (GH)-disturbances have suggested that GH/IGF-I might have anti-inflammatory effects. To elucidate this hypothesis the investigators have planned a study to investigate if 3 weeks administration of GH and subsequently the GH antagonist Pegvisomant (or vice versa) influence serum levels of different inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Between the Growth Hormone (GH)- Insulin Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) System and the Inflammatory System in Healthy Normal Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate if administration of 3 weeks og GH (10-30 microgram/kg/day) and subsequent Pegvisomant (10-15 mg/day) influence serum concentrations of the inflammatory variables Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitive CRP (hsCRP) and the newly discovered acute phase protein YKL-40. The study involves 12 healthy volunteers age from 22-65 years.</detailed_description>
