	<brief_summary>This study will examine the relationship between free radicals in the saliva and periodontitis. 30 adults, 15 with periodontitis and 15 as a control group will give a sample of saliva before treatment and after treatment. The investigators will examine the free radicals in both groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Periodontal Treatment on the Level of Free Radicals in the Saliva</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease is a chronic adult condition. Bacteria implicated in the etiology of this disease causes destruction of connective tissue and bone. As a result of stimulation by bacterial antigen PMN produces free radicals via respiratory burst as a part of host response to infection. Free radicals can be defined as molecules or molecular fragments with an unpaired electron which imparts certain characteristics to the free radicals such as reactivity . Reactive free radicals are able to produce chemical modifications and to damage proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleotides in the tissues.</detailed_description>
