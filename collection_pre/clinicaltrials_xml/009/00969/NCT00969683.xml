	<brief_summary>Most teams use a left double-lumen tube. The double-lumen tube is available with or without a carinal hook. The hook is supposed to facilitate the positioning of the tube and avoid the mobilization of the tube during surgery. The use of double-lumen tubes with a hook is large in Europe and quite unknown in US. The literature is poor, containing only few case reports. The purpose of this research is to compare the two types of left double-lumen tube.</brief_summary>
