	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to identify baseline and early predictors of favorable and unfavorable response to lifestyle intervention. As a secondary objective, the investigators would like to validate our questionnaire or other identified predictors as clinical tools to guide us in selection of the most suitable candidates for lifestyle intervention programs. Assuming the same capacity of our questionnaire to predict an absence of weight loss (â‰¥5%) or a loss to follow-up (likelihood ratio for a positive test, LR+ = 9.9), 70 subjects need to be included in this study in order to find a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval above 2.0 for this LR+, which is the limit of an acceptable test. The investigators will enroll participants with pre-diabetes and BMI 27-40 in our program and administer to them at baseline and at 3 months the designed questionnaire, as well as other already well validated questionnaires assessing state of change and readiness to implement diet or exercise modifications.</brief_summary>
