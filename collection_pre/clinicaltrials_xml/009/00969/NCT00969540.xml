	<brief_title>Trial on the Effect of Optically Modified Fiber Mattress Covers on Sleep Disturbances in Patients With Chronic Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is commonly observed that sleep in its quantity and quality is influenced by the type of mattress used at night. A recent study in patients with back pain showed that waterbeds and foam mattresses did influence back symptoms, function and sleep more positively than did a hard mattress. Pain improves with airbeds compared to regular innerspring mattresses. This study will analyze the effect of optically active particles mattress covers on sleep. The researcher is interested in learning if regular mattress or the study mattress cover (containing optically modified polyethylene terephthalate fiber mattress cover) is more useful in helping back pain and sleep quality.</detailed_description>
