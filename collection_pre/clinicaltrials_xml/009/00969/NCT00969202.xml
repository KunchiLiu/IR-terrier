	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate a short course of very focused (stereotactic) external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of early stage prostate cancer. The investigators will gather scientific information about the tolerance and side effects this type of radiation. The investigators will then compare these results with those of standard 8 week course of external beam radiation therapy to see if this study treatment is equally or more effective in treating prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
