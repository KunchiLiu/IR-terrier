	<brief_summary>This is a prospective single-center randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of PV cryoablation with the Arctic Front® catheter versus the standard PV isolation using radiofrequency irrigated tip catheters. The efficacy of both strategies will be evaluated from a clinical point of view and from the detection and quantification of AF episodes by means of the Reveal XT® implantable loop recorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryoenergy Or Radiofrequency for Pulmonary Vein Isolation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using a radiofrequency catheter is the most widespread technique for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. These procedures are difficult and time-consuming, because they require precise catheter manipulation and multiple radiofrequency applications. Thus, alternative techniques are being investigated to simplify the procedure. Recently, a cryoenergy balloon catheter has been developed for PV isolation (Arctic Front®, Cryocath Technologies). When this catheter is deployed at the PV antrum, it can create a circumferential lesion around the PV ostium by delivering a single cryoenergy application. An implantable loop recorder for AF detection has been made available (Reveal XT®, Medtronic). It may help taking clinical decisions regarding anticoagulant and antiarrhythmic therapy and, at the same time, it may be a powerful tool to evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies. This is a prospective single-center randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of PV cryoablation with the Arctic Front® catheter vs. the standard PV isolation using radiofrequency irrigated tip catheters. The efficacy of both strategies will be evaluated from a clinical point of view and from the detection and quantification of AF episodes by means of the Reveal XT® implantable loop recorder.</detailed_description>
