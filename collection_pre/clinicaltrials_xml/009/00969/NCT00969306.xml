	<brief_title>Chloroquine as an Anti-Autophagy Drug in Stage IV Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor hypoxia is a well-known factor negatively influencing outcome in many solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer. Hypoxic cells are more radio-resistant, more chemo-resistant and more prone to develop distant metastases than normoxic cells. One of the mechanisms responsible for survival of these therapy-resistant hypoxic cells is (macro-)autophagy: a phenomenon in which cells provide themselves with energy (ATP) by digesting their own cell-organelles. Chloroquine is a potent blocker of autophagy and has been demonstrated in a lab setting to dramatically enhance tumor response to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and even anti-hormonal therapy. Thus, chloroquine might very well be able to increase overall survival in small cell lung cancer by sensitizing cells resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed ``extensive disease`` (Stage T04 N03 M1) small cell lung cancer At least one measurable disease site, defined as lesion of ≥ 1 cm unidimensionally on CTscan. WHO performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count at least 1800/µl and platelets at least 100000/µl and hemoglobin at least 6.2 mmol/l. Calculated creatinine clearance at least 60 ml/min Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution; ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the institution (in case of liver metastases ≤ 5 x ULN for the institution) No previous platinum chemotherapy or topoisomeraseinhibitors for SCLC. Life expectancy more than 6 months Willing and able to comply with the study prescriptions 18 years or older Not pregnant or breast feeding and willing to take adequate contraceptive measures during the study Ability to give and having given written informed consent before patient registration No mixed pathology, e.g. nonsmall cell plus small cell cancer No recent (&lt; 3 months) severe cardiac disease (NYHA class &gt;1) (congestive heart failure, infarction) No history of cardiac arrythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia) which is symptomatic and requiring treatment (CTC AE 4.0), or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation controlled on medication is allowed. No cardiac conduction disturbances or medication potentially causing them: QTc interval prolongation with other medications that required discontinuation of the treatment Congenital long QTsyndrome or unexplained sudden death of first degree relative under 40 years of age QTc interval &gt; 480 msec (note: when this is the case on screening ECG, the ECG may be repeated twice. If the average QTinterval of these 3 measurements remains below 480 msec, patient is eligible) Patients on medication potentially prolongating the QTinterval are excluded if the QTinterval is &gt; 460 msec (Appendix, table 2). Medication that might cause QTprolongation or Torsades de pointes tachycardia is not allowed (Appendix, Table 1). Drugs with a risk of prolongating the QTinterval that cannot be discontinued are allowed, however, under close monitoring by the treating physician (Appendix, table 2). No uncontrolled infectious disease No other active malignancy No major surgery (excluding diagnostic procedures like e.g., mediastinoscopy) in previous 4 weeks No treatment with investigational drugs in 4 weeks prior to or during this study No chronic systemic immune therapy No known G6PD deficiency The opposite of the above</criteria>
