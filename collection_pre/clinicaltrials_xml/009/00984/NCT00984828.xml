	<brief_summary>The is a randomized control study for newly-diagnosed myeloma patients 18-65 year old. All patients will receive 4 cycles of velcade and Dexamethasone as front-line therapy. Then patients will be randomized into standard group which will receive a single autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with standard conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2 and the study group which will receive single autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2 + velcade followed by 3 more cycles of velcade alone as consolidation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The is a randomized control study for newly-diagnosed myeloma patients 18-65 year old. Newly-diagnosed myeloma patient enrolled will receive 4 cycles of velcade and Dexamethasone as front-line induction therapy. All patients finished the induction therapy will be randomized into standard group and the study group. All patients will mobilized by cyclophosphamide with G-CSF to collect a target of 2x106 CD34+/kg and then undergo autologous stem cell transplantation. For standard group, patients will receive single auto-SCT with standard conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2. The patients in the study group will receive single auto-SCT with conditioning of melphalan 200mg/m2 added with 4 dose of velcade at 1.0mg/m2 during the transplantation procedure and then followed by 3 more cycles of velcade alone as consolidation.</detailed_description>
