	<brief_summary>rTMS is a promising, though largely untested, option for treating adolescent and young adult depression. This study hypothesizes that rTMS will safely and significantly alleviate depression and decrease suicidal ideation in adolescents and young adults based on previous studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS for Adolescents and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After signing consent and undergoing a thorough screening, participants will be administered rTMS 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks (a total of 20 sessions) as an add-on to their current antidepressant regime. Adolescents must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. We will monitor for depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation over the 4 weeks as well as 1 week following the last rTMS administration using rating scales. These scales will be given once a week, on Fridays, and will require roughly 40 minutes to complete. TMS sessions will last approximately 25 minutes each.</detailed_description>
