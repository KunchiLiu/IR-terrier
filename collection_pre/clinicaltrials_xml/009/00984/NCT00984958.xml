	<brief_title>Bulkamid Treatment of Stress Incontinence in Women With Urinary Stress Incontinence and Not Suitable to TVT-procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to investigate the effect of Bulkamid injection for women with urinary stress incontinence and not suitable to TVT-procedure because of suspected ISD and compare this treatment with no or traditional treatment. The primary endpoint for efficacy will be reduction of leakage during pad-test at 2 months compared with pad- test before injection. Secondary endpoints will be patient satisfaction measured at both 2 and 12 months using a questionnaire and the number of side effects.</detailed_description>
