	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Avotermin (Juvista) in Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were to receive two 1cm incisions on the upper, inner aspect of each arm (four wounds per subject). On Day 0 all subjects received intradermal Juvista at a concentration of 50ng/100ul to one incision site on Arm 1 and 5ng/100ul to one incision site on Arm 2. The other incision sites were injected with placebo. Following injection, 1cm incision wounds were made at each site. On Day 1 all subjects were re-injected with 100ul/cm intradermal Juvista or placebo to each side of the wound (200ul per incision) at the same concentration as for Day 0 (50 or 5ng/100ul). At month 6 all incision sites were excised for histological analysis and all excision sites injected with Juvista. Both sites on Arm 1 received 50ng/100ul/linear cm wound margin and both sites on Arm 2 received 5ng/100ul/linear cm wound margin. No excision sites received placebo. The appearance of excision scars was then assessed after 2, 4 and 6 months of healing i.e at months 8, 10 and 12 of the study.</detailed_description>
