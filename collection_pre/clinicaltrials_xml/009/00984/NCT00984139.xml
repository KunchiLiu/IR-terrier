Adolescents living in institutional care. Planned administration /administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before HBV vaccine challenge and ending 30 days after. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding HBV vaccine challenge or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the HBV vaccine challenge.. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the challenge dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.
