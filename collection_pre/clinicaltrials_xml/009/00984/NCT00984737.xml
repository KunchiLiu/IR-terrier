	<brief_summary>Newly diagnosed hyperglycemia (NDH) and stress hyperglycemia (SH) during acute illness is reported as a non-physiological condition in hospitals. The investigators aim is to determine the rate of NDH and SH among cases admitted to coronary ICU with acute coronary disease and to inquire the relationship of SH with disease severity and functional outcomes such as longevity of ICU stay.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with acute coronary heart disease admitted to the emergency room will be recruited consecutively. Admission plasma glucose (APG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG); the first morning after admission, measurements will be obtained and each participant will be subjected to capillary glucose measurement (CGM) every six hours within the first day. Patients will be separated into 4 groups: GROUP 1: Normoglycemic cases GROUP 2: Newly diagnosed hyperglycemic cases Group 2a: Unrecognized diabetes, hbA1c: &gt;6.0% Group 2b: Stress hyperglycemia &lt;6.0%. GROUP 3: Known diabetes Age, gender, co-morbidities on admission, adverse outcomes in hospital, duration of stay in coronary ICU, deaths, drugs, and glucose levels will be all recorded. Throughout the hospital stay of Group 2 and Group 3, CGMs were performed and treated when necessary (target glucose&lt;180mg/dl). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II); a severity of disease classification system was used for each case.</detailed_description>
