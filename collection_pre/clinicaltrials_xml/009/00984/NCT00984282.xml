	<brief_summary>Trial of sorafenib versus placebo in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to radioiodine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NexavarÂ® Versus Placebo in Locally Advanced/Metastatic RAI-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to sorafenib 800 mg daily or matching placebo. Progression was assessed every 8 weeks by modified RECIST criteria. Subjects had the option to unblind study treatment after progression and to receive open label sorafenib regardless of initial treatment assignment. Following discontinuation of study treatment, subjects were followed for survival every 3 months in long-term follow-up. Subjects who terminated study treatment (either double only or double blind and open label) for reasons other than death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawn entered long-term follow up</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular and Hurthle cell) Poorly differentiated and other thyroid variants (e.g. insular, tall cell, etc.) are eligible provided that the histology has no medullary differentiation nor anaplastic features Progression within 14 months (RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors] should be used as a basis for the assessment of disease progression) RAI (radioactive iodine) refractory Histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer other than differentiated (i.e. like anaplastic and medullary carcinoma, lymphoma or sarcoma) Prior anticancer treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (licensed or investigational) that target VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) or VEGF Receptors or other targeted agents Prior anticancer treatment for thyroid cancer with use of chemotherapy (low dose chemotherapy for radiosensitization is allowed) or Thalidomide or any of its derivatives</criteria>
