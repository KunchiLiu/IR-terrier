	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at a biomarker, 11-dh-TXB2, in blood and urine samples from patients with prostate cancer and healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker 11-dh-TXB2 in Blood and Urine Samples From Patients With Prostate Cancer and Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify a potential novel marker of prostate cancer in the blood and urine, 11-dh-TXB2, to be used as a screening tool for prostate cancer as well as in detection of early relapse in patients previously treated for early-stage prostate cancer. OUTLINE: Blood and urine samples are collected and analyzed for plasma and urinary 11-dh-TXB2 levels by HPLC and tandem-mass spectrometry.</detailed_description>
