	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea is common among Veterans with cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]), leads to hypertension, and is associated with recurrent stroke and death. Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) safely treats sleep apnea, few Veterans with cerebrovascular disease are diagnosed with sleep apnea or offered treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project sought to evaluate whether a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention strategy among Veterans with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension using unattended polysomnography and auto-titrating CPAP with a targeted adherence evaluation and educational protocol resulted in: an improved rate of diagnosed sleep apnea, an improved rate of treated sleep apnea, and improved blood pressure control.</detailed_description>
