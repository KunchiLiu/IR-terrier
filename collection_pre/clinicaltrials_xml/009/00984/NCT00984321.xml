	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether psychoeducation counseling for older cancer patients undergoing treatment is feasible and worthwhile. The investigators will test this in a group or individual phone counseling format. Many cancer patients seek counseling to help with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. This geriatric-specific psychoeducation is intended to help older cancer patients cope with the burden of cancer and aging. The purpose of this study is to see if this type of counseling helps reduce depressive symptoms, anxiety, perception of loneliness and isolation. In addition this counseling aims to improve coping and quality of life (QOL). Individuals who choose not to take part in the intervention study will be asked if they are willing to participate in a brief refusal sub study. The purpose of the refusal substudy is to compare levels of distress in patients that choose to participate and those that decline. This will yield valuable data that will help us distinguish between patients that decline due to lack of interest in research and those that decline due to high levels of distress. Participation in the refusal sub study consists of completion of 2 brief questionnaires.</brief_summary>
