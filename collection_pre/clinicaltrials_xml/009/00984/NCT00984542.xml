	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bendamustine works as second- or third-line therapy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer treated with second- or third-line bendamustine. Secondary - To determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - To determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bendamustine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks.</detailed_description>
