	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to correlate accurate fluoroscopic measurement of gastric band stoma diameter with patient symptoms for optimal band stoma adjustment. Administration of a barium tablet to gastric band patients with dilute liquid barium allows the accurate measurement of the band stoma diameter. The technique is quick, easy to perform, and eliminates magnification error intrinsic to fluoroscopy. The study data suggests the optimal calibrated gastric band stoma diameter is 3.0 mm. The accurate fluoroscopic measurement of gastric band stoma diameter can optimize band stoma adjustment and improve patient outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ten patients presenting for an upper GI series with laparoscopically placed gastric bands were enrolled after informed consent. After a standard upper GI evaluation, oral administration of a standard 13 mm barium sulfate tablet was performed and swallowed with dilute liquid barium during fluoroscopic monitoring. A spot radiograph was obtained once the barium tablet was in the gastric pouch and the dilute liquid barium was passing through the gastric band stoma. Post-processing software used the longest radiographic dimension of the 13 mm barium tablet as the size reference to calibrate measurement of the gastric band stoma diameter.</detailed_description>
