	<brief_title>Aquacel Versus Iodoform Gauze for Filling Abscess Cavity Following Incision and Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The large increase in the incidence of skin and soft tissue infections cause by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has produced a corresponding increase in the number of ED patients presenting with abscesses that require incision and drainage. This study compares Aquacel against routine Iodoform packing for packing abscess cavities after incision and drainage. It is hypothesized that Aquacel will produce speedier healing of the abscess. More effective abscess healing will reduce the need for oral antibiotic coverage, which will in turn reduce the potential for drug resistance caused by indiscriminate use of oral antibiotics.</detailed_description>
