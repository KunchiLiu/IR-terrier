	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to measure the inspiratory flow that the different patient groups (asthmatic children, adults and elderly, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients) generate through empty Easyhaler (two versions) and Turbuhaler inhalers. In addition, the handling and acceptability of the inhalers will be compared in asthmatic children.</brief_summary>
