	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Composite Cancellous and Demineralized Bone Plug (CR-Plug) for Repair of Knee Osteochondral Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this double arm study is to test the ability of an allograft plug to provide "successful" repair of less than (&lt;) 2.5 cm2 osteochondral defect in a low-load-bearing femoral condyle region, and a high-load-bearing femoral-condyle region.</detailed_description>
