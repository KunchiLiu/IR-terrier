	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: The prognosis of patients with advanced esophageal cancer may be improved by preoperative chemoradiation. But only those patients have a benefit from this additional therapy, whose tumor shows a response after chemoradiation. Molecular markers may help to identify before starting the therapy those patients who response. PURPOSE: This is the first prospective, clinical trial to study the impact of ERCC1 to predict histopathological response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RTx/CTx) in patients with cancer of the esophagus.</brief_summary>
