	<brief_summary>Aripiprazole has been approved by the FDA for augmenting ineffective/partially effective oral antidepressant therapy in patients suffering from major depression. The mechanism by which this augmentation is achieved is not known. This study has been designed to test the hypothesis that the primary mechanism of action of aripiprazole antidepressant augmentation through the dopaminergic pathway. Two positron emission tomography (PET) scan procedures and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be used to test this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroimaging Of Treatment Effects in Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an eighteen week study including a two week taper off period. Forty five subjects will be started on 10mg escitalopram then titered to 20mg plus placebo. After 10 weeks of treatment, those subjects who do not respond to the escitalopram, as defined by a 50% reduction in their MADRS score, will be started on adjunctive aripiprazole at 2mg, titered to 10mg. Subjects will remain on the both the escitalopram and aripiprazole for 6 weeks. At week 10 prior to starting the adjunctive aripiprazole and week 16 (end of treatment) the subjects will receive the PET and MRI scans. The neuroimaging will consist of fMRI, a raclopride PET scan, and a fluoro-dopa PET scan. Ten normal control subjects will undergo one set of scans (fMRI,raclopride and FOPA PET scans) to use as comparison group.</detailed_description>
