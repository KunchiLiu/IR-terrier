	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of giving ketoconazole, hydrocortisone and dutasteride (KHAD) with lapatinib. The investigators believe that there is evidence in castrate resistant prostate cancer that two growth factor receptors (EGFr and Her 2 /neu )are increased in prostate cancer cells. Both these receptors are turned off by the drug lapatinib. By adding lapatinib to this trial, the investigators hope that the investigators can turn off the signaling from the receptors and therefore make the participant's cancer more responsive to KHAD treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- For the initial four weeks of the study, participants will receive the drugs ketoconazole, dutasteride and hydrocortisone daily (KHAD treatment). Ketoconazole will be taken orally three times a day, hydrocortisone will be taken orally twice a day and dutasteride will be taken orally once a day. - During the 3rd or 4th week of KHAD treatment participants will undergo a CT-guided bone biopsy. - After completion of 4 weeks on KHAD treatment, participants will start taking lapatinib along with KHAD starting from week 5. Lapatinib is taken orally once a day. - During the 3rd or 4th week of KHAD and Lapatinib (KHLAD) treatment, participants will undergo a CT-guided bone biopsy.</detailed_description>

Patients on bicalutamide must have discontinued this medication for at least 6 weeks to be eligible Patients receiving bisphosphonate can be maintained on this therapy No major surgery or radiation therapy within 4 weeks No strontium89 or samarium153 therapy within 4 weeks ECG showing normal QT interval No thromboembolism in past 6 months Age &gt; 18 years Investigator must check current patient medications against the list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers prior to registration Echocardiogram or MUGA demonstrating ejection fraction within institutional normal limits No previous therapy with lapatinib No previous therapy with ketoconazole within 3 months of starting trial The use of complementary therapy directed at prostate cancer treatment excluding the following: green tea, commercial multivitamin preparations. Vitamin B complex, C, D, E and multivitamins are permitted if these are being taken at less than 3 times the RDA The concomitant use of drugs known to be narrow therapeutic index CYP3A4 substrates are excluded Drugs that are sensitive to CYP3A4 substrates are excluded Patients taking drugs that may further prolong QT intervals and present a known risk for Torsades de Pointes are excluded. Patients who have alcohol or drug dependence currently or in the last 6 months are excluded from this study Any other events, other than those defined above, in the opinion of the investigator, may make the patient ineligible for this trial No contraindication to biopsy such as bleeding disorders. Patients on anticoagulants such as warfarin must be able to safely stop the drug for a threeday period. Patients may not go on heparin during this time No active malignancy other than skin cancer or superficial bladder cancer Cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA. Patients must no have unstable angina or new onset angina or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients must have an ejection fraction within normal limits at the enrolling institution based on an echocardiogram Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained BP &gt; 160 and diastolic &gt; 100 despite optimal medical management Known HIV or chronic Hep B or C Thrombolic or embolic events such as CVA within the last 6 months Pulmonary hemorrhage or any bleeding event CTCAE Grade 2 or greater within 6 months of first dose of study drug of KHAD Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Evidence of history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first study drug of KHAD</criteria>
