	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were aged 12 years or older and were homozygous for the F508del-CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation. Ivacaftor is a potent and selective CFTR potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein. Potentiators are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties of the channel in the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigated the effects of ivacaftor in participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) &gt;=12 years of age with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;=40 percent (%) predicted. This study was conducted in 2 parts. - Part A of this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group evaluation of participants with CF who were aged 12 years or older and were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. - Part B of this study was an open-label extension of Part A, enrolling participants who completed Part A and met pre-specified endpoint criteria, and explored the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor over long-term treatment in participants with CF aged 12 years or older who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.</detailed_description>
