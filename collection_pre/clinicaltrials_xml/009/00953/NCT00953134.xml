	<brief_title>Periconceptional Iron Supplementation in Rural Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2007, the National Strategy for Anemia Prevention and Control in Bangladesh included adolescents and newly married women as target groups for future iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation programs. This double-blinded RCT examined the effect of daily periconceptional IFA vs. folic acid (FA) on anemia and iron indictors before and during pregnancy among married, nulliparous women in rural Bangladesh. Biochemical indices were collected at baseline and either at 15 weeks gestation or after 9 months among non-pregnant women (NPW).</detailed_description>
