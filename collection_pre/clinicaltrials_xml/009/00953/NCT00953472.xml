	<brief_summary>The investigators working hypothesis is that human hypertension is in part due to a derangement in the endocrine function of the heart - a primary or secondary mechanism - resulting in a relative deficiency of the natriuretic peptides (NP). The remodeled hypertensive heart could result in altered processing and degradation of B-type NP resulting in altered molecular forms with decreased biological activity. The investigators further hypothesized the chronic administration of BNP in subjects with hypertension, is feasible, safe and will induce a sustained reduction in blood pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in Human Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ongoing investigations by our laboratory group and others have established that the heart is an endocrine organ as well as a pump. The heart synthesizes and secretes two peptide hormones - atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) - that are endogenous ligands for a particulate guanylyl cyclase receptor (NPR-A). Following receptor binding and generation of its second messenger cGMP, the natriuretic peptides (NPs) mediate biological actions which include natriuresis, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system and vasodilatation with local autocrine and paracrine actions in the heart to include inhibition of fibrosis and enhancement of diastolic function. Hypertension remains a global burden in cardiovascular disease leading to stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Its myocardial complications result from increased mechanical load on the heart. Under physiological conditions of increased myocardial load and resulting myocardial stretch, ANP and BNP synthesis and secretion occur contributing to maintenance of optimal cardiorenal and blood pressure homeostasis.</detailed_description>
