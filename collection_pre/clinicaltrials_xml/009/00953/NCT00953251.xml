	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the diagnostic value of the new TnThs assay for early detection of evolving non-STEMI in patients with acute coronary syndrome and a negative 4th generation cTnT result on admission. METHODS: We evaluated several statistical patterns of blood results of TnT hs and cTnT of 115 patients and calculated necessity of prediction of evolving non-STEMI within 6 hours. RESULTS: Based on the results of the 4th generation cTnT assay, an evolving non-STEMI was diagnosed in 26 patients, 31 were classified as unstable angina. The TnThs lead to an increase of non-STEMI diagnosis as compared to the 4th generation assay. We could calculate increased sensitivities for earlier detection of evolving non-STEMI from 61.5% on admission to 90.9% within 3 hours and 100% within 6 hours compared to cTnT. CONCLUSIONS: The TnThs assay enables earlier detection of non-STEMI and allows identification of an additional percentage of cases with non-STEMI previously classified as unstable angina.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>115 consecutive patients were enrolled with symptoms suggestive of ACS, admitted to the Chest Pain Unit of the University of Heidelberg. All patients received a 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recording on admission, and a second 12lead ECG after 6 hours Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during followup sampling were excluded as were patients with a significant kidney dysfunction defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Patients with STEMI were excluded. Patients with only 1 blood sample were also excluded.</criteria>
