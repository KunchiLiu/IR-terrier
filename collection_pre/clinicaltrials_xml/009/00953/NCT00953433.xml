	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at reducing the risk of hoarseness and damage to the vocal cords following general anaesthesia. Conventional endotracheal intubation with use of a stylet will be compared with the Endoflex tube. A conventional stylet enforced endotracheal tube is dirigible because of the stiffness gained by the addition of a stylet. In high risk rapid sequence intubation settings the enhanced dirigibility can be crucial, which is why most anaesthesiologists choose to add the stylet in these situations. A new endotracheal tube with a dynamic dirigible end called the Endoflex tube might prove to be a good alternative to the conventional stylet enforced endotracheal tube. Study hypothesis: The Endoflex tube will reduce the risk of hoarseness after intubation when compared to the conventional stylet enforced endotracheal tube under optimal intubation conditions.</brief_summary>
