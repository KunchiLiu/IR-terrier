	<brief_summary>Miralax (PEG 3350) has been shown to be a safe and uncomplicated bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy in pediatric populations. This study seeks to confirm the efficacy of this bowel cleansing regimen in adults and to determine the benefit of adding a pretreatment medication to this bowel preparation. The tolerability of Miralax will hopefully improve patient satisfaction with colonoscopy and decrease their reluctance to be screened because of the uncomfortable taste and side effects of bowel preparation regimens.</brief_summary>
