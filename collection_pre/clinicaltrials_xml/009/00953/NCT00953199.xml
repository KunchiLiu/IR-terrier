	<brief_title>Topical Pancreatic Duct Lidocaine for Prevention of Post-Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis is a common cause of morbidity for which there is no known pharmacologic prophylaxis. Post-ERCP pancreatitis is thought to be caused by several factors, including intraductal pressure, multiple duct injections with contrast, and neural arc reflexes. Lidocaine is a safe, inexpensive class IV antiarrhythmic that has topical anesthetic effects, inhibits trypsin activity, and may potentially prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis by injection directly into the pancreatic duct at the time of ERCP. Lidocaine has been shown to inhibit phospholipase A2, a key pancreatic enzyme, interrupt local arc reflexes to stop neuronal transmission, and to dampen GI tract mucosal reflexes to prevent high ductal pressure. The key objective of this study is to determine if injection of lidocaine is beneficial in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Subjects will be randomized to study group or control group in an equal ratio. The physicians performing the ERCP will be unaware of the treatment group to which patients have been assigned. Study arm will receive contrast agent Diatrizoate 60% (5 ml) diluted with lidocaine 2% (5 ml) during ERCP. Control arm will receive contrast agent Diatrizoate 60% (5 ml) diluted with normal saline 0.9% (5 ml) during ERCP. Diatrizoate diluted with normal saline is the standard of care. Patients will be contacted 1 day and 1 week post-ERCP to assess for symptoms of pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
