	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Identifying genes that increase a person's susceptibility to side effects caused by capecitabine may help doctors plan better treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood samples in predicting response to capecitabine in women with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Response to Capecitabine in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of dihydrouracil/uracil (UH_2/U) ratio measured before starting treatment on grade 3-4 capecitabine-related toxicity in women with metastatic breast cancer. Secondary - To prospectively test the value of the germinal genotype of thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) as predictors of resistance to capecitabine. - To evaluate the practical feasibility of such pre-therapeutic screening. - To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase genotyping on grade 3-4 capecitabine-related toxicity in the first and second courses. - To evaluate the predictive gain provided by genotyping relative to phenotyping alone. - To evaluate the influence of TS and MTHFR gene polymorphisms on clinical response and duration of response. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites and their relationship with UH_2/U and genotype. - To evaluate the total cost of pre-therapeutic phenotyping alone and the combination of phenotyping and genotyping. - To exhaustively analyze the 23 exons of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene in patients who developed toxicity. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected 8-15 days before the start of treatment and periodically on the first day of treatment for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase phenotyping (dihydrouracil/uracil ratio and high performance liquid chromatography analysis), genotyping (4 most relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms), and pharmacokinetic analysis.</detailed_description>
