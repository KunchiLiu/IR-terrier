Standard post-op O2 by mask for 2 hours To extended operating room procedures of: 1. No po antibiotics or pre-op bowel prep other than enema prior to surgery 2. Skin warming at least 15 minutes prior to and during surgery(core temp 36C+) 3. IOBAN drapes and Plastic wound protectors used during surgery 4. Restricted IV fluids less than 200cc per hour during surgery 5. Increased FiO2 to 80% during surgery and 2 hours after by mask Monitoring for post-op wound infections at discharge and up to 30days post-op</detailed_description>
