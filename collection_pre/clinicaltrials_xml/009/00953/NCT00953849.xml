	<brief_summary>The poor survival of Veterans with oral cancer underscores the significance of identifying new treatment approaches. The proposed studies will test a new 2 pronged immunotherapeutic approach for oral cancer patients which lessen the immune inhibitory environment while maturing cells that can stimulate T cell reactivity against oral cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Plus Celecoxib Therapy to Stimulate Intratumoral Immune Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this study is beneficial T cell reactivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumors can be synergistically stimulated by blocking suppressor endothelial cells and their induction of other inhibitory cell populations while also maturing immune inhibitory CD34+ cells into antigen-presenting dendritic cells. To test this hypothesis, newly diagnosed OSCC patients will be administered the cyclooxigenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib and/or Calcitriol for the 3 week duration between cancer diagnosis and surgical treatment. The following aims will test the immunological and clinical effectiveness of the combination treatment: - 1. To block the suppressive activity of endothelial cells and increase the levels of dendritic that are stimulatory to T cell reactivity, thereby synergistically increasing intratumoral T cell reactivity. These functional immune analyses will use OSCC tissues removed from untreated patients or patients treated with celecoxib and/or Calcitriol. - 2. To reduce development of OSCC recurrences by synergistically stimulating intratumoral T cell reactivity with celecoxib to block suppressor endothelial cell activity and Calcitriol to mature CD34+ suppressor cells into T cell stimulatory dendritic cells.</detailed_description>
