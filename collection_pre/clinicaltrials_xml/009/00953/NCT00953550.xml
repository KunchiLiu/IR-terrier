	<brief_summary>Rapid sequence intubation is used, when there is an elevated risk of aspiration to the lungs of stomach content. It is typically used in acute settings that require acute surgery or in prehospital settings, but also in specific risk patients requiring elective surgery. The reason for conducting rapid sequence intubation is to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration and at the same time achieve a fast induction of anaesthesia and intubation. Rapid sequence intubation is a procedure with a high risk of complications in itself. The time period from induction of anaesthesia to intubation is particularly risky, because the patient is apneic. This study addresses this problem by investigating, how quickly spontaneous respiration can be reestablished after a rapid sequence intubation when using Rocuronium-Sugammadex compared to Succinylcholine. This is a pilot protocol that is intended to establish a sample size for the full protocol. Study hypothesis: The time from correct tube placement to spontaneous respiration is shorter when using Rocuronium/Sugammadex compared to Succinylcholine.</brief_summary>
