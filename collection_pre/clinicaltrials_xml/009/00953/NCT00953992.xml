	<brief_summary>- To investigate the etiology, epidemiology and prognostic factors of acute kidney injury. - To find out risk factors that relate with the prognosis of acute kidney injury,focusing on inflammation, oxidative stress and nutritional status. - To study on the relationship between gene polymorphism and prognosis of acute kidney injury.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. to investigate the relationship between preexisting malnutrition and adverse outcomes in patients with AKI - Several nutritional assessment methods such as anthropometric, clinical and biochemical evaluations have been used; however, no single indicator is considered to be a "gold standard." 2. to evaluate the association of serum nutritional variables and prognosis of acute kidney injury 3. Given the different half-lives of serum nutritional markers, we hypothesized that the utility of serum nutritional variables as prognostic predictors may differ in early death (&lt;7 days) and late death (&gt;7 days, &lt;28 days) patients.</detailed_description>
