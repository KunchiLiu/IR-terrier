	<brief_summary>The current study aims to explore and analyse the decision making process of couples in regards to continuing or discontinuing infertility treatment. A longitudinal, prospective cohort design is used which allows the monitoring of patients over a longer period of time. Data will be collected quantitatively (questionnaires) as well as qualitatively (in-depth interviews) to allow for a more specific and in depth experience than can be obtained by using a questionnaire study. Innovative aspects of the study include: 1. exploration of determinants of continuing and discontinuing infertility treatment by using a comprehensive psychological theory (both surface and in-depth) 2. exploration of gender differences in the decision making process in continuing or discontinuing treatment 3. longitudinal and prospective arm of the study will allow to gain insight into the 'process' 4. prediction of continuing/discontinuing treatment based on psychological variables.</brief_summary>
