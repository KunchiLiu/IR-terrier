	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at assessing the capability of the PillCam Platform using the PillCam ESO 2 Capsule in: - Determining whether there is 1) active bleeding in the Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract, 2) identifying the anatomic location of acute overt UGI bleeding, and 3) discriminating a variceal versus non-variceal source of UGI bleeding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot and Feasibility Study to Evaluate Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) is a prevalent, clinically significant, and expensive healthcare problem worldwide. The incidence of acute, overt UGIH has been estimated to be 50-150 cases per 100,000 adults in the United States population each year. Clinical Significance / Rationale EGD is the currently accepted community standard for the diagnosis and management of UGIH. Diagnostic EGD in persons presenting with acute UGIH allows for (1) differentiating the source of bleeding (variceal vs. non-variceal), (2) defining the anatomic location of the bleeding site (e.g., esophagus, stomach, duodenum), (3) providing an endoscopic diagnosis, and (4) facilitating patient triage for subsequent level of care (ICU, monitored bed, non-monitored bed, early / expedited hospital discharge). Capsule endoscopy for the small bowel was cleared by the FDA in 2001, and within a short time, has gained acceptance as providing state-of-the-art endoscopic imaging. Capsule endoscopy is now commonly used in the evaluation of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, including iron deficiency anemia, suspected and known Crohn's disease, malabsorption syndromes (e.g., Celiac disease), and chronic abdominal pain. Capsule endoscopy technology is now also being applied to evaluation of the esophagus (PillCam® ESO, Given Imaging, Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) and the colon (PillCam® COLON). Recently, a second generation esophageal capsule endoscope (PillCam® ESO 2, Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) was cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June 2007. While having the same outer dimensions (length and diameter) as the original PillCam ESO capsule, several significant improvements have been made to the internal components of the PillCam ESO 2. Similar to the original PillCam ESO, the system includes a sensor array and data recording device which are connected to the patient during the procedure. The recorded data is downloaded into the Given Imaging RAPID® workstation for review of the capsule endoscopy video. However, there are no published detailed data evaluating the feasibility of utilizing PillCam ESO 2 in individuals presenting with acute, overt UGI bleeding. Moreover, there are no data comparing PillCam ESO 2 and EGD in the evaluation of this patient population. Therefore, in this proof-of-concept pilot study, we will evaluate the feasibility and safety of using PillCam ESO 2 in individuals presenting with acute, overt UGI bleeding.</detailed_description>
