	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine the acute effects of exenatide on postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. Secondary goals are to determine whether there are additional improvements in postprandial lipids and lipoproteins and whether (by the reduction of hyperglycemia alone or in combination with declines in hyperlipidemia) exenatide reduces the pro-inflammatory potential of the postprandial period.</brief_summary>
