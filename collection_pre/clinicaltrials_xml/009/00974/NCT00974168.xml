	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy may be effective in treating malignant spinal cord compression in patients who have received previous radiation therapy to the spine. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying radiation therapy in treating patients with malignant spinal cord compression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the efficacy of a biologically effective dose-based re-irradiation strategy, in terms of the response rate (based on the mobility score using the Tomita scale where improvement in mobility or stable mobility score will be regarded as a response) in patients with malignant spinal cord compression. Secondary - To determine quality of life as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C15 PAL version 1.0 questionnaire. - To determine the non-spinal radiation-induced toxicity using standard RTOG criteria. - To determine the rate of long-term spinal toxicity and radiation-induced myelopathy using the RTOG SOMA morbidity grading system. OUTLINE: Patients are divided into 2 groups according to the interval since their most recent radiotherapy to the involved area of the spinal cord. - Group 1 (&lt; 6 months since prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy for a cumulative biologically effective dose (BED) ≤ 100 Gy_2 in addition to receiving other current treatment. - Group 2 (≥ 6 months since prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy for a cumulative BED ≤ 130 Gy_2 in addition to receiving other current treatment. Mobility score is assessed and patients complete a quality-of-life assessment at baseline and at each follow-up visit starting at week 5. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 5 weeks, at 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
