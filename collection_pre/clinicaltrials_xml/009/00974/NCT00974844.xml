	<brief_summary>Dropping of nucleus is a common complication during cataract extraction by phacoemulsification. The investigators describe a new technique to retrieve the dropped nucleus by using an instrument called Pars Plana Levitator (ASICO-LLC, USA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posterior Assisted Levitation of Dropped Nucleus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon recognition of posterior capsular rupture and dropping of nucleus phaco prob will be withdrawn, status of the nucleus will be visualized by posterior segment non contact lens and if the nucleus found floating, pars plana levitator will be introduced through temporal pars plana, its prongs will be opened and nucleus will be grasped between prongs. Nucleus will be lifted up till the anterior chamber where phacoemulsification will be performed in a usual manner and a posterior chamber intraocular lens will be implanted if possible in the remaining bag.</detailed_description>
