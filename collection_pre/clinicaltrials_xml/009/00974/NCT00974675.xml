	<detailed_description>This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Following confirmation of eligibility, subjects with moderate asthma will be recruited sequentially to one of three dose groups and randomly assigned within dose group to either CAT-354 or placebo. Doses of the assigned treatment will be administered on three occasions 28 days apart. Follow up for pharmacokinetic blood sampling and safety will continue to Day 147 post first dose (91 days post third dose).</detailed_description>
