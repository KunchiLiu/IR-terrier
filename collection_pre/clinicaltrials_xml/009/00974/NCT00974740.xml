	<brief_summary>Clinical studies have shown that immunomodulators (like Anti-CD3 antibodies) have effects on beta-cell-preservation. The lipid-lowering agent atorvastatin is also a potent immunomodulator. In this study the effects of 80 mg atorvastatin per day on preservation of beta-cell function in recent onset type 1 diabetes were studied, as determined by stimulated C-peptide levels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objectives of this study were as follows: - To assess the effect of atorvastatin on pancreatic beta-cell function as measured by C-peptide after a liquid mixed meal stimulation in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, - To assess the effect on metabolic control as measured by HbA1c and insulin requirements, - To assess safety and tolerability of atorvastatin in subjects with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, - To assess the effect on risk factors of diabetic complications as indicated by changes in lipids and CRP, and - To assess the effect on systemic immune abnormalities as measured by effects on beta-cell autoantibodies, blood cytokines and chemokines on protein and transcriptional level. Study duration: 18 months</detailed_description>
