	<brief_summary>The role of angiogenesis has been less clear in lymphoma than in solid tumors, in part related to the heterogeneity of disease and technical issues. In addition to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) effects on angiogenesis and the integrity of tumor vasculature, autocrine VEGF-receptor (VEGF-R)-mediated signaling may play a role in lymphoma. Microvessel density, a measure of angiogenesis, is highest in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), followed by diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and intra-follicular follicular lymphoma (FL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endostar Combined With CHOP Regimen as First Line Chemotherapy for Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate efficacy and safety of endostar combined with CHOP regimen as first line treatment for peripheral T cell lymphoma.The second subject is to clarify the association between expression of VEGF and prognosis in peripheral T cell lymphoma,unspecified(PTCL-U) and angioimmunoblastic T-cellLymphoma(AILT).Methods 15 cases of PTCL were enrolled in this study.Immunohistochemical staining was performed by EnVision method using antibodies VEGF.</detailed_description>
