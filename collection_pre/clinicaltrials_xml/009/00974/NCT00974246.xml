	<brief_title>The Effect on Depressive Symptoms in ECF Residents With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are studying 35 residents in the ECF with a diagnosis of COPD. We are evaluating them for depressive symptoms using the Cornell Depression Scale and the MDS 3.0 section D. We are selecting patients who are not currently on treatment with Advair and starting them on Advair Diskus50/250 1 inhalation bid for a period of 16 weeks and reassessing the Cornell Depression SCale and MDS3.0 section D looking for any changes. We are also going to measure FEV1 and FVC using spirometry before treatment and at the end of 16 weeks. This is a pilot study. The numbers are not necessarily adequate to achieve statistical difference-we are looking for trends.</detailed_description>
