	<brief_title>Uncemented Total Elbow Arthroplasty Data Collection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three parts of this study will be: Retrospective Chart Review- A chart review will be completed on all patients that have had an uncemented total elbow arthroplasty using the press-fit technique at Vanderbilt Hand &amp; Upper Extremity Center. The chart review will include: - A historical data form - An operative data form - A radiographic assessment form Questionnaire Mailing- We will mail prospective study patients a DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire to complete with a mailing letter explaining the request for this information. The DASH will be modified to ask patients regarding their pre-operative time as well. Clinical Data Collection- We will enroll patients who have already had/or will be having a uncemented total elbow arthroplasty using the press-fit technique. If the patient already has a file completed through the chart review we will not complete the historical data form, operative form, or previous radiograph assessments. If the patient does not have a file completed through the chart review the data collection will include: - An Informed Consent Document - A historical data form - An operative data form - A radiographic assessment form - Patient-completed DASH questionnaire - Elbow Assessment Form</detailed_description>
