	<brief_summary>This is a research study testing SABER™-Bupivacaine (an experimental pain-relieving medication). SABER™-Bupivacaine is designed to continuously deliver bupivacaine, a common local anesthetic, for a few days in order to treat local post-surgical pain. This study is testing SABER™-Bupivacaine in people having surgery to repair a hernia. The purpose of the study is to measure and compare the safety (side effects), tolerability (ability to tolerate), and efficacy (how well it works) of two different volumes of SABER™-Bupivacaine with SABER™-Placebo.</brief_summary>
