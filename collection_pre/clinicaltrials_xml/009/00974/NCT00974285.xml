	<brief_summary>The average period of asymptomatic HIV-infection is 8 years, at this stage, CD4+ T lymphocyte count was reduced gradually at the rate of 50~100cells/ul/year. When the CD4 T lymphocyte count dropped below 350cells/ul and viral load increased to 105 in AIDS patients, HAART will be carried out. But, CD4 T lymphocyte was 350~550 cells/ul, there is no intervention measures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The average period of asymptomatic HIV-infection is 8 years, at this stage, CD4+ T lymphocyte count was reduced gradually at the rate of 50~100cells/ul/year. When the CD4 T lymphocyte count dropped below 350cells/ul and viral load increased to 105 in AIDS patients, HAART will be carried out. But, CD4 T lymphocyte was 350~550 cells/ul, there is no intervention measures. - Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) is composed of herbs which have tonic and detoxific function. The long-term clinical application has proved the safety and effect. It can improve the symptoms and signs in AIDS patients with the effective rate of 70% and can significantly improve the quality of life. It can also improve and stabilize immune function and inhibit viral replication. The basis study have shown that Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) can inhibit viral replication from multi-target, multi-link, enhance immune function, increase the secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, participate in immune regulation effect, enhance NK cell activity, promote CD3+CD4+T cell proliferation and increase macrophage phagocytes capacity. - Through the clinical trials, we are going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Immunity 1 (Fuzheng 1) on immune reconstitution of HIV patients in WHOⅠ、II period.</detailed_description>
