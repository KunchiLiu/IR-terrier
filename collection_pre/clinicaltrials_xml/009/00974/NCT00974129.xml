	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the genotype of CTCF, a proven transcription factor, in patients with infantile hemangiomas and to monitor tumor growth. The investigators aim to determine whether or not the CTCF genotype might serve as an early and reliable predictor of tumor growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of CCCTC-binding Factor (CTCF) in Infantile Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seeks to examine a potential relationship between CTCF genotype and hemangioma size and growth rate. In addition to the initial visit, patients will return to our clinic for evaluation at two weeks, one month, two months, six months, and one year. At each visit, patients' hemangiomas will be measured and photographed. At one point over the course of evaluation, a blood sample will be taken from each patient for evaluation of C/T polymorphism at CTCF binding site six.</detailed_description>
