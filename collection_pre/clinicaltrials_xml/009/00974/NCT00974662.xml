	<brief_title>Study Using WST11 in Patients With Obstructing Endobronchial Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a multicentre, exploratory phase IIa, open label, single intravenous (IV) dose, escalating treatment regimen (Treatment regimen = a single dose of WST11 associated with a particular laser light energy) with a one month follow-up. Six escalating treatment regimens will be followed: 3 WST11 doses (5 mg/kg; 7.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) combined with 2 light energies (200 Joules/cm and 300 Joules/cm) The patient will be treated under local anesthesia. The light is produced using a specific laser at a wavelength of 753 nm at a fixed power of 250 mW/cm and locally delivered to the obstructing tumor through an optical fiber placed, during endoscopy, in the endoscope operating channel with visual control, possibly video-transmission assisted. The fiber illuminating diffusion length is fixed (2 cm).</detailed_description>
