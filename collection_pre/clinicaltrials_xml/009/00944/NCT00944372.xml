	<criteria>1. Males or females 18 years of age and older. 2. If female and of childbearing potential, patients must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of study drug administration. In addition, all female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study. 3. If deemed necessary by the Principal Investigator, patients entering the pharmacokinetic population must be willing to be housed within the investigational facility for a minimum of 24 hours following drug administration. 4. Patients (when able) or legally authorized representatives must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and provide written consent to participate and agree to abide by the study requirements. 5. Patients must have tumor localization by conventional imaging methods prior to enrollment (i.e., CT, MRI, US, angiogram). 6. Patients referred for scintigraphy of solid tumors with a high suspicion of containing somatostatin receptor positive tissue. 7. Patients with firsttime tumors must be scheduled for a tissue biopsy. A tissue sample will be sent to the core laboratory for conventional histology and immunohistochemistry analysis. 8. Patients with recurrent tumors or progressive tumors must have previous biopsy results documented, with previous biopsy tissue obtainable for immunohistochemistry analysis. 1. Patients receiving Sandostatin LAR &lt; 21 days prior to dosing or Sandostatin Immediate Release (IM) &lt; 24 hours prior to dosing. 2. Patients who have received any investigational drug within 30 days of admission into this study or plan to participate in a clinical study prior to the end of this study's monitoring period (patients on a research protocol using an approved drug are accepted). 3. Patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding or lactating. 4. Patients with a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that would significantly decrease study compliance, including all prescribed followup. 5. Patients scheduled to undergo any scintigraphy within 7 days prior to study participation or PET scanning within 24 hours prior to study participation.</criteria>
