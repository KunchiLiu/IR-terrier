	<detailed_description>Previous observational and experimental research suggests that increased eating frequency is related to lower weight, body mass index (BMI)and body fatness. It is proposed that eating frequently during the day reduces overall energy consumed by preventing the development of excessive hunger. As elevated hunger increases the reinforcing value of food, and greater intake occurs when the reinforcing value of food increases, eating frequently during the day may be a dietary strategy that can aid with reducing energy intake and improving weight loss during a behavioral weight control program. Therefore, the purpose of this proposed research is to test the effect of manipulating eating frequency on hunger and the reinforcing value of food in 50 overweight/obese adults participating in a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) a condition in which participants will be given an eating frequency prescription to eat every 2 to 3 hours (Grazing); or 2) a condition in which participants will be given an eating frequency prescription of eating 3 meals per day (Three Meals). Both conditions will receive an identical dietary prescription, a low-calorie (1200 to 1500 kcals/d), low-fat (â‰¤ 30% kcals from fat) diet and an identical physical activity goal of 200 minutes of moderate-intense physical activity per week. Additionally, both conditions will receive an identical state-of-the-art, 6-month, behavioral weight loss program.</detailed_description>
