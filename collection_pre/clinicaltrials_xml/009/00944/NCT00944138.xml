	<brief_summary>Obesity plays a causal role for kidney disease incidence and progression. Moderate weight loss reduces the high metabolic demands on the kidney and decreases proteinuria in both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies. However, maintaining behavioral changes for weight loss is very challenging, and common chronic kidney disease (CKD) co-morbidities such as decreased exercise capacity only compound this difficulty. Moreover, no weight loss medications have been adequately tested in adults with CKD and most are contraindicated in this population. Mindful meditation or "mindfulness" in addition to other relaxation techniques may help adults lose weight by interrupting learned behavior, curbing compulsive eating, and reducing stress and appetite. Although mindful meditation and other relaxation techniques have gained the attention of the mainstream media for obesity treatment, scientific data on its efficacy remain limited. Due to the short duration of this study, substantial weight loss in any participant is not expected. Instead, the primary purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of mindful meditation relaxation techniques combined with standard care compared to standard care alone for the treatment of obesity among Veterans with CKD.</brief_summary>
