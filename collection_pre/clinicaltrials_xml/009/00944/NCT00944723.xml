	<brief_title>Impact of Mass Zinc Fortification Programs on Plasma Zinc Concentration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the present study are to determine whether plasma zinc concentration changes in response to additional zinc consumption, as provided by zinc-fortified cereal-based complementary foods fed to adult men (fortified at a level consistent with currently proposed levels). The following specific steps will be completed: 1. Zinc-fortified breads prepared from zinc-fortified wheat flour will be developed with assistance from experts in food technology. 2. A four-week feeding trial will be implemented to assess the change in plasma zinc concentration among young adult men who receive: a) bread fortified with a moderate amount of zinc and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals; b) bread fortified with a large amount zinc and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals; c) non-zinc-fortified bread and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals [negative control group]; and d) non-zinc-fortified bread and a zinc-containing liquid vitamin preparation between meals [positive control group].</detailed_description>
