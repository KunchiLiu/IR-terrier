	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects on a number of health outcomes and the feasibility of a structured program of qi-gong, a form of tai-chi which has been previously tested in older populations, in older hospitalized patients. In particular, this pilot study aims to assess changes in quality of life and depressive symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, with the hypothesis that this intervention will have a positive impact on these two domains, compared to usual care. Adherence will be also monitored in the intervention arm.</brief_summary>
