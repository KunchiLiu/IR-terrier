	<brief_summary>The proposed project will evaluate the efficacy of a telephone-delivered self-management (T-SM) intervention for reducing the impact of secondary conditions in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), including chronic pain, fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized that if the effects of these conditions are reduced, study participants will demonstrate improved participation in the community and improved employment outcomes. This project is important because the majority of persons with MS experience one or more of the following secondary conditions: fatigue, pain, depression, and cognitive impairment. These secondary conditions are not always readily apparent and constitute what has been described by our Rehabilitation Research and Training Center as "hidden disabilities." Secondary conditions such as pain, depression, fatigue, and cognitive impairment frequently not only cause distress in their own right but also affect employment, participation, and quality of life. Having more than one often compounds the effect; the effect of all may be greater than the sum of each individually (e.g. depression can worsen fatigue, and cognitive impairment can worsen depression). It is critical that this constellation of secondary symptoms be addressed using state of the art techniques based on self-management training and that intervention effects be documented with carefully controlled treatment efficacy studies.</brief_summary>
