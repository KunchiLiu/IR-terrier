	<brief_title>Effect of VSL#3 on Intestinal Permeability in Pediatric Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with Crohn's disease have altered intestinal permeability. A pilot study in children showed that probiotics may decrease intestinal permeability. In this double blind, randomized controlled trial, we will observe the effect of VSL#3 on small bowel permeability using a double sugar absorption test. PCDAI was monitored, but not analyzed.</detailed_description>
