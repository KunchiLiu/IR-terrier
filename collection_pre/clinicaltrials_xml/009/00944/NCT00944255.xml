	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND. Polymorphisms occur in several genes encoding key enzymes in the folate pathway may affect drug metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Whether these genetic variations contribute to differential responses to antifolate drug in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains to be investigated in the Taiwanese population. OBJECTIVE. The goal of the present study is to investigate the interactions between genetic variations in folate genes and the efficacy/side effects of anti-folate disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug in Taiwan. DESIGN. A cross-sectional study involving patients with RA were enrolled from TCVGH. Disease activity, drug efficacy and associated side-effects were assessed. Genotypes in folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase and reduced folate carrier were determined by RFLP or pyrosequencing.</brief_summary>
