	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine if varenicline (ChantixÂ®), currently used as a smoking cessation aid, will decrease the likelihood of relapse to smoking following a programmed lapse in the laboratory. The hypothesis is that varenicline will reduce the reinforcing effects of smoking and will delay or prevent relapse compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
