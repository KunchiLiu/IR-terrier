	<brief_title>Study of MDX-1203 in Subjects With Advanced/Recurrent Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) or Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, multidose study of MDX-1203, a fully human monoclonal antibody drug conjugate targeting the CD70 transmembrane cell-surface protein which is highly expressed in ccRCC and B-NHL. MDX-1203 is composed of a human anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a prodrug form of a cytotoxic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) minor-groove binding agent (MGBA). The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (up to 17 cycles or 2 years), and Follow-up (up to 6 months).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2 Criteria specific to each tumor type: For Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC): advanced or recurrent disease. Must have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy For Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma (BNHL): Must have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy Measurable disease criteria by tumor type: For ccRCC: At least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion For BNHL: At least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion Prior therapies for advanced/recurrent ccRCC or relapsed/refractory BNHL or have become intolerant to a systemic therapy Provide archived or fresh tumor tissue for CD70 status. Subjects must be CD70+ Provision of fresh tissue (pretreatment and ontreatment) for exploratory analysis is mandatory for at least 5 and a maximum of 10 BNHL subjects Prior therapy with an antiCD70 antibody History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies Active or untreated central nervous system lymphoma Active infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal) Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy Known current drug or alcohol abuse</criteria>
