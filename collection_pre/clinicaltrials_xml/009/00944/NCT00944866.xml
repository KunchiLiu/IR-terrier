	<brief_summary>The selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The goal of the present study is to investigate the impacts of COX-2 inhibitors on biochemical indices in cardiovascular disease. As the reviewer suggested, the investigators propose to study the effects of Cox-II inhibitor using experimentally induced hyperlipidemic rats. Plasma total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride concentrations will be determined before and after animals treated with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Biochemical markers related to cardiovascular events including prostaglandin I2, thromboxaneA2 and others will also be investigated. The investigators will also investigate these biochemical markers in patients taking Celecoxib and NSAIDs. The investigators hope these studies will reveal clinically useful biochemical markers for cardiovascular events in patients taking Cox-II inhibitor.</brief_summary>
