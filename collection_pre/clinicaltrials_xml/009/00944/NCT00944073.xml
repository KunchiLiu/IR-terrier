	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the body's immune response (body's defense against disease) to an experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine. Up to 650 healthy volunteers from three age groups (greater than or equal to 6 months to less than 36 months, greater than or equal to 36 months to 9 years, and 10 - 17 years) with no history of influenza H1N1 2009 influenza infection or influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination will participate. Participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to 1 of 2 possible H1N1 vaccine groups. Group 1 will receive 15 mcg of vaccine; Group 2 will receive 30 mcg of vaccine. Participants will receive vaccine injections on Days 0 and 21 in the arm or thigh muscle. Study procedures include: medical history, physical exam, maintaining a memory aid, and blood sample collection. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for approximately 7 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peds Sanofi H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Administered at Two Dose Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Data from several cohorts in different age groups that received licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new virus. Adults are more likely to have measurable levels of serum hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or neutralizing antibody than are children. These data indicate the need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1 strain and suggest that different vaccine strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for adjuvant) may be appropriate for persons in different age groups. Based on clinical data from other novel influenza A viruses, a higher dose, or multiple doses of an unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine may be necessary to confer protection to a maximal number of vaccine recipients. This protocol explores the antibody response following vaccination at 2 different dosage levels (15 mcg and 30 mcg) in up to 650 children aged 6 months to 17 years, inclusive. This study assesses the immune response following a single dose of vaccine, to assess whether individuals have any pre-existing 'prime' immunity, such that the initial H1N1 vaccination serves as a boost, thus conferring a more rapid time to protection and the need for fewer doses. Antibody responses will be assessed after a second dose. This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study in healthy infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents and is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine. The primary objectives are safety, to assess the safety of the unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine when administered at the 15 mcg or 30 mcg dose; and immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response following a single dose of unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine, stratified by age of recipient, when administered at the 15 mcg or 30 mcg dose. The secondary immunogenicity objective is to assess the antibody response following two doses of unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine, stratified by age of recipient, when administered at the 15 mcg or 30 mcg dose. There will be 3 age strata, each containing 200 subjects: greater than or equal to 6 months to less than 36 months, greater than or equal to 36 months to 9 years, and 10 - 17 years . Subjects will be randomized into 2 groups, with 300 subjects per group (100 per strata), to receive intramuscular inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine at 15 mcg (Group 1) or 30 mcg (Group 2). The vaccine will be administered on Days 0 and 21. Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events (AEs) for 21 days following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those receiving both doses and Day 21 for those who do not receive the second dose); serious adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 7 months post first vaccination (Day 201); and reactogenicity to the vaccines for 8 days following each vaccination (Day 0-7). Immunogenicity testing will include HAI and neutralizing antibody testing on serum obtained on the day of each vaccination (prior to vaccination) and 21 days following the second vaccination (Day 42). For subjects aged 10-17 years, serum for antibody assays will also be obtained at Day 8-10 following each vaccination. However, for the greater than or equal to 6 months - less than 36 months and the greater than o</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Are males or nonpregnant females aged 6 months to 17 years, inclusive. Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice adequate contraception that may include, but is not limited to, abstinence, barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragms, spermicides, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods during the study for at least 30 days following the last vaccination. The subject must be in good health as determined by axillary (&lt;10 years of age) or oral temperature (axillary temperature &lt;100 degrees Fahrenheit or oral temperature &lt;101 degrees Fahrenheit), medical history, and targeted physical examination based on medical history. Subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must be willing and able to comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. Subject and/or parent(s) legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, and subject may provide written assent as appropriate. Have a known allergy to eggs or other components of the vaccine (including gelatin, formaldehyde, octoxinol, thimerosal and chicken protein). Have a positive urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to vaccination or are breastfeeding.
