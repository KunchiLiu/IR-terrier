	<brief_title>Impact of Targeted Zinc Fortification Programs on Plasma Zinc Concentration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the present study are to determine whether plasma zinc concentration changes in response to additional zinc consumption, as provided by zinc-fortified cereal-based complementary foods fed to young children. The following specific steps will be completed: 1. Zinc-fortified complementary foods and breads prepared from zinc-fortified cereal flours will be developed with assistance from experts in food technology. 2. A two-week feeding trial will be implemented to assess the change in plasma zinc concentration among young children who receive: a) the zinc-fortified cereal porridge and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals; b) a non-zinc-fortified cereal porridge and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals [negative control group]; or c) a non-zinc-fortified cereal porridge and a zinc-containing liquid vitamin preparation between meals [positive control group].</detailed_description>
