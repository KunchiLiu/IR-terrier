	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire (GCLQ) truly detects symptoms or signs of lower extremity lymphedema in patients with diagnosed lower extremity lymphedema. Lymphedema is a chronic condition in which fluid accumulates in the tissues of the body. Many cancer survivors are living with discomfort and changes in their activities due to limb swelling following cancer treatment. If the GCLQ is able to do detect signs and symptoms of lymphedema, the investigators hope to use it as a tool in the clinical care setting to help identify women at risk for or with lymphedema. In the future, this could improve clinical care through the use of a more simple and feasible way to identify lower extremity lymphedema than measuring limbs.</brief_summary>
