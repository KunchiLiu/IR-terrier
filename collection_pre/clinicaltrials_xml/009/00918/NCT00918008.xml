	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study is to evaluate a new genetic-based test which will identify patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer before their surgery, who might have specific genes, which will increase their chances of recurrence of cancer after their surgery. Some patients who are diagnosed with bladder cancer and have their had bladder removed, will have a recurrence of cancer sometime after their surgery. This recurrence is usually caused by tumor cells that originated from the bladder tumor and traveled to other parts of the body, which is called metastatic cancer. Some patients are more likely than others to have metastatic disease. This test may help in identifying these patients who might develop metastases from having these specific genes.</brief_summary>
