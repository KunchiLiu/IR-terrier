	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if participants with untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have a better outcome when treated with olaratumab in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin then when treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin With or Without Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) in Previously Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated participants with Stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with olaratumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin in the first-line metastatic setting.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The participants has histologically or cytologically confirmed NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Stage IIIB with effusion. Mixed NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type. Primary or metastatic site may be used for histology 2. For squamous cell histology or for centrally located mediastinal masses (&lt; 3 cm from the carina) identified by computed tomography scan (CT) or chest xray, the participant must undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest or I.V. contrast CT scan within 3 weeks of randomization, to exclude major airway or blood vessel invasion (in the investigator's opinion) by cancer 3. The participant has measurable disease (Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy 4. The participant's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is 01 5. The participant's age at the time of study entry is ≥ 18 years 6. The participant has adequate hematologic function as defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL, hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 g/dL, and a platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL obtained within 2 weeks prior to randomization 7. The participant has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤ 5 × the ULN in the presence of known liver metastases) 8. The participant has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × the institutional ULN. If creatinine is above the ULN, the patient's creatinine clearance (CrCl) is ≥ 60 mL/min 9. The participant has urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is ≥ 2+, a 24hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1 g of protein in 24 hours to allow participation 10. The participant has adequate coagulation function, as defined by international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above ULN if not receiving anticoagulation therapy. Participants on fulldose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin, have therapeutic INR, no active bleeding (defined as within 14 days randomization) and no pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (eg, tumor involving major vessels or known varices) 11. Because the teratogenicity of Olaratumab is not known, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active males must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to randomization and for the duration of study participation 12. The participant has resolution to Grade ≤ 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4 (NCICTCAE v 4.02) of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior locoregional therapy, surgery, chemoembolization, or other anticancer therapy. The exceptions for such effects are events that pertain to the lab values found elsewhere in these inclusion criteria. (For example, criterion # 6 states that a patient with hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 g/dL is considered eligible, even though NCICTCAE v 4.02 defines this value as Grade 2 anemia.) 13. The participant has a life expectancy of ≥ 3 months 14. The participant has provided signed informed consent 1. The participant has untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Participants are eligible if they are clinically stable, off all steroids after cranial irradiation (whole brain radiation therapy, focal radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery)ending at least 2 weeks prior to randomization, or after surgical resection performed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization 2. The participant has radiologically documented evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement by cancer, or of intratumor cavitation 3. The participant received prior systemic chemotherapy or biologic therapy (eg erlotinib) for Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC outside of the adjuvant setting. Participants who received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic therapy in the adjuvant setting will not be excluded based on such therapy 4. The participant has a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of a) curatively resected nonmelanomatous skin cancer b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ c)other primary solid tumor treated with curative intent, no known active disease present, and no treatment administered during the last 3 years prior to randomization 5. The participant is receiving concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy, including other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization, targeted therapy, or an investigational agent 6. The participant has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 7. The participant has an uncontrolled thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorder 8. The participant has a history of gross hemoptysis (defined as bright red blood or ≥ 1/2 teaspoon) within 2 months of randomization 9. The participant has a serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to randomization 10. The participant has undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization 11. The participant has received adjuvant chemotherapy 21 days prior to randomization or has participated in clinical trials of experimental agents within 28 days prior to randomization 12. The participant has an elective or a planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the trial 13. The participant has peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 NCICTCAE v 4.02 14. The participant has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity 15. The participant, if female, is pregnant or lactating 16. The participant has received previous therapy with any agent that targets platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) 17. The participant has a known allergy to any of the treatment components 18. The participant has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biologic composition similar to that of Olaratumab</criteria>
