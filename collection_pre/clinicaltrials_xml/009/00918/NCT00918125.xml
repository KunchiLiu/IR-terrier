	<brief_summary>The investigators will examine whether an educational video increases patient knowledge about heart failure and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest and leads to greater satisfaction with information provided as compared to usual care. Additionally, the investigators will look at whether racial concordance (physician and patient being of the same race) improves satisfaction with the patient's treatment decision and disease knowledge. Our hypothesis is that a video in which participants are of the same race as the patient will provide better education and more satisfaction with the treatment decision and may lead to more patients choosing ICD therapy.</brief_summary>
