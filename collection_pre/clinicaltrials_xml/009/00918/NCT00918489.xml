	<brief_summary>Primary objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of vorinostat in patients suffering from selected histological types of soft tissue sarcoma. Further evaluations relate to the safety and tolerability of vorinostat, its pharmacokinetics (course of plasma concentration over time) and pharmacodynamics (mode of action). Only subjects with advanced, metastatic disease will be included in this trail.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Efficacy and Tolerability of Vorinostat in Patients With Advanced, Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment with vorinostat will be administered daily over 28 days. This period will be referred to as a therapy cycle. Two consecutive therapy cycles will be separated by a 7-days therapy break. In case of a good response and no relevant side effects, the treatment with vorinostat can be continued for up to 1 year after begin of the treatment. If any relevant side effects or intolerability occur, the dose and/or schedule of administration will be modified according to the pre-defined criteria.</detailed_description>
