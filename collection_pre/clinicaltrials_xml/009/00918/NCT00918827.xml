	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer who have undergone surgery and chemotherapy may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor samples from patients with stage III colon cancer who have undergone surgery and chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor Samples From Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery and Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify predictive factors of efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil-based regimens in patients with stage III colon cancer. - Investigate possibility of "personalized treatment" with adjuvant chemotherapy based on the predictive factors identified. OUTLINE: Patients' tumor tissue samples are collected for protein expression levels of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), VEGF, EGFR, mRNA-expression levels of TP, DPD, thymidylate synthase (TS), and orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT) by ELISA, Human Duo Set, and RT-PCR assays. Patients' enzyme expression levels are compared with their clinical data.</detailed_description>
