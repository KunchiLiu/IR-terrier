	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients who have undergone surgery for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Candidate Protein Expression in Breast Cancer Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine if candidate genes display differential expression between normal and cancer breast tissues. OUTLINE: Previously collected breast cancer tissue samples (paraffin embedded blocks) and normal adjacent tissue are used for immunohistochemistry studies of expression of candidate genes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of breast cancer Tissue samples available Samples are selected based on presence or absence of tumor receptors, (i.e.; estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors) and grouped into following 4 categories: Estrogen receptor (ER)positive/progesterone receptor (PR)positive/HER2negative ERpositive/PRpositive/ HER2positive by FISH ERnegative/PRnegative/HER2positive ERnegative/PRnegative/HER2negative(triple negative or basaltype cancers) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Menopausal status not specified PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Not specified</criteria>
