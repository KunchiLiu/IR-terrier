	<brief_summary>Study aimed to assess the reproducibility of PET imaging using AH111585 (18F) Injection. Subjects are evaluable if they undergo 2 administrations of AH111585 (18F) Injection (3 to 8 days apart) and the corresponding PET acquisitions, and tumors demonstrate detectable levels of 18F uptake on PET.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject has been diagnosed with at least one solid primary or metastatic tumor greater than 2.0 cm in diameter, including but not limited to NSCLC, RCC, GBM, melanoma, sarcoma, breast and H&amp;N cancers. The subject has received clinical routine imaging diagnostic workup within 8 weeks prior to the first [18F]AH111585 PET scan. The subject has a clinically acceptable (as judged by the investigator) physical examination at screening and is capable of selfcare. The subject has known hyper or hypocoagulation syndromes. The subject has received chemotherapy within 3 weeks, or received radiotherapy, surgery or any other treatment against cancer within 4 weeks prior to the first [18F]AH111585 PET scan. The subject is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or any other treatment against cancer between the first and second [18F]AH111585 PET scans. The subject is scheduled to undergo biopsy for the target tumour between the first and second [18F]AH111585 PET scans. The subject has intrahepatic tumour(s) only. For the immunohistochemistry group, the subject's target tumour has been biopsied less than or equal to 1 week prior to the first [18F]AH111585 PET scan.</criteria>
