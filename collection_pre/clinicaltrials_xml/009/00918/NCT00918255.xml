	<brief_title>Study of Adalimumab in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Chronic Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study consists of 2 treatment periods: a 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Period 1: Weeks 0 through the end of Week 15) followed by a 36-week open-label period (Period 2: Weeks 16 through 52). Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio based on Hurley Stage as stratification factor to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (qwk), adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow), or matching placebo during Period 1. During Period 2, participants receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow with the option to escalate to 40 mg weekly dosing at Week 28 or Week 31 if the participant has a Physician's Global Assessment of moderate disease or worse (score of greater than or equal to 3). The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of participants with moderate to severe chronic hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) after 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary objective is to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy and continued safety of adalimumab for an additional 36 weeks of treatment. (Note: Hurley Stage is a classification system for skin involvement that is largely based on the presence and extent of abscess formation accompanied by scarring and sinus tracts. Hurley Stages are I [abscess formation without scarring and sinus tracts], II [widely separated recurrent abscesses with scarring and sinus tracts], and III [multiple interconnected abscesses and sinus tracts across entire area]. Randomization in this study was performed using stratification by Hurley Stage [III versus (I or II).) At the present time, Period 1 double-blind data only is provided; additional information will be provided when analysis of open-label Period 2 is completed.</detailed_description>
