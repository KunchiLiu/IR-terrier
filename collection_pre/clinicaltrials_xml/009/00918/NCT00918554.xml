	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Methotrexate to Treat Sarcoid-associated Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macular oedema remains a significant cause of blindness. Corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of sarcoid-associated macular oedema but more than 50% of relapses occur when corticosteroids are tapered. Methotrexate (MTX) at low dose has been shown to be an effective and safe steroid-sparing agent for lung sarcoidosis and compilation of reported small series of patients with sarcoid-associated uveitis suggest that only 25% of relapses could be achieved with low dose MTX. We decide therefore to test the clinical efficacy of MTX in sarcoid-associated uveitis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients over 18 years old Provided written consent for participation in the trial prior to any studyspecific procedures or requirements Posterior uveitis or panuveitis associated with macular oedema defined as increased macular thickness (more than 250 mm assessed by Stratus TDOCT or 300 mm with Cirrus SDOCT ) and/or the presence of cystoid spaces in the macula, and the absence of epiretinal membranes. Patient with oral contraception Posterior uveitis or panuveitis associated with macular oedema Patients with histologically proven sarcoidosis or a presumed sarcoidosis. In case of a non caseating granuloma in biopsy tissues, the patients with presumed sarcoidosis meet at least 2 of the 4 following criteria: typical changes on chest radiography and computed tomography; predominantly CD4 lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; elevated serum ACE levels; elevated gallium or 5 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake Patients who do not fulfill the inclusion criteria Other causes of uveitis Extra ophthalmologic manifestations of sarcoidosis justifying corticosteroids Patients previously treated with immunosuppressive agents or corticosteroids of more than 10 mg daily over 15 days. Patients with lifethreatening conditions Chronic hepatopathy or renal failure Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus</criteria>
