	<brief_summary>PHPC-02 is a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate whether therapeutic immunization during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) induces elevations of HIV-specific T cell precursors with high proliferative capacity (PHPC) in HIV-1-infected individuals, and whether the quantity of PHPC correlates with the viral load set point following analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Subjects will be randomized to receive either DermaVir Patch (8 subjects per cohort) or DermaVir Patch Placebo (8 subjects per cohort) every four weeks for three applications while receiving maximally suppressive HAART. HAART will be discontinued at Week 9 for an ATI period of 20 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>16 subjects on maximally suppressive HAART were randomized to receive three doses of either DermaVir or Placebo immunotherapy. Subjects receive three DermaVir/Placebo treatments over eight weeks (Weeks 0, 4 and 8) while receiving HAART. HAART is discontinued for a 20 week ATI. Resumption of HAART during ATI is subjects experience: - A confirmed CD4+ cell decrease by &gt; 50% - A confirmed CD4+ cell decrease to less than 350 counts/mL - A confirmed VL increase &gt; 300,000 copies - Emergence of CDC AIDS related event(s) - Signs or symptoms of clinically significant immunosuppression - The subject or the subject's clinician wishes to restart HAART - The subject becomes pregnant</detailed_description>
