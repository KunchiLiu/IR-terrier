	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking is a major cause of illness among HIV-infected patients (non-AIDS defining malignancies (especially lung cancer), non-AIDS bacterial infections and cardio-vascular diseases). Approximately 50% of HIV-infected patients are regular tobacco smokers. Tobacco smoking cessation has well known benefits on mortality and morbidity in the general population where tobacco cessation assistance programs are increasingly implemented. However, smoking cessation interventions have never been evaluated among HIV-infected patients. This trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with placebo.</brief_summary>

Tobacco smoking cessation has well known benefits on mortality and morbidity in the general population where tobacco cessation assistance programs are increasingly implemented. However, smoking cessation interventions have never been evaluated among HIV-infected patients. This trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with placebo. A pharmacokinetic study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of smoking cessation on the plasma concentration of antiretroviral treatment.</detailed_description>
