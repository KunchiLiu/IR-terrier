	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are to assess efficacy and safety of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) when applied to the Emergency Department setting and to compare the efficacy and safety of two PCA dosing regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Patient Controlled Analgesia in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety, efficacy, and dosing of PCA will be assessed in a randomized trial with three treatment arms: 1. PCA with 1.0 mg morphine demand dosing every 6 minutes, 2. PCA with 1.5 mg demand dosing every 6 minutes and 3. a non-PCA comparison group. All patients will receive a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg morphine. All patients can receive additional analgesics as needed, at the discretion of the provider. We hypothesize that morphine supplied via PCA will provide superior analgesia without a greater incidence of adverse events when compared to non-PCA pain management; and that PCA demand dosing of 1.5 mg will be superior to 1.0 mg without more adverse events.</detailed_description>
