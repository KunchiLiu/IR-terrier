	<detailed_description>Despite the recognized value of exclusive breastfeeding during the first months of a child's life and efforts for promoting this practice, rates for this pattern of breastfeeding in Brazil are below those recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO), which advocates exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months. The last national survey about the prevalence of breastfeeding revealed a median duration of 10 months. However , the length of exclusive breastfeeding was only 23 days. A lot of studies identified maternal age as predictor of breastfeeding. In African, Asian, Latin American and the Pacific societies, older women, or grandmothers,traditionally have considerable influence on decisions related to maternal and child health at the household level. Considering all that, interventions intended to increase frequency of breastfeeding, particularly exclusive breastfeeding. However, there are few studies on this subject.</detailed_description>
