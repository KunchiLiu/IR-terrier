	<brief_title>The Impact of Exercise Counseling on Exercise Behavior in People With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance. Research studies indicate that complications such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, and loss of physical function are associated with type 2 diabetes. Clinical management of people with type 2 diabetes consists of medical nutrition therapy, pharmacological therapy, and exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve risk factors associated with complications of type 2 diabetes such as elevated plasma glucose, elevated blood pressure, loss of muscular strength, and loss of exercise capacity. In fact, the American Diabetes Association and American College of Sports Medicine have published position statements recommending the use of exercise, specifically resistance and aerobic training, as an intervention for people with type 2 diabetes. However, 31 percent of people with type 2 diabetes have reported no regular physical activity and an additional 38 percent have reported less than recommended levels of physical activity. Therefore, interventions to promote regular exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes are clinically important by potentially preventing type 2 diabetes-related complications. Previous studies have investigated the impact of exercise counseling on exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes. However, these studies have limitations such as lack of agreement with exercise training guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes and research design flaws. This current study investigates the effect of a novel, physical therapist-directed exercise counseling combined with fitness center-based exercise training intervention on stage of exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
