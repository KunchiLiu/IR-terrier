	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of nimotuzumab in the neo-adjuvant setting in patients with locally advanced HNSCC. The hypothesis is that the response would be increased with the combination of nimotuzumab and cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy With Nimotuzumab in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with unresectable HNSCC. However, the role of induction chemotherapy remains uncertain for resectable disease. Therefore, we plan to perform a phase II study to evaluate it, focusing on radiographic and pathologic response after induction chemotherapy. Moreover, a new EGFR monoclonal antibody (nimotuzumab) is incorporated with PF regimen. The hypothesis is the addition of nimotuzumab would improve the response without remarkably increase the toxicity.</detailed_description>
