	<brief_title>Drug and Non-Drug Treatment Of Severe Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the 5 week Optimal Acute Therapy (OAT) Run in (Month 1) all participants who met initial inclusion criteria received "optimal" acute therapy (OAT). At the end of the OAT Run-in, participants who continued to meet the migraine severity criteria were stratified by sex and randomized via a computerized randomization procedure to the four added treatments: Beta Blocker Placebo (PL), Beta Blocker (Propranolol LA or Nadolol), Behavioral Migraine Management (BMM) + PL, or BMM + Beta Blocker. Each of the 4 treatment protocols required 4 monthly clinic visits and 3 telephone contacts during the 3 month Treatment/Dose Adjustment Phase (Month 2 to Month 4) where Beta Blocker or PL dose was adjusted and BMM was administered. During the 12 month (Month 5 to Month 16) Evaluation Phase clinic visits were scheduled at Month 5, Month 7, Month 10 (the Primary End Point), Month 13 and Month 16. Treatment conditions were blinded only for the preventive medication (Beta Blocker, Placebo) component, and not for the administration of BMM. Electronic headache diary recordings are obtained for the full 16 months of the trial, including the 12 month evaluation phase, and migraine-related impairments in quality of life are assessed at multiple points over the 16 months of the trial.</detailed_description>
