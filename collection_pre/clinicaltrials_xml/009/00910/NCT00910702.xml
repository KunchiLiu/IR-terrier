	<brief_title>The Exploratory Clinical Trials for the Feasibility, Primary Safety and Efficacy of Foldable Capsular Vitreous Body</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) has been one of the most important ophthalmic surgeries for treating a number of blinding diseases by removing and replacing the diseased vitreous body. Current clinic vitreous substitute cannot mimic the natural vitreous which is unable to regenerate after surgery. We have devised a novel foldable capsular vitreous body (FCVB) consisting of a vitreous-like capsule with a tube-valve system, and demonstrated it could finely mimic the morphology and restore main physiological function of the natural vitreous body in our previous study.</detailed_description>
