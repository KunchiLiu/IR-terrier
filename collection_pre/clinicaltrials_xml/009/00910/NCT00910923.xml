	<brief_summary>This will be a single center study conducted in two parts. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of JNJ-38431055 in healthy male volunteers. Part 2 will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-38431055.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-38431055 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study includes 2 Parts and will be conducted at a single center. Part 1 is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the volunteer or investigator knows the name of the assigned study drug), placebo-controlled (placebo is a substance that looks the same as JNJ-38431055 but contains no JNJ-38431055), single ascending dose study. In Part 1, study drug (i.e., JNJ-38431055 or placebo) will be administered orally as single doses on Day 1 or three treatment periods. In Part 1, for each volunteer, the study will consist of a screening evaluation visit, 3 periods of double-blind treatment, and a final, follow-up examination. The total study duration for each volunteer will be approximately 9 weeks. Part 2 is a randomized, open-label, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the effect of administering JNJ-38431055 together with food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-38431055, as compared to administration in the fasting condition. In Part 2, study drug (JNJ-38431055 will be administered orally as single doses on Day 1 or two treatment periods. There will be at least 7 days between doses. In Part 1, study drug (i.e., JNJ-38431055 or placebo) will be administered orally as single doses on Day 1 of three treatment periods. In Part 2, study drug (JNJ-38431055) will be administered orally as single doses on Day 1 of two treatment periods.</detailed_description>
