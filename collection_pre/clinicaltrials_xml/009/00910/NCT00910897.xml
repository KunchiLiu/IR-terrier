	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - Compare the complete remission (CR) rates (i.e., the true CR, with negative immunofixation) achieved with either four courses of VD or four courses of VTD. Secondary objectives: - Compare the following parameters following 4 cycles of VD or VTD induction treatment: - CR rate+ very good partial remission (VGPR) rate - Overall remission rate (CR + VGPR + partial remission (PR) rate) - K/l light chain ratio in patients in CR. - Safety (quality of the sampled stem cells, extrahaematological and haematological toxicity: specially neurological toxicity, length of hospitalization). - Compare the CR rate and the CR + VGPR rates after post-induction autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).</brief_summary>
