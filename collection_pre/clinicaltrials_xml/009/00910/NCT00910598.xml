	<brief_summary>This is a study in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to assess the effects of glatiramer acetate (GA) subcutaneously on the condition of the optical nerve in comparison to no medicinal therapy during 12 months and to assess the use of Optical Coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive ophthalmological technique, in daily practice as an alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning for follow-up of these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography: Glatiramer in Clinically Isolated Syndrome or Early Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. It is characterized by an ongoing process of demyelination and axonal loss, even at the beginning of the disease course, which will result in brain atrophy. A first manifestation of clinical definite MS, is called a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Brain atrophy occurs even in patients with a CIS. Optic neuritis (ON) is a common feature of a CIS. The axons in the retina represent the most proximal part of the optic nerve which is devoid of myelin. Because the retina is part of the central nervous system (CNS), measurement of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RFLN) by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) offers the opportunity to visualize the unmyelinated axons of the CNS directly. OCT is a non-invasive method to measure the thickness of the optical layer. The thickness of the RNFL is reduced in MS patients with or without ON history. Glatiramer acetate (GA), an immunomodulatory drug for RRMS and CIS, reduces brain atrophy and stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which in turn could stimulate neuroregeneration. In this pilot study we would like to assess the feasibility of OCT measurement in patient with CIS other than ON in the Dutch clinical setting and to assess the effect of GA on the RNFL and visual function in patients with CIS or in early relapsing remitting MS patients.</detailed_description>
