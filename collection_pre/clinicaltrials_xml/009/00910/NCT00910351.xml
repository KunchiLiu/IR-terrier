	<criteria>Male or female patients with cystic fibrosis confirmed by genetic testing and / or by sweat test Colonization with P. aeruginosa confirmed in sputum in the past 12 months Cohort 1: greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Cohort 2: 6 12 years of age (inclusive) Normal Body Mass Index: BMI between 14.5 and 30 kg/m2, but in no case lower than the 30th percentile for age. Because CF patients are typically smaller than nonCFpatients, the normal body mass index will be based on standard CF foundation normal values for weight and sex.

Patients and legal representatives must have given their written informed consent to participate in the study after receiving adequate previous information and prior to any study specific procedures Patients with FEV1 &lt; 35% of predicted. FEV1 (forced expiratory volume) is a measure of lung function. This exclusion will prohibit enrollment of patients with severely impaired lung function.
