	<brief_title>A Test of the Effectiveness of a Device for Pediatric Immunization Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Needle pain is the most common and the most feared source of childhood pain, resulting in needle phobia for 10% of adults. Current standard of care for immunizations in the us provides analgesia 6% of the time. An inexpensive, immediately acting form of needle pain control could reduce needle phobia or vaccine refusal in the long term if demonstrated to be effective for immunization pain. This study will evaluate pain responses using video-coded FLACC scores for patients undergoing routine pre-school immunizations. Parent and patient pain assessments, as well as demographic information and pre-procedural anxiety coded from videos will be included.</detailed_description>
