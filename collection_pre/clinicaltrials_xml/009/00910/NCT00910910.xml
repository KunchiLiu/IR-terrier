	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide as a first line therapy in treating patients with B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. This study will compare the effects (good and bad) of lenalidomide with chlorambucil.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of The Effectiveness &amp; Safety Of Lenalidomide Versus Chlorambucil As First Line Therapy For Elderly Patients With B-Cell CLL (The ORIGIN Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After notification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 July 2013, Celgene agreed to discontinue the lenalidomide treatment for all patients due to an imbalance in the number of deaths in patients treated with lenalidomide versus patients treated with chlorambucil. No specific causality for this imbalance has been identified to date. Investigators were instructed to immediately discontinue all participants from experimental lenalidomide treatment and inform their patients accordingly. Participants on the Chlorambucil arm may continue up to 12 months (13 cycles) with the last participant completing in March 2014. All randomized participants will continue to be followed for overall survival and secondary primary malignancies.</detailed_description>
