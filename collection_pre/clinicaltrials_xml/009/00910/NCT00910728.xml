	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to test study drug AZD1480 to see how it may work to treat myeloproliferative diseases. The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of AZD1480. This is the first time the drug has been given to humans and is classed as a first time in man study. Its main purpose is to establish a safe dosage of the drug and provide additional information on any potential side effects this drug may cause. The study will also assess the blood levels and action of AZD1480 in the body over a period of time and will indicate whether the drug has a therapeutic effect on myeloproliferative diseases.</brief_summary>
