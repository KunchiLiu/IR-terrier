	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of prasugrel versus clopidogrel for the reduction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel after successful implantation of coronary drug-eluting stents. To determine the adverse event profile of prasugrel in patients with high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel after implantation of coronary drug-eluting stents. To determine the effect of prasugrel on inhibition of platelet activation in patients with high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Have coronary artery disease and clinical indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of at least one drugeluting stent and where percutaneous coronary intervention of all treated lesions is successful. Have been given standardofcare clopidogrel 600mg loading dose between 24 hours before and at the time of PCI. Standard of Care Aspirin use prior to PCI at least 250mg [intravenous (IV) or oral] within 24 hours before PCI and at the time of PCI. VerifyNow P2Y12 reaction units &gt; 208 measured 27 hours after clopidogrel maintenance dose the day after successful PCI. NonST segment elevation myocardial infarction within 14 days prior to randomization STsegment elevation myocardial infarction within 14 days prior to randomization Have known major complications after percutaneous coronary intervention and prior to randomization Have a body weight &lt; 60 kilogram (kg) Have cardiogenic shock at time of randomization Have refractory ventricular arrhythmias Have New York Heart Association Class IV congestive heart failure Have received glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors eptifibatide or tirofiban within 24 hrs before or during percutaneous coronary intervention or abciximab within 10 days before or during percutaneous coronary intervention Are receiving daily treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) inhibitors that cannot be discontinued or are anticipated to require &gt; 2 weeks of daily treatment during the study</criteria>
