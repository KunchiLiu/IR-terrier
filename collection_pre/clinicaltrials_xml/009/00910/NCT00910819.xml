	<detailed_description>The TKK is a prospective, longitudinal, nation wide cohort study with the purpose to record information on the antineoplastic treatment of colorectal cancer in Germany. The registry will follow patients for up to five years. It will identify common therapeutic sequences and changes in the treatment of the disease. At inclusion, data in patient characteristics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, biomarker testing and previous treatments are collected. During the course of observation data on all systemic treatments, radiotherapies, surgeries, and outcome are documented. The impact of nutrition (CoNut) and physical activity (CoNut) on the course of the adjuvant disease will be examined, as well as long-term effects of adjuvant treatment (CoTox) and the final phase of the palliative process (CoLife). Based on the available data a prognostic score will be developed.</detailed_description>
