	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of formoterol and beclometasone dipropionate on central and peripheral airway dimensions in asthmatic patients using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Further more, the effect of this combination therapy on exhaled NO, lung function (spirometry, body plethysmography, diffusion and resistance) and subjective asthma control score as well as the safety of this combination will be assessed.</brief_summary>
