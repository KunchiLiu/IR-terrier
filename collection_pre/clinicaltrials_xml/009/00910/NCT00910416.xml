	<brief_summary>The assessment of anesthesia depth was based, until recently, on the evolution of hemodynamic parameters. Nowadays it can be evaluated by several monitoring methods, derived from electroencephalogram analysis, namely the Bispectral Index (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, USA). A new modality is currently under development: the NeuroSENSE (Cleveland Medical Devices Inc., Cleveland, OH 44103, USA). The goal of this study is to compare both monitoring modalities during anesthesia.</brief_summary>
