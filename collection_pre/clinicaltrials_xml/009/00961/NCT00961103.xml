	<brief_summary>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is neurodegenerative disease of anterior horn cells of spinal cord and represents the second more frequent pathology in childhood. According to the age of onset and the maximum motor function the disorder is classified in 4 types. Patients with SMA II and SMA III often use orthoses to achieve postural and dynamic functions. In this retrospective observational study the investigators describe the characteristics of sitting position, standing and walking correlated to type and time of orthoses used.</brief_summary>
