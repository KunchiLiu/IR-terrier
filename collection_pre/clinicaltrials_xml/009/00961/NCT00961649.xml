	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of a new fixed combination of brinzolamide/brimonidine (Brinz/Brim) to: - its individual components (Brinz and Brim), and - the concomitant administration of Brinz and Brim (Brinz+Brim).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 5 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and the treatment phase, which included 2 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2 and Week 6 (or early exit). A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized to 1 of 4 study drug groups for 6 weeks. Study drug instillation began the morning after the second eligibility visit. The study was terminated by the sponsor out of caution due to microgel formation in the Brinz/Brim formulation. 13 remaining active subjects were discontinued. Further analysis revealed that neither the drop size nor the concentration of the active ingredients was affected.</detailed_description>

Any form of glaucoma other than openangle glaucoma. Severe central vision loss in either eye. Chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye disease. Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months. Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the preceding 3 months. Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment. Bestcorrected visual acuity score worse than 55 letters using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart. Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the administration of study product. Ocular surgery within the preceding 6 months. Ocular laser surgery within the preceding 3 months. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Any other conditions, including severe illness, which could make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study. Other protocolspecified exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
