	<brief_summary>This study compares the feasibility and efficacy of an individually tailored, child-centered, Internet-based behavioral intervention with that of general Internet-based health information for improving health behaviors and relative weight in Chinese-American children during a 6-month period. A total of 60 children (age 10-14) and their families will be randomized to either the intervention group or control group. The intervention is based on the Social Cognitive Theory and Transtheoretical Model.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study will use a randomized experimental design to examine the effects of an individually tailored, Internet-based behavioral intervention program on improving health behavior (dietary intake and physical activity) and anthropometrics of Chinese-American children. A total of 60 children and their families will be recruited. The intervention will include a weekly Internet session tailored to each individual child for eight weeks and three Internet sessions for parents. Children and their parents in the control group will receive general health information on healthy eating, active lifestyles, dental care, smoking cessation, and risk taking issues via the Internet. The content of the sessions is described later. After informed consent is obtained from parents and verbal assent from the children, baseline data (T0) will be collected before assigning the children and parents to the intervention group or control group. Follow-up data for both groups will be collected at 2 months (T1), 4 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) after baseline.</detailed_description>
