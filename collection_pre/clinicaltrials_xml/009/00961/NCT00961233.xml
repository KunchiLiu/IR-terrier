	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to conduct a clinical trial of two formulations of budesonide (nebulized/swallowed versus viscous/swallowed) in patients with EoE to determine if medication contact time and distribution in the esophagus relates to treatment response. The investigators will also determine if there is systemic absorption of these topical steroids. The investigators hypothesize that tissue and symptom response will correlate with esophageal medication contact time and distribution, and that significant systemic absorption will not be seen.</brief_summary>
