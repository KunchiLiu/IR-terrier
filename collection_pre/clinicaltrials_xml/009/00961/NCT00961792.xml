	<brief_summary>This study attempts to elucidate the factors that contribute to escalation and maintenance of excessive ethanol drinking in young adults by: 1. Examining subjective and objective response differences to alcohol and other common substances in a sample of young, adult social drinkers with varying consumption patterns. 2. Determining whether response to alcohol and other substances is predictive of future consumption patterns through longitudinal follow-up interviews. 3. Examining the relationship between responses to alcohol and other substances at baseline and re-examination testing to evaluate if consumption patterns moderate this relationship.</brief_summary>
