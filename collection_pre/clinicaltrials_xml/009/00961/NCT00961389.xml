	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of delirium in adults patients who are admitted at the critical care unit of a Dutch University Hospital with the mapping of relevant delirium risk factors The primary aim is to validate the investigators' developed delirium prediction model for critical care patients. A secondary aim is to find differences between delirious patients and non-delirious patients on different aspects of diagnostics, treatment and care, outcome, length of stay, and inflammation. According to Dutch law, the need to obtain informed consent was waived by the Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CMO) of Nijmegen for this observational study (2007/283).</brief_summary>
