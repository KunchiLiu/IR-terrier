	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of belly dance as a treatment for pain and improving the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia. Eighty female patients with fibromyalgia between 18 to 65 years were randomly allocated to a dance group (n=40) and control group (n=40). Patients in the dance group underwent 16 weeks of belly dance twice a week, while the patients in the control group remained on a waiting list. Patients were evaluated with regard to pain (Visual Analogue Scale), function (6 minute walk test), quality of life (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and SF-36), depression (Beck Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and self-image (Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination) questionnaire. Evaluations were carried out at baseline, after 16 weeks and after 32 weeks.</brief_summary>
