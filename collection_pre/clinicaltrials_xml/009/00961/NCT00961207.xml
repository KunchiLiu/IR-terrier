	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis: Reduction in albuminuria has been shown to decrease progression of diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic nephropathy patients treated with maximal antihypertensive doses with dual RAAS blockade (total daily dose valsartan 320 mg and either enalapril 40 mg or benazepril 40 mg daily, or losartan 100mg), persistent albuminuria reflects further additional RAAS activation. Microvascular renal disease due to increased RAAS activation may be more effectively treated with triple blockade by the addition of a direct renin inhibitor (DRI) Aliskiren.</brief_summary>
