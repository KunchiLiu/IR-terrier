Patient status should be confirmed by pregnancy test before enrollment. 1. Evidence of diabetes (FPG&gt; 125 mg/dL, or OGTT 2hour glucose&gt;=200 mg/dL, or current use of an antidiabetic agents, except for history of gestational diabetes). 2. History of intolerance or hypersensitivity or contraindication as mentioned in the approved package insert (appendix). 3. Patient has any of the following disorders within the past 6 months: acute coronary syndrome (e.g., MI or unstable angina), coronary artery intervention (e.g., CABG or PTCA), stroke or transient ischemic neurological disorder. 4.
