	<brief_summary>This open-label study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin with or without pemetrexed as maintenance therapy in patients with advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. In Part 1, patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with Avastin (7.5mg/kg iv) plus cisplatin (75mg/m2 iv) plus pemetrexed (500mg/m2 iv) on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. In Part 2, patients responding to treatment will be randomized to receive further treatment cycles of Avastin (7.5mg/kg iv every 3 weeks) with or without pemetrexed (500mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks). Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression. Target sample size is &lt;500 individuals.</brief_summary>
