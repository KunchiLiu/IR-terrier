	<detailed_description>The investigators will use several approach to identify common genetic variations: single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genomic insertions and deletions, and genetic copy number variations (CNVs), interchromosomal translocations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and uniparental disomy (UPD), Epigenetic changes, such as silencing of gene expression via DNA hypermethylation, that can also influence drug effects, and aberrant methylation of CpG islands is a common feature of cancer cells. Over the years, methods of cytogenetic analysis evolved and became part of routine laboratory testing, providing valuable diagnostic and prognostic information in hematologic disorders. The recently developed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays offer the ability to define simultaneously the copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events occurring in a tumor, at high resolution and throughout the genome. In addition to information on copy number changes, SNP arrays allow us to investigate the impact of a high number of SNPs on drug response and toxicity This molecular integrated approach will lead to the identification of alterations potentially involved in the complex mechanisms of leukemogenesis and at the identification and validation of novel biological factors which may serve as predictors of drug-response and drug-resistance or which may be suitable for targeted therapy.</detailed_description>
