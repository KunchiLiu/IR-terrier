	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy Study of Optimizing Ibuprofen Dosing to Achieve Higher PDA Closure Rates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Failure to close the PDA in premature neonates in a timely fashion can lead to pulmonary over-circulation and systemic under-circulation. The PDA often fails to close using currently approved Ibuprofen dosing regimens, and surgical closure becomes necessary. Ibuprofen clearance in premature neonates is significantly correlated with postnatal age, increasing rapidly over time. Hirt et al. published and optimized dosing scheme for preterm neonates based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. We aim to use this dosing regimen in the clinical setting to determine if increased rates of pharmacologic PDA closure can be achieved.</detailed_description>
