	<brief_title>Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics of 400 mg Oral Dose of Raltegravir in HIV-Infected Pre-Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants: Six HIV-positive pre-menopausal women already undergoing therapy with raltegravir. Procedures (methods): This study will be conducted at a single site: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. An outpatient screening visit will assess subject suitability and willingness to participate. During one pharmacokinetic visit women will be asked to self-collect cervicovaginal samples using a cervicovaginal fluid aspirator at the following time points: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after raltegravir 400mg dose administration. One 3mL EDTA tube will be collected at the same time points to analyze blood plasma. A follow-up safety visit will be completed within 30 days of the inpatient stay.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load Able to provide informed consent In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with their treatment regimen and study procedures Currently receiving raltegravir as treatment for HIV infection. Subjects must have been on raltegravir for at least 3 weeks prior to the inpatient pharmacokinetic sampling stay. All women of reproductive potential (who have not reached menopause or undergone bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum Î²HCG pregnancy test performed at screening. Subjects must test negative for sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, or syphilis) at screening All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant). Subjects must be willing to abstain from intercourse, and vaginal instrumentation, including douching, within the 48 hours prior to all study visits. If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy between study visits, the female study volunteer/male partner must use at least one reliable method of contraception (e.g., condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an IUD) Pregnancy Breastfeeding Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator is likely to interfere with followup or ability to take the study medication appropriately A positive test for bacterial vaginosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas</criteria>
