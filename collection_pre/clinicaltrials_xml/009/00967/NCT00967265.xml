	<brief_summary>Patient participation is a central concept in Norwegian health policy. It is mandatory in hospitals and emphasised as one of the most prioritised areas by the Government. Studies from Norway have repeatedly found that patients who seek help in community mental health centres ("DPS") are dissatisfied with the information they receive and about their possibility for real influence in their treatment. One way to improve individual patient participation might be to give patients information before they start their treatment. This can be done as group based patient education to reduce the resources needed. Furthermore, as there are waiting lists for treatment, such introduction seminars could be held while patients are waiting to use this time in a meaningful way. The present study therefore aims at testing the effect of an introduction seminar for patients on waiting list in a community mental health centre.</brief_summary>
