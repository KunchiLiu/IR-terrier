	<brief_summary>Rehabilitative treatment in stroke survivors has shown to be effective in improving functional outcome and reducing dependency. Plasticity of the central nervous system, along with coping strategies and adaptations, seems to play a key role in functional recovery. Some data support the hypothesis that drug which improve dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic transmission in the central nervous system could improve recovery in stroke patients. In this population, antidepressants as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are associated to better outcomes, as evidenced by small clinical trials. However, since depression is a common consequence of stroke, observed improvements could be biased by the action of these drugs on depressive symptoms, thus improving participation in rehabilitative treatment. The hypothesis of this study is that SSRI could improve functional outcome in stroke survivors not only because of their action on depressive symptoms, but mainly because of a direct effect on neural repair and neuronal growth. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a SSRI, escitalopram, on functional outcome of stroke patients.</brief_summary>
