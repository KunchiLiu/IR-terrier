	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to see if KRX-0502 (ferric citrate) is safe and effective as a dietary phosphate binder in controlling and managing serum phosphorus levels in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of a New Formulation of KRX-0502 (Ferric Citrate) in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, non-blinded, efficacy and tolerability trial in patients with ESRD on dialysis three times per week. Approximately 24 patients (approximately twelve diabetic patients and approximately twelve non-diabetic patients) in Israel will be initiated on KRX-0502 (ferric citrate). The study will consist of a two-week washout period immediately followed by a six-week treatment period in. Patients will be initiated on study drug over two to three weeks.</detailed_description>
