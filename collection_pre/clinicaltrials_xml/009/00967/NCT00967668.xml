	<brief_summary>ASPIRE has completed enrollment of patients at the Ann Arbor and Cleveland Medical Centers in a study that is examining the impact of an innovative approach to weight loss ("Aspiring to Lifelong Health in VA", aka "ASPIRE-VA"). ASPIRE-VA has 3 key features: 1) lifestyle coaches who encourage behavior change through a "small steps" approach; 2) a simplified "Stoplight" diet; and 3) user-friendly "enhanced" pedometers to help participants monitor their physical activity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Nearly 78% of Veterans are overweight or obese, imposing a tremendous burden on the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare system for the treatment of obesity-related chronic disease and disability. While weight management treatment has been implemented in VHA, program data shows low enrollment, participation, and weight loss. Traditional behavioral weight loss trials frequently exclude individuals with multiple chronic health conditions. Additionally, men are less likely than women to participate in these trials. New weight loss approaches may be needed to treat these populations. Objectives: To test whether a small-changes intervention (The Aspiring to Lifelong Health Program; aka ASPIRE), delivered in groups or individually via telephone, promotes greater weight loss than standard obesity treatment in a predominantly male, high-risk Veteran population. Data were collected in 2010-13. Methods: A three-arm, 12-month randomized pragmatic effectiveness trial was conducted. Participants were recruited from MOVE! referrals and randomly assigned to one of three programs: the 12-month ASPIRE weight loss program delivered 1) individually over the phone (ASPIRE-Phone) or 2) in-person group sessions (ASPIRE-Group); compared to 3) Veteran Health Administration's VHA standard weight loss program, MOVE!. Participants in the ASPIRE arms met with health coaches weekly in months 1-3, bi-weekly in months 4-9, and monthly in months 10-12. Usual care participants met weekly for 12 weeks with limited options for follow-up care. The ASPIRE program had distinct characteristics: 1) the opportunity for most participants to work with one lifestyle coach throughout treatment, 2) an emphasis on behavior change through a "small steps" approach; 3) the prominence of self-monitoring both physical activity and food intake as a weight loss tool; and 4) the addition of a purely phone based option. Assessments that included the collection of weight, waist circumference and lab values, along with questionnaires, were conducted at baseline, 3-months and 12-months. ASPIRE also added a follow-up component to the study, which was offered to patients at their 12-month assessment. For phone and group patients, it consisted of sessions every other month and an assessment at 18 and 24 months. Usual care patients participated in the assessments only. Phone-based Interviews were conducted shortly after the 3-month assessment with 19 patients in the ASPIRE phone arm and with 16 in the ASPIRE group arm. These interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using NVivo qualitative software to identify themes associated with successful weight loss at 3-month. Approximately 5% of all phone and group intervention sessions were audio-recorded. An expert rater used a checklist to rate session fidelity. A second rater independently assessed 30% of the recorded sessions to establish inter-rater reliability. The checklist was psychometrically validated. It was hypothesized that greater adherence to core behavioral change processes and patient-centered communication strategies by the interventionists would be associated with higher levels of weight loss. Using intention-to-treat principles guide all analyses. The primary outcome was weight change and secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometric (e.g., waist circumference), behavioral, fitness, psychosocial, and physiological measures. The primary analytic approach relied on a linear mixed-effects model with baseline, 3- and 12-month outcomes (e.g., weight) as dependent variables, with each subject as a random intercept to adjust for within-patient correlation of the repeated measures, fixed predictors of study arm indicators, 3- and 12-month time indicators, and time-by-study arm interactions. Status: All coaching and assessments are complete. A design and rationale paper has been published, a paper highlighting 12-month results is in revision. Papers on fidelity, qualitative findings, the role of mental illness and binge eating on weight loss are in progress. Analyses of 24-month data are underway.</detailed_description>
