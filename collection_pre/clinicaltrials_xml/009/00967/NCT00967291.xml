	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin C and ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving mitomycin C together with ifosfamide works in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mitomycin C and Ifosfamide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To assess the therapeutic activity of a mitomycin C and ifosfamide combination, in terms of progression-free survival rate at 6 months, in patients with metastatic stage IV adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. OUTLINE: Patients receive mitomycin C IV on day 1 and ifosfamide IV on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
