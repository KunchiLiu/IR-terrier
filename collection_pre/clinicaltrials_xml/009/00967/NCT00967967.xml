	<brief_summary>Many patients suffering from allergic rhinitis do not recognize or perceive their symptoms. Instruments have been developed to assess quality of life in rhinitis, asthma or both, but there is a need to develop validated tools or methods to assess rhinitis control among rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients. The aim of this study is to assess the discriminative and evaluative properties of the RCSS in asthmatic patients with allergic rhinitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of the Rhinitis Control Scoring System (RCSS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic asthmatic subjects showing seasonal rhinitis symptoms will be recruited. The discriminative (internal consistency, cross sectional construct validity and reliability) and evaluative (responsiveness and longitudinal construct validity) properties of the RCSS will be evaluated as well as the relationship between rhinitis control and asthma control. RCSS will be completed at various time points during the seasonal allergic period.</detailed_description>
