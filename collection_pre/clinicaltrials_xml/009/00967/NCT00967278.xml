	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the positioning and stabilization of different cardiac walls performed during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may have dissimilar impact on hemodynamics. The objective is to evaluate hemodynamics during distal coronary anastomoses in different cardiac walls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Twenty patients undergoing off-pump CABG monitored with pulmonary artery catheter and esophageal doppler will be enrolled. - Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%, age &gt;80 yr, creatinine &gt;1.4 mg/dl, reoperation, valvular heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded - Data will be collected after volemic and hemodynamic adjustments, after heart positioning and establishment of a suction stabilizer and before its removal in anterior, lateral or posterior wall artery anastomosis. - Data was compared by means of two-way repeated measures ANOVA.</detailed_description>
