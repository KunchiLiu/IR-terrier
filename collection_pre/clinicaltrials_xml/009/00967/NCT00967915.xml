	<detailed_description>The primary objective of our study is to determine if frenotomy (or release of tongue tie) for ankyloglossia (tongue tie) will decrease maternal nipple pain with breast feeding and improve infant's ability to breast feed. Our secondary objective is to determine if frenotomy for ankyloglossia will improve the length of time a mother breast feeds. Our hypothesis is that frenotomy will decrease maternal nipple pain, improve infant's breast feeding and prolong the duration of breast feeding.</detailed_description>
