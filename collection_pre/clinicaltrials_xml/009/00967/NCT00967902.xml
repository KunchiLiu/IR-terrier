	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria The patient must be ≥18 and ≤ 80 years of age; Symptomatic ischemic heart disease (CCS class 14, Braunwald Class IB, IC, IIB, IIC, IIIB, IIIC, and/or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia); Acceptable candidate for CABG; The Patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations; The Patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics Committee (MEC), Institutional Review Board (IRB), or Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). Angiographic Single de novo or nonstented restenotic lesion in the target vessel; Patients with twovessel coronary disease, may have undergone successful treatment (&lt;20% diameter stenosis by visual estimate) of the nontarget vessel with approved devices up to and including the index procedure but must be prior to the index target vessel treatment. Any nontarget vessel or lesion intended to be treated during the index procedure, cannot be an unprotected left main, ostial lesion, chronic total occlusion (CTO), heavily calcified, bifurcation, vein grafts, have angiographic evidence of thrombus, be anything requiring atherectomy, thrombectomy, or pretreatment with anything other than balloon angioplasty; Target lesion located in a native coronary artery; Target lesion (maximum length is 20 mm by visual estimate) covered by a single stent maximum 23 mm length for Combo Stent, and 24 mm in length for TAXUS® Liberté® (stent coverage including at least 3 mm of healthy vessel is recommended). The lesion length should be measured after predilation procedure; Reference vessel diameter must be ≥2.5 to ≤ 3.5 mm by visual estimate. The vessel diameter should be measured after predilation procedure and after intracoronary nitroglycerin if spasm is suspected; Target lesion ≥50% and &lt;100% stenosed by visual estimate. General Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test; Patient has had a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours preceding the index procedure (elevated troponin or CKMB ≥2 times upper limit of normal) or &gt;72 hours preceding the index procedure and CK and CKMB have not returned to within normal limits at the time of procedure; The patient is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset AMI, such as nitrate unresponsive prolonged chest pain; Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/l) or on dialysis; Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm3; Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated; Patient requires low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment postprocedure or has received a dose of LMWH ≤8 hours prior to index procedure; Patient has received any organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant; Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer, known malignancy, or congestive heart failure) or known history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than 1 year); Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin/bivalirudin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, prasugrel, stainless steel alloy, sirolimus, paclitaxel and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately premedicated; Patient has previously received murine therapeutic antibodies and exhibited sensitization through the production of Human AntiMurine Antibodies (HAMA); Patient presents with cardiogenic shock; Patient has current unstable cardiac arrhythmias that create hemodynamic instability; Patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion; Any significant medical condition which in the Investigator's opinion may interfere with the patient's optimal participation in the study; Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study or patient in inclusion in another investigational drug or device study during followup; Angiographic Unprotected left main coronary artery disease with ≥50% stenosis; Ostial target lesion(s); Totally occluded target vessel (TIMI flow 0); Calcified target lesion(s) which cannot be successfully predilated; Target lesion has excessive tortuosity unsuitable for stent delivery and deployment; Angiographic evidence of thrombus in the target lesion(s); Target lesion involving bifurcation with a side branch ≥2.0 mm in diameter (either stenosis of both main vessel and major side branch or stenosis of just major side branch) that would require intervention of diseased side branch; A significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that cannot be covered by same single stent; Diffuse distal disease to target lesion with impaired runoff; Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤30% (LVEF must be obtained within 6 months prior to the index procedure); Pretreatment with devices other than balloon angioplasty; Prior stent within 10 mm of target lesion; Intervention (PCI or bypass) of another lesion performed within 6 months before or planned within 30 days following the index procedure.</criteria>
