	<brief_summary>The purpose of the validation study is to develop a valid test battery for assessing driving ability in a driving simulator when influenced by drugs. Ethanol has known, well-documented and well-characterized effects on driving behaviour and accident risk, and will be used to assess the simulator test scenarios' sensitivity to drug effects. Once the test scenarios have been refined and their ability to predict driving accident risk have been validated, we plan to use the simulator to assess driving ability under the influence of different drugs suspected to produce driving impairment.</brief_summary>
