	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of xenotransplantation of DIABECELL(R)[immunoprotected (alginate-encapsulated) porcine islets] in patients with established type 1 diabetes mellitus, and to establish preliminary evidence of the efficacy of DIABECELL(R), as measured by a reduction in serial hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intraperitoneal islet transplantation has the potential to ameliorate type 1 diabetes mellitus and avert the long-term consequences of chronic diabetes which cannot be achieved by conventional insulin treatment. As donor human islets are not available in sufficient numbers, porcine islets are the best alternative source as they are recognised as the most physiologically compatible xenogeneic insulin-producing cells. Although the use of pig-derived cells raises the risk of xenotic infections, this can be minimised by obtaining cells from designated pathogen-free (DPF) animals bred in isolation and monitored to be free of specified pathogens. The worldwide experience to date in more than 200 patients who have received transplants of pig tissue has not demonstrated evidence of transmitted xenotic infections. As animal-derived tissues have to be protected from immune rejection when transplanted into humans, transplants are usually accompanied by immunosuppressive therapy. However, porcine islets are preferably transplanted without the use of immunosuppressive drugs which cause significant morbidity. To protect them from immune rejection, the islets can be encapsulated in alginate microcapsules which permit the inward passage of nutrients and glucose and the outward passage of insulin. Alginate-encapsulated porcine islets transplanted without immunosuppressive drugs have survived rejection for many months in animal studies, and have been retrieved from a diabetic patient over 9.5 years after intraperitoneal transplantation and shown to contain viable islets that stain positive for insulin. DIABECELL® comprises neonatal porcine islets encapsulated in alginate microcapsules. DIABECELL® has been safely transplanted in healthy and diabetic mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and non-human primates. Following DIABECELL® transplants, the requirement for daily insulin was significantly reduced in diabetic rats and non-human primates. The optimal dose and frequency of transplantation of the current DIABECELL® preparation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in humans can only be determined in clinical trials. The intention of this phase I/IIa clinical trial is to obtain at least 52 weeks safety and preliminary efficacy data in type 1 diabetic patients following transplantation of a single low effective dose of DIABECELL® into the peritoneal cavity.</detailed_description>

Patients should have been treated continuously with insulin since diagnosis (Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus 2002) Patients with established brittle type I diabetes mellitus with a welldocumented chronic history of severe metabolic instability who cannot achieve acceptable metabolic control without experiencing multiple episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, often with unawareness; or with degrees of hypoglycaemia, who cannot be adequately managed with intensive insulin therapy alone despite intensive diabetes management delivered by a qualified diabetes team for at least six months prior to enrolment Patients should have an HbA1C ≥7% and ≤10% calculated as the average of the last four consecutive HbA1C readings during the 8week baseline runin period. The difference between the highest and lowest of the four HbA1C reading should be no more than 0.5%.
