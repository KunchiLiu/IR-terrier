	<brief_summary>Prematurity represents 8% of birth and it is one of the leading causes of infant complications. The preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) represents one-third of preterm birth and the rupture of membranes increase the risk of fetal exposition to infection which could lead to neurological sequels. Classic management of women with PPROM before 32SA is based on the extension of the pregnancy with the risk of adding complications like a secondary infection. Moreover, different studies have shown that fetal infection could be one of the most important risk factor for subsequent neurological complications. However, it is difficult to know if it is better to extend the pregnancy to gain in maturity or to arrest the pregnancy to avoid the risk of intrauterine infection. The research objective is to suggest a new strategy to manage women with PPROM. With this new strategy, the investigators seek to extend pregnancy as much as possible but the investigators would like to give birth before the intrauterine infection. The investigators suggest detecting protein associate with neurological complications of preterm child in the amniotic liquid found in the vagina of the mother. A positive test will lead to the delivery of the newborn before its infection. The hypothesis is that it is possible to study changes in the inflammatory status of patients who presented an PPROM from repeated detection of interleukins in vaginal secretions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring of the Inflammatory Response of Patients With Premature Rupture of Membranes With Bedside Tests</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) represents one-third of preterm births and is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. During the latency period, several events such as the ascent of pathogenic microorganisms from the lower genital area could create complications which may culminate in cerebral palsy. Avoiding intrauterine infection appears as one of the most important objective in the PPROM management. Most authors propose the conservative management of women with PPROM, associating antibiotic therapy to corticosteroid administration in patients with PPROM before 30 to 32 weeks. The main benefit of conservative management is prolonging pregnancy, but the benefit must be balanced with the risks of fetal complications. In an effort to diminish the risks of infection linked to a longer latency period, several authors have proposed intentional delivery after PPROM. The primary objective is the comparison between the results of IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHY tests done at the bedside of the patient and the ELISA tests performed in the laboratory. The secondary outcome is the description of the inflammatory status following a rupture of membranes at term and during labor. Vaginal secretions samplings are perform after premature rupture of membranes and during labor. The bedside test is performing immediately after sampling and the rest of the sampling is frozen. ELISA assays will be performed on these samples.</detailed_description>
