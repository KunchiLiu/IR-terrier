	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care for individuals with multiple chronic conditions, health care systems have begun turning to coordinated care. Although coordinated care can refer to many different things, it usually includes activities such as assessing patients' needs, referring them to the right doctors, helping them make and keep appointments, and helping them comply with medical or dietary recommendations. To understand the effects of coordinated care for high-needs Medicaid recipients, MDRC is conducting a randomized trial of a pilot coordinated care program run by Kaiser Permanente for blind and disabled Medicaid recipients in the Denver area.</brief_summary>
