	<brief_summary>Varicella zoster virus is part of the herpesvirus group and causes chickenpox in exposed individuals. The majority of the population is seropositive for this virus. Reactivation of varicella zoster virus occurs in up to 30% of the general population over 60 years old. Solid organ transplant recipients receive lifelong immunosuppression drugs and are at great risk of reactivation of all herpesviruses including the varicella zoster virus regardless of age. The vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing shingles in the general population. The investigators' purpose is to determine how well the vaccine works in patients on renal replacement therapy and post-transplant.</brief_summary>
