	<brief_title>TS Gene Polymorphism Predicts Effect in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Main eligibility criteria were histologic or cytologic proof of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) primary treatment, normal organ function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2. 2. All Patients were delivered to pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 for not less than 4 cycle, administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Response assessment was performed every 6 weeks; toxicity assessment was performed every 3 weeks. 3. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. 4. The study was designed to evaluate TS(thymidylate synthase) gene polymorphism as a predictor for advanced lung adenocarcinoma effect to pemetrexed combined with cisplatin regiment as first-line treatment. 5. Polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase were investigated in peripheral WBC（white blood cell）of all patients.</detailed_description>
