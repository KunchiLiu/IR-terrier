	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Assessment of an Anti-Cold Preparation in the Symptomatic Treatment of Common Cold and Flu-Like Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper respiratory infections are rather frequent in the population, and their treatment consists, in most cases, in the use of symptomatic drugs. Acetaminophen is widely used as an analgesic and antipyretic, whereas chlorpheniramine is an antihistaminic and phenylephrine is a vasoconstrictor with decongestioning activity. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of an anti-cold preparation, currently commercialized in Brazil by the name Resfenol, compounded by acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine for the treatment of cold and flu symptoms in healthy individuals in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Healthy volunteers are recruited through panels fixated at Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre, in Brazil, and must answer a screening questionnaire at first contact. One hundred and forty six patients who met the inclusion criteria were included and, after baseline clinical and laboratory evaluation, were randomized to receive either the active intervention or placebo, 5 times a day, at 4 hour intervals, during 48 to 72 hours, depending on patient availability to show up for re-evaluation. Patients also received acetaminophen as a co intervention, to be taken only in case of persisting symptoms. Patients answered, during treatment, several symptom questionnaires contained in a diary, and followup was performed at days 3 or 4 (clinical and laboratory evaluation) and 10 or 11 (clinical followup). Axillary temperature was assessed along with every dose with a thermometer provided by the study and registered in the diary. Primary endpoint consists in the mean symptom scores, assessed through questionnaires in patient diary, baseline and followup. Secondary endpoints are global duration of symptoms, time of return to usual activities, use of co intervention for symptom relief, improval of fever and adverse effect evaluation.</detailed_description>
