	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Anti-Emetic Efficacy of Ginger in Children and Adolescents Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent with high emetogenic potential. High doses of Cisplatin (120 mg/m2) induces nausea and vomiting in 90 % of patients. More than 60% of patients experience nausea and vomiting even if they are getting the conventional anti emetic medications. Children and adolescents with cancer are using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to relieve symptoms, reduce side effects of treatment, and cope with the emotional aspects of having a life-threatening illness. Parental decisions about using CAM should be based on studies of efficacy and safety . Ginger is already used in traditional folk medicine to treat nausea and vomiting.Additionally, ginger's ability to block 5-HT3 receptors and its free-radical scavenging action in the gut suggests that it may be beneficial for reducing both the prevalence and severity of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. Ginger is an easily available and cost effective substance in Indian scenario; (1gm costs less than one rupees). A dose of 1-2 gm of ginger is found to have favourable effects in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting. There are not much side-effects of ginger have been established so far, except mild stomach upset, increased burping and nausea seen in very few patients after the ingestion of ginger. Ginger is a widely available,affordable and acceptable natural substance which is to be included as an additional treatment option for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting which will significantly improve the health, compliance with treatment and quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
