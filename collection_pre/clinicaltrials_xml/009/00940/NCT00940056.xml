	<brief_summary>Primary Objective To evaluate the efficiency of totally endoscopic ablation of AF compared to rate control management of AF. Secondary Objectives Does totally endoscopic ablation: - reduce atrial fibrillation symptoms? - increase working capacity and improve quality of life? - improve atrial function? - reduce the risk for stroke?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Totally Endoscopic Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized open controlled single centre study that involves 60 patients (men and women) over the age of 50 years with longstanding persistent AF of more than one year duration and in the absence of other severe cardiopulmonary disease. One of the participating investigators informs the patient, both verbally and in writing, about the study and what participation in the study involves. The patient will be given time to ask questions and to consider study participation and can be enrolled in the study after signing and dating written Informed Consent. Study duration per patient is 12 months. After inclusion, the patient will be divided into one of two groups, treatment group or control group, according to block wise randomization. The patient will be asked to complete two health related questionnaires SF 36 and SCL and a transthoracic echocardiography will be conducted together with an exercise test. The patients will thereafter be assessed according to randomisation. Irrespective of group, the patients will be rescheduled for a visit within two months for totally endoscopic ablation and Reveal implantation or just Reveal implantation (control group). All patients will then be assessed during follow-ups after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
