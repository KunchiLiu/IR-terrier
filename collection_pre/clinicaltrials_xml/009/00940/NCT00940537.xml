	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how effective the investigators' optimized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequence in quantifying hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) to enhance MRS as a diagnostic tool in non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) Validation Study in Individuals With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One way to gauge MRS as an effective diagnostic tool is by looking at the reproducibility of the liver fat measurements on subjects by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV). This study assesses the modified MRS sequence, using both breath holds and free breathing. The HTGC levels are measured twice in the same individuals on two independent events separated by 10 minutes. Subjects are then given a high fat, high carbohydrate meal of Pizza Hut pizza, Pepsi, and Oreo cookies. Two hours after eating the meal, the subjects return to the scanner and repeat all MRS scans.</detailed_description>
