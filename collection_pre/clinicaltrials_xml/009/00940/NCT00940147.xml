	<brief_summary>Airway complications are a significant cause of morbidity after lung transplantation (LTx). Bronchoscopic evaluation may help to identify risk factors for requiring interventions later.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Endoscopic Indicators for OACs After Lung Transplantation: Development of a Novel Mucosal Healing Score</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators evaluated lung transplant recipients prospectively. Adult patients surviving 90 day after LTx will be included. The investigators propose a classification of airway healing based on the endoscopic bronchial appearances at days 7, 14, 21, 90, 180 and 365 after LTx. A score system including mucosal healing, full tissue necrosis (=dehiscence), lose sutures, fibrin plugs, polyps and malacia will be developed (max. score 8 points/date). Endoscopic findings will be correlated with the development of obstructive airway complications (OAC, requiring &gt;1 intervention). Afterwards the new score system will be applied prospectively in the patients.</detailed_description>
