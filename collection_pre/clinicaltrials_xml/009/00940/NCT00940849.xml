	<brief_summary>Background of the study: Plant sterols can play an important role in lowering plasma cholesterol. The extent to which plant sterols can reduce plasma cholesterol levels depends on the intake scenario. We suggest that the difference in these effects depends on gastric emptying and bile secretion. Objective of the study: The aim of this study is to gain insight in the mechanisms that may be involved in the effects of plant sterol drinks on gastric emptying and gallbladder motility. In order to test this, we compare the different effects of the consumption of a plant sterol containing drink prior to, during and after a standardized meal.</brief_summary>
