	<brief_summary>The aim of this exploratory randomized, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy of Circadin速 2mg in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease (AD) treated with the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. The effects of add-on Circadin速 2mg vs. placebo on the decline in cognitive skills and global functioning, as well as on daytime somnolence and will be assessed.</brief_summary>
