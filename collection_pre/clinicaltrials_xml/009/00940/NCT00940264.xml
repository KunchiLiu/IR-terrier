	<brief_summary>Transvaginal hybrid procedures especially the transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy are of interest as an available NOTES-Procedure for the clinical routine. Few authors have demonstrated the feasibility and safety in a selected patient collective. The aim of this prospective data collection is to evaluate the feasibility in the clinical routine in a non select patient collective. Therefore all patients giving the informed consent to the transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy will be included and assessed concerning feasibility to perform the transvaginal approach and complete the operation transvaginally.</brief_summary>
