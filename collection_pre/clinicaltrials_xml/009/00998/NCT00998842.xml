	<brief_title>Comparison of a Novel 12-Lead Wireless Electrocardiogram (ECG) and a Standard Wired ECG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to compare ECG recordings from the Signalife Fidelity 100 Wireless 12-lead ECG Monitor System to that of the GE 5000 Wired 12-lead ECG Monitor System during rest and while walking. We hypothesize that ECG recordings from the wireless system will be equivalent to recordings from the standard wired system.</detailed_description>
