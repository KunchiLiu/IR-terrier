	<brief_summary>- Study Design - Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, escalating single-dose design. - Five ascending dose cohorts. - In each cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of HM10460A or placebo (negative control) - Objectives - The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single escalating subcutaneous doses of HM10460A in healthy adult Korean Subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic (PK) Characteristics of HM10460A (HNK460) in Healthy Adult Korean Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: - to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A. - to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). - to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and CD34+ cell counts in the blood. - to assess the immunogenicity (HM10460A, native G-CSF antibody,neutralizing antibodies) of a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A.</detailed_description>
