	<brief_title>Stress Reduction Intervention for Enhancing Treatment Outcome for Depressed Minority Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of a stress reduction treatment compared to psychoeducation in helping minority patients with major depression get better. The study will last 10 weeks. During the main portion of the study, subjects will receive either individual weekly sessions of stress-reduction therapy or psychoeducation for six weeks. The stress reduction therapy will consist of mindfulness-based stress reduction and problem solving therapy, which focuses on linking psychological problems with psychosocial issues and helping you use your skills and resources to improve your functioning. The psychoeducation will consist of six sessions of education on depression and the treatment and management of symptoms. Each session will last 50 minutes, and four of the visits will also include filling out questionnaires which will take approximately 15-30 minutes to complete. One month after the last session, subjects will come in for a follow-up visit with a study clinician to see how they are doing and to fill out questionnaires.</detailed_description>
