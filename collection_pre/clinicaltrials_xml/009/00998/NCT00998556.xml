	<brief_title>Effect of Bromocriptine on Left Ventricular Function in Women With Peripartum Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a serious life threatening heart disease of unknown etiology in previously healthy women. Only a minority of patients recovers completely while the majority of PPCM patients develop persistent ventricular dysfunction and may experience severe heart failure leading to cardiac transplantation. Thus, these young patients are very sick at a time when the newborn would need a healthy mother. Many of PPCM patients need lifelong treatment causing a large financial and social burden. Indeed, a better understanding of the disease and more efficient therapeutic options are urgently needed. To date, no specific therapy is available so that patients are treated by medical pharmacotherapy for heart failure. Diagnosis of PPCM is usually made at advanced stages of the disease in severely symptomatic women but prognosis of affected women is poor with reported mortality rates of 15% and recovery in only 23% to 54% of PPCM patients despite optimal medical treatment. Therefore strategies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk and novel therapeutic approaches are required to improve poor prognosis of affected women. The trial would establish a new specific therapeutic regimen for PPCM and the investigators can expect that such a novel approach would be rapidly adopted in the clinical management of this disease. Since the trial design follows state-of the-art guidelines, the investigators assume that bromocriptine would shortly be adopted into clinical guidelines of the German Cardiac Society, European Cardiac Society, and the American Heart Association.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female subjects in the first 5 months postpartum with new onset of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (LV ejection fraction â‰¤35% as assessed by echocardiography) using the internationally accepted criteria for PPCM 1: absence of an identifiable cause of heart failure, absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy and LV systolic dysfunction demonstrated by classical echocardiographic criteria. Age equal or greater 18 Written informed consent of the patient Preexisting cardiac disease (except PPCM which had complete resolution in a previous pregnancy) Any preexisting serious conditions Previous cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention History of alcohol and/or any other drug abuse Contraindication to the planned therapy (e. g. hypersensitivity to trial medication or one of its components) Concomitant therapy other than specified in the trial protocol such as products for treatment of fungal infections, psychotropic drugs, medication with the active substances diclofenace, verapamil or doxycycline. Women with child bearing potency without effective contraception (i. e. implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs or vasectomized partner) during the conduct of the trial. Patients using hormonal methods of contraception must be informed about possible influences of the study drug on contraception, in addition heart failure drugs may interfere with contraception. Patients will be counselled about the safest method to be used for contraception. Expected low compliance (e.g. by travel distance to trial site) Concomitant participation in other clinical trials</criteria>
