	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a cross-curricular physical activity intervention on cardiovascular disease risk factors in 11-14 year olds. The null hypothesis states that the intervention will have no effect on cardiovascular disease risk factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Disease and the Effects of a Cross-curricular Physical Activity Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease including obesity, blood pressure and blood lipids have been shown to track from childhood through to adulthood. The prevalence of overweight and obesity for children (4-18 years) in the UK is reported to be 15 % and 4 % respectively. Furthermore, in comparison to England (2.9 %) obesity is more prevalent for those living in Scotland (7.6 %) and Wales (6.5 %). Previous research from two Welsh secondary schools indicate overweight and obesity rates for boys and girls aged 12-13 to be even greater at 26 % and 38 % respectively. Further to this, 19 % were identified as having elevated total cholesterol (â‰¥5.2 mmol/L). For many, overweight and obesity is the result of the combined effect of excess energy consumption and inadequate physical activity. Previous school-based physical activity interventions have demonstrated modest improvements to cardiovascular disease risk factors by implementing extra-curricular activities or improving current physical education curriculum. Few have attempted to increase physical activity using normally, class-room taught curriculum subjects. This study examines the impact of activity knowledge circuits to combat cardiovascular disease risk factors in 11-14 year old children.</detailed_description>
