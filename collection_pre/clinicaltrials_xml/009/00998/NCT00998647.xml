	<brief_title>Modified Ultrafiltration in Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact of modified ultrafiltration following extracorporeal circulation on primary and secondary hemostasis is controversial. In this study we intend to assess both, primary and secondary hemostasis prior to and after the usage of modified ultrafiltration. Primary hemostasis is assessed using Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (Multiplate) and secondary hemostasis is assessed performing thrombelastometry using the ROTEM device. Patients are preoperatively randomized to receive either modified ultrafiltration or no filtration.</detailed_description>
