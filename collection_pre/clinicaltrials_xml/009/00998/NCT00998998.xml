	<brief_title>The Anemia Control Program: Early Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with alterations in infant behavior and development that may not correct with iron therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine if a home-based intervention to foster child development improved behavior and development in infants with IDA. IDA and non-anemic infants were randomly assigned to a year of intervention or surveillance only. Infants were enrolled and began study participation at 6 or 12 months. All infants were treated with oral iron and visited weekly to record iron intake, feeding, and health (surveillance). For infants randomized to intervention, the weekly home visit included an hour-long program fostering child development by supporting the mother-infant relationship. Psychologists, unaware of iron status or intervention assignment, assessed cognitive, motor, and social-emotional development (Bayley Scales) at the beginning, midpoint, and end of the year.</detailed_description>
