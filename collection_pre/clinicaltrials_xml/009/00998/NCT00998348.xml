	<brief_title>Study of Parenting Intervention to Prevent Child Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early years between ages 3-7 are critical in the development of obesity. The importance of the family in the development of children's eating and activity behaviors has been emphasized by experts, yet to date no obesity prevention interventions incorporating a strong family focus with emphasis on improved parenting practices have been developed. The work proposed here will address this gap by testing the efficacy of an 8-mo parenting intervention designed to change both social and physical aspects of the home environment, which in turn will reduced % body fat in children. Subjects will be 280 families (one parent and one child from each) with at least one preschool-age child (2-5 years old). Following baseline measures, pairs will be randomized into intervention or control. The intervention will teach more effective parenting skills (child management, communication, routines, etc.), then apply these skills to specific practices that encourage healthier behaviors. The intervention will include group sessions and tailored phone calls facilitated by a registered dietitian who has also received training in parent education. Group sessions will use multiple teaching strategies and include separate child activities. Tailored calls will use motivational interviewing techniques to help parents overcome barriers to behavior change. The intervention is guided by Darling and Steinberg's Integrative Model of parenting, which highlights the importance of parenting values, style and practices in child socialization, and Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory, which suggests ways to foster autonomous motivation to adopt new behaviors. The resulting intervention will help parents learn skills to reduce their parenting-related stress and create home environments that support healthy-weight behaviors. The primary outcome, % body fat in children, will be assessed using anthropometry and a validated prediction equation (Dezenberg, 1999). Analyses will include baseline measurements of the outcome as a covariate. Secondary measures include child and parent diet and physical activity, parenting style and practices, and home environment. Maintenance effect will be assessed following a 6-mo no-intervention period. A comprehensive analysis is included to test for mediation effects. This intensive intervention will create the exposure necessary to make life-altering changes in weight-related behaviors. Plans build on extensive formative work conducted by our experienced researchers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Families must have at least one child age 25 years. The scientific rationale for focusing on this young population is that this age range includes the period often referred to as the "adiposity rebound," which has been identified as one of the critical periods for obesity development. Additionally, children of this age are still subject to strong parent and family influences which may be amenable to intervention. At least one parent or caregiver in the household must be overweight (BMI â‰¥25); however, this does not have to be the participating parent. The scientific rationale for focusing on families with at least one overweight parent is that having an overweight parent increases the child's risk of becoming overweight. Parents must be willing to participate in measures and intervention activities, and give consent for child's and his/her own participation. Parents who are unable to speak English or comprehend standard agelevel materials will be excluded. Currently funds are not available to translate and provide the program in Spanish or other languages.</criteria>
