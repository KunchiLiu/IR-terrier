	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess changes in shoulder muscle strength, shoulder movement, shoulder flexibility, muscle thickness, upper arm torsion angle, and subacromial width (space where the rotator cuff muscle passes through) after completing a 6-week shoulder strengthening and stretching program in division I collegiate swimmers. The result of this study may demonstrate the effectiveness of a strengthening and stretching program to positively influence factors that have been associated with pain and injury in division I collegiate swimmers and indicate the need to implement this program for the entire team. Following a 6-week strengthening and stretching program, it is believed that scapular kinematics, shoulder flexibility, and shoulder and scapular stabilizer strength will be improved compared to control subjects.</brief_summary>
