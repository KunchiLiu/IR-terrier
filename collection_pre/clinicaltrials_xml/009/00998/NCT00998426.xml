	<brief_summary>HepaGam B Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) solution contains 10% maltose, which could possibly interfere with the measurement of glucose levels when using glucose non-specific tests. The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of HepaGam B HBIG shows an increase in glucose levels in the body using non-specific glucose monitoring, as well as specific glucose monitoring. The sponsor believes that this medication will not cause a significant increase in glucose levels in the body when measured by glucose non-specific tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Blood Glucose Levels During Infusion With HepaGam B (HBIG) in Post-liver Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) is used post liver transplantation (OLT) in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive recipients to prevent recurrence of hepatitis B. One formulation of HBIG, HepaGam B, contains the disaccharide maltose, which can potentially falsely elevate glucose readings when glucose nonspecific point of care (GNSPOC) testing is used, such as a glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ)-based method. This can result in inappropriate administration of antidiabetic agents and resultant episodes of clinically significant hypoglycemia. Glucose specific point of care (GSPOC) testing, such as a glucose oxidase-based method, however, is not affected by the presence of maltose. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a significant difference in glucose readings using GSPOC and GNSPOC monitoring devices after HBIG administration. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, prospective study evaluating patients receiving maintenance HBIG therapy over 3 months post liver transplantation. Blood glucose levels in each subject were analyzed by GSPOC and GNSPOC devices at specific times around HBIG administration.</detailed_description>
