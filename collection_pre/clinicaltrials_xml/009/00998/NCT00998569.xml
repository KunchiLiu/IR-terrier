	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of neurocognitive enhancement on cognitive abilities and related social and adaptive behaviours in individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Subjects in this study will be randomized to receive Neurocognitive Enhancement Therapy (NET) or to a wait list and then NET . Secondary aims include examining whether the cognitive benefits are potentiated by repeated exposure during in-home practice with complementary exercises. Additionally, the investigators will examine the durability of the effects and their generalization to functional capacity and everyday functional performance after completion of the groups.</brief_summary>
