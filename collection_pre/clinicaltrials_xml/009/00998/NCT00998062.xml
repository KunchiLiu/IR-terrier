	<brief_summary>The present project is aimed at determining the prevalence of LDL-C &lt;130 mg/dl with hsCRP â‰¥2mg/l, and of HDL-C &lt; 40 mg/dl in Spain together with the estimation of cardiovascular risk, to analyze the contribution of measuring hsCRP for primary prevention purposes. In a subgroup of that population a number of inflammatory and oxidative status biomarkers would be also measured to better understand the meaning of elevated hsCRP.The study aim to analyze data already collected in studies (11 studies will participate) carried out in Spain, in 10 Spanish regions, after the year 2000.</brief_summary>
