	<brief_summary>There is now a general consensus that the combination of excessive energy intake and a low capacity to oxidize fat will lead to muscular fat accumulation and insulin resistance. It is known for many years that physical exercise is the most powerful treatment to combat insulin resistance, but it is also known that it is difficult to get people to exercise. A major breakthrough has come from the nutrition field, with the finding that resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, could serve as an "exercise mimetic" by protecting mice from many detrimental effects of diet-induced obesity. Therefore the researchers would like to investigate if resVida can increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and fat oxidative capacity in obese subjects. The researchers hypothesize that an increased mitochondrial function together with an increased intrinsic activity will lead to a better control of fatty acid handling in muscle, upon a high-fat challenge.</brief_summary>
