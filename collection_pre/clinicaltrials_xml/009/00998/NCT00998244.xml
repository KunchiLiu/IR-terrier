	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn if a very low carbohydrate (sugar) diet or traditional low fat diet is able to reduce symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in people who are overweight. Patients with GERD may experience all or some of the following symptoms: stomach acid or partially digested food re-entering the esophagus (which is sometimes referred to as heartburn or regurgitation) and belching. In this study, the investigators also hope to find out if acid in the esophagus is reduced more by a low carbohydrate diet than a low fat diet.</brief_summary>
