	<brief_summary>Rationale: Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF and plerixafor helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. Purpose: This phase II trial is studying how well plerixafor works in patients with multiple myeloma previously treated with lenalidomide and planning to undergo autologous stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plerixafor in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With Lenalidomide and Planning to Undergo Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: I. To determine the proportion of patients reaching a stem cell yield of 3 million CD34 cells/kg by second day of apheresis with intravenously administered AMD3100 among patients receiving primary therapy for myeloma with lenalidomide. Secondary Objectives: I. Safety and tolerability of intravenously administered AMD3100. II. Rate of failure to mobilize. Outline: Patients receive plerixafor IV on days 5-8 and filgrastim subcutaneously on days 1-8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.</detailed_description>
