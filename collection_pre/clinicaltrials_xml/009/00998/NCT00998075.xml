	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether treatment with a combination capsule of Esomeprazole 40 mg and Aspirin (ASA) 325 mg is bioequivalent (i.e.has the same effect within the body) as these medications taken separately. Two different forms of esomeprazole (tablets and capsules) will be investigated.</brief_summary>
