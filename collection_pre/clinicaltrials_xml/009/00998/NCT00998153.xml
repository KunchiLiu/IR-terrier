	<brief_summary>The investigator proposes to evaluate Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT), which integrates: 1) an ecologically-based intervention for treatment of substance abuse behaviors in high risk adolescents, 2) exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for sexually assaulted youth, and 3) psychoeducation strategies for prevention of risky sexual behaviors and revictimization. The principal purpose of this research proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of RRFT in reducing the risk of drug abuse and other risky behaviors, PTSD, and revictimization among adolescents who have been sexually assaulted. The Research Plan will be conducted based on Stage 1a and Stage 1b from NIDA's Behavioral Therapies Development Program as described in Rounsaville, Carroll, &amp; Onken (2001). The final phase of the research will involve conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of RRFT in a sample of adolescents, comparing primary outcome measures of youth receiving RRFT to youth receiving usual care in the community. Participants will be adolescents (12-17 years) who have experienced a sexual assault. Assessment of substance use and other risk behaviors, trauma-related psychopathology, and incidents of revictimization will be collected at pre- and post- treatment, as well as 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. Hierarchical Linear Modeling will be the primary method used to test study hypotheses. Development and evaluation of the proposed intervention will have significant implications for addressing public health problems in adolescent substance abuse and related high risk behaviors.</brief_summary>
