	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the data obtained by computer-aided quantification of the synovial perfusion in patients with arthritis using two-dimensional and three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography and the clinical data used to represent the degree of joint inflammation. Intra- and inter-observer reliability of this method will also be determined.</brief_summary>
