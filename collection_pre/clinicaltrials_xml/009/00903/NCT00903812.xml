	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, international observational study of subjects receiving CHOP-14 or CHOP-21 (with or without Rituximab) for the treatment of NHL. Approximately 100-150 sites will contribute information on subjects treated at their institution. To avoid geographical bias, sites will be selected to represent the spread of subjects in each country. Each site will be initially limited to 5 retrospective subjects and 10 prospective subjects (15 subjects per site) but sites may be asked to contribute further subjects to approximately 10 retrospective subjects and 20 prospective subjects. Retrospective subjects may include any subject that has completed all cycles of chemotherapy treatment prior to date of site initiation. Prospective subjects which may be considered for the study are any subject planned for CHOP-14 or CHOP-21 (with or without Rituximab) treatment after the site initiation visit.</detailed_description>
