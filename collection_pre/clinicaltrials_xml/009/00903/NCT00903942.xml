	<brief_summary>For patients with stage III Lung Cancer, We propose one cycle chemotherapy using Abraxane and Carboplatin, followed by pulsed low-dose sensitizing Abraxane chemotherapy and daily Radiation. This will be followed by more hi-dose chemotherapy. We anticipate this regimen to target early distant microscopic spread by using one cycle of chemotherapy prior to radiation, and to achieve control of the disease in the lung by combining pulsed low-dose sensitizing Abraxane, with radiation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed NSCLC. Clinical or pathologic stage IIIA (T13N2M0, T3N1M0) and IIIB (Any T N3M0, T4 Any N M0) diseases according to the American Joint Committee of Cancer criteria. Patients with malignant pleural effusion will be excluded. The primary tumor must be radiographically measurable. Age &gt; 18. Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 or Zubrod PS 0 or 1. FEV1 sufficient for patients to tolerate radiation therapy, which is at the discretion of the radiation oncologist, usually &gt; 800 ml, but may be higher or lower depending on the volume of radiotherapy portal, which is a variable of the tumor extent. WBC &gt; 3000; platelet count &gt; 100,000; absolute neutrophil counts &gt; 1,500; HGB &gt; 9.0 g/dl, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min. Laboratory values must be obtained &lt; 4 weeks prior to registration. Patients with equivocal enlargement of adrenal gland(s) on CT scan, or a few equivocal regional or distant lesions on any imaging studies need further imaging study (PET, bone scan, or others) or biopsy to rule out distant metastasis. Patients must have adequate liver functions: AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis. Bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL. Preexisting neuropathy must not be worse than grade I. A signed informed consent. Normal organ function including EKG findings deemed acceptable for chemotherapy by the medical oncologist. Patients with distant metastasis (stage IV disease). Patients without measurable disease. Patients with medical contraindication to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients with myocardial infarction within the preceding 6 months or symptomatic heart disease, including angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia. Patients with bilirubin elevated above institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) must be excluded. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.
