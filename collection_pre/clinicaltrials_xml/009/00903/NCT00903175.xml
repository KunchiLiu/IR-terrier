Note: Subjects who have previouslytreated CNS metastases (surgery plus or minus radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or gamma knife) and meet all 3 of the following criteria are eligible: Are asymptomatic and, have had no evidence of active CNS metastases for ≥ 6 months prior to enrollment and, have no requirement for steroids or enzymeinducing anticonvulsants (EIAC) 11. Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities including, but not limited to: Malabsorption syndrome Major resection of the stomach or small bowel that could affect the absorption of study drug Active peptic ulcer disease Inflammatory bowel disease Ulcerative colitis, or other gastrointestinal conditions with increased risk of perforation History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment. 12.

Patients receiving chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent 14. Patients with a known history of HIV seropositivity. 15. Patients with active bleeding. 16. Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions within the past 12 months that could affect their participation in the study such as: Cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV), myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to first study treatment, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, cerebrovascular accidents ≤ 6 months before study treatment start.

Severally impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 0^2 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air. Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;2.0 x ULN. Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/disorders that impair the ability to evaluate the patient or for the patient to complete the study.

History of pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have been treated with therapeutic anticoagulating agents for at least 6 weeks are eligible. 19. Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy and off treatment for ≤ 3 years 20.
