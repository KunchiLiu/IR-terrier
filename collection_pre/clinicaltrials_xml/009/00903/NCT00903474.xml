	<brief_title>Mindful Movement Program in Improving Quality of Life in Older Female Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To test the effects of the 12-week Mindful Movement Program on quality of life in older female breast cancer survivors. - To test the effects of this program on mindfulness outcomes in these participants. - To compare mindfulness qualities in the experimental group with the control group. - To determine the qualitative benefits of this program as described by these participants. OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I (Mindful Movement Program [MMP]): Participants undergo a 2-hour MMP session once weekly for 12 weeks. Participants are encouraged to practice intentional-mindful movement at home 5 minutes daily during weeks 1-4, 10 minutes daily during weeks 5-8, and 15 minutes daily during weeks 9-12. Mindful movement is a self-directed activity incorporating mindfulness concepts and physical movement. Mindfulness consists of the three core elements: intention (reasons for participating in a mindfulness intervention), attention (observing experiences in the present moment), and attitude (nonjudgmental openness and acceptance of experiences). Each MMP session includes verbal sharing with a partner and the group and movement individually and with a partner, while focusing on the elements of mindfulness. Music is incorporated into some portion of each session. - Arm II (control): Participants undergo no intervention. All participants complete questionnaires for sociodemographic and individual characteristics, quality of life (including psychological, social, spiritual, and physical well-being, anxiety and depression, fear of recurrence, body image, and upper body symptoms), movement, and mindfulness (including attention, self-compassion, and intention) at baseline and weeks 12 and 18. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 participants (45 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
