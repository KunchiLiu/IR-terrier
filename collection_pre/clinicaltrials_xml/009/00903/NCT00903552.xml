If subject is of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g., intrauterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives or other equivalent hormonal contraception) for 2 months prior to vaccination. She must also have a negative pregnancy test at study entry and must agree to continue such precautions for three months after vaccination 1.

Has received any other licensed or investigational influenza vaccine within 12 months prior to enrollment in this study or expected receipt of any influenza vaccination before the final immune response blood collection 3. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the administration of the study vaccine The use of inhaled and nasal steroids will be permitted 4. Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination 5. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study 6. Acute disease at the time of enrollment.
