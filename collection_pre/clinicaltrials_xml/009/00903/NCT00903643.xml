	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if clinically relevant subsets exist in patients meeting the diagnosis of Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS). Subsets suggest differential responses to treatments and if verified, this will be important for the stratification of patients in clinical studies related to PBS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensory Processing in Subjects With Painful Bladder Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with the diagnosis of painful bladder syndrome (PBS) constitute two or more phenotypes that are distinguished by differential neurophysiological processing of sensory information. Further, these differing phenotypes can be predicted by the presence or absence of the co-morbidity fibromyalgia.</detailed_description>
