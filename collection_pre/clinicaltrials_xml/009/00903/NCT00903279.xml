	<brief_title>Treatment of Patients Colonized With Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Prior to Bone and Joint Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enhanced characterization of MRSA strains carried by patients and their eradication prior to surgery will significantly reduce healthcare costs to the VA by reducing the number of MRSA positive patients who need to be isolated and or closely monitored, and allow healthcare providers to better predict the patient's requirements. In addition, the application of molecular methods will facilitate faster tracking of MRSA postoperative infections.</detailed_description>
