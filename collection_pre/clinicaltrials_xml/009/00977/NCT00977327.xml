	<brief_summary>Purpose: - Improvement of extent of resection by the use of intraoperatively acquired image data sets to navigate. - Better define the role of different intra-operative imaging modalities, used to update the navigational data set, in aiding the surgeon during resection of intra-axial brain lesions. - To examine the cost-effectiveness of different intraoperative navigational systems as a function of operative time and Operative time (Surgery including imaging) There is increasing neuro-oncological evidence that extent of resection might have an impact in particular in low-grade lesions.</brief_summary>
