	<brief_title>Myopic Control for High Myopes Using Orthokeratology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthokeratology (ortho-k) has been shown to have strong potential for retardation of myopic progression in low myopes. To date, clinical experience has shown the technique to be less effective in achieving full myopic reduction in high myopes. Would myopic control be possible for high myopes undergoing partial correction ortho-k treatment? A randomized, longitudinal study is designed to investigate the efficacy of partial correction ortho-k in retardation of myopic progression in high myopic children. Eye growth in terms of axial length elongation in children wearing ortho-k and over-spectacles (to correct residual refractive errors) (study group) and those wearing single-vision spectacles (control group) will be evaluated and compared.</detailed_description>
