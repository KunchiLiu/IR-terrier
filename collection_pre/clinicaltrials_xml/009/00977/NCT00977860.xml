	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine, in both low-risk and intermediate-risk cohorts, the rates of acute and late grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity observed during a 24 month follow up and to estimate the rate of biochemical Disease-Free Survival, Phoenix and American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definitions, at 2 years following hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiosurgery should be ideal for treating prostate cancer because: - targeting accuracy for static targets is excellent, with an error of about 1mm, - it can adjust for intra-fractional organ motion, reducing the volume of the target PTV and therefore the dose to surrounding organs, - by using over one-hundred non-conplanar beams, the dose gradient between the prostate and surrounding tissues may be superior to that achieved with conventional linear accelerators, - the radiobiology of prostate cancer may favor large dose per fractions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma Gleason score 27 Biopsy within one year of date of registration Clinical stage T1bT2b, N0Nx, M0Mx (AJCC 6th Edition) Tstage and Nstage determined by physical exam and available imaging studies (ultrasound, CT, and/or MRI) Mstage determined by physical exam, CT or MRI. Bone scan not required unless clinical findings suggest possible osseous metastases. PSA ≤ 20 ng/dL Patients belonging in one of the following risk groups: Low: CS T1bT2a and Gleason 26 and PSA ≤ 10, or Intermediate: CS T2b and Gleason 26 and PSA ≤ 10, or CS T1bT2b, and Gleason 26 and PSA ≤ 20 ng/dL, or Gleason 7 and PSA ≤ 10 ng/dL Prostate volume: ≤ 100 cc Determined using: volume = π/6 x length x height x width Measurement from CT or ultrasound ≤90 days prior to registration. ECOG performance status 01 Completion of patient questionnaires:FACTG questionnaire, AUA questionnaire, EPIC26 questionnaire, SHIM questionnaire, Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices questionnaire Consent signed. Prior prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate Prior radiotherapy to the prostate or lower pelvis Implanted hardware or other material that would prohibit appropriate treatment planning or treatment delivery, in the investigator's opinion. Chemotherapy for a malignancy in the last 5 years. History of an invasive malignancy (other than this prostate cancer, or basal or squamous skin cancers) in the last 5 years. Hormone ablation for two months prior to enrollment, or during treat</criteria>
