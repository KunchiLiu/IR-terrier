	<brief_summary>In order to explore genetic factors that may determine the neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, germinal gene polymorphisms will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomic Study to Predict Neurotoxicity of Oxaliplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the impact of single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism on the toxicity profile in colorectal cancer patients treated with FOLFOX chemotherapy, 10 cc of blood will be drawn in EDTA tube for extraction. DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood samples using DNA isolation kit, and SNP polymorphisms will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
