	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn if adding hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to erlotinib helps treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Another goal of this research study is to learn more about NSCLC and how it may respond to study treatment. Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). TKIs block a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR may control tumor growth and tumor cell survival. However, although TKI drugs can work for some lung cancer patients for a period of time, eventually the tumor finds a way to resist or counteract the TKI treatment and it begins to grow again. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by the FDA for treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and several other diseases. Laboratory research suggests that when HCQ is given with a TKI, it may help delay or prevent TKI resistance from developing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Because no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will be randomized into of the study groups: Group A (erlotinib) or Group B (erlotinib and HCQ). Study treatment will be divided into time periods called cycles. Each study treatment cycle is 28 days. - Erlotinib (Group A and Group B) will be taken orally once a day. Hydroxychloroquine (Group B) will be taken orally once a day after taking erlotinib. - The following tests and procedures will be performed day 1 of each cycle: physical examination, performance status assessment, questions about any symptoms or side effects, blood for routine tests. The following procedures will be performed at certain study visits: Research blood tests (cycle 1, cycle 2, then every other even cycle); eye exam (cycle 4, cycle 7, and then every 3 months); assessment of the tumor with CT or MRI scan (done at the end of even cycles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer Stage IV disease by the American Joint Committee on Cancer/IASLC 7th edition proposed edition staging criteria An EGFR sensitizing mutation must be detected in tumor tissue. Specifically, patients harboring the most common mutations, deletions in exon 19 or the L858R mutation in exon 21 are eligible. Presence of the known resistance mutation T790M as detected by direct tumor sequencing is not allowed. Other rare EGFR mutations may be eligible after discussion with the overall principal investigator Age equal to or greater than 18 years Measurable disease by RECIST criteria, defined as the presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as 10mm or greater with spiral CT scan ECOG Performance status of 0, 1 or 2 Since prior radiation or surgery, 14 days or more must have elapsed before starting protocol treatment No prior treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib, or other small molecule EGFRTKIs. Prior treatment in the adjuvant setting is allowed if at least 1 year has elapsed since TKI course. Adequate organ function as outlined in the protocol Patients must undergo a screening eye exam to obtain approval for HCQ treatment, which establishes the absence of baseline conditions include macular degeneration, visual field changes, other retinal disease, and cataracts that interfere with required funduscopic examinations No G6PD deficiency, as HCQ may cause hemolysis in patients with G6DP Symptomatic CNS metastases or newly diagnosed CNS metastases that have not yet been definitively treated with radiation and/or surgery. Note that patients with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowed if they have been definitively treated and are clinically stable. Maintenance steroids are allowed but maintenance seizure medication with an EIAED is not allowed Prior radiation therapy inclusive of all identified target lesions. Note that prior palliative radiation to bony disease, CNS disease, or a limited thoracic area is allowed, provided that there is measurable disease outside the field and radiation is completed at least two weeks prior to starting treatment and the patient has fully recovered from all side effects Current use of hydroxychloroquine for any reason Known hypersensitivity to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or any closely related drug: erlotinib, gefitinib, or any closely related drug Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects must practice acceptable methods of birth control Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Note that patients with chronic, stable radiographic changes who are asymptomatic are eligible Invasive malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix, basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, including a prior diagnosis of porphyria or nonlightsensitive psoriasis, as HCQ can significantly exacerbate both of these conditions Use of any nonFDA approved or investigational agent in 30 days or less of enrolling onto the trial, or failure to recover from the side effects of any of these agents Penicillamine use for Wilson's disease or any other indication, as concomitant use with HCQ can increase toxicity to penicillamine Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks</criteria>
