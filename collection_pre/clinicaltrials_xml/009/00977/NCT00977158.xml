	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is characterize the changes in bacterial diversity of the upper respiratory tracts of infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). Another goal is to determine when CF patients become colonized with pathogenic bacteria that are responsible for the lethal lung damage in children with CF. Ten subjects will be recruited into the study. Throat swabs will be collected at 6-8 weeks of age, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months of age in order to chart any changes in the bacterial populations of the respiratory tract. Clinical data will also be collected to evaluate the possible influence of external factors on changes in the microbial communities. This study will provide preliminary data on whether probiotics can eradicate the colonization of the respiratory tract by pathogenic bacteria.</brief_summary>
