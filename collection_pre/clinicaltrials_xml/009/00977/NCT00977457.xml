	<brief_summary>This trial studies the side effects and best way to perform genetic testing in predicting biomarkers of recurrence in patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery. Collecting and storing samples of tissue, blood, and other body fluids from patients to test in the laboratory and collecting information about the patient's health and treatment may help doctors learn more about cancer and help predict the recurrence of prostate cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the performance of these models in predicting the likelihood of biochemical recurrence (BCR). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the performance of these models in predicting upgrading and upstaging prior to surgery. II. To explore the performance of these models in improving risk stratification among patients eligible for active surveillance. III. To determine whether prostatic massage or surgery raises the count of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in post-digital rectal exam (DRE) blood specimens. OUTLINE: Patients receive prostatic massage and undergo a digital rectal exam (DRE). Laboratory assessments are performed and blood samples are collected for molecular biology testing. On the day of the scheduled prostatectomy, a second blood collection is performed prior to surgery.</detailed_description>
