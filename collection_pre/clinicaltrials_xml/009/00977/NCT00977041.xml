	<brief_summary>A number of studies suggest that training to increase different types of brain waves is related to pain relief. The purpose of the second phase of this study is to see if neurofeedback training might help people with chronic pain control their pain better. The information from the study may help the investigators treat chronic pain better in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurofeedback Treatment of Pain in Persons With Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During this phase of the study, research personnel will provide up to 15 of the subjects with SCI-related pain with a full course (up to 40 sessions) of NF training to determine the effects of this treatment on (a) chronic daily pain, (b) EEG-assessed frequency band amplitudes, and (c) other measures of quality of life (specifically, sleep quality, fatigue, and pain interference). Standard NF training procedures will be used that involve simply asking participants to relax while looking at the feedback screen and to "Do whatever is necessary to make and keep the color bar wide." EEG bandwidth activity that is associated with being pain-free or with experiencing less pain will be reinforced. This protocol will be repeated for up to 40 30-minute sessions, scheduled at least weekly (but more often if the participant and study PI can arrange this with their schedules. Brain wave activity will be measured three times during the study: once before treatment begins, once immediately after treatment ends, and three months following treatment. Research staff will collect data regarding pain intensity and quality of life from subjects via the telephone three times: before treatment, immediately after treatment, and three months after treatment ends.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. 18 years old or older. 2. At least 12 months postSCI. 3. Otherwise healthy (i.e., no other secondary medical complications, such as pressure ulcers, that could impact pain scores). 4. Read, write and understand English. 5. Experience SCIrelated pain on a daily basis. 6. Report an average pain intensity of at least 4 on a 010 Numerical Scale. 7. An individual must have one significant pain problem that is the worst or most painful if he/she has more than one pain problem. 8. Pain problem has lasted at least six months, and began after injury. 1. History of seizure activity or has nonnormative brain activity. 2. Suicidal or paranoid thoughts. 3. Presence of traumatic brain injury or significant skull defects.</criteria>
