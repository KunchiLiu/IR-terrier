	<brief_title>Macular Hole Reopening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A reopening of a macular hole (MH) is a well-known complication of successfully closed MHs. Recently, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling has become widely used as an adjunctive procedure during MH surgery. The incidence of a reopening of a MH is 0 to 8.6% in eyes in which the ILM was peeled off, and 2 to 16% in which the ILM was not peeled off. Part of the variation in the percentages of reopening was the length of the follow-up period; eyes with longer follow-up periods have higher incidences of reopening.</detailed_description>
