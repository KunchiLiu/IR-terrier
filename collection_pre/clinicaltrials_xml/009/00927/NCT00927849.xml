	<brief_summary>Idiopathic hypertensive anal canal is a fact and already exists presented by anal pain aggravated by defecation. It can be managed safely by closed lateral sphincterotomy but chemical sphincterotomy had a minor role in its management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Idiopathic Hypertensive Anal Canal: a Place of Internal Sphincterotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient and methods: Sixty three patients complaining of anal pain without any anal pathology and 10 healthy volunteers were examined. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, neurological examination, anorectal manometry, and measurement of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML). All patients with hypertensive anal canal were randomized into three groups. Group I (surgical group) underwent closed lateral sphincterotomy LS, group II using nitroglycerine ointment (GTN) and group III received injection of botulinum toxin in internal sphincter. Post procedures data were recorded at follow up period.</detailed_description>
