	<brief_summary>This study is designed to show that a new lead, which paces the left bottom chamber (left ventricle) of the heart, is safe. Using a lead on the left side of the heart has been shown to potentially improve heart failure symptoms. The shape and size of this new lead may make it a good choice for patients or physicians.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized design trial. All consented patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria may receive the investigational lead. The study design has statistical power to show safety at one-month after implant.</detailed_description>
