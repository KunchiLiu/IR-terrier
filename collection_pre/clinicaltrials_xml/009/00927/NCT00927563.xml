	<brief_title>Tolcapone Treatment of Pathological Gambling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will consist of 8 weeks of treatment with tolcapone in 10 subjects with pathological gambling. The hypothesis to be tested is that tolcapone will be effective in reducing the urges to gamble in patients with pathological gambling. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</detailed_description>
