	<brief_summary>Retinal thickness measurement is one of the most important examinations in the follow up of exudative age-related macular degeneration. Prior studies have shown that there are a series of algorithm line failures in OCT examinations. This study is conducted to compare the quality of the examinations of to different spectral domain OCT machines concerning the positioning of algorithm lines. Furthermore the reproducibility of the examinations id tested, both machines provide different techniques to guarantee that in repeated examinations the same location is examined.</brief_summary>
