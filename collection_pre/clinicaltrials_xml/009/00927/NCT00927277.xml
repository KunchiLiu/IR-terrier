	<brief_title>Low Level Laser Light Therapy as an Aid to Liposuction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Erchonia EML Laser is designed to administer low level laser therapy (LLLT). It has been hypothesized that LLLT may reduce pain and promote nerve regeneration through the speculated anti-inflammatory and immune enhancement properties of the therapy. Prior research has indicated LLLT to be a potentially safe and effective means of reducing pain. This clinical study was designed to evaluate the potential of the Erchonia EML Laser in offering a novel means of delivering LLLT to reduce pain and enhance healing following liposuction.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>There were separate inclusion criteria for both the liposuction and the clinical study components of the study. INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE LIPOSUCTION PROCEDURE Prior to partaking in the clinical study qualification evaluation, an individual must have already: qualified as a patient for liposuction according to the American Society of Liposuction Surgery (ASLSS) and the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery (AACS) 2000 Liposuction Guidelines. been deemed suitable for undergoing anesthesia according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists: Preanesthesia Evaluation guidelines: Basic Standards For Preanesthesia Care (Approved by House of Delegates on October 14, 1987).
