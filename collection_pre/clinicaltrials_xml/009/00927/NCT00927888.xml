	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to quantify postoperative pain after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and investigate whether preemptive analgesia may positively impact intraoperative anesthetic management, decrease patient postoperative pain and discomfort, and improve patient functional outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain and Functional Patient Outcomes After Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) with local anesthetic is used to treat facial pain and headache of various etiologies and has been widely used during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether preemptive SPGB may positively impact postoperative pain and functional outcomes after FESS. A prospective, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study was performed. 60 patients (18 to 70 yrs), undergoing general anesthesia for bilateral FESS, were randomly assigned to receive SPGB with either 2 ml 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 (BP, treatment group) or normal saline (NS, control group). SPGB was performed preemptively 10 min before the start of surgery. Pre- and post operative (day#0, day#7, day#30) visual analogue pain scale, SNOT-20, CT &amp; Endoscopic scores were compared between the two groups.</detailed_description>
