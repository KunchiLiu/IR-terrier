	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of high-oleic canola oil and a high-oleic canola/flaxseed oil blend as compared to a typical Western diet on plasma lipids, fatty acid profiles, and risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease in hypercholesterolemic patients. Furthermore, the metabolism of dietary oleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid contained in high-oleic canola oil and flaxseed oil will be investigated.</brief_summary>
