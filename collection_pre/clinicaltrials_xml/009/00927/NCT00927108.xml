	<brief_summary>To study the success of Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell culture project in Rajavithi Hospital to identify an unlimited clone human neuronal progenitor stem cells from the human brain in the Biomolecular Research Center. This study aims to produce the reproductive clone of neuronal development protocols and advance projects. Neuronal cells such as pyramidal cells, oligodendrocyte, and dopaminergic neuron differentiation protocol/projects for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease respectively in next phase of clinical trials.</brief_summary>
