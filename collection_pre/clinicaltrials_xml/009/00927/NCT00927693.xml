	<brief_summary>Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis by Noninvasive Imaging Research (EISNER) is a multi-study research program being conducted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The principal objective of this randomized trial (referred to as "Study 1") is to assess whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning provides clinical benefit thus improving patient outcomes in asymptomatic subjects with intermediate coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Additionally, the study is designed to assess the value of combining the CAC scan with the Framingham risk score (FRS) and measurements of serum or plasma biomarkers to predict outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At baseline eligible subjects underwent a clinic visit where they were randomized 2:1 to a "scan group" which had complete cardiac risk assessment and CAC scanning or a "no scan group" which had only complete cardiac risk assessment. Both groups underwent a private counseling session with a trained nurse practitioner to review their results and receive customized health behavior suggestions based on current American Heart Association guidelines for primary prevention of heart disease. Subjects were followed up for changes in clinical status, medication use and specific health behaviors at one year after baseline. Annually for four years, subjects were followed up for subsequent diagnostic testing, therapy, and outcomes related to their cardiac health. At four years after baseline, all subjects (from both groups) returned for a repeat clinic visit to have a complete cardiac risk assessment and CAC scanning. Year 4 CAC scanning was performed in both the "scan group" and "no scan group". Additional long-term followup is being conducted under a separate protocol.</detailed_description>
