	<brief_title>Topical Application of AS101 for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease, affecting 10-20% of children and 2% of adults worldwide. The mechanism of AD is still not completely understood, but the disorder appears to result from the complex interaction between immunological responses, various susceptability genes, defects in skin barrier function, host and environmental factors and infectious agents. AS101 is a non toxic potent immunomodulator that has been shown to have beneficial effects in diverse pre clinical and clinical studies. Recently, AS101 has shown efficacy and safety in the treatment of mild to moderate Psoriasis which shares with AD a related immunological mechanism along with the AS101 ability to decrease the level of interleukins known to be involved ith the pathogenesis of AD.</detailed_description>
