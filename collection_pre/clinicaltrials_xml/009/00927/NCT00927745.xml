	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of AutoFlow Mode During Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many new mechanical ventilation modes are proposed without clinical evaluation. Among them, "dual-controlled" modes, as AutoFlow, are supposed to improve patient-ventilator interfacing, and could led to lesser alarm. This study is a long term clinical evaluation of AutoFlow during assist-controlled ventilation, focusing on its efficacy (on gas exchange and outcome) and on ventilator alarms.</detailed_description>
