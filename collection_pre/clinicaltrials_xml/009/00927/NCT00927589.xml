	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study is designed to evaluate the effect of trastuzumab on QTcF interval and to characterize the effects of trastuzumab on carboplatin pharmacokinetics in patients with HER2-positive metastatic or locally advanced inoperable cancer. The QT interval is a measure of time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. The QTcF interval is the QT interval as calculated using Fridericia's correction; the QTcB interval is the QT interval as calculated using Bazett's correction.</brief_summary>
