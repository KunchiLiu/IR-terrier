	<brief_title>XL TDR® eXtreme Lateral Total Disc Replacement for the Treatment of Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The XL TDR® eXtreme Lateral Total Disc Replacement consists of two endplates that are provided in a number of sizes to accommodate a variety of patient anatomies and pathologies. The XL TDR device is made up of a ball and socket articulation and the joint is made of CoCrMo alloy. The XL TDR is intended to be used to reconstruct the spine following the removal of part or all of the intervertebral disc on one level of the lumbar spine. The XL TDR is indicated for reconstruction of the disc following discectomy in skeletally mature subjects with symptomatic degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine at one level from L1-L5. DDD is defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history radiographic studies.</detailed_description>
