	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of Antihemophilic factor, recombinant, manufactured protein-free (rAHF-PFM) reconstituted in 2 mL sterile water for injection (SWFI) and compare with those of rAHF-PFM reconstituted in 5 mL of SWFI.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject or subject's legally authorized representative has provided written informed consent The subject has severe hemophilia A as defined by a baseline FVIII activity &lt;= 1% of normal; tested at screening The adolescent/adult subject has a documented history of at least 150 exposure days to FVIII concentrates (either plasmaderived or recombinant), and the pediatric subject has at least 50 exposure days The subject is &gt;= 12 to &lt;= 65 years of age for the complete pharmacokinetic assessment and &gt;= 2 to &lt; 12 years for the incremental recovery assessment The subject has a Karnofsky performance score &gt; 60 The subject is human immunodeficiency virus negative (HIV) or HIV+ with stable CD4 count &gt;= 200 cells/mmÂ³ (CD4 count determined at screening, if necessary) The subject has a known hypersensitivity to mouse or hamster proteins or to FVIII concentrates The subject has a history of FVIII inhibitors with titer &gt;= 0. 5 BU (Bethesda Assay) or &gt;= 0.4 BU (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda Assay) any time prior to screening The subject has a detectable FVIII inhibitor at screening, &gt;= 0.4 BU (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda Assay), in the central laboratory The subject has severe chronic liver disease as evidenced by, but not limited to, any of the following: International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.4, hypoalbuminemia, portal vein hypertension including presence of otherwise unexplained splenomegaly and history of esophageal varices The subject has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia A (e.g. qualitative platelet defect or Von Willebrand Disease) The subject has received another investigational product within 30 days of enrollment The subject's clinical condition may require major or moderate surgery (estimated blood loss &gt; 500 mL) during the period of participation in the study Subjects with clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or cognitive illness, or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect subject safety or compliance The subject is a female of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at screening</criteria>
