	<brief_summary>We postulate that the combination of IL-2 and GM-CSF immunotherapy will efficiently mobilize autologous peripheral blood stem cells and activated immune effector cells in patients with a hematologic malignancy. These activated effector cells will improve the immune function of the graft. These hypotheses will be tested using this proposed clinical trial to mobilize autologous peripheral blood stem cells pre-transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have pathologic diagnosis of one of the following malignancies: NonHodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease, Multiple Myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasia (Waldenstrom, Amyloidosis), Leukemia (AML, ALL, CLL) Prior Treatment: &gt; 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy. Performance Status: Karnofsky &gt; 70% Age &gt;18 Life Expectancy &gt; 4 months Bone Marrow: bone marrow biopsy and aspirate Blood counts: The patient must have adequate bone marrow function, i.e. a total WBC of &gt; 2,000/ul, a Hgb of &gt; 7 mg/dl, and a platelet count of &gt; 50,000/ul, unless this abnormality is believed to be due to the underlying disease. Pulmonary function tests: DLCO &gt; 55% predicted. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction of &gt; 40% by radionuclide scan or echocardiography. Liver function tests (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and SGOT/SGPT) &lt; 3 x normal (unless believed to be elevated due to disease). No significant comorbid medical or psychiatric illness that would significantly compromise the patient's clinical care and chances of survival. Informed Consent: Informed consent must be signed prior to the treatment. Patients must be aware of the neoplastic nature of their disease and willingly consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks and discomforts. The patient is not deemed eligible if there is any other serious medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent informed consent. (Human protection committee approval of this protocol and a consent form is required.) Medical, social, or psychological factors which would prevent the patient from receiving or cooperating with the full course of therapy. Evidence on physical exam, LP, CT, or MRI scans of CNS involvement with malignancy. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including recent (&lt; 6 months) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina (symptomatic despite optimal medical management), lifethreatening arrhythmia, or hypertension or clinically significant obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease. Serology positive for HIV History of seizures. Concurrent or expected need for therapy with systemic corticosteroids (since systemic steroids may suppress the effects of IL2). Current and clinically significant pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites. Positive pregnancy test or presence of lactation. Uncontrolled active infection. Documented hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used in the protocol. No concomitant, ongoing malignancy that is lifethreatening, based on PI's evaluation</criteria>
