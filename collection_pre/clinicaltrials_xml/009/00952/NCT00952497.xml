	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety, and tolerability of telatinib when used in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin) as first-line therapy in subjects with advanced gastric cancer. The primary objective is to assess progression free survival (PFS) in subjects receiving telatinib in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin). The secondary objectives are to assess overall survival, overall response rate, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers.</brief_summary>
