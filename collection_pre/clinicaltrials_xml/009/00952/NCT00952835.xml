	<brief_summary>In this study will be consecutive enrolled children with asthma (classified according to GINA guidelines) and rhinitis (classified by ARIA guidelines); the investigators will research clinical personal and parental history regarding allergic diseases, exposition to passive smoking and interpretate hematochemical parameters markers of atopy. Skin Prick Tests will be performed. In this study the investigators will evaluate lung function parameters (spirometry with bronchial reversibility test and exercise induced bronchoconstriction, oscillometry, respiratory plethysmography, etc.), airway inflammatory indices such as exhaled nitric oxide at different flows, exhaled and nasal temperature, nasal cytology. The aim of the study will be to evaluate possible correlation between these different parameters and clinical status of the patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Different Disease Control Indices in Children With Asthma and Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patients will be evaluated by spirometry and then he will undergo exercise challenge in order to evaluate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as a marker of asthma control. The test of the challenge will be correlate with childhood Asthma control test score,levels of control (GINA classification)and the different markers of airway inflammation and atopy.</detailed_description>
