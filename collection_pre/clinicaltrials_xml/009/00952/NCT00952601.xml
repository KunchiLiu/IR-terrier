	<brief_summary>Pharmacotherapy has long been considered the primary approach for tic suppression in Tourette syndrome (TS). Unfortunately, medications are often ineffective and frequently have significant side-effects. This is a pilot therapeutic study using a dietary approach, the modified Atkins diet (MAD). The goal of this study is to establish the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of dietary therapy in patients with TS ("proof of concept") and to determine whether this intervention is worthy of evaluation in large-scale clinical trials. The modified Atkins diet mimics the well established ketogenic diet, but in a less-restrictive dietary manner. Dietary approaches using the MAD/ketogenic diet are currently under investigation for neurological conditions other than epilepsy, including Alzheimer disease, headaches, autism, narcolepsy, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and depression.</brief_summary>
