	<brief_summary>Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect of some antipsychotics (APS), including some atypicals. Clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia are broad including amenorrhea, galactorrhea, tender breasts, gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction. Less known but also present is the increased cardiovascular risk, specially in women, disorders of osteoporotic type and a potential increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. Despite this growing evidence, there are no consistent published data in order to adopt evidence-based decisions that may be beneficial for the patient. This naturalistic observational 6 months follow-up study on patients with APS-induced hyperprolactinemia aims to obtain more information about the switching approach in cases of hyperprolactinemia secondary to APS and to better establish the role of switching to quetiapine (APS not related with the increase prolactin levels) in this problem.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect of some antipsychotics (APS), including some atypicals. Clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia include most remarkably the appearance of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, tender breasts, and gynecomastia - associated with dysmorphophobia and psychological disorders in some cases, particularly in men-. Another common side effect is sexual dysfunction, with decreased libido, anorgasmia, and in men, impotence, reduced volume ejaculated and even backward ejaculation. Less known but also present is the increased cardiovascular risk, specially in women, disorders of osteoporotic type. Furthermore, several authors have related hyperprolactinemic states with the development of breast cancer including a potential worse prognosis of it (Mandala, 1999; Clevenger 2003; Mujagic, 2004), and with the development of metastatic prostate cancer and resistance to hormone therapy in men (Lisonni, 2005) Despite this growing evidence and the fact that APS with no apparent increase of prolactin levels exist, such as quetiapine or aripiprazole, many clinicians don't even monitor prolactin levels in patients following APS treatment. And when they do, they find there are no consistent published data in order to adopt evidence-based decisions that may be beneficial for the patient. This naturalistic observational 6 months follow-up study on patients with APS-induced hyperprolactinemia aims to obtain more information about the switching approach in cases of hyperprolactinemia secondary to APS and to better establish the role of switching to quetiapine in this problem.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent signature. Men aged 1850 years and women aged 1845 years. Patients diagnosed of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder according to DSMIV and on ambulatory psychiatric followup. Treated with one or more antipsychotics other than quetiapine for at least 8 weeks prior to inclusion in the study. Prolactin serum levels over 20 ug/L. That, in the opinion of the clinician, the origin of the hyperprolactinemia is the antipsychotic treatment administered previously to the patient. Switching from previous antipsychotic treatment to quetiapine following the clinical criterion of the investigator in response to hyperprolactinemia in a period less than 5 days prior to inclusion in the study. Women with childbearing potential using an effective contraceptive method and with a negative result in the pregnancy HCG test at the time of inclusion. Be able to understand and meet the study requirements. Pregnant or nursing women. Mental retardation. Dependence or abuse of substances on inclusion according to DSMIV criteria. Patients that, in the investigator's opinion, are at a high risk of suicide or mean a risk of aggression to others. Treated with any of the following drugs that can modify PRL levels on inclusion and during the study: antipsychotics, except for quetiapine, antidepressants except for mirtazapine, hormone therapy, spermicides, antiparkinson drugs or dopaminergic agonists, metoclopramide, domperidone, cimetidine or ranitidine, verapamil, enalapril, alphamethyldopa, reserpine, morphine and other opioid derivatives, antiretrovirals (protease inhibitors), vitamin D or any complex containing it. These drugs are excluded for their known potential effect on prolactin serum levels, sexual hormones and/or cortisol. Administration of an antipsychotic depot injection in one of the usual administration intervals of the depot (e.g., 34 weeks) prior to inclusion. Be treated with any of the following P4503A4 cytochrome inhibitors in the 14 days prior to inclusion, including: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, fluvoxamine, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir. Be treated with any of the following P4503A4 cytochrome inducers in the 14 days prior to inclusion, including: phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, St. John's wart, and glucocorticoids. Any contraindication to the use of quetiapine fumarate in the investigator's opinion (including lack of response to it in previous treatment attempts) (applies also to any other treatment to be used in the study comparative agents). Suffer any medical condition that can effect the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study treatment(s). Suffer any medical condition in decompensation or not receiving inappropriate treatment for it in the investigator's opinion (e.g., diabetes, angina pectoris, hypertension...) and can affect psychotic symptoms and/or levels of prolactin, sexual hormones and/or cortisol. Suffering unstable diabetes. Absolute neutrophil count Â£1.5 x 109 per litre. Noncompliance with the study plan. Participation in a clinical trial in the four weeks prior to inclusion in the study.</criteria>
