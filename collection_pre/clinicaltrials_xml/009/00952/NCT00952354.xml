The hypothesis is that children with Down syndrome will present low performance, regarding not only the quantitative measures as MLU-m, MLU-w, GM-1 and GM-2, but also regarding the qualitative aspects of their production, when compared to children with typical development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One of the alternatives to observe and assess language development and language disorders is to analyze spontaneous language samples, which allos the identification of qualitative and quantitative aspects. The analysis involves the MLU-morphemes, MLU-words and words classes. All words produced are analyzed, including interjections, adverbs and adjectives.Word classes with grammatical characteristics present lower averages, as prepositions and conjunctions. Reference parameters are the ones of the spoken language. The objective assessment with qualitative and quantitative data may help the speech and language pathologist/therapist to determine therapeutic guidelines to each patient.</detailed_description>
