	<brief_summary>Rationale: Neck complaints are often caused by motor vehicle accidents and particular after rear-end collision. Patients complain about neck pain after a whiplash trauma, which lead to mobility restrictions of the cervical spine. It is estimated that 20% develop a chronic pain disorder after 1 year, called a chronic whiplash syndrome. Objective: the primary objective is to investigate the natural course of active-and passive range of motion and principally the difference score between active-and passive cervical range of motion after a whiplash trauma. The secondary objectives are: investigate the predictive value of active-and passive range of motion and chronicity. Further, the correlation between the degree of restriction of the active and passive backward flexion and chronicity will be investigated. Finally, the correlation between the possible predictive factors such as pain, ideas and feeling about pain, memory and attention, events of the last year and complaints after the motor vehicle accident and chronicity are examined. Study design and study population: a prospective cohort of 100 whiplash patients which underwent a measurement of the cervical movements and gave permission to recontact them for further research.</brief_summary>
