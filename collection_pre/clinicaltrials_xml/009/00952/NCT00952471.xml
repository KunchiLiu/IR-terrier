	<brief_title>Reduction in Clinical Variance Using Targeted Design Changes in Computerized Provider Order Entry Order (CPOE) Sets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Variance in ordering of care can be characterized as the lack of uniform use of specific treatments by clinicians for a given medical condition. Unwarranted variance in healthcare has been associated with prolonged length of stay, diminished health and increased cost. Practice variation in the management of asthma can be significant and few investigators have evaluated strategies to reduce this variation. We hypothesized that selective redesign of order sets using different ways to frame the order and physician decision-making in a computerized provider order entry system could increase adherence to evidence-based care and reduce population-specific variance.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients admitted using an acute asthma exacerbation order set. Patients who did not have either an admission or discharge diagnosis of asthma exacerbation. In addition, patients admitted to the intensive care unit directly or transferred to the intensive care unit within 24hours were excluded from analysis. Finally, patients were excluded from analysis if asthma was not the presenting problem.</criteria>
