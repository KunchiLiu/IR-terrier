	<brief_summary>The first event of the atherosclerotic plaque formation is the accumulation of the low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) in to the intima of the arterial wall. After accumulation of the LDL-cholesterol, the oxidation of the LDL-cholesterol particles and recruitment of monocytes to the intima and media are the next steps. The thickening of intima-media thickness (IMT) is resulted from these initial events. The IMT can be easily measured by high-resolution ultrasonography in various arteries including carotid, brachial and radial arteries. The increased carotid IMT can be used as a non-invasive independent parameter indicating increased cardiovascular mortality. Some investigators reported increased radial IMT is associated with increased early failure of the radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula in the hemodialysis patients. Moreover, radial IMT is increased in patients underwent radial artery intervention because of denudation injury of the radial artery. Recently, the use of statin can halt the progression of the carotid IMT progression. However, it is unknown that the use of statin can prevent the progression of radial IMT after the transradial coronary intervention. The investigators want to evaluate the effect of statins on the progression of the radial IMT after the transradial intervention.</brief_summary>
