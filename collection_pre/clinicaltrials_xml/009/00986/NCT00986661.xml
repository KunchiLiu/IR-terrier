	<brief_summary>This open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effect on tumor growth following a single intralesional injection of PV-10 in subjects with either (a) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is not amenable to resection, transplant or other potentially curative therapy or (b) cancer metastatic to the liver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess PV-10 Chemoablation of Cancer of the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject will be enrolled in one of three planned cohorts (Main Study Group, Expansion Cohort 1 or Expansion Cohort 2). Main Study Group. Three initial subjects with either HCC or cancer metastatic to the liver will receive 0.25 mL PV-10 per cc lesion volume (Lv) to a single lesion (up to a maximum dose of 7.5 mL PV-10). If none of the initial three subjects experiences a new and persistent CTCAE Grade 3 or greater non-hematological or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity over a 28-day follow-up interval, an additional three subjects will be enrolled and similarly treated with PV-10 administered at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10) provided no new and persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity occurs. Expansion Cohort 1 (EC1). Following demonstration of safety and tolerability in the Main Study Group, up to 48 additional subjects with cancers metastatic to the liver or with recurrent HCC will be enrolled into this expansion cohort. Subjects will be treated with PV-10 administered at 0.50 mL per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10). Enrollment will continue provided no new and persistent Grade 3 or greater non-hematological (excluding fatigue) or any Grade 4 hematological toxicity occurs. Expansion Cohort 2 (PV-10 plus Sorafenib). Following demonstration of safety and tolerability in the Main Study Group, up to 6 additional subjects with HCC receiving sorafenib at a dose that has been stable and tolerable for at least 4 weeks will be enrolled into each of two successive dose groups in Expansion Cohort 2. The first 3 subjects will be assigned to Expansion Cohort 2.1 (EC2.1) and will receive PV-10 administered at 0.25 mL PV-10 per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 7.5 mL PV-10). If none of the initial 3 subjects experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as onset of any Grade 3 or greater non-hematological (excluding fatigue) or Grade 4 hematological toxicity within 28 days of PV-10 administration that is persistent for 14 days or longer, enrollment in Expansion Cohort 2.2 will commence. If 2 or more of the initial 3 subjects experience a DLT, the combination of PV-10 and sorafenib at this PV-10 dose level will be judged to be intolerable. If one of the initial 3 subjects experiences a DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled in Expansion Cohort 2.1. If none of these additional subjects experiences a DLT, enrollment in Expansion Cohort 2.2 will commence. If 1 or more of the 3 additional subjects (i.e., ≥ 2 of 6 subjects) experiences a DLT, the combination of PV-10 and sorafenib at this PV-10 dose level will be judged to be intolerable. If Expansion Cohort 2.1 has been completed with tolerable toxicity, enrollment in Expansion Cohort 2.2 (EC2.2) will commence at a dose of 0.5 mL PV-10 per cc Lv (up to a maximum dose of 15 mL PV-10). If none or 1 of the first 3 subjects enrolled experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If no more than 1 subject among 6 experiences a DLT, the dose of 0.5 mL PV-10 per cc Lv will be judged to be the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for the study. If 2 or more of the 6 subjects experiences a DLT, the combination of PV-10 and sorafenib at this PV-10 dose level will be judged to be intolerable. If the Expansion Cohort 2.2 dose is not tolerated, Expansion Cohort 2.1 will be expanded to 6 subjects, unless this has already occurred. If more than 1 subject of the 6 experiences a DLT, the Expansion Cohort 2.1 dose of PV-10 plus sorafenib will judged to be intolerable. Otherwise, the Expansion Cohort 2.1 dose will be the MTD for the study. Subjects in Expansion Cohort 1 or Expansion Cohort 2 with more than one injectable tumor ≥ 1 cm in diameter will be eligible for treatment of an additional injectable tumor 28 days to 120 days after prior PV-10 administration provided that any prior treatments with PV-10 were well tolerated. This may be repeated until all injectable tumors ≥ 1 cm in diameter have received PV-10.</detailed_description>
