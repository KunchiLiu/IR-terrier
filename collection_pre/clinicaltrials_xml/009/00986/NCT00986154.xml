	<criteria>Male or female subjects older than the minimum legal adult age (country specific); Acute symptomatic proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE confirmed at the site by appropriate diagnostic imaging; Able to provide written informed consent thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent to treat the current episode of DVT and/or PE; More than 48 hours pretreatment with anticoagulant therapy prior to randomization; Calculated Creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt; 30 mL/min; significant liver disease (e.g., acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;\= 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin (TBL) x 1.5 times the ULN; patients with active cancer for whom long term treatment with (LMW) heparin is anticipated; active bleeding or high risk for bleeding contraindicating treatment with (LMW) heparin or warfarin; chronic treatment with nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); treatment with aspirin in a dosage of more than 100 mg/per day or dual antiplatelet therapy; concurrent treatment with potent Pgp inhibitors; subjects with any condition that, as judged by the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study</criteria>
