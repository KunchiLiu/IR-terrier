Each patient will evaluate her/his postsurgical pain intensity prior to taking trial medication. To be eligible for this trial, post surgical pain must be moderate to severe Subjects should be in good health otherwise as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram and laboratory tests at screening. Female subjects should be either postmenopausal or should have had surgical sterilization. Patients with known hypersensitivity to diclofenac, aspirin, acetaminophen or to antipyretics or with allergies manifested by attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis following treatment with aspirin or other agents with cyclooxygenaseinhibiting activity such as NSAIDs. Use of antipyretic/analgesic drugs from 48 hrs predose to 24 hrs postdose Presence of bleeding disorder (history of excessive bleeding after dental procedures or minor injuries) Patients with Diabetes mellitus. Presence, history of, or family history of malignant hyperthermia or anesthesiarelated events that may be suggestive of malignant hyperthermia. An abnormal ECG at screening, including PR&gt;200 ms, QRS&gt;110 ms, QTcF&lt;380 or &gt;450 ms, lead II T wave abnormalities. Nonspecific T wave abnormalities in leads other than lead II are permissible if not accompanied by any other morphological abnormalities. Patients with infection e.g. dental abscess Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
