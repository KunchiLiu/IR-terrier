	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Stenting, Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon or Atherectomy to Treat Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The superficial femoral artery is a common place for arteriosclerosis in patients symptomatic for lower extremity vascular disease. Advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting have provided new options for the treatment of the disease in this arterial segment. Despite the initial technical success rate of more than 95% the late clinical failure remains an important concern. Restenosis after PTA occurs in 40-60% within one year. Percutaneous removal of the obstructive material through atherectomy may reduce restenosis rate. So far, data in support of excisional atherectomy derive from registries. Another attempt to reduce restenosis is the use of paclitaxel eluting balloons (PEB). First clinical studies suggest that the use of PEBs during percutaneous treatment of femoropopliteal disease is associated with significant reductions in late lumen loss and target-lesion revascularization. There is no randomized comparison of this three different interventional strategies. Thus the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of these strategies in terms or reduction of diameter stenosis at follow-up angiogram.</detailed_description>
