	<brief_summary>Based on available mechanistic and clinical information, the investigators propose a nonrandomized study to evaluate the effect of succinylcholine in patients taking statins. The investigators' purpose is to evaluate the effect of succinylcholine on patients taking statins. Patients scheduled to undergo elective surgery (other then orthopedic, spinal, vascular or muscle) with planned endotracheal intubation will be approached regarding participation in the trial. Design of the study is complex because there is no way to randomize patients to statins or no statins and also no way to take them off the statins prior surgery. So statin use will not be randomized; confounding factors will be accounted for by stratification (every 10 years of age from 40-80 and gender) and statistical adjustment. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that succinylcholine administration increases plasma myoglobin concentration more in patients who are on statins compared to patients who do not.</brief_summary>
