	<brief_summary>Some patients who need kidney transplants have high levels of antibodies that make them incompatible with most potential deceased donor kidney offers. These patients are considered highly-sensitized and are very difficult to transplant because the likelihood that they will receive a compatible organ is very low. There are some medications and procedures that can decrease the antibody levels and this can increase the chance of finding a compatible donor for these patients. In this study the investigators will give two medications (IVIg and Rituximab) to highly-sensitized patients who are on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney transplant. After the investigators administer these medications, the investigators will continue to check for compatibility as organ offers are received. If a compatible organ offer is received, the investigators will perform the transplant using that organ. The investigators hypothesize that these medications will lower antibody levels and increase the chance that a these patients are able to receive a compatible kidney transplant.</brief_summary>
