	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic interval training versus strength training or a combination of these regimes on factors comprising the metabolic syndrome in order to find the most effective exercise regime for patients with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance and/or Endurance Training, What is Most Effective in Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Western world, approximately 25% of young to middle-aged adults have metabolic syndrome. There seem to be a strong age-dependence in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, but the incidence rises rapidly within adolescents and middle-aged groups and follows the development of obesity in the general population. Metabolic syndrome confers an increased risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and premature death; therefore, effective and affordable strategies to combat the syndrome would be of great individual and social importance. Despite the general agreement that moderate-intensity physical activity for a minimum of 30 min five days per week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min three days a week promote and maintain health, the optimal training regime to treat metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular abnormalities remains uncertain.</detailed_description>
