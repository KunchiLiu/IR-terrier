	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC + MUCI peptide vaccine in boosting the immunologic response to MUCI in patients with triple-negative BC</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine in boosting systemic immunity to MUC1 in women who have completed therapy for AJCC(American Joint Committee on Cancer)stage I-III 'triple-negative' [i.e., ER(-) PR(-) HER2/neu(-)] breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the MUC1 peptide and poly-ICLC vaccine in this cohort of patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive MUC-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) and poly-ICLC vaccine SC in weeks 0, 2, and 10 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients may receive a booster vaccine in week 52. Patients will be followed for study-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) for a period of 30 days after their last vaccination. If a patient experiences a SAE while participating in this study, they will be followed until the resolution of the SAE.</detailed_description>
