	<brief_title>Effect of Adrenocorticotropin Injection With Weekly Interferon Beta in Patients With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is a complex, multi-factorial disease that includes inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes manifesting both focally in the form of lesions and diffusely in otherwise normal-appearing brain tissue. Recent data shows that ACTH can have beneficial effects on specific neurodegenerative diseases and it may have superior neuroprotective effects. Adding a regimen of ACTH to standard Avonex treatment may provide neuroprotection and promote remyelination.</detailed_description>
