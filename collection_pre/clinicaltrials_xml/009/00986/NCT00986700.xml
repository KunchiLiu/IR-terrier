	<brief_summary>High fasting glucose is a very common problem in type 2 diabetic patients. The cause is probably glucose production by the liver, known as the "dawn phenomenon". The investigators hypothesize that a late night meal can lower the fasting glucose level by early morning insulin secretion stimulated by the food. In this study the investigators intend to test the effect of different kinds of late night meals on fasting glucose in type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
