	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether a supervised mixed aerobic and strength training (MAST) program is effective in improving overall physical fitness and blood flow in the brain and lowering risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Program in Women With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions and disorders that increase the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and strokes. Sedentary lifestyle is one of the risk factors, which decrease overall physical fitness and together with aging may lead to decrease in physical functioning in everyday life as well as changes in blood flow in the brain and cognitive functions. Regular physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. It may also improve blood flow velocity and cognitive functions. Physical activity should be as effective as possible, but also as safe as possible. Supervised mixed aerobic and strength training (MAST) program for 4 months enables to individualize the intensity of aerobic exercise based on measured maximal exercise capacity. Throughout each training session heart rate will be monitored with a new real time wireless ECG system.</detailed_description>
