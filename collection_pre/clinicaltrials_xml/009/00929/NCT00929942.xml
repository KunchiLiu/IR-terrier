	<brief_summary>A prospective observational trial involving 10 patients is planned. Intervention "SX-ELLA Stent Degradable DV Bronchial (DV Stent)" will be implanted in the target lesion in general anesthesia under fluoroscopy or by direct vision. Before dilatation, extension of the airway complications will be measured by bronchoscopy and documented.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biodegradable Stents in Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive airway complications (OAC) (bronchial stenosis) are a significant problem in lung transplantation (LTx), and a special subset of chronic graft dysfunction. The overall rate is approximately 20% per recipient. Even though disobliteration (laser, argon-coagulation, cryotherapy) or balloon dilatation (bronchoplasty) are performed there is a high rate of recurrence. Self expandable metallic stents (SEMS) is one suggested treatment option after failed initial therapy but have a high rate of re-stenosis (50-60%). Morbidity, the risk for e.g. infection and atelectasis and lower long-term survival are often consequences in pts. treated with SEMS. No surgical options aside from re-do-transplantation are available. OAC are developing mostly in the time 3 - 6 months post Tx. The idea is a permanent but temporary therapy with replacement character of the stenosis which is given in degradable bronchial stents. Hypothesis: New biodegradable bronchial stents are a successful treatment of benign bronchial stenosis after lung transplantation. After stent placement is further disobliteration is less frequently used during the next 6 months.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Recurrent airway complication (obstructive or necrotic) after singleorder doublelung transplantation (at least twice balloondilatation or disobliteration therapy). Patient at least 3 months after lung transplantation and followed in MHH outpatient clinic. Target lesion in the left or right main stem bronchus, intermediate bronchus, right or left lower lobe, left upper lobe. Multiple lesions are eligible for inclusion and treatment but DVstent implantation in different target lesions should be at least 6 weeks apart. Pregnant or breast feeding women. Patients who are using no doublebarrier method of birth control. Previous use of a metallic stent (SEMS). Target lesion in the middle lobe bronchus, right upper lobe, carina or trachea. Previous use of brachytherapy or topical mitomycin. Pats. after heartlung transplantation.</criteria>
