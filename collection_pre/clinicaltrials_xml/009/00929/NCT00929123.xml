	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a manual therapy technique (neural mobilization) on measures of clinical pain and function, experimental pain sensitivity, and on the function of the median nerve in individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome. The investigators hypothesized that individuals receiving a neural mobilization technique known to directly stress the median nerve would demonstrate greater improvements in clinical pain and function, experimental pain sensitivity, and median nerve function than those receiving a sham technique.</brief_summary>
