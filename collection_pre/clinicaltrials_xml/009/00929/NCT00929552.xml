	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate if dietary fish oil has a beneficial effect on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, body composition and metabolic rate in healthy, but slightly overweight, teenage boys. We hypothesized that the n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil might have greater effect during growth and development, as intervention trials studying the effect of fish oil on babies have shown greater effects than in adults.</brief_summary>
