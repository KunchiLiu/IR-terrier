	<criteria>1. Male or female adults aged ≥ 40 years, who have signed an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedure. 2. Patients with moderate to severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, Stage II or Stage III) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines 2008. 3. Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. 4. Patients with a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 30% and &lt; 80% of the predicted normal, and postbronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 0.7 at Visit 2 (Day 14). 5. Patients, according to daily electronic diary data between Visit 2 (Day 14) and Visit 3 (Day 1), with a total score of 1 or more on at least 4 of the last 7 days prior to Visit 3 (Day 1). 1. Pregnant women or nursing mothers (pregnancy confirmed by positive urine pregnancy test). 2. Women of childbearing potential, unless using an approved method of medical or surgical contraception. 3. Patients requiring long term oxygen therapy (&gt; 15 h a day) on a daily basis for chronic hypoxemia, or who have been hospitalized for an exacerbation of their airways disease in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Day 21) or between Visit 1 (Day 21) and Visit 3 (Day 1). 4. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Day 21). 5. Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator or the responsible Novartis personnel, have a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition. 6. Patients with any history of asthma indicated by (but not limited to) a blood eosinophil count &gt; 600/mm^3 (at Visit 1, Day 21) and onset of symptoms prior to age 40 years. 7. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc measured at Visit 1 (Day 21) (Fridericia method) is prolonged (&gt; 450 ms for males or &gt; 470 ms for females. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply to the study.</criteria>
