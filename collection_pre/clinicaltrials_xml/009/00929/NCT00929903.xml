	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of pazopanib hydrochloride in treating young patients with solid tumors that have relapsed or not responded to treatment. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Young Patients With Solid Tumors That Have Relapsed or Not Responded to Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum-tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of pazopanib hydrochloride in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. II. Define and describe the toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib hydrochloride in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Preliminarily define the antitumor activity of pazopanib hydrochloride within the confines of a phase I study. II. Evaluate changes in tumor vascular permeability following initiation of pazopanib hydrochloride and correlate these changes with clinical outcome by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients accrued after the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib hydrochloride has been determined receive pazopanib hydrochloride as an oral suspension. Some patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and periodically during study. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic studies.</detailed_description>
