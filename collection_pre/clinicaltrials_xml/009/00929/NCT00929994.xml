	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that the addition of formal cardiac rehabilitation to standard care will result in long-term improvements in cardiovascular fitness and functional capacity in individuals who have suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. Furthermore, it is proposed that the addition of cardiac rehabilitation will influence stroke risk, physical activity participation, strength, and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Individuals With Transient Ischemic Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as an episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain ischemia lasting less than 24 hours. Once an individual has suffered a TIA, preventative measures can be taken to target modifiable risk factors, one of which is physical inactivity. The current proposal focuses on the use of an established model of care (cardiac rehabilitation (CR)) and applies it to those who have suffered a TIA in order to maximize physical activity and minimize risk of future cardiovascular events. This will be a one-group pre/post design study. Participants will undergo measures at baseline, 6 and 12 months (cardiovascular fitness, 6 minute walk test, quality of life, diet, strength, physical activity, and Framingham Profile stroke risk (plasma lipids, blood pressure, medication use)).</detailed_description>
