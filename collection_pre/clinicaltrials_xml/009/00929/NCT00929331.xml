Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g. lowdose aspirin, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency are eligible. Receipt of an influenza vaccine within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Administration of any vaccines within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during the study period. Subjects who receive such treatment after enrollment will be followed per protocol and included in the safety analysis, but excluded from the accordingtoprotocol cohort. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study.
