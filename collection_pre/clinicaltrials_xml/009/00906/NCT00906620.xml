	<detailed_description>In this health promotion program, a pilot intervention study will be implemented to assess the effects of three different health promoting / suicide prevention programs in 11,000 students across 11 European countries (Sweden, Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain): 1. A general health promotion program targeting students' awareness on healthy/unhealthy behaviours and students' self-efficacy in diminishing unhealthy behaviours; 2. ProfScreen - screening by professionals of at-risk students through a questionnaire. For adolescents identified as high risk (screen positives) the program includes referral to mental health treatment and ensuring compliance. 3. QPR (Question, Persuade &amp; Refer) - a gatekeepers' program, training all adult staff at schools (teachers, counselors, nurses etc.) and parents on how to recognize &amp; refer a student with risk-taking behaviours or suffering from mental illness to mental-health help resources. Each of these prevention programs uses a different active component in order to be successful. The first prevention program empowers the students by increasing their self-efficacy. The second prevention program (ProfScreen) empowers mental health professional in identifying subjects at risk. The third program (QPR) empowers teachers and parents in at-risk case finding and referring to mental health facilities. The registration of the complete RCT is available on the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00000214).</detailed_description>
