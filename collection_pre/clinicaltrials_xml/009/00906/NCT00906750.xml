	<brief_summary>Eligible research subjects will be randomized to receive either FluMist or inactivated influenza vaccine then stratified by age and necessity to receive either one or two immunizations. Subjects requiring one immunization will be immunized at Day 0. Subjects requiring two immunizations will be immunized at Day 0 and Day 28. Subjects will be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination and given a diary card to record symptoms after each vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are to: 1. Describe the safety of FluMist and inactivated influenza vaccine. 2. Describe the incidence and duration of viral replication following immunization with FluMist. 3. To examine the association between immunization response (seroconversion or seroprotection) and baseline clinical factors (age, type of malignancy, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, serum IgA, IgG and IgM levels).</detailed_description>
