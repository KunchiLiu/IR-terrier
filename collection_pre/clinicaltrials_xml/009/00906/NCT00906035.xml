	<brief_summary>This research study will evaluate the effects of aspirin and dipyridamole alone and in combination on the blood flow in the vessels of the legs. We will examine how these medications are able to inhibit the clotting of platelets in the vessels of patients with PAD, and thereby affect the blood flow in the legs. Platelets are cells in the blood that have the ability to adhere to each other to form clots.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Vascular Biology of Dipyridamole in Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dipyridamole has been reformulated to guarantee systemic bioavailability and steady state levels compatible with inhibition of platelet aggregation ex vivo (1). This newly formulated dipyridamole has been shown to roughly equal in efficacy to low dose aspirin in the secondary prevention of stroke and the drug combination seems roughly additive (2). The present study is designed to explore two potential mechanisms which have been linked to dipyridamole action on the vessel wall; modulation of vascular eicosanoid generation and prevention of oxidant stress (3). We shall address the hypothesis that dipyridamole affects these systems in patients with PAD. These individuals have disordered platelet-vascular interactions, as reflected by increased generation of thromboxane, an index of platelet activation and of prostacyclin, probably a homeostatic response to traumatic and chemical stimulation of the endothelium (4,5). Furthermore, we shall assess the functional consequences of dipyridamole action, alone and in combination with aspirin compared with aspirin alone on local measurements of flow and oxygenation, including exercise tolerance, Doppler Ultrasound and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Lipid peroxidation will be quantified based on mass spectrometric analysis of the major urinary isoprostane, 8,12-iso-iPF2a-VI (6,7).</detailed_description>
