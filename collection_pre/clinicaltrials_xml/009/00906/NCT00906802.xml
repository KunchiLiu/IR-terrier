	<brief_summary>One of the most common complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is delayed gastric emptying (DGE), otherwise known as "gastroparesis," which is not fatal but results in prolonged hospital stay and increased hospital costs. Delayed gastric emptying is defined as nasogastric decompression after postoperative day (POD) 10 or a failure to tolerate a regular diet after POD 14. The incidence of DGE has been reported to range from 5% to 72%.</brief_summary>
