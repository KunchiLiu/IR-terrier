	<brief_summary>Phase II, multi-centric, open-label, study. Disseminated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in patients older than 60: evaluation of fractionated radio-immunotherapy with 90Y-DOTA-hLL2 as a consolidation therapy after first line of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of 90Y-DOTA-hLL2 as a Consolidation Therapy After R-CHOP in Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial treatment: 6 courses of CHOP-R 14 with evaluation of response before C4 (observation of no change or progression at this time will get the patient off study). Consolidation : fractionated RIT (8 weeks after the end of R-CHOP: 2 injections of 15 mCi/m2 of 90Y-DOTA-hLL2 and hLL2 at day 1 and day 8).</detailed_description>
