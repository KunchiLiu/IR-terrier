	<brief_summary>This study will explore the efficacy and safety of a regimen of ON 01910.Na as a 48-hour continuous intravenous infusion once a week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle in MDS patients with Trisomy 8 or classified as Intermediate-1, -2 or High Risk who are not responding to current therapeutic options. The rationale for this trial is based upon data from laboratory studies with ON 01910.Na and upon activity that has been observed in other clinical trials with ON 01910.Na in patients with MDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of ON 01910.Na in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Patients With Trisomy 8 or Classified as Intermediate-1, -2 or High Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, study in which 14 MDS patients with Trisomy 8 or classified as Intermediate-1, -2 and High risk who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive ON 01910.Na 800 mg/m^2/24h as an continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) over 48 hours once a week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. As of Amendment 3 to the Protocol, the regimen is changed to 1800 mg/24h for 72 hours every other week for the first four 2-week cycles and every 4 weeks afterwards. The total study duration is 31 weeks, which includes a 2-week screening phase, a 27-week dosing phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase that begins after the last dose of ON 01910.Na. Beginning at week 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter, patients will be assessed for response. Patients who drop out for any reason will not be replaced. Patients who achieve by week 29 a complete or partial response or stabilization of their disease are eligible to receive an additional 24 weeks of ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/24 h over 72 hours per week of a 4-week cycle.</detailed_description>
