	<brief_summary>This is a two part study comparing the Trachview videoscope to standard laryngoscopy in their ability to visualize the glottic opening. It is hypothesized that the glottic view is improved with the Trachview videoscope. Not only can the Trachview provide an alternative and often improved view of the airway, but can be used for teaching novice intubators. Furthermore, the Trachview requires minimal deviation from standard intubating techniques and thus, it is much easier to learn and use than many fiberoptic scopes currently available.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a two part study. Part one: Adult airway mannequins were used. Subjects were medical students with no previous experience in intubation. Part two: This was a convenience sample of patients undergoing elective surgery. All patients were consented. The subjects were physicians and nurse anesthetists who were going to be intubated in the operating room setting. For both parts of the study, the subjects viewed the glottic opening using direct laryngoscopy followed or preceded by visualization of the glottic opening using the Trachview. The subjects were asked to score the amount of the glottic opening that could be visualized using the POGO (percent of glottic opening)score. Subjects were only given a very brief inservice on how to use the Trachview. Additional measurements such as presurgical airway assessments of the patients were obtained.</detailed_description>
