	<brief_title>A Study of IMC-A12 in Combination With Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine progression free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have received no prior systemic therapy when treated with IMC-A12 administered every three weeks in combination with oral sorafenib administered twice daily.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable HCC The patient has at least one target lesion measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Target lesion(s) must not lay within a previously irradiated, ablated, or chemoembolized area. If a lesion does lie in such an area, there must be evidence of growth on successive imaging studies, including tumor hypervascularity, in order for such a lesion to be considered a target lesion The patient has not received prior systemic therapy for HCC. Patients may have received prior embolization, chemoembolization, intraarterial chemotherapy infusion, ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, or cryosurgery The patient has fasting serum glucose &lt; 160 mg/dL or below the ULN and/or hemoglobin A1C &lt; 7%. If baseline nonfasting glucose &lt; 160 mg/dL, fasting glucose measurement is not required The patient has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document The patient has brain metastases The patient has acute hepatitis The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided that their blood glucose is within normal range and that they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition The patient has congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA, unstable angina pectoris, new onset of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy The patient has experienced a hemorrhage or bleeding event â‰¥ NCICTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior first dose of study therapy</criteria>
