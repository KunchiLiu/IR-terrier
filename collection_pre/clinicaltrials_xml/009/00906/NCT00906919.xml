	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Diabetes Patient Education and Self-Management Education in Persons With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the current health care environment, it is unacceptable for patient education programs to merely provide information. Rather, educational programs must concentrate on behavior change and on supporting patients to become more confident and motivated in participating in managing their health. Persons with type 2 diabetes attending a Diabetes Education Centre will be assigned to either a group that receives regular professionally-led diabetes patient education (control group) or to to a group that receives regular professionally-led diabetes patient education augmented by lay-led self-management education i.e., the Stanford six-session Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (experimental group). Data will be collected at two points in time (0 and 6 months). Outcome measures will show if participants who receive self-management training in addition to regular patient education are able to:manage their diabetes more effectively; engage in the specific behaviors that keep the condition from worsening; achieve more control over their condition; and use the health care system more effectively.</detailed_description>
