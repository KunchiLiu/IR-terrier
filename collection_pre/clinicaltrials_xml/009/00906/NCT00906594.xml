	<criteria>All patients were at least 18 years old, with unilateral or bilateral openangle glaucoma (defined as IOP &gt; 21 mmHg, mean of three consecutive measurements, at any time during the day, at the moment of glaucoma diagnosis) or ocular hypertension (IOP&gt; 25 mmHg, mean of three consecutive measurements, at anytime during the day, at the moment of diagnosis). Glaucoma was defined as a reproducible glaucomatous visual field defect based on GHT outside normal limits and/or PSD lower than 0,5% or glaucomatous changes of the optic disc associated to elevated IOP. A visual acuity (ETDRS) of 20/80 or better was required for randomization. Included woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy, systemic contraindication to betablocker therapy, argon laser trabeculoplasty three months before screening visit, any history of filtering surgery, ocular surgery or uveitis three months before screening visit, hypersensitivity to any compound of the study drugs, concomitant use of any experimental drug, any condition in which treatment with betablocker is contraindicated or any other abnormal and/or ocular condition or symptom that would prevent study participation, according to the judgment of the investigator. The use of systemic betablocker, if needed, was allowed and not considered an exclusion criterion. Latanoprost nonresponders defined as lower than 15% IOP reduction after runin period with latanoprost monotherapy were excluded from the study.</criteria>
