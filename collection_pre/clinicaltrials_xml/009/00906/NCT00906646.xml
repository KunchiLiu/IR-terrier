	<brief_summary>This was a prospective randomised trial of metabolic therapy including antioxidants and cellular energisers to determine whether this therapy could improve the results of cardiac surgery. The hypothesis was that the metabolic therapy could improve clinical recovery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Perioperative therapy with antioxidants and metabolic substrates has the potential to reduce oxidative stress and improve recovery from cardiac surgery, particularly in elderly and high risk cases. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of perioperative metabolic therapy at a biochemical and clinical level in cardiac surgical patients. Methods Patients (n = 117, mean age 65 Â± 1.0 years, 74% male) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery were randomized to receive for a minimum of 2 weeks before and one month after surgery, either metabolic therapy (coenzyme Q10, magnesium orotate, lipoic acid, omega-3 fatty acids and selenium) or placebo. Biochemical and clinical outcomes were assessed.</detailed_description>
