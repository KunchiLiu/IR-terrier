	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral intake of COMT inhibitors affects the smooth plasma levodopa levels achieved by intestinal levodopa/carbidopa infusion in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. The hypothesis is that COMT inhibitors make plasma concentrations of levodopa more fluctuating.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Levodopa/Carbidopa Infusion With and Without Oral Catechol-O-methyl Transferase (COMT) Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim is to measure variability in plasma levodopa levels during the following three treatments: Day 1: Duodopa in individually optimised dose Day 2: 80% of optimised Duodopa dose + two tablets of entacapone at t=0 hours and at t= 6 hours Day 3: 80% of optimised Duodopa dose + two tablets of tolcapone at t=0 hours and at t= 6 hours Plasma samples for determination of levodopa concentrations will be taken every 30 minutes during 8 hours. Video recordings will be performed every 30 min during 8 hours, for later blinded assessments by 2-3 experts. Sequences will be in randomised order. Patient self-scores regarding mobility will be recorded, every 30 min during 8 hours.</detailed_description>
