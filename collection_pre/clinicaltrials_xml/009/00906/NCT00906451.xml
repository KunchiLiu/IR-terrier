	<brief_summary>During myocardial infarction, inflammatory response may negatively influence ventricle wall remodeling as well as endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in the coronary and systemic arterial systems. Statins have been consistently proved to attenuate inflammation and improve endothelial function. In this study, we tested the effect of different doses of statin on inflammatory response and endothelium-dependent vasodilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simvastatin Effect on Inflammation and Endothelial Function After Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the generation of inflammatory mediators negatively influences arterial wall remodeling and the endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in the coronary and systemic arterial systems. The intensity of this inflammatory upregulation is strongly related to the incidence of recurrent coronary events. High dose potent statins can rapidly reduce plasma levels of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins and inflammatory activity in subjects during ACS. By inference, it is plausible to hypothesize that these effects during the acute phase of myocardial infarction may influence the post-discharge endothelial dysfunction. So far, data is unavailable to verify this assumption or to define the potency required for such statin anti-inflammatory effect in myocardial infarction patients. The present study aim to investigate the role of statin dose on the time-course of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and its late effect on endothelium-dependent arterial dilation.</detailed_description>
