	<brief_summary>Introduction: While growing older, it is possible to notice a decrease in the functional and physiological reserves in the organism which impairs the the abilities in the elderly in doing some tasks. A simple balance becomes a challenge. Objective: To evaluate the functional balance in the aging process. Methods: The group was formed by 48 people from 10 to 85 years old. The evaluation instruments are the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), the Unipodal Support Test, the Functional Reach Test and the Romberg's Test.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>48 individuals of both sexes and aged between 10 and 85 years were chosen. These individuals were divided according to age, into four groups (each group containing 12 individuals, 6 men and 6 women): Group I (G1): 10 - 18, Group II (G2): 20 - 35; Group III (G3): 45 - 60, Group IV (G4): 65 - 85. The instruments used for assessment of the balance were: (1) Berg Scale - consists of 14 items with common activities of daily life, with progressive degree of difficulty (2) Assessment of Gait and Balance for Performance Oriented (POMA), consists of a protocol that evaluates the static and dynamic balance, with operations similar to the activities of daily living, (3) Test Support Unipodal; (4) adapted Functional Reach Test, which assesses the stability in the standing position, (5) Test and Romberg Romberg's test Romberg-Barr√© or sensitized conducted in stable and unstable soil, and all positions were first with open eyes and then with closed eyes. The duration of each exposure was 30 seconds, with different positioning of the feet.</detailed_description>
