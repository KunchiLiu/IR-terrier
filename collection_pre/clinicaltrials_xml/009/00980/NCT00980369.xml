	<brief_title>The Importance of Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy Incision: Parallel or Vertical</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) technique is considered the optimal surgical treatment for chronic anal fissures (CAFs); however, questions remain regarding the best technique. The present study investigated whether the type of anoderm incision (vertical or parallel to the anus) affected wound healing, wound-related complications, incontinence and recurrence rates in CAF patients undergoing open LIS.</detailed_description>
