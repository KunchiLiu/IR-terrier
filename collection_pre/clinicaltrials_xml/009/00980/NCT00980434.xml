	<brief_summary>The investigators are studying the clinical worth of the serum markers S-100B and NSE in patients with spinal cord injuries e.g. in patients with vertebral fractures. If there is a injury to the neuronal structures these two proteins could be secreted into the serum and add evidence to the severity of the injury.</brief_summary>
