	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that Adaptive CRT is at least as good at optimizing a patient's cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) as the current method of using an echocardiogram. Adaptive CRT (aCRT) is an implantable heart failure device feature that attempts to optimize CRT without echocardiographic testing.</brief_summary>
