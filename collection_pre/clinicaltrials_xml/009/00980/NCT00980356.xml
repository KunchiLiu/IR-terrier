	<brief_title>Vildagliptin in New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Development of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) also called post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and poor short term clinical outcomes. There is currently no doubt about the fact that NODAT is a condition that needs medical attention and treatment. Although most centers follow treatment regimens for DM type II prospective data about their effectiveness in NODAT are lacking. Little information exists in kidney transplantation regarding conventional glucose-lowering therapies, either oral hypoglycemic agents or traditional insulin regimens. The Aim of this study was to evaluate whether a monotherapy with Vildagliptin improve glycemic control and to assess the safety in kidney transplanted patients with newly diagnosed NODAT.</detailed_description>
