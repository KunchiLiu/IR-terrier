	<brief_summary>People who have received an allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are more likely than other people to get ill from a germ called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Most people who have had a stem cell transplant are offered a vaccine called 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) to help protect against this germ. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response in HSCT recipients who receive a 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine (13vPnC) followed by 23vPS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subject &gt;=2 years of age. Allogeneic HSCT for hematologic disorder. Allogeneic HSCT with full myeloablative conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning. Allogeneic HSCT approximately 3 to 6 months (91 days to 203 days) before enrollment. Stable engraftment (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1000/µL; platelet count &gt;50,000/µL). Complete hematologic remission of underlying disease with very good partial remission (VGPR) acceptable in the case of lymphoma and myeloma. Subject or parent/legal guardian expected to be available for the entire study and can be contacted by telephone. Subject or parent/legal guardian must be able to complete an electronic diary (ediary) and complete all relevant study procedures during study participation. Hematological recovery as defined by ANC &gt;1000/µL; platelet count &gt;50,000/µL. All female and male subjects who are biologically capable of having children must agree to abstinence or commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control from signing of the ICF until for 3 months after the last vaccination. Negative urine pregnancy test for all female subjects of child bearing potential. Autologous HSCT. Receipt of donor lymphocyte infusions during the 28 days preceding enrollment. Uncontrolled GVHD that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject from participating in the study. Lansky/Karnofsky Score &lt;=60%. Receipt of plasma products or immunoglobulins during the 60 days preceding enrollment. Receipt of rituximab since HSCT. Receipt of chemotherapy for relapse of underlying malignant disease since HSCT. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Lymphoproliferative disorder since HSCT. Chronic illnesses with cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or liver failure that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent the subject participating in the study. Vaccination with any licensed or experimental pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT. Previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccinerelated component. Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would in the opinion of the investigator contraindicate intramuscular injection. Participation in another study with ongoing use of an unlicensed investigational product from 28 days before study enrollment until the end of the study. Participation in another study with ongoing use of a licensed investigational product that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Permanent residence in a nursing home or other residential care facility. Pregnant or breastfeeding female subject. Subject who is a direct relative (child, grandchild, parent, or grandparent) of study personnel, or is a member of the study personnel. Receipt of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) including gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products, and tissue engineered products at any time before enrollment. If information is available, previous allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccinerelated component in a stem cell donor.</criteria>
