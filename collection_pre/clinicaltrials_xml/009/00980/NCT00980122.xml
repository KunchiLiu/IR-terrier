	<brief_summary>Cancer is the commonest cause of death in Singapore, and many cancer deaths occur in hospital. Management of cancer patients is getting more complex with constant development of new drugs, interventional procedures and supportive measures. Despite this, the majority of advanced cancer patients will die from their disease or related complications. There is a lack of data on the utilisation of health resources in advanced cancer patients in this country. In this study the investigators ask themselves how aggressive care was in the last 3 months of the patient's life. The investigators will be collecting data on specific cancer treatments, interventional procedures, and supportive measures.</brief_summary>
