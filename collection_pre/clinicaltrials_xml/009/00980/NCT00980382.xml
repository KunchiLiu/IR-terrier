	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized study, consisting of a dose-escalating phase I study in advanced solid cancer and a subsequent phase II study in metastatic gastric cancer. In phase I study, we aim to determine the MTD and the recommended dose of S-1 combined with docetaxel given every 3 weeks. Dose level and escalating schedule are followings - S-1(level 0, 1/2, 3/4, 5: 60, 70, 80, 90 mg/m2/day) q 12 hours po Days 1-14) - Docetaxel (level 0/1,2/3, 4/5: 25, 30, 35 mg/m2) mixed in d5w 200 ml iv over 60 min: Days 1, 8with dexamethasone 8 mg po q 12hr for 3 days (total 6 doses: D0-2)and parenteral pheniramine maleate 1 ample (45.5mg) before docetaxel</brief_summary>
