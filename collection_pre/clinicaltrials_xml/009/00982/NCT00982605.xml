	<brief_title>EBUS-guided TBNA for Molecular Diagnostic of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (LN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSCLC is a common cancer. Accurate and early staging has a significant impact on outcome. EBUS-TBNA of involved mediastinal lymph nodes is critical. Molecular markers could improve mediastinal staging.</detailed_description>
