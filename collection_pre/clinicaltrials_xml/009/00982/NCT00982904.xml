	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at assessing the tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of the fexinidazole in healthy volunteers. In animal models of both acute and chronic experimental Trypanosomiasis infections, fexinidazole shows highly promising efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human African Trypanosomiasis: First in Man Clinical Trial of a New Medicinal Product, the Fexinidazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is designed to obtain safety, tolerability and PK data after single and multiple oral administration of increasing doses of fexinidazole in healthy male sub-Saharan African subjects. This study will also assess the relative bioavailability of fexinidazole administered as a tablet in comparison with oral suspension, and to assess the impact of concomitant food intake on the relative bioavailability of fexinidazole after single oral dose administration. The study will be divided in 3 successive parts. Study Part I will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study with fexinidazole administered as an oral suspension. Study Part II will be a comparative bioavailability study of a fexinidazole tablet vs. the oral suspension and assessment of food effect, according to a three-way cross-over design. Clinical part will be conducted in open conditions and bioanalysis in blind conditions. Study Part III will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study with fexinidazole administered either as an oral suspension or as a tablet, depending on Part II results. Dosage regimen will be either q.d. or b.i.d., depending on Part I and Part II results for the unchanged drug and the metabolites. Treatment duration will be 14 days. Bioanalysis will be performed in open conditions for Study Part I and Study Part III.</detailed_description>
