	<brief_title>Yoga Breathing for Fatigue in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue is the most common complaint among cancer patients. This pilot study will evaluate the effects of pranayama (ancient yoga breathing techniques) on fatigue and quality of life among 30 patients undergoing chemotherapy, on an every 2, 3, or 4 week schedule, with a fatigue score of at least 4 on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (most). Patients will be randomized to either pranayama or wait-list control. The pranayama group will learn and practice 3 breathing techniques on a daily basis. The study period will occur during 2 consecutive cycles of chemotherapy (cycle A and Cycle B), and the wait-list control patients will crossover to the treatment arm at the beginning of his/her Cycle B. Fatigue will be measured using the revised Piper Fatigue Scale along with quality of life measures. These study measures will be conducted at baseline, at the end of cycle A, and at the end of cycle B. We hypothesize that pranayama will improve clinical symptoms of fatigue and quality of life among patients undergoing chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
