	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before radiotherapy) using cisplatin and docetaxel, followed by carboplatin given at the same time as radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Cisplatin/Docetaxel (CDDP/TXT) and Chemoradiation for Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for patients with unresectable head and neck cancer, but there can be substantial added toxicity with chemoradiotherapy compared to radiation therapy alone. Neoadjuvant therapy with cisplatin / 5-fluorouracil has demonstrated activity in this disease, and taxanes appear to improve response further. Docetaxel / cisplatin / 5-fluorouracil has been shown to be a highly active regimen. However, with the potential added toxicities of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it is important to minimize toxicity while maintaining efficacy. Chemotherapeutic agents that are DNA cycle-specific like 5-fluorouracil are more stomatotoxic than those that are cell phase non-specific. Of note, several studies have suggested that docetaxel and cisplatin is a highly active combination when used for advanced disease or as neoadjuvant therapy . This study will therefore test the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel without 5-fluorouracil followed by chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin to determine whether promising response rates with modest toxicity can be achieved. Carboplatin will be used as the radiosensitizing agent during chemoradiotherapy to reduce nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity as compared to further treatment with cisplatin.</detailed_description>
