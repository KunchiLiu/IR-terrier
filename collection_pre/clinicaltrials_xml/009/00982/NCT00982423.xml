	<brief_summary>The investigators' objective is to define the effects of decreasing the furosemide dose on heart, kidney and humoral function in people with compensated heart failure and kidney dysfunction and also in people with compensated heart failure without kidney dysfunction. Secondly, to define the humoral activation in both groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Decreasing the Lasix Dose on the Cardiorenal System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The broad objective of this protocol is to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of human Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS) with a specific emphasis upon the biological interaction between diuretic therapy, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) and cyclic 3'-5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Compensated CHF without Renal Dysfunction: Left ventricular ejection fraction of equal or less than 40% assessed by echocardiography, nuclear scan, MRI, or left ventriculogram within the past 36 months. Stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III symptoms as defined by: a) no change in NYHA symptoms over the past 3 months; b) on stable doses of ACE inhibitor or beta blocker or digoxin or furosemide or angiotensin II receptor, type 1 (AT1) blocker over the past 3 months; c) no episode of decompensated CHF over the past 6 months. Calculated creatinine clearance of equal or less than 80 ml/min, using the CockcroftGault formula assessed within the past 36 months and a confirmatory calculated creatinine clearance equal or less than 80 ml/min at the time of enrollment. Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Compensated CHF with Renal Dysfunction: Left ventricular ejection fraction of equal or less than 40% assessed by echocardiography, nuclear scan or left ventriculogram within the past 36 months. Stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III symptoms as defined by: a) no change in NYHA symptoms over the past 3 months; b) on stable doses of ACE inhibitor or beta blocker or digoxin or furosemide or AT1 blocker over the past 3 months; c) no episode of decompensated CHF over the past 6 months. Calculated creatinine clearance of equal or less than 60 ml/min and greater than 20 ml/min, using the CockcroftGault formula assessed within the past 36 months and a confirmatory calculated creatinine clearance equal or less than 60 ml/min and greater than 20 ml/min at the time of enrollment.
