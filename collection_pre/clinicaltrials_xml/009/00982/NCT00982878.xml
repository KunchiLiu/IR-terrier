	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the Central Nervous System exposure of maraviroc in HIV-1 infected subjects receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen, including maraviroc, at steady state.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Maraviroc Central Nervous System (CNS) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>15 HIV-1 infected subjects currently receiving stable antiretroviral therapy will be recruited. At study entry, within 14 days of screening procedures, subjects will commence maraviroc dosed at 150 mg twice daily. For the rest of study period antiretroviral therapy will comprise: - Truvada™ one tablet once daily at 0900 - Kaletra™ two tablets twice daily 0900 and 2100 - maraviroc 150 mg twice daily at 0900 and 2100 Subjects will attend for regular clinic visits during study treatment phase. On day 15, subjects will attend the unit in the morning prior to usual dosing time. Blood with be drawn to assess plasma maraviroc concentration pre dose and pre lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture will be performed under standard aseptic techniques to asses CSF maraviroc concentration and routine CSF parameters. On completion of this study visit, subjects will cease maraviroc, continue on their usual antiretroviral regimen and attend for a follow up visit 10 days later.</detailed_description>

Have screening laboratory results (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) that fall within the normal range of the central laboratory's reference ranges unless the results have been determined by the Investigator to have no clinical significance current alcohol abuse or drug dependence active opportunistic infection or significant comorbidities including dementia current prohibited concomitant medication (as listed in section 4.1.4) Have a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 32 Contraindication to lumbar puncture examination.
