	<brief_summary>The safety and tolerability of CVX-060 have been established in the first-in-human clinical trial, CVX-060-101. Thus, this phase Ib/II trial is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of combining CVX-060 with sunitinib in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to subsequently assess the treatment efficacy of the combination treatment, as well as that of sunitinib alone in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Of CVX-060, An Anti-Angiogenic COVX-Body, In Combination With Sunitinib In Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On 23-Nov-2010, B1131001 (CVX-060-102) was closed to enrollment due to emerging clinical data which led to a re-assessment of the strategic goals of the PF-04856884 program. The study enrolled the Phase 1b portion only. Subsequently, on 25-Oct-2012, due to data safety signals in a separate clinical trial with PF-04856884 (CVX-060), all PF-04856884 studies were discontinued and ongoing patients on B1131001 were permitted to remain on study at a reduced PF-04856884 dose if determined to have been deriving clinical benefit.</detailed_description>
