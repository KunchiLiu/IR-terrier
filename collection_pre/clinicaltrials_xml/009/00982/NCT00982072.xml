	<brief_title>Tacrolimus Versus Prednisolone for the Treatment of Minimal Change Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Standard treatment is with high dose steroids which is often effective in controlling the nephrotic syndrome but has a high morbidity due to the side effects of the steroids. There is also a high relapse rate,therefore many patients require long term steroid therapy to control their disease which has significant morbidity and mortality. Some patients are or also become steroid resistant. There are studies showing the effectiveness of alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide but the use of these drugs is limited by their toxicity, including increased rates of infection, cancers and infertility. Tacrolimus (prograf) is a T-cell specific calcineurin inhibitor that shares similar immunosuppressive actions with cyclosporine A.In other glomerular diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous glomerulonephritis, prograf has been shown to be a very effective treatment for proteinuria. This may be due to the immunomodulatory effects on the underlying disease, but there may also be a direct effect of tacrolimus (prograf) on the podocyte, stabilising the actin cytoskeleton and therefore decreasing protein leak.Therefore tacrolimus (prograf) is likely to be effective in reducing proteinuria in minimal change disease.It has also been shown to have a good side effect profile when used to allow the avoidance of steroids in transplantation.This study aims to prospectively study if tacrolimus (prograf) is effective as treatment for minimal change disease compared with standard therapy with steroids, and whether it has advantages in terms of side effect profile and prevention of relapse.</detailed_description>
