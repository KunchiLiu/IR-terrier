	<brief_summary>Paracetamol is the centrally acting analgesic most commonly used in the world, indicated for the symptomatic treatment of fever and pain in mild to moderate. It comes in different formulations for oral, intravenous and rectal. The IV route allows rapid passage of paracetamol in the systemic arterial circulation and thus the brain, faster distribution evidenced a higher plasma concentration compared with oral and rectal. However the IV route also has disadvantages well known risks iatrogenic perfusion is an invasive lengthy, unpleasant and painful. The way per-Albus not to date used for the administration of paracetamol. It is a path nonetheless very interesting for the rapid absorption of drugs such as nitrates used in angina pectoris, as it seeks a highly vascular area (the floor of the tongue or gingival groove) and allows a very rapid action. Furthermore, the terminal per-oral mucosa, less restrictive than IV administration and faster than oral administration, requires a simple medical gesture without special surveillance after administration, produces no pain or risk of infection for the patient (in contrast to the IV). It is interesting to test a new dosage form per-oral mucosa of paracetamol and compare pharmacological level (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) with the only dosage form of reference used by the IV route.</brief_summary>
