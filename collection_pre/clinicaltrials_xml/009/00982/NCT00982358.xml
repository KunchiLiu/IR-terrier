	<brief_summary>This study is designed to support the use of valsartan in the diabetic population. Two different groups will be studied, one with and one without coronary artery disease (CAD) documented by angiography. The study is intended to demonstrate that valsartan 320 mg has an anti-inflammatory potential, reducing inflammatory serum markers as well as inflammatory gene expression, and to show that valsartan is able to improve metabolic parameters in this patient population. Furthermore, in the subgroup of patients with documented CAD this study wants to show that valsartan improves coronary perfusion. 3 Objectives Primary objectives: 1. To demonstrate the anti-inflammatory efficacy of valsartan 160/320 mg by testing the hypothesis of superiority compared to placebo in the reduction of the inflammatory marker Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in plasma after 16 weeks of treatment in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2. To demonstrate the anti-inflammatory efficacy of valsartan 160/320 mg by testing the hypothesis of superiority compared to placebo in the reduction of the inflammatory marker Interleukin 6 (IL-6) in plasma after 16 weeks of treatment in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary objectives: 1. To explore the effect of 160/320 mg valsartan on parameters of insulin sensitivity. 2. To explore the effect of 160/320 mg valsartan on additional inflammatory markers in plasma [e.g. C-Reactive protein (CRP), soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), serum amyloid A (SAA), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), fibrinogen, Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), matrix metalloproteases -2, -3 and -9 (MMP-2, -3, -9), and sE-selectin)]. 3. To explore the effect of 160/320 mg valsartan on inflammatory gene expression from monocytes and fat tissue. 4. To explore the effect of 160/320 mg valsartan on metabolic gene expression in fat tissue. 5. To explore the effect of 160/320 mg valsartan on coronary perfusion, in the group of patients with angiographically documented CAD.</brief_summary>
