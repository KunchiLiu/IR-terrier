	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test: 1. Safety of 900 mg or 1800 mg of WS® 1442 per day in overweight subjects (BMI 25 to 29,9 kg/m²) 2. Pharmacodynamic effect of WS® 1442 on endothelial function versus nordic walking training in overweight subjects</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WS®1442 in Slightly Overweight Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 overweight subjects with a BMI of 25 to 29,9 kg/m2 are to be included. The safety of 900 mg/1800 mg per day WS® 1442 is determined by adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs as well as by a treadmill test at the beginning and the end of the study. Endothelial function measured before and after two different training modalities is compared to that measured before and after intake of two different doses of WS® 1442.</detailed_description>
