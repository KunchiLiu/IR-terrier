	<brief_summary>Patients enrolled will need treated with an IVUS- VH (intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual histology) which is an arterial stent procedure, that involves threading a tiny wire into the artery, followed by a balloon, a stent, or other device to treat a blocked artery, and often (though not always), a special ultrasound catheter to take pictures of the inside of the artery. Participants in the study, will have an additional procedure performed: a tiny tube will be advanced into the heart artery to collect a blood sample for research purposes, and a blood sample will be collected from the femoral (thigh) artery through the tube that will be placed there as a standard part of having this procedure. The blood that is collected will be analyzed for markers of inflammation or irritation in the blood (c-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, Monocyte chemotactic protein-1), as well and a gene called Matrix Metallopeptidase 3, which is believe to influence the progression of plaque on the walls of arteries and the progression of coronary artery disease. .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients that have severe blockage in one of the arteries that provides blood flow to your heart will be enrolled into the research study. Most of the procedures in the study standard care used by cardiologists when treating blocked arteries. Patients enrolled will need treated with an IVUS- VH (intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual histology) which is an arterial stent procedure, that involves threading a tiny wire into the artery, followed by a balloon, a stent, or other device to treat a blocked artery, and often (though not always), a special ultrasound catheter to take pictures of the inside of the artery. We will collect all the data from the above stated standard medical care procedure. Participants in the study, will have an additional procedure performed: a tiny tube will be advanced into the heart artery to collect a blood sample for research purposes, and a blood sample will be collected from the femoral (thigh) artery through the tube that will be placed there as a standard part of having this procedure. The blood that is collected will be analyzed for markers of inflammation or irritation in the blood (c-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, Monocyte chemotactic protein-1), as well and a gene called Matrix Metallopeptidase 3, which is believe to influence the progression of plaque on the walls of arteries and the progression of coronary artery disease. . Finally, after discharged from the hospital, the research nurses will call you at home to ask you questions about how you are doing for approximately 5-10 minutes. Telephone follow-up will occur at one month, six months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 36 months.</detailed_description>
