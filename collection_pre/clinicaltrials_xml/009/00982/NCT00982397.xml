	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is two-fold. In Phase I (Protecta Clinical Study), system performance will be evaluated. In Phase II (PainFree SST), the inappropriate shock-free rate at one year of subjects implanted with a Medtronic Protecta implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) will be evaluated. Phase II of the study will begin when the Medtronic Protecta devices are market released in each participating geography. Subjects enrolled into Phase I of the study will continue follow up in Phase II.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients meeting one of the following criteria can be included in Phase I of the study: Patients indicated (per local indications) for a dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (DRICD)/cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRTD) Patients undergoing a device replacement or upgrade to DRICD or CRTD and with the protocol required leads (patients must be enrolled prior to implant) Patients meeting one of the following criteria can be included in Phase II of the study: Patients indicated for a DRICD/VRICD/CRTD device and intended to receive a Protecta device Patients undergoing a DRICD/VRICD/CRTD device replacement or an upgrade to a Protecta DRICD/VRICD or CRTD Patients indicated for a DRICD/VRICD/CRTD already implanted with a Protecta device and the protocol required leads, who have not yet been discharged after implant Patients with a mechanical tricuspid heart valve Patients enrolled or intended to participate in any concurrent drug and/or device study, which would confound the results of this trial as determined by Medtronic, during the course of this clinical study Patients with medical conditions that preclude the testing required for all patients by the study protocol or that otherwise limit study participation required for all patients Patients with exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g. age, pregnancy, breast feeding, etc) Patients anticipated not being able to complete the study Patients unwilling to provide written informed consent</criteria>
