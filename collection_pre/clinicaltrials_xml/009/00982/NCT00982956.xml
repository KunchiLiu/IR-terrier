	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of computer-assisted navigation in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA ) by comparing it with conventional TKA. Methods: Gemini MK II implants (Link, Germany) were used. VectorVision√¢ CT-free navigation system (BrainLab, Germany) was employed for the TKA. For each subject, computer-navigation TKA and the conventional TKA were separately performed on two knee joints. The operative method and order of the operations were decided on a randomized basis. All the patients and doctors conducting follow-up study and performing imaging measurement were blind to selection of the operation. Student t test was used for statistical analysis. hypothesis: computer-assisted navigation system can significantly improve the accuracy of tibial and femoral cuts on coronal and sagittal planes.</brief_summary>
