	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what parts of the brain have increased or decreased connectivity when people are depressed and how Seroquel extended release (XR) changes this connectivity in depressed patients. The genetic samples collected are to look at variation in a gene (serotonin transporter gene), which affects the functioning of the chemical serotonin in the brain.</brief_summary>
