	<brief_summary>The potential influence of lunar phases on human life has been widely discussed by the lay press. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible relation between the lunar cycle and the hemorrhagic complication rate and surgical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The investigators tested this hypothesis by evaluating the complication rate for 18760 patients who underwent surgery from January 2001 to December 2008 (103 lunar phases) at the National Institute for Cancer Research in Genoa. The date of definitive surgery was allocated to the lunar phases.</brief_summary>
