Patients with seizure disorders requiring medication (such as steroids or antiepileptics).

Surgical treatment or radiation therapy in the past 4 weeks. Palliative radiotherapy at focal sites on the extremities is allowed, also within 4 weeks before start Unresolved toxicity CTC ≥ grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy except alopecia. Known or suspected allergy to any investigational agent or any agent given in association with this trial. Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the patients participation in the study or evaluation of the study results Any condition that is unstable or which could jeopardize the safety of patient and his compliance in the study. Antracyclines: &gt; 450 mg/m2 doxorubicin or and &gt; 600 mg/m2 epirubicin Medications known to have dysrhythmic potential is not permitted (ie, terfenadine, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol, risperidone, indapamide) Usage of coumarinderivate anticoagulants.
