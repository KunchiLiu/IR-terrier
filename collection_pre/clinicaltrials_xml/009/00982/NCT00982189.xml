	<brief_summary>This study is funded by the American Heart Association. The goal of this research is to prevent early cardiovascular damage before symptoms develop for persons with HIV infection. Evidence suggests that taking low doses of blood pressure and cholesterol medication reduces risk for heart disease in persons who are at increased risk (such as the case with HIV infection). Participants who are taking HIV treatment with an 'undetectable' viral load, and who do NOT need treatment for high blood pressure or cholesterol may be eligible to enroll. Participants will take a low dose cholesterol medication (or placebo) and a low dose of a blood pressure medication (or a placebo), and will be seen at 3 study visits over 4 months.</brief_summary>
