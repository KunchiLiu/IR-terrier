	<brief_summary>Mother-infant relationship disturbances broadly comprise three areas; maternal distress, infant functional problems, and relationship difficulties. Given the high frequency of such disturbances and the relative paucity of randomized treatment studies, substantial systematic investigation is needed. This project is a randomized controlled study comparing mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment with treatment as usual in cases where mothers and/or health visitors demanded expert help.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN Eighty dyads with infants below 1½ years of age are interviewed and then randomly assigned to MIP or TAU. An end-point interview follows after ½ year, evaluating the intervention effects. The MIP treatments are performed by IPA psychoanalysts at the Infant Reception Service of the Swedish Psychoanalytic Society. TAU implies contact with a Health Visitor at a Child Health Centre. Additional treatments within the TAU framework suggested at the initiative by the health visitor or the mother are registered at the end-point interview. Each TAU case will also be investigated via CHC records. INSTRUMENTS Mother-report questionnaires; the Ages and Stages Questionnaire:Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE; Squires et al., 2002), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox et al., 1987)and the Swedish Parental Questionnaire (SPSQ; Östberg et al., 1997). Independently rated video-taped mother-infant interactions: the Emotional Availability Scale (EAS; Biringen, 1998). Relationship assessment: the Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS; ZERO-TO-THREE, 2005). Prognostic assessment: the Mother-Baby Interview (MOBI; Salomonsson, 2009). Interview-based assessments of psychoanalytic aptitude and quality of the process. Ideal typing (Stuhr&amp;Wachholz, 2001) of "maternal types" and "infant types."</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The mother expressed significant concerns about one or more of the following domains: herself as a mother, her infant's wellbeing, or the motherbaby relationship (this was operationalized as a score &lt; 80 ("perturbed relation") on the PIRGAS or, alternatively, &gt; 2.5 on the SPSQ). Infant of any gender, age below 18 months. Duration of worries exceeding two weeks. Domicile in Stockholm. Reasonable mastery of Swedish. Maternal psychosis.
