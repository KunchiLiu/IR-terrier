	<brief_summary>Background: One way tumors are able to grow is by forming new blood vessels that supply them with nutrients and oxygen. Sunitinib blocks certain proteins on the surface of tumor and blood vessel cells that are involved with the formation of new blood vessels. Blocking these proteins may prevent the tumor cells or blood vessels from continuing to grow. Objectives: To determine whether sunitinib can cause tumors to shrink or stabilize in patients with recurrent brain cancer. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with brain cancer whose disease has worsened after standard treatment with surgery, radiation. Design: Patients take a sunitinib pill once a day in 4-week treatment cycles. Treatment may continue as long as the tumor remains stable or decreases in size and the side effects of treatment are tolerated. Routine blood tests are done every 2 weeks during the first 8 weeks of treatment and then every 4 weeks after that. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are done before starting treatment (at baseline) and at the end of every 4-week cycle to monitor tumor growth. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are done at baseline and at the end of the first cycle. Neurological and physical examinations are done at baseline, at week 2 of treatment and at the end of every treatment cycle. Health-related quality of life is assessed every 4 weeks. Pregnancy tests, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms are repeated as needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib to Treat Recurrent Brain Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Solid tumors have multiple mechanisms for stimulating angiogenesis with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) axis being only one of them. Sunitinib, through its multiple tyrosine kinase receptor targets, represents an attempt to capitalize on the concept of targeting multiple mechanisms responsible for glioma-associated angiogenesis. Sunitinib inhibits platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit (stem cell factor (SCF) receptor) at nanomolar concentrations. The combination blocks all three known major glioma-mediated angiogenic mechanisms (VEGF, c-kit, PDGF). Based on this scientific rationale, the promising anti-glioma activity of sunitinib in preclinical models, and the promising clinical data in patients with gliomas treated with other VEGF inhibitors, we are now proposing a phase II trial of sunitinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. Objectives: To evaluate the anti-glioma activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who are either naive or resistant to prior bevacizumab therapy. Eligibility: Patients with recurrent malignant glioma are eligible for this study. Design: This is a phase II study with a target enrollment of 64 (32 with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 32 with anaplastic glioma (AG)) patients who have not progressed on prior treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, and 64 (32 with GBM and 32 with AG)patients who have progressed on prior bevacizumab therapy. Sunitinib will be self-administered orally at 37.5 mg daily, with dose adjustments allowed for toxicity and concomitant drug interactions. The primary endpoint is six-month progression free survival for both arms of the study. We performed an interim analysis (see below) and after consulting with the pharmaceutical company (Pfizer) we believe that ending the study is the most appropriate course of action to take. In the original design of the trial, for the AG stratum, the agent will be considered effective if at least 14 patients have not progressed by 6 months. Now, we have observed one out 10 Bev-na√Øve who haven't progressed by 6 months. Then given one patient in the first 10 patients whose PFS &gt;=6, the conditional probability of observing at least 14 out of 32 patients who are 6 month-PFS is only 43% even if the true 6 months-PFS is 55%. Since in the first 10 patients, we only observed one patient with PFS&gt;=6 months, it is unlikely that the true 6 month-PFS is 55%. The conditional power would be close to zero, if the true 6 month-PFS close to 10% as observed so far. Based on the conditional probability, the chance of a positive study is small, and hence the trial should be considered stopped for futility. For Bev-resistant patients, because in the first 12 patients none had PFS &gt;= 6 months the conditional probability of declaring the agent being effective is even lower and equals 12%, if the true PFS at 6 months is 55%. Essentially there is little chance that the agent can be declared effective.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patients with histologically proven intracranial malignant glioma will be eligible for this protocol. Malignant gliomas include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), gliosarcoma (GS), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified). 2. Patients may have received prior therapy with bevacizumab, but not within six weeks of starting treatment with sunitinib. Patients who received prior therapy with bevacizumab must have demonstrated radiographic disease progression while being treated with bevacizumab. 3. Patients must have progressed after radiation and temozolomide therapy and have an interval of greater than or equal to 4 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry. If the patient has had prior stereotactic radio surgery, true tumor progression must be corroborated by fludeoxyglucose 18F (FDG)positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy imaging. 4. Patients must have evidence of tumor progression by contrast enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. This scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a fiveday stable dose of steroids. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MR/CT is required. The same type of scan (i.e., MRI or CT) must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. 5. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: They have recovered from the effects of surgery. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease postoperatively, a CT/MRI should be done: no later than 96 hours in the immediate postoperative period, or at least 4 weeks postoperatively, and within 14 days of registration, and on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days. f) Normal organ and marrow function defined as: total leukocyte count greater than or equal to 3000 cells/ul, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500 cells/ul, platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000 cells/ul, serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 times the upper limit of normal, and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL , serum calcium less than or equal to 12.0 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, prothrombin time (PT) less than or equal to 1.5 upper limits of normal (ULN).
