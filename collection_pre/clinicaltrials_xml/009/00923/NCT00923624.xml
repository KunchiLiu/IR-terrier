	<brief_title>Patient Portal to Support Treatment Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>300 adult HIV+ patients will be randomized to one of two arms. 150 will be assigned to receive secure messages focused on antiretroviral adherence from a nurse through the health plan EMR patient website. 150 will be assigned to an attention control comparison arm, and will receive electronic messages from a study staff member that provide information about the various features of the health plan patient website. Patients will be invited by mail to be telephone screened for enrollment in the study. Patients will be provided the opportunity to opt out of being contacted by the study. Eligible and interested patients will be mailed an access code and separately emailed a link to a secure study website where they will complete a web consent form and a baseline web survey before being randomized to an intervention arm. This trial will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of using health information technology as an intervention delivery vehicle to improve patient disease management behaviors such as treatment adherence.</detailed_description>
