	<criteria>Bcell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (BCLL) according to the 1996 National Cancer Institutesponsored Working Group (NCIWG) Criteria One or more, but &lt;= 3 previous treatment regimens for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Patient requires treatment for CLL (Rai stage III and IV disease or stage 0 to II disease with evidence of progression) Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function More than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, including investigational agents, for the treatment of CLL. Patient must have recovered from the acute side effects incurred as a result of previous therapy World Health Organization (WHO) Performance Status (PS) 0,1 Life expectancy of at least 24 weeks Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment. Both men and women enrolled in this trial must use adequate barrier birth control measures during the course of the trial and 2 weeks after the completion of trial Written informed consent Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity Active hepatitis or a history of prior viral hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or positive hepatitis B serologies. Patients with a positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test with a documented history of prior hepatitis B immunization are eligible as long as other criteria are met (i.e., negative tests for : hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and hepatitis C virus antibody [HCVAb]) Active uncontrolled infection Recent documented history (within 2 years) of active tuberculosis (TB), current active TB infection, currently receiving antituberculous medication (e.g., isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, or others) Positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay Transformation to aggressive lymphoma (e.g., Richter's syndrome) Past history of anaphylaxis following exposure to humanized monoclonal antibodies Previous treatment with alemtuzumab Previous hematopoietic stem cell transplant Pregnant or breastfeeding patients Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with CLL Other severe, concurrent diseases (e.g., cardiac or pulmonary disease), mental disorders, or major organ malfunction (e.g., liver, kidney) that could interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the study Medical condition requiring chronic use of oral corticosteroids at a dose higher than physiologic replacement. Active malignancy, other than CLL, which needs therapy with anticancer drug(s) Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia Small lymphocytic lymphoma</criteria>
