	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of 8 week treatment with Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20, 60, 120, 240 mg and placebo in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and to determine the adequate antihypertensive dosage for later clinical study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antihypertensive Efficacy and Tolerability and Determine the Adequate Antihypertensive Dosage of Fimasartan in Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that the Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed in high dose. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel grouped, clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability and to determine adequate antihypertensive dosage of Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Approximately 182 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in 8 centers nationwide. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the following 5 groups. Subjects will take test/control drug for 8 weeks of treatment period. If subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1 week of wash-out period. Group I : Placebo, Group II : Fimasartan 20 mg, Group III: Fimasartan 60 mg, Group IV : Fimasartan 120 mg, Group V : Fimasartan 240 mg,</detailed_description>
