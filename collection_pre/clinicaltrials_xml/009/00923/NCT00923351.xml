	<brief_summary>Background: - Pediatric solid tumors (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma) are often difficult to cure with standard treatment. - Immune therapy using an experimental vaccine made from proteins from the patient's tumor cells may boost the body's immune response against the tumor. - The effects of chemotherapy on the immune system can potentially make immunotherapy more effective if administered soon after completion of chemotherapy. The addition of recombinant human IL-7 (interleukin 7) (rhIL-7 (recombinant human interleukin 7)) may make the immunotherapy more effective. Objectives: -To determine whether immune therapy given after immune suppression can help the body fight the tumor and to determine the safety of the treatment. Eligibility: -Patients with solid tumors, i.e., Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma whose disease has recurred after treatment or spread beyond the original site Design: - Patients undergo tumor biopsy (removal of a piece of tumor tissue) to collect tumor cells for making a vaccine from proteins in the patient's tumor and apheresis (removal of a quantity of white blood cells) to collect white cells for re-building the immune system after immune therapy. Apheresis is repeated three times during immunotherapy (weeks 8, 14 and 20). - After receiving standard chemotherapy for their tumor (and an additional course of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to further suppress immunity if needed) patients receive immune therapy in Cohorts A and B. rhIL-7 is given 48 hours before the vaccine, as an injection under the skin in an extremity that will not be used for the vaccine in patients in Cohort B only. You will be watched closely for 6 hours after the rhIL-7 for any signs of reaction. rhIL-7 will be given before vaccine doses #1, #2, #3, and #4. The vaccine is given at study weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Each vaccine is given as a total of six separate rhIL-7 followed by injections: three intradermal (like a (tuberculosis) TB test) on one arm or leg and three subcutaneous (like those for insulin injections for diabetes). on the other arm or leg. An anesthetic cream may be used to minimize the discomfort of injections. - Patients' white cells are returned to them by infusion through a vein on the first day of immune therapy. - Imaging studies and immune studies are done at weeks 1, 8 and 20 to determine the response to treatment on the tumor and on the immune system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy to Treat Ewing's Sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma or Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Patients with recurrent or metastatic pediatric solid tumors experience low survival rates, but using current standard therapies, many patients with these diseases are rendered into a state of minimal residual disease associated with lymphopenia. - Lymphopenic hosts show augmented immune reactivity, which may be favorable for inducing antitumor immune responses. Objectives: - To determine whether Alpha cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) and 8H9 depleted autologous lymphocytes plus tumor lysate/keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) pulsed dendritic cell vaccines plus or minus r-hIL7 (CYT107) can induce immune responses to tumor lysate in this patient population rendered lymphopenic by cytotoxic therapy. - To assess the safety of administering lymphocytes depleted of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) plus CD25plus suppressor T cells plus or minus r-hIL (CYT107 (interleukin 7)) to lymphopenic hosts. Eligibility: - Patients with metastatic or recurrent pediatric solid tumors of the following histologies: Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma, synovial cell sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, undifferentiated sarcoma, embryonal sarcoma. - Patients must have sufficient accessible tumor for biopsy to generate tumor lysate. - Patients must meet eligibility criteria upon enrollment and upon completion of standard therapy prior to administration of immunotherapy as significant time will have elapsed between the time points. Design: - Immunotherapy consists of one autologous lymphocyte infusion depleted of CD25plus suppressive T cells and depleted of contaminating tumor cells plus 6 sequential tumor lysate/KLH pulsed dendritic cell vaccines. No cytokine is administered on Arm A and r-hIL7 (CYT107) is administered on Arm B. - Patients will be evaluated for immune responses to tumor lysates using ex vivo assays and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). - The trial uses a one-stage design targeting a response rate of 50 percent. Up to 47 patients will be treated. - Stopping rules will take effect if excessive toxicity is observed.</detailed_description>

Informed Consent All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years old) must sign a document of informed consent (screening protocol) prior to performing studies to determine patient eligibility. After confirmation of patient eligibility all patients or their legal guardians must sign the protocol specific informed consent to document their understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any protocol related studies are performed (other than the studies which were performed to determine patient eligibility). E. Laboratory Parameters renal function: creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 or normal age adjusted serum creatinine (less than or equal to 5 yrs. less than or equal to 0.8 mg/ml; 510 yrs. less than or equal to 1.0 mg/ml; 1015 yrs. less than or equal to 1.2 mg/ml; greater than 15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.5 mg/ml) liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin less than 1.5 ULN hematologic function: platelets greater than 50,000 cells/mcl, hemoglobin (Hgb) greater than 9.0 gms/dl, prothrombin time (PT) less than 1.5 ULN.

Accessibility of Tissue to Generate Tumor Lysates Patients must have adequate tumor bulk accessible to biopsy in order to generate the tumor lysate (at least 2 cm diameter). Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates will be limited to percutaneous biopsies or open biopsies of readily accessible lesions. Patients should not undergo biopsies, which will later compromise the ability to render function preserving local therapy (e.g. limb salvage therapy). To prevent this, all bone biopsies should be performed in consultation with the orthopedic consultant on the case. For patients with bone marrow involvement, bone marrow aspirates may be used as a source of tumor for tumor lysates. Patients are not eligible if, in the opinion of the principal and associate investigators, tumor biopsy would entail extensive surgery such as thoracotomy or laparotomy, or if the tumor site places the patient at substantial risk from the biopsy procedure. National Cancer Institute (NCI) Laboratory of Pathology will review all tumor specimens for diagnosis. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: for Apheresis/Tumor biopsy portion of the trial: A. Other conditions Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections, autoimmunity or organ dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational agents or are likely to interfere with the study procedures or results. Previous allogeneic stem cell or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Conditions related to tumor, which require emergency treatment (airway compression, spinal cord compression) since enrollment would delay initiation of such therapy. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Corticosteroids initiated at the time of tumor diagnosis or recurrence for treatment of nerve compression or other symptoms is permitted during this phase of the trial, but will not be permitted during the immunotherapy phase, with the exception of a self limited course of steroids as described in Section 2.1.4.A. Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from cancer are not excluded provided that the metastatic CNS disease has been effectively treated and there is no evidence of active CNS disease as evidenced by stable clinical findings and stable radiographic findings for a period of 6 weeks. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C due to confounding effects on immune system. INCLUSION CRITERIA: for Immunotherapy portion of the trial: A. Informed Consent Because significant time will have elapsed between apheresis/tumor biopsy and the initiation of immunotherapy, all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years old) must sign a second informed consent to document their understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any protocol related studies are performed (other than the studies which were performed to determine patient eligibility). B. Time and Recovery from Cytotoxic Therapy At least 3 weeks should have elapsed since the last cycle of cytotoxic therapy or since the last dose of radiation therapy, at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient has received any investigational therapy, and patients should have recovered from toxic side effects of previous therapy to a grade 1 or less, with the exception of the following: Hematological toxicity: recovery to levels required in Section 2.1.1.E.

D. Birth Control Subjects of childbearing or childfathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are being treated on this study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: for Immunotherapy Portion of the Trial: A. Other conditions Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections or organ dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational agents or are likely to interfere with the study procedures or results. Persistent or progressive cancer following the completion of the standard therapy phase of the trial will not, in and of itself, preclude receipt of immunotherapy. However, patients will not receive immunotherapy if they have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status performance status of 3 or 4 or, for children less than or equal to 10 years of age, Lansky less than or equal to 50 (Appendix III). Furthermore, patients will be removed from the trial if they develop requirements for antineoplastic therapy (e.g. radiation therapy) for progressive disease during the trial as discussed in protocol. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection due to confounding effects on immune function. Patients who require chronic daily oral corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are permitted. Also, a time limited course of steroids does for an unrelated medical condition (e.g. allergic reaction, poison ivy) will not preclude receipt of immunotherapy provided that two weeks elapse between the last dose of systemic corticosteroids and initiation of immunotherapy. Patients who are receiving other biologic therapies including cytokines or growth factors not specified by the protocol. Herbal supplements will not result in exclusion but should be noted and reviewed with the principal investigator (PI). Patients with a history of CNS metastases from cancer are not excluded provided that the metastatic CNS disease has been effectively treated and there is no evidence of active CNS disease as evidenced by stable clinical findings and stable radiographic findings for a period of 6 weeks. Excluded from Arm B: Patients with history of autoimmune disease (excluding thyroiditis on chronic thyroid replacement therapy) or active autoimmune disease, due to a risk of exacerbation of autoimmunity with rhIL7. Patients with a history of B cell malignancy due to a risk for growth with rhIL7 therapy. Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation defined as a QTc greater than or equal to 470 ms or a prior history of cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.</criteria>
