	<brief_summary>Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, a component of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The National Cholesterol Education Program advises the public to consume 2 g/day of plant sterols or stanols in addition to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change Diet to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. For foods to carry the FDA health claim label they must contain 0.65 g of phytosterol ester or 1.7 g of phytostanol ester per serving. The study was a controlled diet, cross-over clinical investigation using a Latin square sequence. It consisted of two 29 d phases separated by a four week wash out interval. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment arms: 1 % dairy milk or low-fat soy beverage providing 1.95 g plant sterols/day.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Healthy males and females, age 1960 years old, will be screened for determination of fasting circulating LDLcholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels. 2. Subjects accepted into the study will have plasma LDLC levels between 120 and 200 mg/dl, TG levels below 250 mg/dl, and a body mass index (BMI) between 22 to 32 kg/m2. 3. Subjects must also demonstrate an ability to understand dietary and exercise procedures and be judged as compliant and motivated by the investigators. 4. Subjects will be permitted to take stable doses of thyroid hormone and antihypertensive agents, as long as these are continued equivalently throughout the duration of study. 1. History of recent (i.e. less than 3 mo) or chronic use of oral hypolipidemic therapy, including fish oils, or probucol within the last 6 months. 2. History of chronic use of alcohol (&gt;2 drinks/d), systemic antibodies, corticosteroids, androgens, or phenytoin. 3. Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, or other major surgical procedures within the last six months. 4.
