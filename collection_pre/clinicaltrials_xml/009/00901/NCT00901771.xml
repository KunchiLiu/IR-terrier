	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the proposed investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of the Provent device in a sample of OSA patients who have either refused or been non-adherent with PAP treatment. Both initial efficacy (evaluated after approximately one week with Provent) and efficacy after approximately 5 weeks in patients who demonstrate initial efficacy will be assessed. A secondary objective is to assess adherence with Provent treatment during the 5-week evaluation period.</brief_summary>
