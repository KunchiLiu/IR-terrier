	<brief_title>ANRS HC20 Effectiveness of an Optimized Anti HCV PegIFN-alpha2a + Ribavirin on Sustained Virological Response in Patients With HCV Genotype 1 and 4 Non Responders and Co-infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients HIV infected, the success rate do not exceed 20% in genotype 1 or 4 patients. In case of treatment failure , patients are rarely re-treated, and liver fibrosis progresses rapidly. The new molecules are not yet available for patients co-infected with HIV, and patients having already undergone a first treatment will likely be among the last to be included in trials evaluating the effectiveness of these treatments. However, recent studies show that it is possible to propose a new treatment "optimized" to these patients in the hope to obtain better success rate. Provide antiretroviral treatment, use of high doses of Peg-interferon and ribavrine, and supporting patients.</detailed_description>
