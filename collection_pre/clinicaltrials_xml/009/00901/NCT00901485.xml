	<brief_title>Autotitrating Versus Standard Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV) in Newly Diagnosed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to compare the effect of two types of noninvasive ventilator (a small machine that assists breathing) in patients newly diagnosed with nocturnal hypoventilation who are inexperienced in the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV is standard therapy for patients with nocturnal hypoventilation. The most common type of NIV is bilevel pressure support which assists patient breathing by delivering different levels of air pressure during inspiration and expiration via a mask covering the nose or nose and mouth. Standard bilevel NIV (VPAP™) has been further developed to create a new automatically adjusting NIV (AutoVPAP™). Automatically adjusting NIV varies the inspiratory air pressure according to the airflow rates generated by the patient. This may improve patient comfort, hours of NIV use and recovery time. Patients over the age of 18 referred to, or under follow up at, the Royal Brompton Hospital who require domiciliary NIV but are inexperienced with use of NIV will be considered for entry into this randomised crossover study. If eligible for inclusion and willing to take part patients will be setup on automatically adjusting NIV or standard NIV, assigned in random order. At the end of one month the patient will be swapped to the alternative NIV for a further one month of domiciliary NIV treatment. At the end of each one month treatment period the patient will undergo overnight polysomnography, transcutaneous CO2 monitoring and 24 hour Holter monitoring.</detailed_description>
