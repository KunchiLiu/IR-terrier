	<brief_title>Effects of Walnut Consumption on Endothelial Function in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence-based guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) refer to cardioprotective dietary fatty acid proportions. Several studies demonstrate the hypocholesteremic effects of walnuts in energy restricted diets. To our knowledge, the health benefits accrued as a result of addition of walnuts to an ad libitum diet in type 2 diabetic subjects have not been studied. Addition of walnuts to an ad libitum diet represents a practical way to achieve the recommended fatty acid proportions. The proposed study will examine whether a total dietary pattern inclusive of walnuts, will result in amelioration of cardiac risk as measured by improvement in endothelial function and glycemic control in type 2 diabetics. Results of the study will have important implications for clinicians and dietitians in dietary management of type 2 diabetes. Demonstrating that walnuts can be regarded as beneficial components of dietary management of type 2 diabetes is of relevance to the walnut industry as well. The study employs a pragmatic approach to approximate dietary practices in a real world setting thus enhancing the external validity of the study. If positive, the study results can inform future marketing efforts of the California Walnut Commission. Demonstrating that addition of walnuts to an ad libitum diet can potentially lead to improvement in endothelial function, improve lipid profiles, glycemic control and reduce the risk of CVD complications in diabetic patients has important applications for dietary management of diabetes.</detailed_description>
