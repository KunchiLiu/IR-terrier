	<brief_summary>The NAEPP (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program) guidelines recommend that spirometry be performed on patients with asthma because they serve as an objective measure of airway obstruction. Unfortunately, most children under 5 years of age are unable to perform a forced expiratory maneuver making conventional spirometry unavailable in this age group in most venues. Furthermore, other population groups such as retarded people, elderly or physically handicapped share the same difficulty. Karmel Sonix Ltd has developed the Personal WheezoMeter a hand-held pulmonary sounds analyzer that utilizes contact sensors to acquire, amplify, filter, record and quantify the presence of wheezing. This usability study was designed to test independent home use and device interface effectiveness of the Personal WheezoMeter in order to validate its safe and effective use by intended users.</brief_summary>
