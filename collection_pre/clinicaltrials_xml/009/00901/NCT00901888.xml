	<brief_summary>The apelin-APJ system is a relatively new discovery. It has generated interest in part due to it's apparent ability to counteract the renin-angiotensin system, which is frequently overactive in many cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin has a powerful ability to cause blood vessels constrict and reduces their diameter. One of the actions of apelin is to cause blood vessels to relax and the investigators specifically wish test the hypothesis that apelin will cause blood vessels constricted by angiotensin II to relax.</brief_summary>
