	<brief_summary>This study will examine the degree of blood thinning (platelet function) in patients coming for non-cardiac surgery on antiplatelet agents using platelet function tests called thromboelastography (TEG) and platelet mapping assay (PMA) and major cardiac complications that occur any time after surgery (perioperative).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Perioperative Platelet Function and Major Adverse Perioperative Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who have had stents in their coronary arteries (PCI) have to stay on antiplatelet agents to prevent clotting of their stents. These patients often require non-cardiac surgery (NCS) at some stage after their PCI. The rate of major cardiac complications (MACE)in this population is very high and it is unclear why they are at higher risk than the general population. It is possible their antiplatelet is not adequate, or that surgery causes them to be more clot prone. This is a prospective, multicentre observational study.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>patients between ages 3085 years old, receiving postPCI aspirin and/or clopidogrel therapy patients undergoing nonambulatory, NCS patients will have received a bare metal coronary stent within the last 12 months or a drug eluting stent at any time prior to their NCS the type of surgery has to be such that there are no contraindictions to remain on an antiplatelet agent surgeon must agree to keep the patient on at least one antiplatelet agent during the perioperative period clotting abnormalities drugs affecting platelet function other than aspirin or clopidogrel moderate renal impairment liver dysfunction with coexisting thrombocytopenia</criteria>
