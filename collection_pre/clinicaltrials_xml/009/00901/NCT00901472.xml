	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is: sleep disordered breathing (SDB), specifically, obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with poorer glucose in the existing type 2 diabetic condition. In an exploration of this hypothesis, the investigators hope to provide evidence linking SDB to increased severity of disease in the type 2 diabetic patient. By doing so, the investigators ultimately seek to support investigating the use of SDB interventions as an additional method of care in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
