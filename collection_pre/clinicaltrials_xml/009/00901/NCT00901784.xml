	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover, relative bioavailability study performed on 24 healthy adult male volunteers and 4 alternates. All 28 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw. Subjects were to return for the 48-, 72-, 96- and 120-hour blood draws. Both periods were separated by a washout period of 14 days.</detailed_description>
