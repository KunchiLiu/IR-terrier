	<brief_summary>Accurate length determination of root canal is essential in root canal therapy. Radiography has been the conventional method for this measurement but recently several in-vitro studies have shown that new generations of Electronic Apex locators are as accurate as radiography in length determination. It is hypothesized that the latest generation of Electronic Apex locator can produce acceptable results as radiography when used for length determination.</brief_summary>
