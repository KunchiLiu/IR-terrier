	<brief_summary>The study is a randomised placebo controlled double-blinded clinical trial where a group of healthy pre- and postmenopausal women is randomised to the intake of fish oil capsules or placebo oil capsules for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measurements(weight, height,blood pressure) blood samples and adipose tissue biopsies will be taken in order to illustrate the effect of marine n-3 PUFAs (fish oil) on the concentration of circulating female hormones and to investigate what impact menopause might have on the ability to incorporate marine n-3 PUFAs into tissues.</brief_summary>
