	<brief_summary>Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal studies to induce local growth of new blood vessels from existing ones. The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve the symptoms of patients with erectile dysfunction resulted from a vascular origin and respond to PDE-5 inhibitors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low intensity shockwaves (1/10 the ones used in Lithotripsy) are delivered to the penile tissue. Shockwaves are created by a special generator and are focused using a specially designed shockwave applicator apparatus. The shockwaves are delivered trough the applicator covering the corpora cavernosa of the penis.</detailed_description>
