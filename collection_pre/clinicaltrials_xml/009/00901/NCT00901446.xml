	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the technical performance and clinical handling of a coronary catheter that includes two imaging techniques. The catheter being evaluated performs near infrared spectroscopy and ultrasound imaging of the coronary arteries. Near infrared spectroscopy is used to identify lipid or cholesterol deposits in the vessel wall and the ultrasound component provides structural information about the vessel. Combining multiple imaging techniques into a single catheter can reduce the total number of catheters required during treatment and the overall duration of cardiac catheterization. Both of these results may lead to safer procedures.</brief_summary>
