	<detailed_description>Aim of the present investigation is to demonstrate the clinical equivalence between fluticasone plus salmeterol 500/100 µg daily and an equipotent dose of CHF1535 in maintaining the same asthma control in patients adequately controlled with fluticasone plus salmeterol at the above mentioned daily dose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Asthmatic patients will be enrolled at Visit 1 into the runin period if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Written informed consent obtained 2. Adult male and female (≥18 and ≤65 years) 3. Clinical diagnosis of controlled asthma according to Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA) revised version 2007 in the previous week before study entry: no daytime symptoms (twice or less/week) no limitations of activities no nocturnal symptoms/awakenings no need for reliever/rescue medications (twice or less/week) lung function (FEV1) &gt; 80% predicted or personal best (if known) 4. Patients treated with fluticasone 500 µg + salmeterol 100 µg daily for ≥ 4 weeks 5. A cooperative attitude and ability to correctly use the device and to complete the diary cards. Patients will not be enrolled at visit 1 into the runin period if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Inability to carry out pulmonary function testing; 2.

Three or more courses of oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation due to asthma during the previous 6 months; 6. Patients treated with longacting β2agonists (LABAs) other than salmeterol, anticholinergics, and leukotriene antagonists during the previous 4 weeks; 7. Current smokers or recent (less than one year) exsmokers defined as smoking at least 15 packs/year; 8. Clinically significant or unstable concurrent disease : e.g. uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other endocrine disease; significant hepatic impairment; significant renal impairment; significant other pulmonary disease; cardiovascular disease; gastrointestinal disease; neurological disease; haematological disease, autoimmune disorders, that may interfere with patient's safety, compliance, or study evaluations, according to the investigator's opinion; 9. Patients with a serum potassium value ≤ 3.5 mEq/L 10. Patients with QTc interval (Bazett's formula) higher than 450 msec at screening visit 1; 11. Cancer or any chronic diseases with prognosis &lt; 2 years; 12. Female subjects: pregnant or with active desire to be pregnant, lactating mother or lack of efficient contraception in a subject with childbearing potential (i.e. contraceptive methods other than oral contraceptives, IUD, tubal ligature). A pregnancy test in urine is to be carried out in women of a fertile age at screening 13. Significant alcohol consumption or drug abuse; 14. Patients treated with betablockers as regular use; 15. Patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tricyclic antidepressants and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), unless already taken at stable doses at the screening visit 16. Allergy, sensitivity or intolerance to study drugs and/or study drug formulation ingredients; 17. Patients unlikely to comply with the protocol or unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study; 18. Patients who received any investigational new drug within the last 12 weeks; 19. Patients with asthma exacerbations during the runin period will also be excluded from the study.</criteria>
