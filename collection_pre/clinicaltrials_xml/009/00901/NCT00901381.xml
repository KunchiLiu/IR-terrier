	<brief_title>Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor for Stem Cells Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is one of the main reasons of mortality and morbidity all over the world. In economically developed countries stroke takes 2 or 3 place in the structure of morbidity and mortality. In animal models, it was shown that autological stem cells transplantation significantly increased perfusion of ischemic area and improved lost motor and sensor functions. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used in some clinical trials without following autological transplantation. However, there are no enough evidence-based proved results of G-GSF safety and effectiveness in acute ischemic stroke. In order to determine safety and efficiency of G-CSF administration together with conventional treatment and conventional intensive care protocol during acute ischemic stroke we organized this clinical trial.</detailed_description>
