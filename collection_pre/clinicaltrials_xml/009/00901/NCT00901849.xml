	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the feasibility of combining two drugs, Tarceva (an anti-EGFR agent), and Rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), in children with progressive low-grade gliomas who have failed initial conventional treatment. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of this drug regimen, the potential efficacy of the regimen will be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>children less than 21 years of age, with or without neurofibromatosis, with recurrent lowgrade gliomas. patients with or without NF1 must have failed some form of conventional therapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy (carboplatin/vincristine) to be eligible, including those treated wtih initial surgery. Patients do not have to have received radiotherapy to be eligible. children with all types of histologically proven lowgrade gliomas will be eligible; reoperation at the time of recurrence is not mandatory for entry on study. patients with intrinsic brain lesions, believed neuroradiographically consistent with a lowgrade glial tumor, with neurofibromatosis type 1 can be treated without histological confirmation. patients without neurofibromatosis type 1 must have histological confirmation of a lowgrade glial tumor prior to entry on study. patients must have a Karnofsky score of greater than or equal to 50% for children greater than 10 years of age, or a Lansky score of greater than or equal to 50% for patients less than 10 years of age. patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are able to use a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for purposes of assessing performance score. patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. patients must be able to swallow medication in tablet form. patients must have adequate organ function, including: peripheral ANC of greater than 1,000/microliters; a platelet count of greater than 100,000/microliters; hemoglobin of greater than 8 gms,dl (pRBC transfusions of allowed to maintain hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl) patients must have adequate renal function, which is defined as a normal serum creatinine for age patients must have adequate liver function, as defined as a total bilirubin or less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for age, and an SGPT (ALT) of less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for age patients must have had a MR scan within 3 weeks of starting treatment all patients, and/or their parents or legal guardian, must sign a recent informed consent all institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human study must be met. patients must not have any other active tumors. pregnancy or breast feeding is an exclusion criteria, as the potential mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of these drugs in developing fetuses are unknown. A pregnancy test must be obtained in females who are postmenarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. patients with uncontrolled infection are excluded. patients who have previously received Tarceva or Rapamycin are excluded. patients on antiepileptics and/or corticosteroids are allowed on study as long as they have been on a stable or weaning dose for 7 days prior to study initiation (defined as first day of treatment).</criteria>
