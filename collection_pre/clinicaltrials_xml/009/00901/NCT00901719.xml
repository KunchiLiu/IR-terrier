	<brief_summary>The apelin-APJ system is a relatively new discovery. It has generated interest in part due to it's apparent ability to counteract the renin-angiotensin system, which is frequently overactive in many cardiovascular disease. Two of the main actions of apelin are to increase the pumping ability of the heart and cause blood vessels to relax. The investigators wish to assess if these actions are altered in the setting of normal renin-angiotensin activation and increased renin-angiotensin activity.</brief_summary>
