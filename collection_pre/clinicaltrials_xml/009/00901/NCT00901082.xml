	<brief_summary>Patient presenting to chronic pain clinics frequently undergo diagnostic and therapeutic spinal injections as part of their treatment. These procedures can cause significant level of apprehension in patients, which can lead to increased procedural times, increased procedural pain and reluctance to continue with the treatment program. It appears that certain interventions could reduce the anxiety and catastrophization levels and modify pain perception during medical procedures. The investigators therefore sought to evaluate the effect of a single 30 minutes information session which includes relaxation training administered 5 to 6 days before the nerve block procedure on patient's anxiety and catastrophization levels prior to the procedure and pain scores during the procedure, as well as the overall level of satisfaction with care received.</brief_summary>
