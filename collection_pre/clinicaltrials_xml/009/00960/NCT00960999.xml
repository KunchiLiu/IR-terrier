	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known which regimen of stereotactic body radiation therapy is more effective in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of two radiation therapy regimens and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the 1-year rate of ≥ grade 3 adverse events that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment with single fraction vs multiple fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy in medically inoperable patients with stage I peripheral non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - To estimate the 1-year primary tumor control rate in these patients. - To estimate the 1-year overall survival and disease-free survival rate of these patients. - To assess FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose) standardized uptake value changes as a measure of treatment response and outcomes. - To determine pulmonary function changes by treatment arm and response. - To determine the association between biomarkers and primary tumor control and/or ≥ grade 2 radiation pneumonitis. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2) and T stage (T1 vs T2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (single fraction): Patients undergo one stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment to the target lesion. - Arm II (multiple fractions): Patients undergo SBRT to the target lesion once daily for 4 days. Blood and tumor tissue samples may be collected for further analysis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
