	<brief_summary>Adjuvant N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-enhancing agents, such as GlyT-1 inhibitors and NMDA-glycine site agonists have been demonstrated to be beneficial for chronic schizophrenia patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of add-on treatment of an inhibitor of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAOI), DAAOI-1, in chronically stable schizophrenia patients who have been stabilized with antipsychotics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>D-amino Acid Oxidase Inhibition (DAAOI-1) add-on Treatment for Chronic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Schizophrenia patients reveal positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments. In addition to dopamine system hyperactivity, hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Consequently, enhancing NMDA receptor neurotransmission has been regarded as a novel treatment approach. To date, several reported trials on adjuvant NMDA-enhancing agents, including glycine, D-amino acids (D-serine, D-alanine), and sarcosine (a glycine transporter I inhibitor), revealed beneficial but limited efficacy for positive and negative symptoms. DAAOI-1 is a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor which can elevate synaptic concentration of D-amino acids. The aim of this project is to examine the efficacy and safety of add-on treatment of DAAOI-1 in chronically stable schizophrenia patients who have been stabilized with antipsychotics. In the study, 60 schizophrenic patients are recruited into the 6-week trial and randomly assigned into the two groups (1 gm/dDAAOI-1, or placebo) with a double-blind manner. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Scales for the Assessment of Negative symptoms (SANS), Global Assessment of Function (GAF), quality of life (QOL), Hamilton Depression rating scale 17(HAM-D 17), Clinical Global Impression(CGI)and side effects are evaluated every two weeks during the trial. Cognitive function ("7 domains of Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia" [MATRICS])are assessed at weeks 0 and 6. The efficacies of two groups are compared.</detailed_description>
