	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin K Supplementation on Glucose Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, many studies have reported that vitamin K metabolism is related to glucose metabolism. The suggested mechanisms connecting vitamin K metabolism and glucose metabolism, are inflammation responses and osteocalcin effect on glucose metabolism. Most of the studies have investigated fasting glucose and insulin sensitive index, few have assessed glucose-intake-stimulated responses in regard to vitamin K supplementation. The purpose of this study is to test whether vitamin K supplementation has an effect on glucose metabolism in terms of acute beta cell response using intravenous glucose tolerance test.</detailed_description>
