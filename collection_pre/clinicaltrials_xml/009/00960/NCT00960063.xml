	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/1B, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of robatumumab (SCH 717454, MK-7454) administered in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric participants with solid tumors, to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and dose-finding of robatumumab when administered in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan (Arm A); or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (Arm B), or ifosfamide and etoposide (Arm C). The primary study hypothesis is that robatumumab can be safely administered in combination with chemotherapy regimens in pediatric participants with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
