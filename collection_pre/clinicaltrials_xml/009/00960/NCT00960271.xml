	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess both the role and cost-effectiveness of EBUS in preoperative Non small cell lung cancer staging. This controlled multicentric study will be conducted in 22 centers in France. The study design includes two prospective phases. In phase 1, one investigator in each center will prospectively be evaluated for its ability to perform EBUS, with a required goal of 9 informative samplings out of 10 consecutive patients. The phase 2 will include the medico-economic assessment of the technique in the preoperative setting. A maximum of 420 patients for each phase is forecasted.</brief_summary>
