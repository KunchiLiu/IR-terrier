	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial of Weight Loss Programs in Obese Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high prevalence of obesity and its medical consequences make it one of the most important public health issues in the United States today. Few interventions have been consistently successful at reducing obesity. This trial will test an intervention program that lasts 22 weeks, with 16 evening sessions and one weekend day. Participants will be randomized to one of two arms. Both arms will receive diet and exercise intervention elements. The study aims for gradual weight loss, with a calorie target that will maintain ideal body weight, rather than a more calorie restricted diet. The exercise component is based around increasing walking. The arms will compare methods for producing long-lasting behavior change.</detailed_description>
