	<mesh_term>Aphakia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Agerelated cataract patients undergoing cataract surgery where the cataractous lens has been removed by phacoemulsification, with circular tear capsulotomy, leaving the posterior capsule intact Patients requiring primary IOL implantation Patients with a potential corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better on clinical assessment Patients with normal anterior segments apart from cataracts Subjects with clear intraocular media other than cataract Preexisting pathology or physiology, which may be aggravated by the implant, or may render the implant ineffective and that could potentially cause future acuity losses to a level of 0.5 or 20/40 or worse in either eye. This includes the following: Microphthalmia Corneal decompensation or Endothelial Insufficiency Pseudo exfoliation High myopia Pars planitis Patient with greater than 1 dioptre of preoperative corneal astigmatism Subjects who are expected to require retinal laser treatment Previous intraocular and/or corneal surgery History of uveitis, glaucoma, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or IDDM, pseudoexfoliation, macular degeneration that may affect potential best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better Operative complications of posterior capsular rupture, zonular dehiscence, incomplete continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis, severe iris /corneal trauma and inability to achieve secure placement in the designated location Subjects using a systemic medication that is known to cause ocular side effects Subjects participating in a concurrent clinical trial or if they have participated in an ophthalmology clinical trial within the last 30 days Subjects who have only one eye with potentially good vision Patients who are not willing to cooperate in the 6months followup period Children under the age of 18 years</criteria>
