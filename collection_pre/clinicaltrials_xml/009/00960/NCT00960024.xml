	<brief_summary>This project aims at generating evidence of a work-rehabilitation strategy that benefits the people with severe mental illness (SMI) who want to work, increase their sense of well-being and integration in society, decrease their financial dependence and experiences of stigma and discrimination. The project is likely to help form the basis of how to implement the evidence based supported employment (SE)-model, Individual Placement and Support model (IPS), in a Swedish work-rehabilitation context. In the long run, evidence of SE in a Swedish context could help to decrease the period of sick-leave and increase fulfilling and productive lifestyles among people with severe mental illness. In all, the effectiveness of SE can improve the quality of life for the target group, the quality in mental health care rehabilitation and decrease the costs of treatment and care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supported Employment in a Swedish Context</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence-based mental health treatment and scientific support has gained increased attention in Sweden. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare emphasizes the importance of Supported Employment. Especially since there are no study in Sweden that has an RCT-design, and that fully take on the responsibility of implementing a SE- intervention in concordance with the evidence based version of SE in mental health care, the Individual Placement and Support model, IPS. Internationally, SE according to IPS is an evidence-based approach to help people with SMI find and keep employment. RCT and quasi-experimental studies showed that IPS (Place-Then-Train), is more effective than the traditional stepwise vocational rehabilitation model(Train-Then-Place. However, there is no research evidence if the SE/IPS will function in relation to a Swedish benefit and health system and work-rehabilitation context. This intervention project will therefore not only study the effects of vocational and health-related outcomes and experiences, but also study the implementation of SE/IPS, its feasibility and level of fidelity in a Swedish context.</detailed_description>
