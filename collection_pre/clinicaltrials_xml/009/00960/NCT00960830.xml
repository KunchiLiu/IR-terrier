	<brief_title>Mirtazapine Reduces ICD Shocks in ICD Patients With Depression and Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>episodes of arrhythmia remain present even after icd implantation, this is specially true in depressed patients. it is hypothesized that improving mood state by means of an antidepressant drug . namely mirtazapine. could be responsible of alleviating the number of appropriate shocks delivered by the cardioverter. this could be due to a direct effect of the drug itself or an indirect effect of improving anxious and depressive affect. the mood and anxiety state are measured with the HADS scale</detailed_description>
