	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with childhood hematologic cancer or aplastic anemia treated with dapsone may help doctors learn more about risk factors for developing methemoglobinemia. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying methemoglobinemia in patients with childhood hematologic cancer or aplastic anemia treated with dapsone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methemoglobinemia in Patients With Childhood Hematologic Cancer or Aplastic Anemia Treated With Dapsone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine host-related risk factors for developing symptomatic methemoglobinemia in patients with pediatric hematologic malignancies or aplastic anemia who received dapsone prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii. - Determine whether a deficiency in cytochrome b5 reductase is a risk factor for symptomatic methemoglobinemia in a subset of these patients. Secondary - Collect a genomic DNA specimen from a subset of patients for whom enzyme testing is being conducted to store for future analyses of variations in the genes responsible for cytochrome b5 reductase. OUTLINE: Patients' medical records are reviewed for possible risk factors (e.g., age, sex, and body mass index) for developing symptomatic methemoglobinemia. A subset of patients undergo blood sample collection for analysis of cytochrome b5 reductase levels. DNA samples are also collected from these patients for future genetic polymorphism studies.</detailed_description>
