	<brief_title>Preventive Medicine Study of Childhood Atopic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Environmental intervention programs: We will both interview by telephone and mail the health education leaflets, in order to achieve the following aims: -Smokers living with the children will change where smoking takes place for reducing the children's ETS exposure. Data collection: We will contact participants individually to get informed consent before data collection. No matter what intervention, non-intervention or reference group, all participants will test as follows: - Blood sample collection: We will test the total IgE, specific IgE, cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13, TNF-Î±, ECP and EOS. - Questionnaire collection - Pulmonary function test After intervention programs applied, all participants will test pulmonary function, and total IgE, specific IgE and cytokines by blood sample after six months by school approaches. Then, we can compare the pulmonary function, total IgE, specific IgE and cytokines before and after intervention programs.</detailed_description>
