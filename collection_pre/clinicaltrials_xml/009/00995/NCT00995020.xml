	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine whether SWETZ (Straight Wire Excision of Transformation Zone) is a superior alternative to LLETZ cone (Large Loop Excision of Transformation Zone cone biopsy) in the management of pre-invasive endocervical disease. SWETZ is a new cone biopsy procedure performed with a straight wire electrode and it will be compared to LLETZ cone, which is performed with a large loop electrode.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment of precancerous lesions hinges on the destruction, or more commonly, the excision of the cervical transformation zone . When the transformation zone contains squamous precancer and is completely ectocervical and therefore full visible, excision or destruction is an effective and relatively straightforward therapeutic entity. However in a small proportion of women a cone biopsy is necessary. A cone biopsy often requires the excision of 20-30 mms of endocervical canal. Interventions. 1. The standard procedure, LLETZ - cone (Large Loop Excision of Transformation Zone cone biopsy), is performed with a large loop electrode of 20-25 mm depth. The activated loop was applied to the cervix outside the lateral margin of transformation zone and brought slowly to the controlateral margin with the objective to acquire 20-25 mm up the canal. 2. The experimental intervention is SWETZ (Straight Wire Excision of Transformation Zone), a method of excision using a 1cm straight disposal of 0.20 wire to remove the endocervical transformation zone or glandular disease. The activated wire was used as a knife, fashioning a cone with desired dimensions. This technique may be able to excise the endocervical transformation zone with a lower rate of morbidity and incomplete excision rate than LLETZ cone biopsy. The hypothesis to be tested in this trial is that SWETZ is superior to LLETZ cone in the management of endocervical pre-invasive disease.</detailed_description>
