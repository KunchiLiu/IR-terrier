	<brief_title>Unilateral Versus Bilateral Endoscopic Lung Volume Reduction A Comparative Case Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient enrolment and data acquisition is to be carried out on a prospective basis. It is planned to enrol a total of 20 patients with bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary emphysema. All patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in Heidelberg. Patients will be considered for both unilateral and bilateral treatment with intrabronchial valves (IBV) on the basis of their emphysema distribution. Patients will be randomised to two treatment arms. 10 patients receive unilateral or bilateral treatment in each case.</detailed_description>
