	<brief_summary>Purpose: In the framework of a randomized concurrent controlled trial, to assess the effectiveness of a feasible educational mechanism based on the principles of Alfred Adler, that focuses on the family, to improve the dietary habits of schoolchildren, to induce them to increase their physical activity, and to prevent obesity and diseases related to obesity. Primary Objectives for Children: 1.To increase intake of fruits and vegetables, to reduce intake of sweets and unhealthy snacks at home and in school, to increase exercise and to reduce sedentary activities. Primary Objective for the Parents: Increase the involvement of parents in the education of their children regarding nutrition. Description: Study population: Approximately 600 students and 600 parents from 24 first grade classes in 4 schools. Schools are randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention comprises a 5-session parental workshop and 5 joint parent-child school-based activities. The control group will be offered the intervention after conclusion of the trial. Participants are recruited in first grade, anthropometrics are measured, and pupils and parents are interviewed on eating habits and exercise. Snacks are observed. The intervention takes place in the second grade, and outcome assessment is done at the end of the 2nd grade and beginning of the 3rd grade. In-depth interviews will be conducted with parents of obese children. Significance: Most interventions geared to prevention of childhood obesity have failed dismally. A new approach that focuses on the parent-child interaction may be contributory.</brief_summary>
