	<brief_summary>Background: - Growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) provides many tumors, including brain tumors, with needed nutrients and oxygen for cancer cells to survive. One possible treatment for different kinds of cancer involves treatment with drugs that slow or stop angiogenesis and prevent further tumor growth. - Vandetanib is an oral medication known to block angiogenesis and has shown significant antitumor activity in laboratory and animal studies. Vandetanib appears to be well tolerated by patients at specific daily doses. - Carboplatin is a drug that interrupts division of cancer cells and has been shown to be a useful drug in treatment of tumors known as gliomas. It is a useful drug for treating brain tumors, but researchers are interested in gathering more information about how it works as a treatment for patients who have not responded to initial surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Objective: - To determine the safety and effectiveness of vandetanib and carboplatin, given together or sequentially, against recurrent high-grade gliomas. Eligibility: - Adults diagnosed with a malignant glioma who have received standard treatments that no longer appear to be effective. Design: - Patients will be assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 patients (combination group) will receive oral vandetanib for 28 days and intravenous (IV) carboplatin (once at the beginning of the 28-day cycle). Group 2 patients (sequential group) will receive IV carboplatin alone (once at the beginning of the 28-day cycle) and then oral vandetanib (300 mg daily) for 28 days if the tumor grows or the patient develops unacceptable carboplatin toxicity. - Treatment will continue in 28-day cycles for 1 year for both groups. - Patients will undergo a number of tests and procedures during the treatment cycle, including physical examinations, routine laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans - At the end of 1 year of treatment, patients will be reevaluated for possible continuation of drug therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase II Trial of Vandetanib (ZD6474) in Combination With Carboplatin Versus Carboplatin Alone Followed by Vandetanib Alone in Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: In vivo experiments have documented the ability of vandetanib (ZD6474) to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical tumor models. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with malignant gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, vandetanib represents a potentially promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors. Phase II data of vandetanib for recurrent glioblastomas conducted at the National Institutes of Health showed promising activity but responses were usually short-lasting. Carboplatin has shown activity as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas in adults and preclinical data generated at Dr. Fines' laboratory demonstrate additive anti-glioma activity with vandetanib. The safety profile of carboplatin and the preclinical and clinical data supports its use in combination with vandetanib in patients with malignant gliomas. Vandetanib is also an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor and it has been demonstrated that the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and non-phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) predict for a higher likelihood of response to the EGFR inhibitors Tarceva and Iressa. Objectives: To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of vandetanib in combination with carboplatin and single agent carboplatin and to collect information regarding the spectrum of toxicities. To determine if the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact PTEN and non-phosphorylated AKT predict for a higher likelihood of response to vandetanib. Eligibility: Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma are eligible for this study. Design: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of two groups. Patients in group one will be treated with vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) and with carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve at steady-state [area under curve (AUC)], 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle (combination group). Patients in group two will receive carboplatin alone (AUC 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle. Patients who develop tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity on carboplatin alone (group 2) can then receive single agent vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) in 4-week cycles (sequential group). A total of 128 evaluable patients will be analyzed. The total accrual ceiling will allow for 74 patients to be enrolled in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stratum and 74 patients in the anaplastic gliomas (AG) stratum (total 148) to factor in replacing those patients who come off treatment prior to cycle 1.</detailed_description>

These include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), and malignant glioma/astrocytoma NOS. Patients must have an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) scan performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI/CT is required. The same type of scan, that is, MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: Patients will be eligible four weeks after surgery if they have recovered from the effects of surgery. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease postoperatively, a CT/MRI should be done: no later than 96 hours in the immediate postoperative period or at least 4 weeks postoperatively, and within 14 days of registration, and on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days. If the 96 hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated.

Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy. All patients or their previously designated durable power of attorney (DPA) (if the patient is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable) must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old, and must have a life expectancy greater than 8 weeks. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.

Patients must also have serum potassium greater than or equal to 3.5 mg/dL, magnesium greater than or equal to 0.75 mmol/L and calcium levels within normal levels; supplementation is allowed. In cases where the serum calcium is below the normal range, 2 options would be available: 1) the calcium adjusted for albumin is to be obtained and substituted for the measured serum value. Exclusion is to then be based on the adjusted for albumin values falling below the normal limit. 2) Determine the ionized calcium levels. Exclusion is then to be based if these ionized calcium levels are out of normal range despite supplementation. These tests must be performed within 14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion. Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose of steroids for at least five days prior to registration. This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race. Minorities will actively be recruited to participate. Patients must not be pregnant or nursing, and all patients (both men and women) must be willing to practice birth control during and for 2 months after treatment with vandetanib and/or carboplatin.
