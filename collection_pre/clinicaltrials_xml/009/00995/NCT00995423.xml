	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether the outcome of treatment with CoroflexTM Please stent is not inferior to the outcome of treatment with TAXUS stent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Paclitaxel-Eluting Coroflex Please Stent Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish the effectiveness and the safety of coronary stenting with the newly developed paclitaxel-eluting balloon expandable stent (CoroflexTM Please stent, B. Bran, Melsungen, Germany), compared to the conventional paclitaxel-eluting balloon expandable stent (TAXUS stent, Boston scientific) in the treatment of coronary stenosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must be at least 18 years of age Significant de novo coronary artery stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimation) Patients with stable (CCS class 1 to 4) or acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina pectoris Braunwald class IB, IC, IIB, IIC, IIIB, IIIC or NSTEMI) or patents with atypical chest pain or without symptoms but having documented myocardial ischemia, amenable to stentassisted percutaneous coronary intervention The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical and angiographic followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin Aspirin Both Clopidogrel and TIclopidine Sirolimus, paclitaxel Stainless steel and/or Contrast media (patients with documented sensitivity to contrast which can be effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be enrolled. Patients with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be enrolled) Systemic (intravenous) Sirolimus or paclitaxel use within 12 months Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study History of bleeding diathesis or known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery within 2 months Current known current platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or Hgb &lt;10 g/dL An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of thienopyridines during the first 12 months post enrollment Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment) Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period Patients with EF&lt;25% Cardiogenic shock at entry Acute MI patients within symptom onset &lt; 12 hours needing primary angioplasty Creatinine level &gt; 3.0mg/dL or dependence on dialysis Patients with left main stem stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate)</criteria>
