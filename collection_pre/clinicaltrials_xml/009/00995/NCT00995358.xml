	<brief_title>A Study With Peptide Vaccination in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase I vaccination study using peptides derived from TTK, LY6K, and IMP-3 for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who had failed for the standard therapy indicated that the vaccine treatment were well tolerated and feasible, and that antigen-specific T cell responses were strongly induced by the vaccination with some objective clinical responses. Thus, we are currently initiating the randomized phase II clinical vaccination study for the same cohort with ESCC to evaluate the survival benefit of the cancer vaccination.</detailed_description>
