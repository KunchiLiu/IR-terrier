	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pivotal trial is to evaluate subcutaneous (SQ) AIN457 as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the rate of exacerbations of posterior uveitis or panuveitis secondary to Behçet's disease during the 24 weeks of study therapy as compared to standard of care alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with Behçet's disease and with a history of recurrent uveitis in a least one eye. Documented evidence of &gt;2 recurrent exacerbations of either intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis in the study eye within the past 6 months (this could include the current exacerbation for patients having an acute exacerbation at screening). Exacerbations fulfilling the study inclusion criteria must have one or more of the following recorded in the patients patients medical record for each recurrent exacerbation: &gt;2+ vitreous haze with &lt;2+ anterior chamber cell grade (intermediate or posterior uveitis) or &gt;2+ vitreous haze with &gt;2+ anterior chamber cell grade (panuveitis) presence of retinal infiltrates or vasculitis or hemorrhages documented &gt;10 ETDRS letter or 2 line Snellen decrease in visual acuity attributed to ocular inflammation secondary to the recurrent exacerbation of Behçet's disease. Requirement for either of the following immunosuppressive therapies for at least 3 of the past 6 months for the treatment of or to prevent an exacerbation of ocular inflammation related to Behçet's disease: Prednisone or equivalent &gt;10 mg daily The need for at least &gt;1 periocular injection or &gt;1 intravitreal corticosteroid injection in the study eye within the past 6 months (the last injection must have not been given within 6 weeks of screening) Treatment with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or methotrexate either as monotherapy or in combination with or without steroids. (Patients treated at any time with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide are not eligible for the study.) Patients not meeting the above specified criteria for immunomodulatory therapies are eligible for enrollment if they are intolerant to systemic immunomodulatory therapy as determined by the study investigator. Subjects with infectious uveitis, uveitis due to other causes than Behçet's disease, or uveitis of unknown etiology. Less severe (i.e. anterior) uveitis associated with Behçet's disease. Ocular treatments Treatment with intravitreal antiVEGF agents administered to the study eye within 3 months prior to study screening. Treatment with any injected or implantable corticosteroid releasing device (i.e., flucinolone acetonide implant, Retisert®) in the study eye within the last 3 years. Intraocular surgery or laser photocoagulation in the study eye within the last 6 weeks prior to screening except for a diagnostic vitreous or aqueous tap with a smallgauge needle. Systemic conditions or treatments Treatment with any live or liveattenuated vaccine (including vaccine for varicellazoster virus or measles) within 2 months prior to screening. Any systemic biologic therapy (e.g. interferon, infliximab, daclizumab, etanercept, or adalimumab) given intravenously or subcutaneously within 3 months prior to screening and no prior treatment with AIN457. Any prior treatment with systemic alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil). Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
