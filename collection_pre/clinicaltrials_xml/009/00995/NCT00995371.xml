	<mesh_term>Spinal Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Symptomatic Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) primarily caused by dorsal element hypertrophy. Prior failure of conservative therapy and ODI Score &gt;20%. Radiologic evidence of LSS (L3L5), Ligamentum flavum &gt;2.5mm, confirmed by preop MRI and/or CT. Central canal cross sectional area ≤ 100 square mm. Anterior listhesis ≤ 5.0mm. Able to walk at least 10 feet unaided before being limited by pain. Available to complete 26 weeks of followup. A signed Informed Consent Form is obtained from the patient. Adults at least 18 years of age. Prior surgery at intended treatment level. History of recent spinal fractures with concurrent pain symptoms. Disabling back or leg pain from causes other than LSS (e.g. acute compression fracture, metabolic neuropathy, or vascular claudication symptoms, etc.) Significant / symptomatic disc protrusion or osteophyte formation. Excessive / symptomatic facet hypertrophy. Bleeding disorders and/or current use of anticoagulants. Use of ASA and/or NSAID within 5 days of treatment. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Epidural steroids previously administered (not ESI naive) Wound healing pathologies deemed to compromise outcomes, including: diabetes, excessive smoking history, cancer, connective tissue diseases, recent spine radiation and severe COPD. Dementia and/or inability to give informed consent. Inability of the patient to lie prone for any reason with anesthesia support (e.g. COPD, obesity, etc.). On Workman's Compensation or considering litigation associated with back pain.</criteria>
