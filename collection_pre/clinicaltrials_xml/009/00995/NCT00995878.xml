	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of two standard fibroid treatments: MRI guided ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) and uterine artery embolization (UAE). Both treatments are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for women who do not plan to become pregnant. A second goal of this study is to better understand which symptoms bother women with fibroids the most. Understanding and addressing the symptoms of clinically-significant uterine fibroids is important in order to optimize treatment outcomes and control health care costs. Women who are eligible to participate in the study, are randomized to one of two treatment arms (UAE or MRgFUS). Women in both arms will receive treatment but will not be able to choose which treatment she will receive. A comprehensive assessment of symptoms-including experienced pain- will take place at baseline, 6 weeks, and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following treatment with UAE and MRgFUS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The FIRSTT: Comparing MRgFUS(MR-guided Focused Ultrasound) Versus UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization)for Uterine Fibroids.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine fibroids affect up to 70 to 80% of women and about 30% of women are symptomatic. Over 200,000 hysterectomies are performed each year for uterine fibroids in the USA. The direct health care costs attributable to uterine fibroids exceed $2.1 billion annually. Fibroids are reported to cause a number of symptoms including heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, pain with menses and bowel and bladder dysfunction. However, fibroid symptomatology is incompletely understood. Understanding and addressing the myomas pain are important in optimizing treatment outcomes and controlling health care costs from a societal perspective. This study proposes to optimally characterize symptoms and symptom relief in women with leiomyomas severe enough to seek interventional therapy. Secondly we will characterize a variety of symptoms utilizing standardized instruments for other pelvic diseases and symptoms to optimize comparisons with other disease processes. Clinical and scientific significance of the studies is high. We look to generate resources which can be used at a later time to assess the biologic and genetic variables affecting treatment outcome and to comprehensively assess the societal economic impact of uterine fibroids and their treatment with UAE and MRgFUS. Participants will be in the study for up to 36 months following fibroid treatment.</detailed_description>

BMI which prohibits subject from fitting in MRI device 9. Severe abdominal scarring precluding safe MRgFUS treatment 10. Active pelvic infection 11. Intrauterine contraceptive device in place at the time of treatment 12. Current use of GnRH agonists or antagonists 13. Unstable medical conditions requiring additional monitoring during the procedure 14. Bleeding diathesis requiring medical treatment 15. Imaging suggestive of malignant disease of uterus, ovary, or cervix 16. Imaging suggestive of only adenomyosis 17. Pedunculated submucosal or subserosal myoma with a stalk less than 25% of the maximal fibroid diameter</criteria>
