	<brief_summary>Malnourished children and babies with birth weights under 2500 grams are at high risk for negative outcomes over their lifespan. Philani, a paraprofessional home-visiting program, was mounted in neighborhoods in three townships in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2002 to 2004 to improve nutritional outcomes. One mentor mother was recruited from each of 37 neighborhoods. Mentor mothers were trained to conduct home visits to weigh children and to support mothers to problem-solve life challenges, especially around nutrition. Households were randomly assigned on a 2-to-1 ratio to the Philani program or to a standard care condition. Children were evaluated over a 1-year period. The investigators hypothesized that children in the intervention would gain more weight than children in the control.</brief_summary>
