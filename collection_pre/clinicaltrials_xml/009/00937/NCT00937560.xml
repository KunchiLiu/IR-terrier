	<brief_summary>This single arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and dose-dense weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (Avastin) in participants with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Participants received 6-8 3-week cycles of treatment with bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg intravenously (iv) on Day 1 of each cycle, paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 iv on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, and carboplatin iv to an area under the curve (AUC) of 6 on day 1 of each cycle. Following combination chemotherapy, bevacizumab could be continued to be given as a monotherapy.</brief_summary>
