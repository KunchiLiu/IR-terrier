	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effect of combining prolonged exposure, a cognitive-behavioral treatment program for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with medication (varenicline) and counseling treatments for smoking cessation. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a 3-month treatment of either: 1) varenicline and smoking cessation counseling alone, or 2) prolonged exposure, varenicline, and smoking cessation counseling. Assessments will be completed at the end of treatment and 6-month follow-up. We hypothesize that, at the end of treatment and at follow-up, abstinence rates and decrease in cigarettes smoked will be greater among participants who receive the combined treatment for both PTSD and smoking.</brief_summary>
