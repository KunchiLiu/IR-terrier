	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare results obtained with gender-specific and traditional knee replacement systems design among women undergoing total knee replacement surgery. Women who qualify and agree to participate will be randomly assigned to receive either a traditional or gender-specific knee replacement. During surgery, measurements of bone resection and bone-to-implant relationships will be recorded. At selected time intervals, participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires regarding pain and function, will be examined by their surgeon and routinely obtained xrays will be evaluated. In addition, a subset of participants will be randomly selected to undergo gait analysis to evaluate knee motion and muscle function.</brief_summary>
