	<brief_summary>This study is an economic evaluation of Symbicort (Budesonide/formoterol) as maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) versus its competitive alternatives. The aims of this study are: - To estimate the relative effectiveness of each one of the alternatives in the management of patients with moderate to severe asthma through a systematic review for the following outcomes: - Cumulative incidence of asthma severe exacerbations symptoms - Safety of each alternative (frequency of adverse events and complications due to the medications) - To estimate the direct medical costs of treating with each pharmacologic alternative: Symbicort as SMART versus increased use of inhaled corticosteroids or Adding long-acting inhaled beta 2 agonist plus inhaled corticosteroids. - To create a decision analysis model (decision tree) that allows comparisons between the alternatives on expected values and costs. - To calculate the average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. - To carry out a sensitivity analysis to test de robustness of the cost-effectiveness results allowing for reasonable changes in expected values and costs.</brief_summary>
