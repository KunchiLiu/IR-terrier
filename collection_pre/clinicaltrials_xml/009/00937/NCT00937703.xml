	<brief_summary>TELEDIAB-2 is a national, multicenter, controlled, randomised trial. The primary objective of the study is to show that during the initiation of a basal insulin treatment , a computerized decision-making system of adaptation of the insulin, coupled to a distance follow-up (thanks to PDAphone or an interactive vocal server (IVS)), is able to improve metabolic control at the end of 4 mouths as compared with conventional care. Main judgment criteria: comparison of HbA1c means of the 2 groups profiting from a telemonitoring system compared to the reference group at 4 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives : 1. - To compare the 2 methods of telemonitoring employed. 2. - To evaluate the speed of the glycemic attack of the objective to the rising, according to the method of follow-up employed. 3. - To evaluate the satisfaction of the patients and the doctors with respect to systems of telemonitoring, and improvement of the quality of life (DQOL).</detailed_description>
