	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SRT2104 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/day) in type 2 diabetic subjects when administered once daily for 28 consecutive days, and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SRT2104 after a single dose and multiple administrations in type 2 diabetic subjects. The secondary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of SRT2104 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/day) when administered once daily for 28 consecutive days on fasting blood glucose and insulin and post-prandial blood glucose and insulin in type 2 diabetic subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of SRT2104 in Type 2 Diabetic Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Primary: 1. To determine the safety and tolerability of SRT2104 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/day) in type 2 diabetic subjects when administered once daily for 28 consecutive days. 2. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SRT2104 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/day) after a single dose and multiple administrations in type 2 diabetic subjects. Secondary: 1. To determine the effect of SRT2104 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/day) when administered once daily for 28 consecutive days on fasting blood glucose and insulin and post-prandial blood glucose and insulin in type 2 diabetic subjects. Study Design: Prospective, multi-center, clinical study of SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days; randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple-dose, inpatient/outpatient study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SRT2104 in type 2 diabetic male and female subjects on an existing, stable, background metformin therapy. Approximately 225 subjects aged 30-70, who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study to ensure completion of forty (40) evaluable subjects within each of five dosing groups. Subjects will be evenly randomized to receive SRT2104 at one of five doses, placebo (A), 0.25 g/day (B), 0.5 g/day (C), 1.0 g/day (D), or 2.0 g/day (E), once a day for 28 consecutive days, approximately 15 minutes following consumption of a standardized meal. Subjects will remain on a fixed dose of test material for all dosing days in the study. Subjects will sign the informed consent form at the Screening Visit, and will undergo screening assessments over a 2-day period to verify eligibility for the study. If eligible and willing to participate, subjects will return to the clinic within 21 days of the Screening Visit to participate in the dosing phase of the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive SRT2104 or placebo, and will be required to stay overnight at the study center on Day -1 and Day 27 to gather required PK samples and to assess safety on Day 1 and Day 28 respectively. In addition, subjects will be asked to return to the study center on Days 2 and 29; for three interim weekly safety assessments (on Days 8, 15, 22); and for an End of Study safety assessment 7 days after they complete the 28-day dosing period. A follow-up safety call will be made to each subject 30 days following their final dose of SRT2104 or placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects of any race and gender within the age range of 30 to 70 years. 2. All female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential. For the purposes of this study, this is defined as the subject being amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, or at least 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, or women who underwent tubal ligation. Menopausal status will be confirmed by demonstrating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 40 138 mIU/ml and oestradiol &lt; 20 pg/ml at entry, unless this information is available in the subject's medical record. In the event a subject's menopause status has been clearly established (for example, the subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH and/or oestradiol levels are not consistent with a postmenopausal condition, determination of subject eligibility will be at the discretion of the principal investigator following consultation with the sponsor and medical monitor 3. All male subjects must agree with their partners to use doublebarrier birth control or abstinence while participating in the study and for 12 weeks following the last dose of study drug. 4. Willingness to provide written informed consent to participate in the study 5. HbA1c ≥ 7.5 and ≤ 10.5 6. Fasting glucose ≥ 160 and ≤ 240 mg/dL 7. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 25.0 kg/m^2 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m^2 8. On stable metformin medication for at least 3 months (≥ 1.0 g/day) prior to Screening 9. No prior history of HIV 1 or 2 10. Absence of disease markers for hepatitis B &amp; C virus 11. Absence of significant disease or clinically significant abnormal laboratory values on the laboratory evaluations, medical history or physical examination during the screening; normal end organ function 12. Have a normal 12lead ECG or one with abnormality considered to be clinically insignificant 13. Have a normal chest Xray (P. A. View) or one with abnormality considered to be clinically insignificant 14. Comprehension of the nature and purpose of the study and compliance with the requirement of the entire protocol 1. Any major illness in the past three months or any significant ongoing chronic medical illness not related to diabetes 2. Renal or liver impairment, defined as serum creatinine level of ≥ 1.4 mg/dL for females and ≥ 1.5 mg/dL for males, and greater than two times the upper limit of normal for liver enzymes, respectively. 3. History of or current gastrointestinal diseases influencing drug absorption, except for appendectomy 4. History, within 3 years, of drug abuse (including Benzodiazepines, opioids, amphetamine, cocaine, and THC) 5. History of alcoholism (more than two years), moderate drinkers (more than three drinks per day) or having consumed alcohol within 48 hrs prior to dosing [one drink is equal to one unit of alcohol (one glass wine, half pint beer, one measure of spirit)] 6. Participation in any clinical trial within the past three months 7. History of difficulty in donating blood or accessibility of veins in left or right arm 8. Donation of blood (one unit or 350 ml) within three months prior to receiving the first dose of test material 9. Use of any prescription drug therapy, with exception of any prescription medication administered at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening, provided the medication is not contraindicated by the metformin label 10. Use of any alternate antidiabetic therapy, except metformin, within three months of enrollment</criteria>
