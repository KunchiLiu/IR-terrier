	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine whether whole body vibration is beneficial in promoting bone health, physical fitness and neuromotor performance in patients with chronic stroke. Subjects in the experimental group will undergo whole body vibration therapy (1 session per day, 3 sessions per week) for 8 weeks. The vibration frequency used in this study will be 30Hz. The total duration of exposure to vibration for the experimental group will be 10 minutes. While standing on the vibration platform, patients will be instructed to repeat the following set of light exercises: (1) light squatting,(2) deep squatting, (3) side-to-side weight-shift, (4) Forward and backward weight-shift, (5) forward lunge, (6) marching on the spot. The control exercise group, on the other hand, will perform the same exercise program on the platform, but no vibration will be given. The training will be conducted by a qualified personnel with physiotherapy background. The outcome measurement will be performed 4 times: (1) immediately before the commencement of intervention, (2) immediately after termination of treatment, (3) at 1 month after termination of treatment. Each subject will be evaluated for bone markers, leg muscle strength, balance, spasticity, and walking ability.</brief_summary>
