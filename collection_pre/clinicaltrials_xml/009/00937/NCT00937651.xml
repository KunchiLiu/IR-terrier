	<brief_summary>Study objective: 1. To evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy, safety and tolerability of the drug after the oral administration of BR-A-657•K at 20~180mg for 4 weeks to patients with essential hypertension. 2. To review the pharmacokinetic profile after the multiple administration and the pharmacodynamic profile regarding the renin-angiotensin system, after the oral administration of BR-A-657•K at 20~180mg for 4 weeks to patients with essential hypertension. 3. To determine the dose for the clinical study at the next phase by analyzing the relationship between the antihypertensive efficacy and pharmacokinetic • pharmacodynamic results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic Study of Fimasartan (BR-A-657•K)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that the Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed in high dose. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel grouped, clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability and to determine adequate antihypertensive dosage of Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in Seoul National University Hospital. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the following 5 groups. Subjects will take test drug/placebo for 28 days of treatment period. If subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1 week of wash-out period. Group I : Placebo, Group II : Fimasartan 20 mg, Group III: Fimasartan 60 mg, Group IV : Fimasartan 180 mg</detailed_description>
