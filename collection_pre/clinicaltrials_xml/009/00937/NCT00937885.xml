	<brief_summary>Reminiscence is the systematic use of memories and recollections to strengthen self-identity and self-worth. The study aim was to investigate the consequences for nursing home residents and staff of integrating reminiscence into daily nursing care. Ten nursing homes were randomised into either an Intervention Group, who implemented reminiscence, or a Control Group, who continued with usual care. Data were collected at baseline and again 6 and 12 months after the intervention start. Results suggested that use of reminiscence can improve residents' quality of life and possibly delay progression in dementia symptoms. Nursing staff can experience greater satisfaction with personal and professional roles and develop a more positive view of the residents.</brief_summary>
