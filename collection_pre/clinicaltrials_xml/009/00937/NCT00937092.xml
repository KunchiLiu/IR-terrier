	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of high-dose furosemide versus low-dose furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine on diuresis, renal function, electrolyte balance, and 60-day post-discharge outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (DAD-HF) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worsening renal function (WRF) and hypokalemia related to diuretic use for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are common and portend poor prognosis. Low dose dopamine infusion improves renal perfusion. Whether dopamine infusion improves diuresis and/or reduces renal complication in ADHF is not known. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of high-dose furosemide (HDF, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of 20 mg/h for a total of 8 hours) vs. low-dose furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine (LDFD, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/h furosemide plus 5μg/kg/min dopamine for a total of 8 hours) on diuresis, renal function, electrolyte balance, and 60-day post-discharge outcomes in patients hospitalized with ADHF.</detailed_description>
