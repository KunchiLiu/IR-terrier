	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the toxicity and clinical response of therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as treatment for advanced melanoma. Patient will receive a single treatment consisting of conditioning chemotherapy for seven days (cyclophosphamide for two days and fludarabine for five days), intravenous infusion of high number of in vitro expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes followed by two weeks with daily low-dose interleukine-2. Patients will be evaluated for toxicity, tumor response, and immune response. After the first 6 patients the treatment with IL-2 has been changed to include higher doses of IL-2 (see intervention)</brief_summary>
