	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the hemodynamics effects of two usual hypnotic agents (LENOXe ™ (xenon 100 % v/v) and sevoflurane) during a general anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients. The hypothesis is that the use of the LENOXe ™ (xenon 100 % v/v) allows to obtain per-operating hemodynamic stability non inferior than with sevoflurane.</brief_summary>
