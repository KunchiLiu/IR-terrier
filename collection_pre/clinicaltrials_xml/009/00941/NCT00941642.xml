	<brief_summary>Lovaza is the only fish oil supplement approved by the FDA. It is available by prescription for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia (&gt; 500 mg/dl). The primary mechanism appears to be a reduction in hepatic production of triglycerides. Also decreases the hepatic production of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). There also may be antioxidant properties as well. The thought behind using Lovaza as a treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is two fold. It would help in the decrease production of triglycerides by the liver and have antioxidant properties decreasing the production of free radicals in the liver. In doing so, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and perhaps cirrhosis and liver cancer would be prevented.</brief_summary>
