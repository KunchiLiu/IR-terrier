	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators address the research question of whether palm olein will have a positive influence on plasma total homocysteine levels in human volunteers provided with high-protein diets formulated from common Malaysian foods. Hypothesis: There is a significant difference on the effects of the three experimental oils (palm olein, olive and coconut oil) on plasma tHy levels and the other markers of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk measured.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Fat Type in Combination With High Protein on Plasma Homocysteine Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental are comprise of 30% kcal fat, 20% kcal protein and 50% kcal carbohydrate. Each of the test fat [palm olein (POo), virgin olive oil (OO) and coconut oil (CO)] contributes to two-thirds of total dietary fat will be compared. Three meals a day providing 2000 kcal, including breakfast, lunch and dinner will be provided for the 5-weeks period of each fat rotation. 45 volunteers are fed with normal cooking oil for 3 weeks for standardisation purpose. They were then stratified into 3 groups according to gender, homocysteine and cholesterol level. The volunteers will be randomized, blinded and will undergo a 3 arms crossover intervention. Each intervention will take 5 wk with 2 wk wash out in between. Baseline blood samples will be taken while other blood samples will be collected at week-4 and -5 of the study.</detailed_description>
