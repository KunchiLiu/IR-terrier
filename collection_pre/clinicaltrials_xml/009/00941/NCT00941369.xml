	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To investigate the impact of insulin glargine versus Neutral Protamine Hagedorn basal insulin on a composite diabetes related quality of life score (DRQoL). Secondary Objective: A comparison of combination therapy with insulin glargine versus Neutral Protamine Hagedorn basal insulin from baseline to endpoint in terms of: - Glycaemic parameters: 7 blood glucose profiles - Incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia as well as confirmed severe hypoglycemia - Change in lipid status</brief_summary>
