	<brief_summary>Asthma self-management is an effective way to improve the outcomes of patients with asthma. However, to be most effective these interventions should be targeted and designed toward a specific population or group. There is currently no asthma self-management intervention directed towards older adults. The hypothesis is that a 6-session asthma self-management intervention will improve the outcomes of older patients with asthma.</brief_summary>
