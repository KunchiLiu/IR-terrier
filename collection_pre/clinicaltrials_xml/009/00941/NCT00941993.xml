	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized, multicenter, prospective, clinical study intended to evaluate the effectiveness of a method for iontophoretic delivery of a buffered lidocaine/epinephrine solution for provision of tympanic membrane anesthesia in patients who are indicated for an ear procedure requiring penetration of the tympanic membrane, including, but not limited to, myringotomy, tympanocentesis with culture or tympanostomy with tube placement.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age 12 months and older 2. Both male and female patients eligible 3. Patients are indicated for procedures requiring penetration of the tympanic membrane (including, but not limited to, myringotomy, tympanocentesis with culture or tympanostomy with tube implant) 1. Patients with a history of sensitivity or reaction to lidocaine, epinephrine or any hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type or any component of the drug solution 2. Markedly atrophic, retracted, atelectatic or perforated tympanic membrane 3. Otitis externa 4. Electrically sensitive patients and patients with electrically sensitive support systems (pacemakers, defibrillators, etc.) 5. Damaged or denuded skin in the auditory canal 6. Cerumen impaction resulting in a significant amount of cleaning required to visualize the tympanic membrane</criteria>
