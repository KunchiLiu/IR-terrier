	<brief_summary>For patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma there is no standard therapy. One strategy is re-exposure to temozolomide in a higher dose. This increase in dosing can be done by 2 regimens. Aim of this study is to compare these 2 dosing regimens concerning toxicity. In study arm A patients receive temozolomide for one week, followed by a week without temozolomide. In study arm B patients receive temozolomide for three weeks, followed by a week without temozolomide. The regimen that is less toxic will be selected for further evaluations.</brief_summary>

Histological diagnosis of glioblastoma Tissue available for the determination of MGMT promoter methylation in the primary tumor or from the recurrent tumor if a patient undergoes a surgical procedure at recurrence prior to study entry.

Treatment with any chemotherapy other than temozolomide according to the schedule of the EORTC NCIC trial (Stupp et al. N Engl J Med 2005;352:987996) except that an adjuvant starting dose of 200 mg/m2 and more than 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide are allowed Prior systemic or local treatment with DNAdamaging agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents for any cancer Allergy to or other intolerability of temozolomide Unable to undergo MRI Past medical history of diseases with poor prognosis, e.g. severe coronary heart disease, severe diabetes, immune deficiency, residual deficits after stroke, severe mental retardation HIV infection Pregnancy Breast feeding Treatment within in any other clinical trial parallel to the treatment phase of the current study</criteria>
