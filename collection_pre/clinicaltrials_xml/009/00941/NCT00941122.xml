	<brief_summary>1.To assess whether the Elution swab (ESwab) is superior to Amies transport swabs for the detection of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) in colonized patients and to determine whether nasal cultures alone is sufficient for detection of MRSA isolates in hospitalized patients. 2.To assess patient comfort in the use of the ESwab vs. Amies Transport swab for screening patients for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Elution Swab (ESwab) and Amies Transport Swabs for Screening Patients for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) Colonization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRSA is a major cause of nosocomial and life threatening infections. Infections with MRSA have been associated with a significantly higher morbidity, mortality and costs than methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA).1 Selection of these organisms has been greatest in the healthcare setting; however, MRSA have also become more prevalent in the community.2 To control the transmission of MRSA, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) has recommended guidelines, which include an active surveillance program to identify potential reservoirs and a rigorous infection control program to control the spread of MRSA. Accurate identification of patients colonized with MRSA is essential in managing the transmission of the organism. It is currently unknown whether the currently utilized collection rayon swab is the optimal swab in detecting colonized patients The purpose of this study is to directly compare whether Eluted (ESwab) swab is superior to the currently utilized rayon swab in identifying MRSA/VRE colonized patients.</detailed_description>
