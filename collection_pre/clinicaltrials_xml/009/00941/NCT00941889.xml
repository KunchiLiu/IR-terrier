	<brief_title>The Effect of HPV Vaccination on Recurrence Rates in HIV Patients With Condylomata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine called Gardasil had recently (at start of study) been developed and approved by the FDA for the prevention of cervical HPV infection and cervical cancer, which is associated with infection from this virus. It is unknown whether the same vaccine could also be of benefit in treating anogenital warts, which are caused by the same virus. This is an important and clinically relevant question which needs to be answered. Anal warts have a high prevalence and recurrence and usually require extended lengths of treatment and follow-up, especially in the HIV population. At times, treatment of anal warts requires multiple surgeries to excise them if the burden of disease is high. Therefore, this disease represents a significant expense to patients and the health care system. Further, the HPV virus that causes anal warts has been associated with anal cancer and with its preliminary lesion known as anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). This study touches on two important, relevant and costly healthcare issues: finding a better treatment for the most common sexually transmitted disease in our country, and helping to prevent anal cancer, which is often a fatal disease.</detailed_description>
