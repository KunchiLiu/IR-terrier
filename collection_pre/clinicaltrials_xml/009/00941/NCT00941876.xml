	<brief_summary>HIV positive women and couples have broad reproductive health needs that are not always met within HIV services. The integration of family planning (FP) services into Tanzania's HIV Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) will address the fertility desires of CTC clients and ultimately result in the reduction of unintended pregnancies and HIV incidence. One strategy for integrating FP and CTC services is to use a "facilitated referral" model. Facilitated referrals are enhanced referrals for additional services that have been used in other settings and which are the preferred intervention strategy the Government of Tanzania would like to pilot test. This study will evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and costs of implementing a "facilitated referrals" intervention by examining FP use among female clients attending HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Centers. This study will measure whether there is a reduction in unmet need for contraception among female CTC clients after the facilitated referral integration intervention has been implemented.</brief_summary>
