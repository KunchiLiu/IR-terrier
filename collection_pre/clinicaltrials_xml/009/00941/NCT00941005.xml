	<brief_summary>Introduction: Current rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) experienced by outpatient surgery patients are as high as 20-30%. Electroacustimulation (EAS) therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in controlling these symptoms, but trials identifying their efficacy in the outpatient surgery population are lacking. This study integrates conventional pharmacotherapy with alternative medicine in prevention of PONV. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty two patients undergoing surgery procedures at an outpatient surgery center were randomized to two treatment arms. The first arm was standardized pharmacologic PONV prevention typical for patients undergoing outpatient surgery, while the second arm employed the use of ReliefBand, an FDA-approved electroacustimulation (EAS) device with pharmacologic treatment to relieve symptoms of PONV and pain. EAS is a derivative of acupuncture therapy that uses a small electrical current to stimulate acupuncture points on the human body and is thought to relieve nausea, vomiting and pain. Outcomes measured were post-op questionnaires evaluating pain and nausea symptoms, emetic events, the need for rescue medications and the time to discharge.</brief_summary>
