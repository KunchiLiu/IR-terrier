	<brief_title>Monopolar Electrosurgery Versus Ultrasound Scissors in Thoracoscopic Ventral Spondylodesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One group of patients will be operated on using ultrasound scissors in the preparation during Thoracoscopic Ventral Spondylodesis. The other group will be operated on using Monopolar Electrosurgery. The study is designed as a randomized trial. That means that all patients who have given their consent to participate in the study will be allocated to either ultrasound scissors or Monopolar Electrosurgery by chance. A total of 40 patients will be included in this study. The study ends with finishing of the first day after the operation, there is no longer follow up.</detailed_description>
