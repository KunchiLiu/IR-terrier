	<brief_summary>A switch from protease inhibitors (PIs) to raltegravir (RAL) will be effective virologically and immunologically. Moreover, it will be associated with significant improvements in the lipid profile in HIV patients with undetectable viremia on PIs. In this setting, RAL once a day (QD) will perform as well as RAL twice a day (BID).</brief_summary>
