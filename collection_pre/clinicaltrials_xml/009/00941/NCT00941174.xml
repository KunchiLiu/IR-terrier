	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether the intact human colon with an unaltered microflora distribution absorbs folate and to what extent it is absorbed into the systemic circulation using a dual/oral intravenous route. This will elicit an understanding of colonic folate absorption and metabolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folate Absorption Across the Large Intestine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study supplements two earlier in print exploratory studies investigating the absorption of folate across the colon after an infusion during colonoscopy and a pre-trial with the purpose of determining dissolution characteristics of two placebo caplet formulations. Using a dual route oral/intravenous, folate (pharmaceutical name Calcium Leucovorin), labeled with a stable isotope will be used to quantitatively measure total folate levels, as well as the uptake of (13C) labeled folate. A pH dependent caplet targeted to the colon and fluoroscopy will determine dissolution characteristics. Labeled and unlabelled folate in blood and urine samples will be used to quantitatively measure the uptake of folate. This will further our understanding of the kinetics (caplet transit times), colonic folate absorption (metabolism) and impact on folate status (bioavailability) in healthy adults.</detailed_description>
