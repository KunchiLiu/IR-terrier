	<brief_summary>The investigators have been offering computer assisted therapy of aphasia (CAT) as a complement to traditional treatments to aphasia patients of the "Service of Neurorehabilitation" for some years. The investigators have shown its efficacy in hospitalised patients with recently acquired aphasia. In addition to studies stressing the importance of treatment intensity, several studies suggest that pharmacological treatment can also improve recovery after a cerebral lesion. The underlying idea is that the administration of medication influencing the system of neurotransmitters can play a role in functional recovery. Studies have assessed mainly substances acting on the dopaminergic (amphetamine and bromocriptine) and GABAergic system (piracetam). The main objective of the present study concerns the evaluation of the effects of levodopa on recovery of anomia in patients with aphasia. In particular, the investigators use CAT to control intensity and quality of therapy and they will assess whether the administration of levodopa promotes recovery. In each patient, two periods of anomia therapy with CAT, each performed with a different word list, will be compared. In addition to speech therapy, each period will be associated with the administration of either levodopa and benserazide (Madopar Â®), or placebo. Evaluations at baseline and after each treatment period will be performed with the material and denomination battery</brief_summary>
