	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if ultrasonography is an adequate means for confirmation of nasogastric tube placement and that ultrasonography is more time efficient than radiography confirming nasogastric tube placement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Confirmation of Nasogastric Tube Placement Via Ultrasonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our current nasogastric tube placement protocol requires confirmation of nasogastric tube placement with plain radiography. Obtaining a plane radiograph in the emergency department can be time consuming and exposes the patient to radiation. Ultrasound is readily available to our physicians and does not expose patients to radiation. Confirmation of nasogastric tube placement by ultrasonography may provide a faster means of confirmation and expose patients to less radiation.</detailed_description>
