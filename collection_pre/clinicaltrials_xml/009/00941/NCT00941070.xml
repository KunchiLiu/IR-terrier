	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how triapine and cisplatin given together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with cervical cancer or vaginal cancer. Triapine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving triapine together with cisplatin may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine three-month fasting F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging complete metabolic response as defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) PET study group. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine 6-month progression-free survival rate as calculated from the date of first treatment until date of disease progression, relapse, or death. II. To quantitate change in pre-treatment standard uptake value (SUV) on PET/CT and post-treatment PET/CT or disease progression PET/CT. III. To quantitate pre-treatment, during treatment and 3-mo post-treatment grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and sexual function toxicity resulting from Triapine®, cisplatin, and radiation therapy as measured by CTCAE v3.0, which will be utilized until December 31, 2010; CTCAE v4.0 will be utilized beginning January 1, 2011. IV. To associate smoking habit (non-smoker, smoker who quit during therapy, smoker) with 3-mo post-treatment PET/CT metabolic response and 3-mo best overall clinical response as measured by RECIST criteria after Triapine®, cisplatin, and radiation therapy. V. To associate HPV or non-HPV sub-type cervical cancer with 3-mo post-treatment PET/CT metabolic response and 3-mo best overall clinical response as measured by RECIST criteria after Triapine®, cisplatin, and radiation therapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to brachytherapy treatment (planned intracavitary brachytherapy vs none). Patients receive cisplatin IV over 90 minutes on days 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 and triapine IV on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33. Patients also undergo pelvic external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week during weeks 1-5. Patients may undergo parametrial boost radiation and intracavitary low-dose or high-dose rate brachytherapy as clinically indicated. Patients undergo whole-body F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT imaging at baseline, at 3 months after completion of study treatment, and at disease progression. Patients complete Sexual Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire and a smoking behavior questionnaire at baseline, at 3 months after completion of study treatment, and at disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female patients must have histologically confirmed (tumor tissue biopsy) primary clinical stage IB2IVB cervical cancer or clinical stage IIIVB vaginal cancer not amenable to curative surgical resection alone to be eligible; patients with stage IVB cervical cancer may receive systemic chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic disease a) after the 3month posttherapy PET scan and b) if the 3month posttherapy PET scan documents progressive disease at the discretion of the treating physician Patients with other active invasive malignancies are excluded; patients with prior malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or prior in situ carcinoma of the cervix, patients with synchronous or past history of primary endometrial cancer meeting all conditions of a) stage not greater than IB, b) no more than superficial myometrial invasion, c) without vascular or lymphatic invasion, and d) no poorly differentiated subtypes including papillary serous, clear cell or other FIGO grade 3 lesions; patients with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) cancer present within the last five years are excluded; patients are excluded if they have received prior low abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy for any reason that would contribute radiation dose that would exceed tolerance of normal tissues Life expectancy of greater than 3 months Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal PT/aPTT =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Patients should have a serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5mg/dL to receive weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy Patients whose serum creatinine is between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL are eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy if the estimated creatinine clearance is &gt;= 30 ml/min; patients eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy using the criteria for creatinine clearance may also receive intravenous Triapine® Women of childbearing potential and male partners must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Patients must demonstrate ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier are excluded Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurological and other adverse events History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Triapine® or other agents used in study Patients unable to receive intravenous chemotherapies as a consequence of poor vascular access are ineligible Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, known inadequately controlled hypertension, significant pulmonary disease including dyspnea at rest, patients requiring supplemental oxygen, or poor pulmonary reserve; proteinuria or clinically significant renal function impairment (baseline serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dL), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements are excluded Patients with known glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) are excluded as the antidote methylene blue for Triapine® toxicity may be at best ineffective in such patients and may have the potential to complicate the clinical situation by provoking hemolysis Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Triapine® is a heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; screening betahcg levels and diagnostic tests will be used to determine eligibility; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Triapine®, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Triapine®; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study Patients not willing to agree to use appropriate contraception while on trial will be excluded HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Triapine®; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated; HIV testing is not mandatory; patients that are known to be HIVpositive are ineligible if they are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy</criteria>
