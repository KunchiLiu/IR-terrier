	<brief_summary>Compared with the early diagnosis rate and the mortality rate between the patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from the screening group and the control group, new screening protocol is conducted into high-risk population in Guangdong Province, China. Meanwhile, we also perform epidemiological surveys of the screening population to acquire the baseline information. Through analyzing the risk factors, this study can provide a population-based prospective evidences to better understand the reasons of NPC onset in high-risk population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample selection - Select communities of 70,000 to 120,000 populations in Sihui and Zhongshan City as our fields by cluster sampling randomization - Divide them into screening group and control group according to the areas of administration Participants recruitment - Subjects voluntarily attend this screening study - Informed consents are performed at the recruitment Questionnaires - Face-to-face interviews are conducted by well-trained investigators Physical examinations - Each participants are performed medical services such as otorhinolaryngologic and lymphatic examinations Serological tests - Each blood samples are tested for IgA antibodies against EBV capsid antigen (VCA/IgA) and IgA antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1/IgA) - If the results reach the serological definition of high-risk populations, fiberoptic endoscopy and pathological biopsy were performed by otorhinolaryngologists - The rest of the blood samples will be stored at the biobank of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center Follow up - The cohort will follow up according to the screening protocol</detailed_description>
