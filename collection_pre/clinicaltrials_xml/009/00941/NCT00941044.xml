	<brief_summary>Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a new concept of mechanical ventilation. NAVA delivers assistance to spontaneous breathing based on the detection of the electrical activity of the diaphragm. The investigators will study the effects of non-invasive NAVA in respiratory muscle unloading in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
