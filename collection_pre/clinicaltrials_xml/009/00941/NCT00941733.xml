	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized (2:1) trial of symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) secondary to atherosclerotic lesions (stenotic or occluded) of the infrapopliteal vessels. Patients will undergo a percutaneous transluminal endovascular procedure with either the IN.PACT Amphirion™ drug eluting balloon or with a standard (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) PTA balloon. Patients will be followed with pre-study, post-study, and follow-up evaluations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria Age ≥18 years and ≤85 years Patient or patient's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has signed an Ethical Committee approved consent form Female patients of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test ≤7 days before the procedure and are willing to use a reliable method of birth control for the duration of study participation Patient has documented chronic Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) in the target limb prior to the study procedure with Rutherford Category 4, 5 or 6 Life expectancy &gt;1 year in the Investigator's opinion General Angiographic Inclusion Criteria Reference vessel(s) diameter between 2 and 4 mm Single or multiple lesions with ≥70% diameter stenosis (DS) of different lengths in one or more main afferent crural vessels including the tibioperoneal trunk At least one non occluded crural vessel with angiographically documented runoff to the foot either direct or through collaterals Angiographic Inclusion Criteria for Late Lumen Loss (LLL) assessment Angiotarget lesion (TL) is one identifiable single solitary or series of multiple adjacent lesions with a diameter stenosis (DS) ≥70% and a cumulative length ≤100 mm that can be covered by a single IN.PACT Amphirion™ (10 mm balloon landing zone in both edges is mandatory) Angiotarget lesion (TL) is the only lesion in that vessel (only one AngioTL per patient is allowed) General Exclusion Criteria Patient unwilling or unlikely to comply with FollowUp schedule Planned major index limb amputation General Angiographic Exclusion Criteria Lesion and / or occlusions located or extending in the popliteal artery or below the ankle joint space Inflow lesion or occlusion in the ipsilateral Iliac, Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA), popliteal arteries with length ≥15 cm Significant (≥50% DS) inflow lesion or occlusion in the ipsilateral Iliac, Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and popliteal arteries left untreated Previously implanted stent in the target lesions(s) Aneurysm in the target vessel Acute thrombus in the target limb General Procedural Exclusion Criteria Failure to obtain a &lt;30% residual stenosis in preexisting, hemodynamically significant (≥50% diameter stenosis (DS) and &lt;15 cm length) inflow lesions in the ipsilateral iliac, SFA and popliteal artery. No Drug Eluting Stents (DES) and / or Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) allowed for the treatment of inflow lesions. Failure to cross the TL with a 0.014" guide wire Use of alternative therapy, e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon, laser, radiation therapy, DES as part of the index procedure ANGIOGRAPHIC cohort General Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;30 ml/min except for patients with renal end stage disease on chronic haemodialysis</criteria>
