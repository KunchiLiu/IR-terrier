	<brief_summary>The study aims at establishing the effectiveness of the non-mesh (Desarda) technique for the treatment of primary inguinal hernias at Mulago Hospital in Uganda. First developed and used in India, the Desarda method is reported to offer superior outcomes such as minimal postoperative groin pain and near zero recurrence rates. In comparison to the mesh-based repairs, it is a simple and affordable technique suitable for the resource-constrained communities. It is devoid of complications associated with foreign body implants. Early clinical outcomes which include acute groin pain, time to resumption of normal gait, operative time and complications will be assessed. Participants will be followed at 2 hours, 3 days, 7 days and 14 days postoperatively. The investigators hypothesize that the mean postoperative acute groin pain score, or the mean postoperative day of return to normal gait is different in adult patients who undergo the non-mesh (Desarda) repair from what it is in those who undergo the mesh (Lichtenstein) technique of hernia repair.</brief_summary>
