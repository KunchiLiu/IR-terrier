Elucidate if low-frequency EA induce ovulation and restore LH frequency and amplitude as well as sex steroid secretion as compared to a control group receiving same amount of attention. Aim 2. Elucidate if low-frequency EA restore cortisol frequency and amplitude compared to a control group receiving same amount of attention. Aim 3. Elucidate if low-frequency EA restore psychological distress and quality of life as compared to a control group receiving same amount of attention.in women with PCOS.</detailed_description>
