	<brief_summary>In patients with chest pain and/or shortness of breath coronary artery disease (CAD) is suspected depending on the pattern of symptoms and the electrocardiogram (ECG). Coronary angiography is the method of choice to verify this suspicion. If the patient coronary arteries on coronary angiography are totally normal, one can only speculate if the patients' discomfort is from the heart or not. A possibility to get further information about the healthiness of the coronary arteries is the acetylcholine test (ACH-test). When injecting this natural, body produced-substance into the coronary arteries one can test if the vessels coronary spasm which can be the reason for the patient's symptoms. The investigators therefore use this test in this study to look for coronary spasm in patients with suspected CAD but normal coronary arteries. In case of a positive test, the patient profits from having found a cause for his/her symptoms making treatment with special tablets possible. Furthermore, the investigators want to analyze blood samples of every patient to look for signs of inflammation that seem to be linked with coronary spasms. On the basis of these results the ACH-test could probably be avoided in the future.</brief_summary>
