	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability profile (rate and amount of absorption into the bloodstream) of a test formulation of ivermectin solution 1 mg/ml with a marketed reference formulation of ivermectin 3 mg tablets when taken after an overnight fast .The study is designed in accordance with the EU Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 2001.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ivermectin Solution Bioequivalence Study - Fasted</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine (i.e. a medicine used to eliminate parasitic worms) for oral administration, and is approved in the US and some other countries in a tablet form. A new liquid formulation of ivermectin has been developed to facilitate dosing. This is a single dose, randomised, crossover study in healthy adult male and female volunteers, with doses taken after an overnight fast. Doses will be separated by washout period of at least 14 days. Twenty-one blood samples will be taken from each volunteer over 144 hours in each period. Concentrations of ivermectin in plasma will be measured using a validated chromatographic assay (LC-MS/MS). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and bioequivalence on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.</detailed_description>

Smoking or alcohol consumption greater than protocolspecified levels Protocolspecified contraindication to blood sampling Acute or chronic medical, dietary or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial</criteria>
