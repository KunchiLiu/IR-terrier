	<brief_summary>The objective is to assess the humoral and cellular immune response of the VAX102 vaccine delivered IM and SC in a prime-boost regimen at dose levels 1 µg or 2 µg in healthy adults against the influenza A virus M2e antigen after each vaccination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Immune Response to Two Doses of VAX102 Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to assess the humoral and cellular immune response of the VAX102 vaccine delivered IM and SC in a prime-boost regimen at dose levels 1 µg or 2 µg in healthy adults against the influenza A virus M2e antigen after each vaccination. The magnitude and quality of the M2e-specific B and T cells will be measured. B cell responses will be evaluated on pre-dose Days 0, 28 and post-dose Days 7, 35, 42 and 60. T cell responses will be measured on pre-dose Days 0, 28 and post-dose Days 14, 42 and 60. IgG M2e antibody will be measured on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35. 42 and 60. The secondary objective is to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of the VAX102 vaccine delivered IM or SC at dose levels 1 µg or 2 µg, in a prime-boost dosing regimen, in healthy adults 18-49 years of age, inclusive.</detailed_description>

Documented influenza infection in the 6 months prior to study entry. Presently receiving or history of receiving any medications or treatments that affects the immune system such as allergy shots, immune globulin, interferon, immunomodulators, cytotoxic drugs or drugs known to be frequently associated with significant major organ toxicity, or systemic corticosteroids (oral or injectable) in the past 6 months. Inhaled and topical corticosteroids will be allowed. Receipt or planned administration of a nonstudy vaccine within 30 days before and during the study and through the Day 42 evaluation. History of anaphylactic type reaction to injected vaccines. History of drug or chemical abuse in the year before the study. Use of new prescription medications started within 7 days before study entry. Receipt of blood or blood products 8 weeks before study entry or planned administration during the study period. Donation of blood or blood products within 8 weeks before study entry or at any time during the study. Acute disease within 72 hours prior to vaccinations, defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness (as determined by the investigator through medical history and physical examination; for example, those requiring an absence from work) with or without fever, or a fever &gt;37.9ºC orally. Study vaccine can be administered to persons with a minor illness, such as diarrhea, or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness. Vaccination can be delayed until the subject has recovered. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with study objectives</criteria>
