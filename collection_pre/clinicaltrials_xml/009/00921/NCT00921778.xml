	<brief_summary>The occurrence of persistent vaginal bleeding following laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) is reported in the wide range of 0 % - 25 %. Experienced gynaecologists have claimed that removal of any remaining endometrium in a reverse cone pattern at the time of the hysterectomy reduces the occurrence of persistent vaginal bleeding to a minimum. The effect of this particular technique has not been reported. Ullevaal University Hospital have developed an unipolar electrode for this study (Lapcone electrode, mod. UUS, L: 25cm, 6x10, Art. No. REM-270, Ross Electro Medical Ltd, Unit K1&amp;K2, Quarry Fields Estate, Mere, Wiltshire BA12 6LA, London, UK). The electrode is CE approved. Outcome: 1.Occurrence of vaginal bleeding 12 months after the procedure. 2. Patient satisfaction 12 months after the procedure (10-point analogue scale). Design: Prospective randomised trial. Methods; The study participants are randomised to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy performed by perioperative electrocoagulation from the upper cervical canal (n=70) or performed by excision of the endocervix in a reverse cone pattern followed by electrocoagulation of the upper cervical canal (n =70).</brief_summary>
