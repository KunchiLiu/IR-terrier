	<brief_summary>Some recommendations of expert consensus on subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) are controversial in those areas with not enough information to reach a conclusion, such as not recommending treatment with thyrotrophic hormone of 4-10 mUI/L and free thyroxin in normal range. The body changes or symptoms at this stage are often mistaken as aging. There are studies showing significant changes in heart (slow rate, lower ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction); hypercholesterolemia, dysfunction cognitive abilities (memory attentionâ€¦). The prevalence of SH increases with age, reaching 14% over 65 years old. This age group increase as the population ages highlights the need for evidence to improve recommendations for the elderly. NEUROPSI is a validated neuropsychological test sensible for mild cognitive alterations. It can be applied to individuals with little schooling. This study aims to determine positive change in cognitive abilities (NEUROPSI), ejection fraction, and body percent of lean and adipose tissue without adverse effects, placebo versus thyroxin supplement to keep thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) between 0.5-2.5 mUI/L in elderly with TSH 4-10 mIU/L.</brief_summary>
