	<brief_summary>The study will assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of VAX102 when given with Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) delivered in the same arm as two separate IM injections in healthy adults 18 to 49 years. The investigators will measure the immunogenicity of the VAX102 when given with TIV and the antibody response to TIV when given with VAX102 compared to TIV alone.</brief_summary>
