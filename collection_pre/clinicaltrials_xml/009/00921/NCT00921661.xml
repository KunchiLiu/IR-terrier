	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the dose of aflibercept to be further studied in combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/isovorin (FOLFIRI) in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Secondary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile of aflibercept, to determine the pharmacokinetics of aflibercept, to make a preliminary assessment of antitumor effects.</brief_summary>
