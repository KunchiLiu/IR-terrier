	<brief_summary>Hypothesis 1- Using IMRT, the radiation therapy (RT) dose can be safely escalated from 58 Gy to 74 Gy given as 6 fractions/week with concurrent chemotherapy. Hypothesis 2- Esophageal motion can be used to customize planning organ at risk volumes. Hypothesis 3- Biological predictors of acute esophagitis can be used to identify patients at high risk of developing esophageal toxicity from radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophageal Sparing Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for Locally-Advanced Thoracic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective phase I study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation therapy given in an accelerated fashion (2 Gy/fraction, 6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be utilized to spare the esophagus. All patients on the dose escalation study will participate in additional assessments evaluating esophageal motion and esophageal toxicity from radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
