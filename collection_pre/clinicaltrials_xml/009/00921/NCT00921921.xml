	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 'COPD' is a chronic disease, which means that it cannot be cured, but that inhalers and tablets can be used to control the symptoms. In COPD, the airways become inflamed which can cause coughing and make the airways tighten. This 'inflammation' is the root of the problem in COPD. The airways of the lung start in the windpipe and branch like the branches of a tree, getting smaller and smaller. In COPD the inflammation is deep in the lungs, out to the very small airways. Different inhalers make the medicines into different sized particles. Most steroid inhalers used for COPD make the medicine into particles which are too big to get into the very small airways ('coarse particles'). Other inhalers make a mist, with much smaller particles ('fine particles'). These are as small as the smallest airways in the lungs. Doctors have recently found a way to measure the inflammation in the small airways that are affected in COPD. The investigators want to find out if taking one of these 'fine-particle' steroid inhalers can treat that inflammation.</brief_summary>
