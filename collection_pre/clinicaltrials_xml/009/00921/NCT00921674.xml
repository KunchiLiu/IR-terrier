	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability profile (rate and amount of absorption into the bloodstream) of a test formulation of Ivermectin solution 1 mg/ml with a marketed reference formulation of Ivermectin 3 mg tablets when taken after a standard meal. The study is designed in accordance with the EU Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 2001.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ivermectin Solution Bioequivalence Study - With Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine (i.e. a medicine used to eliminate parasitic worms) for oral administration, and is approved in the US and some other countries in a tablet form. A new liquid formulation of ivermectin has been developed to facilitate dosing. This is a single dose, randomised, crossover study in healthy adult male and female volunteers, with doses taken 20 minutes after a standard breakfast. Doses will be separated by washout period of at least 14 days. Twenty-one blood samples will be taken from each volunteer over 144 hours in each period. Concentrations of Ivermectin in plasma will be measured using a validated chromatographic assay (LC-MS/MS). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and bioequivalence on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.</detailed_description>
