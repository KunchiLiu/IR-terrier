	<brief_title>Safety Study to Evaluate KW-2450 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, sequential, ascending, multi-dose, Phase 1 study will enroll up to 72 subjects with previously treated advanced solid tumor. Subjects at each dose level will receive KW-2450 orally, once daily for 28 days followed by a 1-week observation period. After completing the 1 week observation period, all subjects will receive KW-2450 on a continuous daily schedule. All doses of KW-2450 will be administered to subjects under overnight fasting conditions. Dose escalation may proceed once &gt;= 3 subjects have completed the Day 29 blood sample to evaluate glucose. The safety of each dose level will be established prior to enrollment of subjects in the next dose level. Dose escalation will proceed sequentially with accelerated titration. Once the criteria for completing the accelerated titration are reached, dose escalation will follow a modified Fibonacci schedule. Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level. Enrollment will proceed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established or the highest dose level (800 mg/day) has been reached.</detailed_description>

Subjects must be recovered from the effects of any prior antineoplastic therapy. The ongoing adverse events due to these therapies must be &lt;=Grade 1 prior to entering the study. At least 5 halflives should have elapsed for any investigational agents prior to the administration of study medication 10.

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use effective contraception, defined as oral contraceptives, double barrier method (condom plus spermicide or diaphragm) or abstain from sexual intercourse during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of KW2450. WOCBP include females who have experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months) 13. Male subjects must be willing to use an appropriate method of contraception (e.g., condoms) or abstain from sexual intercourse and inform any sexual partners that they must also use a reliable method of contraception (e.g., birth control pills) during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of KW2450 14. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of receiving study medication. 1. Women who are pregnant or lactating 2. Known diabetes defined as: random serum glucose concentration of &gt; 200 mg/dL fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of &gt; 126 mg/dL 2hour post load serum glucose concentration of &gt; 200 mg/dL following an oral glucose tolerance test the need for an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin in order to keep the serum glucose below the above levels; or any diabetic complication (cataract, retinopathy, nephropathy, etc.). 3. Subjects showing clinical evidence or with a history of cataract(s) or retinopathy 4. Abnormal free T4 values. Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) values at enrollment will be further evaluated by free T4.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: Ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics; A serious or nonhealing active wound, ulcer, or bone fracture; Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg, found on two consecutive measurements separated by a 1week period despite treatment with two antihypertensive agents) 7.
