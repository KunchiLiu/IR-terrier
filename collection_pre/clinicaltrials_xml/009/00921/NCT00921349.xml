	<brief_summary>The value of banding ligation plus beta blocker in the prophylaxis of first episodes of variceal bleeding has not yet been evaluated. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of banding ligation plus nadolol versus nadolol in the prophylaxis of first bleeding in cirrhotic patients with high-risk esophageal varices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Ligation Plus Nadolol Versus Nadolol Alone in the Prophylaxis of First Variceal Bleeding in Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has replaced EIS as the endoscopic treatment of choice for management of bleeding esophageal varices. The advantages of EVL include requiring fewer treatment sessions to achieve variceal obliteration, lower rebleeding rates and fewer complications (5-9). Controlled studies that compared EVL with beta-blocker in the prevention of first variceal bleeding suggested that EVL was at least equal to beta-blockers in the prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding. However, portal pressure may be elevated after repeated EVL. Hence the combination of nadolol and EVL is a reasonable approach to prevent the first episode of variceal bleeding.</detailed_description>
