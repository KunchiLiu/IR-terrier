	<brief_summary>Chronic viral infections induce oxidative stress that can cause a number of concomitant diseases, e.g. cardio-vascular diseases or metabolic disorders. Therefore, a sufficient treatment of oxidative stress may be of benefit for the patient to prevent further diseases. Shingles (herpes zoster infection) have been successfully treated with antioxidative substances like high-dose vitamin C for ages. Not only the acute symptoms can be diminished by high-dose vitamin C. Even long-term sequelae, like painful post-herpetic neuropathy, may be mitigated or even fully avoided.</brief_summary>
