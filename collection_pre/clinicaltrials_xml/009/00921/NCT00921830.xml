	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of 3 Formulations of Ibuprofen Suppositories</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ibuprofen is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in adults and children. Two ibuprofen suppository formulations have been developed for pediatric use to facilitate dosing in younger age groups. This is a single-dose, balanced, randomised, three-period crossover study in healthy male and female adult volunteers. Each volunteer will receive a single dose of 50 mg ibuprofen as a suppository, a single dose of 200 mg ibuprofen as a suppository and a single oral dose of 200 mg ibuprofen (tablet). There will be 14 blood samples taken over 12 hours in each study period. Concentrations in plasma of ibuprofen and its S and R enantiomers will be measured using a validated chromatographic method. Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and bioavailability on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.</detailed_description>
