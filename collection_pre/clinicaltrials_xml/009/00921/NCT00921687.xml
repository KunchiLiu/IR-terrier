	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as kidney damage for greater than 3 months or a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1.73m2 for greater than 3 months. Patients with CKD are at high risk for development of cardiovascular disease and metabolic complications. Guidelines for the care of patients with CKD have been developed by the National Kidney Foundation. Despite the wide availability of these guidelines, adherence is low. The goal of the current study is to evaluate whether a multifactorial intervention, including a CKD registry, will improve CKD guideline adherence. The hypothesis is that providers exposed to a multifactorial clinical intervention including education, academic detailing, and a CKD registry will be more likely to adhere to CKD guidelines than those only exposed to education.</brief_summary>
