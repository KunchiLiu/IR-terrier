	<brief_summary>Surgical options for managing hindfoot arthritis include: joint fusion, total ankle joint replacement or osteotomies (realignment) of bones. Fusion of arthritic hindfoot joints has been the accepted method of managing hindfoot arthritis for over a century. Recently, total ankle replacement has evolved as a treatment option for patients with end stage ankle arthritis. A comparison of gait for patients before and after hindfoot fusion or total ankle replacement will give further information about the outcome of this treatment. The principal aim of this project is to assess the effect of total ankle replacement or hindfoot fusion on gait. We are also interested in the outcome of the surgery and its effect on your symptoms (eg. pain and mobility). The results of this study will aid researchers in assessing this new treatment modality. Your involvement in this study is critical for the researchers to further analyze this new form of treatment and your time and involvement is appreciated.</brief_summary>
