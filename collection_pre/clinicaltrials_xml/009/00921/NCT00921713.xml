	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test the efficacy in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of an Oncology Nurse Care Management (ONCM) program to support cancer patients early in their course. The ONCM program will be compared with an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) program that will provide education materials and treatment resources for patients. Efficacy will be measured by differences over time in participant-reported Quality of Life, Symptoms and Emotional Distress, and Quality of Care between patients receiving ONCM versus EUC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall Goal: Our primary goal is to assess the impact on quality of life, quality of care, and other outcomes of two programs designed to support patients newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. The Oncology Nurse Care Management (ONCM) and Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) interventions will be implemented and evaluated among enrollees of Group Health. Specific Aims: A.1. To develop a robust early cancer notification system based on automated data to facilitate intervention shortly after cancer diagnosis. A.2. To implement an Oncology Nurse Care Management program that addresses patient questions, symptoms, psychosocial needs, and facilitates timely, coordinated care. A.3. To compare the impact of the Oncology Nurse Care Manager Program with Enhanced Usual Care in Group Health cancer patients using a randomized clinical trial design. Our two primary outcomes are quality of life and patients' perspectives of quality of care. As secondary outcomes, we will evaluate the impact of the intervention on psychosocial distress and depression.</detailed_description>
