	<brief_summary>Chemoembolization (TACE) is used in the majority of advanced hepatocellular carcinomas. Randomized clinical trials indicated that TACE improves overall survival in patients with good liver function (Child-pugh A or B). However, the shortcoming of TACE is obvious: hypoxia induced neoangiogenesis after blockage of blood supply of the tumor; repeat TACE deteriorates liver cirrhosis due to toxicity of chemotherapeutic agent to the parenchyma liver. Thalidomide has been reported to have antiangiogenic and antimetastatic effects. The objectives of adjuvant therapy with thalidomide for chemoembolization is to evaluate overall survival and time to progression.</brief_summary>
