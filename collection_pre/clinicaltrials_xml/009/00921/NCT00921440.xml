	<brief_summary>The investigators' rationale was to evaluate whether a 64-slice CT scanner allows accurate measurement of computed tomographic changes in coronary artery flow profiles and whether CT flow measurements are suitable for classifying the significance and hemodynamic relevance of a stenosis and thereby supplement as a functional parameter for morphological stenosis analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA) and Coronary Flow in Stenosis Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 50 patients prospectively underwent computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in a multidetector CT scanner (Brilliance 64, Philips) Â± 1 day before or after invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Immediately thereafter, 2 radiologists reviewed the imaging data to detect any vessel segments with morphology poorly evaluable by CTCA. A locally constant cyclical measurement was acquired in these coronary arteries in breath-hold technique during the passage of a 50ml bolus of contrast media. For analysis, time-density curves of the bolus passage were registered in the coronary artery and the aorta (internal reference), the up-slopes were determined and correlated with each other. The results were compared with the ICA findings.</detailed_description>
