	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients with kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether a link exists between the effectiveness of therapy with sunitinib malate and development of blood biomarkers, specifically the angiogenic factors VEGF and interleukin-8 (IL-8), in patients with kidney cancer. Secondary - To evaluate the link between the time to progression and the development of VEGF and IL-6 CXCL7 and CXCK5 blood levels in these patients. - To evaluate the link between VEGF and IL-6 CXCL7 and CXCK5 blood levels and disease-free survival of these patients after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. - To evaluate the link between VEGF and IL-6 CXCL7 and CXCK5 blood levels and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected at baseline and then every 6 weeks for pharmacokinetic analysis.</detailed_description>
