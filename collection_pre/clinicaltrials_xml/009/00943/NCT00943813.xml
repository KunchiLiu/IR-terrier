	<brief_summary>At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center the investigators want to provide the best care to their patients. One way to do this is to evaluate the ways that doctors communicate with patients. To this end, the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences runs a Communication Skills Training and Research Laboratory. One goal of this laboratory is to evaluate doctor-patient communication and provide training in how to improve the quality of this communication. Invitation to participate in this pilot project does not mean that a problem with communication has been identified in your doctor's practice. Rather, it is because your doctor and the fellow working with your doctor have agreed to cooperate with us as the investigators develop strategies to train physicians, nurses and other clinical personnel to communicate with cancer patients in as effective and sensitive a manner as possible.</brief_summary>
