	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immune response (body's defense against disease) to an experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 virus. This study will help determine how and when the H1N1 flu shot should be given with the seasonal flu shot to make it most effective. The 650 participants will be divided into the following age groups: infants from 6 months-36 months old, children 36 months-9 years old, and adolescents 10-17 years old. Each age group will have 200 children. There are 4 treatment groups in each age level. Study procedures include: medical history, targeted physical exam based on history, maintaining a memory aid, and blood sample collection. Participants will be involved in the study for about 8 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Data from several cohorts in different age groups that received licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new virus. In addition, adults are more likely to have measurable levels of serum hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or neutralizing antibody than are children. These data indicate the need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1 strain and suggest that different vaccine strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for adjuvant) may be appropriate for persons in different age groups. If the novel influenza H1N1 2009 virus continues to circulate, it is possible that it will co-circulate with the non-pandemic seasonal influenza strains. In this situation, it might be beneficial to co-administer an H1N1 vaccine concurrent with the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. This protocol will explore if vaccination with the 2009-2010 licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) has an effect on antibody response to the novel influenza H1N1 2009 virus. This protocol will also examine if receiving the H1N1 vaccine either concurrent with, prior to, or following the seasonal influenza vaccine affects the antibody response to the seasonal influenza vaccine. A randomized Phase II study in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents. This study is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine when given concurrent with seasonal TIV, or sequentially with (before or after) seasonal influenza vaccine. Primary objectives are: safety, to assess the safety of the unadjuvanted, inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered either concurrent with, prior to, or following licensed seasonal influenza vaccination; and immunogenicity, to assess the effect of TIV administration on antibody response to unadjuvanted, inactivated H1N1 vaccine as assessed by HAI, stratified by age of recipient. The secondary objective is: immunogenicity, to assess the effect of H1N1 vaccine administration on antibody response to TIV as assessed by HAI, stratified by age of recipient. Subjects will be randomized into 4 groups, stratified by age (150 subjects per group with 50 subjects per age stratum: greater than or equal to 6-&lt;36 months, greater than or equal to 36 months-9 years, and 10-17 years), to receive two 15 mcg doses of inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine at Days 0 and 21 followed by TIV on Day 42 (Group 1), two 15 mcg doses of H1N1 vaccine of which the first dose is administered concurrently with TIV (Group 2), two 15 mcg doses of H1N1 vaccine of which the second dose is administered concurrently with TIV (Group 3), or TIV administered on Day 0 followed by two 15 mcg doses of H1N1 vaccine on Days 21 and 42 (Group 4). Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events for 21 days following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those who do not receive the second dose), serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical conditions for 8 months post first vaccination (Day 201 for Groups 2 and 3 or Day 222 for Groups 1 and 4), and reactogenicity to the vaccines for 8 days following each vaccination (Day 0-7). Immunogenicity testing will include HAI and neutralizing antibody testing prior to vaccination, on the day of each vaccination (Days 0, 21 and 42) and 21 days following the third vaccine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Are males or nonpregnant females aged 6 months to 17 years, inclusive. All subjects 6 months to 9 years must be "primed". Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice adequate contraception that may include, but is not limited to, abstinence, barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragms, spermicides, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods during the study for at least 30 days following the last vaccination. The subject must be in good health, as determined by axillary (&lt;10 years of age) or oral temperature (axillary temperature &lt;100 degrees Fahrenheit or oral temperature &lt;101 degrees Fahrenheit), medical history, and targeted physical examination based on medical history. Subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must be willing and able to comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. Subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, and subject may provide written assent as appropriate.

Have an active neoplastic disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy. Have long term use of glucocorticoids including oral, parenteral or highdose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the preceding 6 months.
