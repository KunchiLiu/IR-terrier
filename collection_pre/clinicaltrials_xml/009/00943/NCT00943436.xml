	<detailed_description>Obesity is a consequence of positive energy balance, in which more energy is consumed than expended. It is hypothesized that regular amounts of physical activity may be important in helping individuals more accurately regulate energy balance. More research is needed to understand the impact of a physically active lifestyle on energy regulation capabilities Therefore, this study looks at sedentary college aged males compared to active college aged males when looking at two different sessions of energy expenditure, one exercise session and one resting session, and their energy and macronutrient intake after these sessions. The sessions will take place in the morning where each participant will exercise or rest and then be allowed to eat from a buffet ad libitum, where acute energy and macronutrient intake will be assessed. The following hypotheses are proposed: - Individuals who regularly engage in physical activity will more accurately respond to an energy deficit caused by an acute period of physical activity by increasing intake at a subsequent meal. - Individuals who do not regularly engage in physical activity (sedentary individuals) will be less sensitive to accurately regulate energy balance and will not respond to an energy deficit caused by a period of acute physical activity.</detailed_description>
