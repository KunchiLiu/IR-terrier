	<brief_summary>Current treatment protocol for pediatric femoral shaft fractures is immediate spica casting for patients 6 years and younger and for patients over 6 years and older is percutaneous or open placement of titanium elastic intramedullary nails. The investigators would like to evaluate the current treatment protocol by comparing those patients 6 years and younger treated with closed reduction and spica casting to those 6 years and younger treated with percutaneous pinned with titanium elastic intramedullary nails or submuscular plating. The investigators will be comparing their post-operative functional level, pain management, impact on family and complications through chart and x-ray reviews. The goal is to improve patient care pre and post-operatively for those who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture 6 years old and younger and increase the knowledge of those residents/physicians who care for this patient population.</brief_summary>
