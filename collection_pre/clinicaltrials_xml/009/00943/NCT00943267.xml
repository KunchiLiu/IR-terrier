	<brief_summary>Recombinant human Activated Protein C (rhAPC) has been shown to reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis. The biological effects of APC are pleiotropic, and can be roughly divided in anticoagulant and cytoprotective effects. Lung infection and inflammation are associated with reduced bronchoalveolar levels of endogenous APC. Recent evidence derived from animal studies indicates that local administration of rAPC into the lungs exerts local anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects. In this study we propose to study the potential of locally administered APC, within a lung subsegment, to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced lung inflammation and coagulation in humans.</brief_summary>
