	<brief_summary>To compare participation rates in screening for Barrett's Esophagus (BE) using sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), unsedated transnasal endoscopy and capsule endoscopy in a population based cohort. An age and gender stratified random sample of 300 patients from a previously defined (in terms of the presence or absence of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux using a validated questionnaire) population based cohort from Olmsted County11, 12 using the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), who have not undergone endoscopy, will be randomized to undergo screening using capsule endoscopy OR transnasal endoscopy OR conventional sedated endoscopy. The investigators will compare participation rates in the three arms. To identify factors associated with non-participation in population screening for BE. The investigators will compare demographic and clinical factors in participants and non-participants, to help predict non-participation using data from prior surveys (data has been collected on patient demographics, bowel and reflux symptoms, employment, education, somatization behavior, psychological profiles using the validated Gastroesophageal Reflux questionnaire [GERQ] and the Bowel Disease Questionnaire [BDQ]) which have been completed by all targeted subjects. This preliminary will allow us to identify barriers to screening and develop interventions to increase participation in future larger studies.</brief_summary>
