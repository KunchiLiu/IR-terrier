	<brief_summary>The researchers plan to test the following hypothesis: A good level of glucose control in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is dependent on two levels of feedback from the body: 1. the transport of insulin through small blood vessels: suggesting that hypoglycemia leads to increased insulin sensitivity which then causes recurrent hypoglycemia; 2. the endocrine level, defined as insulin-glucose interaction and hormonal counter-regulation. The researchers plan to investigate the relationships between hypoglycemia, insulin transport, and counter-regulation. This study will ultimately lead to a better understanding of risk for recurrent hypoglycemia.</brief_summary>
