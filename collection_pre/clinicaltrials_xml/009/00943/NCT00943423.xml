	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A PET scan may help doctors learn how the cancer responded to combination chemotherapy and whether radiation therapy is also required. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving a PET scan to see how well it works in deciding whether patients who have received combination chemotherapy for stage IA or stage IIA Hodgkin lymphoma also need radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Scan in Planning Treatment in Patients Undergoing Combination Chemotherapy For Stage IA or Stage IIA Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether patients with stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphoma who have a negative fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging after 3 courses of chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) require consolidation radiotherapy (to areas of previous involvement) in order to delay or prevent disease progression. OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, bleomycin sulfate IV, vinblastine IV, and dacarbazine IV (ABVD) on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses. On day 15 of the third course of chemotherapy, patients undergo a CT scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with nonresponsive disease or progressive disease are removed from the study. Patients who achieve response undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Patients with a positive FDG-PET scan receive an additional course of ABVD and undergo involved field radiotherapy. Patients with a negative FDG-PET scan are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Within 6 weeks after completion of course 3 of chemotherapy, patients undergo involved field radiotherapy to disease areas. - Arm II: Patients receive no further treatment. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
