	<brief_summary>The surgery stress relives systemic inflammatory response by hormones and adrenergic receptors. When the pro-inflammatory mediator is higher than anti-inflammatory response, the physiologic status is impaired and the patient is more susceptible an infection and cardiovascular collapse. The anesthesia can abolish or minimize the surgery stress, improved more safety to the patient. This study is a double blind controlled trial with 40 patients divided in two groups (EMLA and Dorsal Penile Nerve Block - DPNB) submitted a standard inhalator anesthesia and postectomy surgery by Plastbell®. The investigators will be observe heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial pressure, involuntary movements during the surgery and pain in the pos-operatory. With this study, the investigators can define what tactic (EMLA or DPNB) associated a general anesthesia is more effective to relive the pain when children are submitted a postectomy by Plastbell®.</brief_summary>
