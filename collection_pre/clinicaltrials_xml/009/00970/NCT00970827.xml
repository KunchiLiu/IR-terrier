	<brief_summary>Angioplasty is a commonly performed procedure for treating blockage of the blood vessels in the heart. Although this procedure is usually successful, it is often accompanied by a small degree of damage to the heart (i.e., small heart attack). The purpose of this study is to find out if inflating a blood pressure cuff on the arm or the leg at the time of angioplasty for several minutes has a beneficial effect. Patients will be assigned to one of three treatment groups: inflating blood pressure cuff on the arm, inflating blood pressure cuff on the leg and a control group.</brief_summary>
