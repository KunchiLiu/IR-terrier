	<brief_title>Exercise and Nerve Function in Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective for this application is to quantify the benefits of exercise on nerve function including proprioception, and investigate the relationship of these findings with improvements in epidermal and dermal innervation. In this pilot project, we will pursue 2 specific aims: 1) determine the effect of an exercise intervention on nerve function in people with diabetic neuropathy, and 2) assess changes in cutaneous innervation following participation in an exercise program.</detailed_description>
