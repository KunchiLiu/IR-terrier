	<brief_summary>The study examines the biochemistry underlying human olfaction in both normal and diseased states. The study aims are: 1. to determine the levels of cAMP in olfactory tissue from people with chronic rhinosinusitis and other nasal disorders. 2. to correlate preoperative olfactory function with cAMP levels from biopsied olfactory tissue. 3. to determine odorant and pheromone-mediated activation of cultured human olfactory sensory neurons using calcium imaging and 4. to determine odorant and pheromone-mediated activation of cultured human olfactory sensory neurons using "smell-chip" technology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Olfactory Dysfunction of Rhinosinusitis - Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)/Calcium Signaling Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject will be recruited from those scheduled to have endoscopic sinus surgery and similar procedures. This study uses the tissue that would normally be discarded during the surgical process. The tissue is cultured and frozen for purposes of the following testing: odor detection and signal transduction, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and odor detection, the role of cAMP in olfactory dysfunction, and pheromone detection. Only tissue that would normally be discarded during the course of the surgery will be used. The study does not interfere with or change any clinical care.</detailed_description>
