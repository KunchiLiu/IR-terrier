	<brief_title>Effect of Cinnamon Extract on Insulin Resistance in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance is a condition in which body cells do not fully respond to the action of insulin, a hormone that controls the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. As a result, blood sugar levels become abnormally high. Insulin resistance is common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study involves the administration of a nutritional supplement (cinnamon extract). The cinnamon extract like regular cinnamon powder comes from the bark of Cinnamon Cassae plant. It is believed that cinnamon may act in the same way as insulin and therefore could potentially improve insulin resistance and help to lower blood sugar (glucose) levels.</detailed_description>
