	<brief_summary>This study was conducted to determine and compare the safety and effectiveness of two neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium and vecuronium) at various doses in adults who are undergoing general elective surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia. Study participants received an intubating dose of a neuromuscular blocker (to enable insertion of a tube through the nose or mouth into the trachea to provide artificial ventilation). The intubating dose was followed by repeated bolus maintenance doses as needed, to maintain muscle relaxation. The time it takes to reach maximal effect of the neuromuscular blocker (onset time) after the intubating dose was measured and compared as the primary outcome.</brief_summary>
