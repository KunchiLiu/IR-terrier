	<brief_summary>Limited participation in health promotion activities is noted in people with diabetes, even though lifestyle changes have been found to be essential in decreasing the risk of complications of the disease. The purpose of this study is to gather preliminary data to assess the feasibility of an intense, customized health promotion program in people with diabetes, and to evaluate outcome measures following participation to determine effect size for future studies. Subjects with type 2 diabetes will participate in a 10-week health promotion program, at a frequency of 3-4 days per week. The intervention will include aerobic and strength training exercises with a schedule of progression, individual nutrition counseling, and diabetes health education sessions.</brief_summary>
