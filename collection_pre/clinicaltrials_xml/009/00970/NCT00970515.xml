	<brief_title>Laparoscopic or Conventional Mesh Repair of Incisional and Umbilical Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare immediate and long-term (24 months) results of laparoscopic and open mesh repair of incisional and umbilical hernia. Five hundred patients will be included in this randomized, multicentric trial. Hypotheses are that laparoscopic approach: 1- reduces immediate parietal complications without increasing intra abdominal septic complications 2- is less invasive and also reduces patients' hospital stay and recovery time; 3- has the same efficacy, than open approach.</detailed_description>
