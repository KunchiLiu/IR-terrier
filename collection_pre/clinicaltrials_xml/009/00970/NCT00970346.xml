	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by a mutation in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein. As a result mucus stagnation, obstruction and plugging take place in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, the biliary and pancreatic duct, and in the reproductive system. The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 3 days of daily dosing of OligoG CF-5/20 versus placebo in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
