	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the use of a drug called Thymoglobulin, combined with a delayed start of the anti-rejection drugs (10 days after liver transplant), compared to the current approach of starting anti-rejection drugs called calcineurin inhibitors or CNI's within 2 days after the liver transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Thymoglobulin to Protect Kidney Function After Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Strong anti-rejection drugs like tacrolimus or cyclosporine, are given to patients who have received transplants, to ensure that the patient's body does not reject the new organ. In some cases, while anti-rejection medications protect a newly transplanted liver, they can injure the patient's kidneys and cause them not to work as well as they should. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the best way to protect kidney function and to ensure that the newly transplanted liver is not rejected. This study will evaluate the use of a drug called Thymoglobulin, combined with a delayed start of the anti-rejection drugs (10 days after liver transplant), compared to the current approach of starting anti-rejection drugs called calcineurin inhibitors or CNI's within 2 days after the liver transplant.</detailed_description>
