	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to study whether preferences for the goals of care for 80 subjects with end-stage cancer are altered after viewing a video outlining the goals of care compared to their initial preferences after hearing a verbal description of the goals of care alone. Subjects will choose among three goals of care, life prolonging care, basic medical care, and comfort care.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Terminal, progressive cancer with poor prognosis whose treatment intent is palliative, based on the following definition: All patients with brain cancer, liver cancer, inoperable nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, or gallbladder cancer; OR Patients with the following cancers: metastatic colon cancer or stage III or IV nonsmall cell lung cancer; OR Patients with the following cancers, if firstline therapy has failed and limited response is expected to secondline therapy: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, melanoma, leukemia, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, sarcoma, lung cancer, myeloma, or lymphoma. The terms terminal, progressive, poor prognosis, palliative intent and limited response will be judged by the patient's oncologist (and not by the RSA or consenting professional). 2. Return patient visit (defined as a patient known to the oncologist from previous assessments and treatments, where the working and personal relationship has been established and not a new patient to the clinic). 3. English speaking. Only Englishspeaking patients will be included in our present study since English is the validated language of our study tools. 4. Given the sensitive nature of the study, clinicians will decide whether the patient is a potentially appropriate subject based on their knowledge of the patient. 5. Able to provide informed consent. 6. Age greater than or equal to 21. 1. MMSE &lt; 25. 2. Psychological state not appropriate for endoflife discussion as determined by the treating clinician.</criteria>
