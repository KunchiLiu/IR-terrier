Patients who are considered to be with agitation and appropriate candidates for treatment with intramuscular (IM) medication by the investigator or subinvestigator(s). The investigator or subinvestigator(s) believes that it is safe to administer IM olanzapine to the patients in consideration of safety, including the anticholinergic action of IM olanzapine. Patients who have a score of 1 or 2 on AgitationCalmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) before the first IM injection of investigational product. Patients whose Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score is less than or equal to 40 within last 1 year before informed consent. Patients with defect. Patients whose agitation continues more than 2 weeks before informed consent. Patients who were previously treated with antipsychotics and were considered by the investigator or subinvestigator(s) to be treatmentresistant to antipsychotics. Patients who were treated by oral olanzapine at a dose of more than 20 milligrams (mg) for more than 4 weeks but did not improve. Patient who have a history of participation in clozapine trials or treatment with clozapine. Patients who have comorbidity of mental retardation and personality disorder. Patients whose agitation is possibly due to brain lesions such as (but not limited to) head injury, stroke, brain breeding, and cerebral infection. Patients with substupor or stupor. One or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology. However, if the patient has had one or more seizures in the past with an identifiable etiology, and that etiology has been resolved, the patient may be entered. Patients who have a history of DSMIVTR substance (except caffeine and nicotine) abuse within the past 30 days or substance dependence within the past 6 months before informed consent. Or patients who have a history of using illegal drug. Patients whose agitation is caused by substance abuse or neurologic conditions, in the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator(s).

Patients with inadequately controlled diabetes, or patients whose treatment for diabetes has been changed within 4 weeks before the first IM injection of the investigational product. The investigator's discretion will supersede even if the patients do not meet the above criteria for concurrent diabetes. Patients who have received haloperidol decanoate fluphenazine decanoate, or fluphenazine enanthate within 8 weeks before the first IM injection of investigational product. Patients who have received risperidone longacting injection within 12 weeks before the first IM injection of investigational product. Patients who have a history of receiving injectable depot antipsychotics other than haloperidol decanoate, fluphenazine decanoate, fluphenazine enanthate and risperidone longacting injection. Patients who have received antipsychotics or other prohibited concomitant medicines within 2 hours before the first IM injection of investigational product. Patients who have received benzodiazepines within 4 hours before the first IM injection of investigational product.</criteria>
