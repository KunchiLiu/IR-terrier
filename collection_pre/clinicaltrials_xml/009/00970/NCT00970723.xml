	<brief_summary>Macular edema remains a major cause of vision impairment in diabetic patients. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Systemic factors seam to play a role in this pathogenesis, including high blood pressure. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of an intensified intervention on blood pressure and sleep apnea with that of conventional treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic macular edema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Blood Pressure and Sleep Apnea in Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes and macular edema involving the center of the macula in both eyes will be randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment in accordance with national guidelines or to receive intensive treatment, with a systematic screening for sleep apnea and /or uncontrolled high blood pressure, and intensified intervention on both anomalies if detected. The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients having a sustained 50% or more-decrease in retinal thickening at 1 year. Secondary outcomes will be the percentage of patients having a 2 ETDRS lines or more-increase in visual acuity at one year, number of ocular interventions in each group, prevalence of sleep apnea and uncontrolled high blood pressure in the intervention group.</detailed_description>
