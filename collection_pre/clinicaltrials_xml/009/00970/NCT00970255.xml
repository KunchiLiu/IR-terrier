	<brief_summary>Upper lingual frenulum have been implicated as a cause for pain during breastfeeding and latch problems. The investigators hypothesize that performing frenotomy of the frenulum may improve breastfeeding. The investigators will include breastfeeding infants with pain or latch problems in whom the lingual frenulum had been treated but breastfeeding problems were not resolved. The investigators plan to study the effect of frenotomy of the upper lingual frenulum on maternal pain (using pain score by visual analog scale) and/or latch score.</brief_summary>
