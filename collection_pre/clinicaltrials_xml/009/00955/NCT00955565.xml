	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the precision of computer-assisted navigation for hip screw implantation to conventional fixation without navigation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy of Navigation in Placement of Sacroiliac Screw</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment for sacroiliac dislocations and sacroiliac fractures is placement of two screws through the iliosacral joint into the sacral ala or the body of the S1 vertebra. Correct positioning is technically demanding. Screw displacement may reduce the strength of fixation and lead to neurological complications. Secondary objectives of the study are to compare the fluoroscopy time, complications and surgery duration between the treatments.</detailed_description>
