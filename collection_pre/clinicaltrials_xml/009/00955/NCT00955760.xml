	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: • Assess the effects of poly-specific cytochrome P450 and drug-transporter induction by repeated dose Rifampicin (600 mg/day) co-administration on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of Neramexane. Secondary Objectives: • To assess safety and tolerability of Neramexane single dose treatment alone and co-administration of a Neramexane single dose with a Rifampicin repeated dose treatment.</brief_summary>
