	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized strategy trial conducted among women who received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy for purposes of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV but do not otherwise meet criteria to initiate HAART for their own health. The study is designed to determine whether continuation of HAART after delivery or other pregnancy outcome reduces morbidity and mortality compared to discontinuation and re-initiation of HAART according to current standards of care.</brief_summary>
