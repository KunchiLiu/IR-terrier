	<brief_summary>The investigators want to determine if the benefits of weight loss outweigh the potential risk in a group of older adults. The investigators will test the hypothesis that changes in diet composition alone or in conjunction with weight loss will have a significant effect on fat stores, and as a result, improve cardiometabolic risk factors and functional status in adults 65 and older.</brief_summary>
