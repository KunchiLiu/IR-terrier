	<brief_title>Study of 6(S)-5-MTHF Among Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor-Resistant Outpatients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of two phases, each lasting a total of four weeks (8 weeks total), with visits at the DCRP every 10 days. If the subject is eligible, they will be asked to return two weeks later for a baseline visit, when they will be randomly assigned, like a flip of a coin, to one of three treatment groups: a) drug/drug, b) placebo/drug, c) placebo/placebo (a placebo is a pill that looks like a study drug but contains no active medication). They will have a greater than 50% chance of receiving active medication (Deplin) at some point in the 8 week study. Neither the subject nor the research staff will know which group the subject is in. All subjects will be asked to take the study medication in the morning, in addition to their ongoing SSRI treatment.</detailed_description>
