	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (CPB) work when given with or without cixutumumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is stage IV or has come back (recurrent). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Other types of monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, may find tumor cells and help kill them. It is not yet known whether giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with bevacizumab is more effective when given with or without cixutumumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Bevacizumab With or Without Cixutumumab in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival with the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, and +/- IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) in patients with advanced, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall survival and response rate of the above combination in patients with non-squamous, advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. To evaluate the toxicities of the above combination in patients with non-squamous advanced non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A (CPB): Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. ARM B (CPB+cixutumumab): Patients receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab as in Arm A. Patients also receive cixutumumab (IMC-A12) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with bevacizumab and cixutumumab may continue in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
