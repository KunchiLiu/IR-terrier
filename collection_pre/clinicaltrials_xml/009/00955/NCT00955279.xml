	<brief_summary>This study tests the safety and effectiveness of ustekinumab or golimumab compared to placebo (placebo looks like the drugs being studied, but has no active ingredients). The purpose of this research study is to determine if ustekinumab or golimumab is safe and to determine its effects (good and bad) on patients with chronic sarcoidosis with pulmonary and/or skin involvement. Patients with pulmonary involvement constitute the primary population for analysis, and patients with skin involvement constitute the secondary population; a patient may be in both populations. The study will be conducted at approximately 40 sites globally.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of Ustekinumab or Golimumab Administered Subcutaneously (SC) in Patients With Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ustekinumab is approved for dosing in patients with psoriasis and golimumab is approved for dosing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. This study will use either drug in patients with chronic sarcoidosis. Ustekinumab and golimumab are being tested to see if they may be useful in treating chronic sarcoidosis. This study will compare the effects (both good and bad) of ustekinumab and golimumab to those of placebo. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ustekinumab and golimumab (administered as individual treatments) in patients with chronic sarcoidosis with lung and/or skin involvement who still have symptoms even though receiving current therapy. About 180 patients will take part in the study. While in this study, patients may not take part in any other medical research studies. Ustekinumab and golimumab are not approved by the national health authorities for treatment of chronic sarcoidosis; therefore, they can only be used in a research setting to treat this condition. The screening phase of the study, where the doctor will determine if a patient is eligible for the study, will last 1 to 4 weeks. Patients are put into 1 of 3 groups and each group will get a different treatment. The results of the golimumab group and the ustekinumab group are compared to placebo. Patients will either receive ustekinumab, golimumab or placebo. Placebo looks like ustekinumab and golimumab and is given in the same way, by injection, but contains no active drug. Patients will receive study agent until Week 24 and will continue to be followed through Week 44 for assessment of safety and any other effects after discontinuation of therapy. The patient will continue to take all sarcoidosis medication(s) at current, stable dose for the first part of the study. If the patient remained on a stable steroid dose from Week 0 through Week 16 of the study, the study doctor will begin to taper (lower) the steroid dose. The steroid taper will continue through to the end of the Week 28 visit. The patient will continue to take their other sarcoidosis medication(s) at the same dose for the rest of the study. An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be responsible for reviewing the safety data for the study. Patients will be in the study for about 48 weeks. The end of the study is defined as the last visit of the last patient. A site-specific substudy is being implemented to collect serum and lung samples from patients who are currently enrolled in this study. A separate protocol is being implemented to collect lung fluid and serum samples from normal, healthy subjects to be used as comparators for similar samples obtained in the 1275148SCD2001 substudy. Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: ustekinumab (180 mg at Week 0, followed by 90 mg at Weeks 8, 16, and 24 with placebo at Weeks 4, 12, and 20), golimumab (200 mg at Week 0, followed by 100 mg at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24) or placebo (at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24) administered by SC injection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have sarcoidosis with onset date of &gt;=2 years prior to screening with at least 1 of the following: a. pulmonary sarcoidosis defined as 1) a diagnosis of sarcoidosis with evidence of lung parenchymal disease (Stage II, III or IV on chest radiograph), and 2) an FVC of &gt;=45% and &lt;=80% of predicted normal value at screening, and 3) an MRC dyspnea score of &gt;2 at screening, and 4) a 6 minute walk distance between 100 to 550 meters at screening, and 5) &lt;=15% absolute change in percentpredicted FVC at baseline relative to screening AND/OR b. skin sarcoidosis defined as 1) active chronic skin lesions for &gt;=3 months either on face or elsewhere on body that have not resolved on current systemic and/or local therapy, and 2) have either: a single lesion of &gt;=2 cm in longest dimension or multiple (3 or more) lesions with at least 1 lesion having a longest dimension of &gt;=1 cm, and 3) have an SPGA score &gt;=2 at screening have been receiving treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or 1 or more immunomodulators for &gt;=3month period immediately prior to screening on a stable dose of these medications for &gt;=4 weeks before screening Have a diagnosis of other significant respiratory disorder other than sarcoidosis that would complicate the evaluation of response to treatment Have a smoking history of &gt;=20 pack years Have used an investigational drug within 1 month prior to screening or within 5 halflives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer have received previous administration of a treatment with any other therapeutic agent targeted at reducing TNFalpha within 6 months or 5 halflives of the agent, whichever is longer, prior to screening Patients who have previously received biologic antiTNFalpha agents outside of the above period are allowed to enter the study Have previously used cyclophosphamide Have previously used or received local therapy (including local injections) within 3 months before the screening visit or used or received treatment with prescription topical creams within 1 month before the screening visit for treatment of sarcoidosis skin lesions Have used any therapeutic agent targeted at reducing IL12 and/or IL23, including but not limited to, ustekinumab and briakinumab within 6 months or 5 halflives of the agent, whichever is longer, prior to the screening visit have received natalizumab or agents that deplete or modulate the activity of B cells or T cells within 12 months of screening, or, if after receiving these agents, evidence is available at screening of persistent depletion of the targeted lymphocyte population have used any antibody (monoclonal or polyclonal) or antibodybased agents &lt;= 6 months or within 5 halflives of the biologic prior to the screening visit, whichever is longer</criteria>
