	<brief_summary>Patients who admit to using buprenorphine by the intravenous route will be randomized to either Subutex or Suboxone and be followed up for 3 months to determine if there is less injection with Suboxone than with Subutex based primarily on patient diaries. Patients randomized to Suboxone may continue to receive the product for a further 9 months at their request and will be monitored at 3 month intervals. Patients will receive a payment for the inconvenience of keeping a daily diary and to cover their travel expenses.</brief_summary>
