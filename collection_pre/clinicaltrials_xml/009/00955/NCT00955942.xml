	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Flaxseed may help protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of flaxseed supplement in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flaxseed Supplement in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the feasibility of dietary flaxseed (FS) supplementation in patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. - To collect toxicity and tolerability data on dietary FS supplementation during definitive chemoradiotherapy. Secondary - To validate urinary and serum markers of oxidative stress and FS lignan levels as surrogates of the bioavailability of FS in these patients. - To determine if a dose response to daily ingestion of 20 g or 40 g of FS can be observed in plasma lignan levels and urinary markers of oxidative stress. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients consume flaxseed muffins once or twice daily beginning on the first day of radiotherapy and continuing for up to 9-10 weeks. - Arm II: Patients consume placebo muffins once or twice daily beginning on the first day of radiotherapy and continuing for up to 9-10 weeks. Blood and urine samples are collected periodically for biomarker studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.</detailed_description>
