	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor over a shorter period of time may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of hypofractionated 3-dimensional radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated 3-Dimensional Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. ICORG 99-09</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the acute and long-term radio-induced toxicity (any organ) of hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - To assess the radiological tumor response rate at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy. - To assess the actuarial freedom from thoracic progression rate. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to combined lung volume at 25 Gy (≤ 30% vs &gt; 30%). Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. - Group 1: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 24 fractions (total of 72 Gy). - Group 2: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 22 fractions (total of 66 Gy). - Group 3: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 20 fractions (total of 60 Gy). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
