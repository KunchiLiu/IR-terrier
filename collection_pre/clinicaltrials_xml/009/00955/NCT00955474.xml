	<brief_title>Seroquel Alone Versus Seroquel With an SSRI for Depression With Psychotic Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is designed to investigate the non-inferiority of treatment of PsyD using monotherapy with quetiapine XR versus combination treatment using quetiapine XR and an SSRI (sertraline or citalopram or escitalopram) during the acute phase of treatment. The primary outcome measures will be the change rates of symptoms of depression (as measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D-17] and psychosis (as measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] Positive Symptoms Subscale). The secondary aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of quetiapine XR and SSRIs in patients with the diagnosis of PsyD. Metabolic factors including fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and fasting lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides) will be obtained at screen and at the 8-week endpoint of the study to assess the impact of treatment on the development of risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Measures of cognitive function (MGH Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire and RBANS) (Fava et al. 2006; Randolph et al. 1998) will be obtained at screen and the 8-week endpoint of the study to assess the impact of treatment on cognitive function.</detailed_description>
