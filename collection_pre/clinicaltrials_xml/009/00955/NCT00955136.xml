	<brief_title>Utilization of Diagnostic Ultrasound in the Detection and Therapy of Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-clinical studies have indicated that, during a continuous infusion of intravenous perfluorocarbon-containing microbubbles, the ultrasonic power delivered from a diagnostic ultrasound transducer is capable of restoring microcirculatory flow and improving epicardial recanalization rates following acute coronary thrombotic occlusions. Since both diagnostic ultrasound and intravenous infusions of microbubbles are a Class I indication to assess regional and global left ventricular function and risk area in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), this pilot study will examine whether diagnostic assessments of left ventricular function and risk area size impacts epicardial recanalization rates and infarct size in STEMI. The aim of this study is to test whether guided high mechanical index impulses from a diagnostic transducer during a continuous infusion of intravenous microbubbles are capable of improving microvascular recanalization and epicardial recanalization rates in STEMI, as assessed by coronary angiography, and recovery of regional microvascular perfusion and function in the post-infarction period.</detailed_description>
