	<brief_summary>Approximately 30% of people aged 65 years and older experience breathlessness (perceived respiratory difficulty) during daily activity. The main causes of increased breathlessness in the healthy elderly are poorly understood and are the main focus of the proposed study. Some possible contributing factors include abnormalities in the control and/or mechanics of breathing. To evaluate these possible contributory factors, the investigators will compare ventilatory and perceptual responses to: 1) exercise, 2) increased levels of inspired carbon dioxide, and 3) reduced levels of inspired oxygen under strictly-controlled experimental conditions where the investigators increase or decrease breathing requirements by altering dietary salt intake in healthy 40-80 year old men and women. Exercise and rebreathing tests will be performed at baseline and at the end of each 3 day treatment period. Breathlessness intensity will be measured and compared at a standardized work rate, ventilation or end-tidal PCO2 during these tests.</brief_summary>
