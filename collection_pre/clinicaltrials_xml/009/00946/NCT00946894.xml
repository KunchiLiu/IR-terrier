	<brief_summary>The aim of this three-arm randomized study was to evaluate results of different thyroid resection modes among patients with bilateral multinodular non-toxic goiter, with special emphasis put on recurrence rate and morbidity rate, in a 5-year follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes of Different Thyroid Resections for Multinodular Non-toxic Goiter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The extent of thyroid resection in bilateral multinodular non-toxic goiter remains controversial. Surgeons still continue to debate whether the potential benefits of total thyroidectomy outweigh the potential complications. Most low-volume surgeons avoid to perform total thyroidectomy owing to the possible complications such as permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and permanent hypoparathyroidism. On the other hand, the increasing number of total thyroidectomies are currently performed in high-volume endocrine surgery units, and the indication for this procedure include thyroid cancer, Graves disease and multinodular goiter. Recently there has been increasing acceptance for performing total thyroidectomy for bilateral multinodular non-toxic goiter as it removes the disease process completely, lowers local recurrence rate and avoids the substantial risk of reoperative surgery, and involves only a minimal risk of morbidity. This common perception is based largely on single-institution retrospective data, a few multi-institutional retrospective experiences, and only a few prospective randomized studies comparing the outcomes of total vs. subtotal thyroidectomy.</detailed_description>
