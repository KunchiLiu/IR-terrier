	<brief_summary>Treatment of pericarditis largely remains empirical due to the relative lack of randomized controlled trials. Nevertheless, some recommendations have been formulated to guide management and follow-up of acute pericarditis. Aspirin or an NSAID at medium to high dosages is the mainstay of treatment. Optimal length of treatment is not established. PERICARDITE is a French multicentric placebo controlled double blind randomized trial assessing efficacy of a brief treatment based on Aspirin (4 days) versus a longer treatment (21days) in treating a first episode of probably idiopathic acute pericarditis. It is a non inferiority trial. Exclusion criteria are: diseases known to cause pericarditis: (recent myocardial infarction, autoimmune disease, postpericardiotomy syndromes, connective tissue disease, tuberculosis, neoplastic disease). Primary endpoint is: 30 days recovery defined as the normalization of all clinical and paraclinical initial abnormalities. Secondary endpoint is: 6-month recurrence.</brief_summary>
