	<brief_title>ETV Versus Shunt Surgery in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normal pressure Hydrocephalus is a reversible disorder of cognition and gait disorder.Currently the shunting of CSF is the recommended treatment of these patients. Even though shunts are known to be beneficial treatment of Hydrocephalus they often need treatment or revision for infection or malfunction.
