	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies carboplatin and paclitaxel to compare how well they work with or without bevacizumab and/or cetuximab in treating patients with stage IV or non-small cell lung cancer that has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumor needs to grow. Cetuximab may also stop cancer cells from growing by binding and interfering with a protein on the surface of the tumor cell that is needed for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and paclitaxel are more effective with or without bevacizumab and/or cetuximab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0819: Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab and/or Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Stage IV or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival (OS) in the entire study population. II. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) by institutional review of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare OS and PFS by centralized review in EGFR FISH-positive patients. II. To compare PFS by centralized image review and by institutional review in the entire study population. III. To compare the response rate (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) in a subset of patients with measurable disease in EGFR FISH-positive patient and the entire study population. IV. To assess the toxicities of these treatment regimens. V. To prospectively test EGFR FISH as a predictive marker for the selection of patients for cetuximab plus chemotherapy. III. To evaluate the role of V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations in terms of cetuximab efficacy. IV. To compare the results of EGFR FISH with KRAS mutations, EGFR mutations, EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC), and other purported EGFR-related biomarkers. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare PFS in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an IHC score &gt; 200 treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (if appropriate) with or without cetuximab. II. To compare OS in patients with advanced NSCLC with an IHC score &gt; 200 treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (if appropriate) with or without cetuximab. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes with or without bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses, patients receiving bevacizumab may continue to receive bevacizumab (as above) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab as in Arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses, patients may continue to receive cetuximab with or without bevacizumab (as above) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

patients with additional lesions in an ipsilateral nonprimary lobe without M1a or M1b disease will not be considered to have stage IV disease and are not eligible Patients must have a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to evaluate for central nervous system (CNS) disease within 42 days prior to registration; patient must not have brain metastases unless: (1) metastases have been treated and have remained controlled for at least two weeks following treatment, AND (2) patient has no residual neurological dysfunction off corticosteroids for at least 1 day Patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable disease documented by CT or MRI; the CT from a combined positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be used to document only nonmeasurable disease unless it is of diagnostic quality; measurable disease must be assessed within 28 days prior to registration;
