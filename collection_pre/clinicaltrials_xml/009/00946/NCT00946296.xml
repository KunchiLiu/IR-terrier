	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief course of SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide) administered preoperatively provides any benefit in the surgical management of patients undergoing thyroidectomy as definitive management of their Graves Disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of SSKI Pre-Treatment on Blood Loss in Thyroidectomy for Graves Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically Potassium Iodide was given to patients for 1 week prior to thyroidectomy. This common practice was used to decrease thyroid function and prevent thyroid storm during the thyroidectomy. However, in modern practice, nearly all patients presenting for surgical management have been made euthyroid through the use of medications such as propylthiouracil. Despite this potassium iodine continues to be administered with the presumption that it decreases the friability of the gland making surgery easier, with less blood loss. The outcomes to be measured in this surgery are operative time, operative complications and blood loss.</detailed_description>
