	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, two-arm, open-label expansion phase study is to collect preliminary efficacy data of panobinostat at the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) level in combination with azacytidine (5-Aza) versus an active control arm 5-Aza alone. This randomized phase II part allows also collecting safety data of panobinostat in combination with 5-Aza in comparison to single-agent 5-aza.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase l: Patients with cytopathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML according to WHO criteria, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia who are eligible for Vidaza treatment ECOG performance status greater less than or equal to 2 Phase ll: Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who are candidates for treatment with 5Aza and present with one of the following: intermediate2 or highrisk myelodysplastic syndromes according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). OR AML with multilineage dysplasia and maximum of 30% blasts (former RAEBT according to FAB) OR chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) Patients must have the following laboratory values unless elevations are considered due to MDS or leukemia: AST/SGOT and/or ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x ULN; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN; serum bilirubin (total and direct) ≤ 2 x ULN; electrolyte panel within normal ranges (WNL) for the institution. Phase l: Prior treatment with deacetylase inhibitors Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent Phase ll: Planned hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (HSCT) Patients with therapyrelated MDS Patients with therapyrelated AML and/or relapsed/refractory AML Patients with impaired cardiac function including any of the following: Complete left bundle branch block or use of a permanent cardiac pacemaker, congenital long QT syndrome, history or presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, clinically significant resting bradycardia (&lt;50 beats per minute), QTcF &gt; 460 ms on screening ECG, or right bundle branch block + left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block) Presence of unstable atrial fibrillation (ventricular response rate &gt;100 bpm). Patients with stable atrial fibrillation are eligible provided they do not meet the other cardiac exclusion criteria Previous history of angina pectoris or acute MI within 6 months Screening LVEF &lt;45% by echocardiography or MUGA Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension or history of poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen). Any of concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study. For example: Uncontrolled diabetes Active or uncontrolled infection Uncontrolled hypothyroidism Acute or chronic liver or renal disease Patient has evidence of clinically significant mucosal or internal bleeding Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
