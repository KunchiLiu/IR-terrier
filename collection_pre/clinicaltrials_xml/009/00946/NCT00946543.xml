	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the best dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To test the feasibility of delivering hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvic nodes of patients with prostate cancer. - To determine the optimal dose level of this treatment regimen to be used in future studies. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to small bowel total volume (low small bowel volume &lt; 450 cc vs high small bowel volume ≥ 450 cc). Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvis for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
