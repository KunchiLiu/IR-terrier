	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of timed exposure to bright light for the treatment of disturbed nighttime sleep and daytime wake in community-dwelling dementia patients and their caregivers, and to determine if there are genetic relationships between memory problems and sleep problems</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Efficacy: Up to 4 weeks of morning bright light exposure will be more efficacious than morning dim light in consolidating nighttime sleep as assessed by actigraphy. 2. Predictors of response: We expect the primary predictor of treatment response will be initial MMSE score. Secondary predictors include baseline sleep/wake and circadian parameters and age. 3. Effectiveness: Bright light treatment will be more effective than dim light in improving quality of life. 4. An understanding of some of the genetic markers of memory and/or sleep problems.</detailed_description>
