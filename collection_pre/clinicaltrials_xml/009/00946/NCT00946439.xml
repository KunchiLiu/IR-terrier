	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate the effects of adding a wheel assisted running training (WART) to a conventional mixed physical activity training (CT) program on walking and gross motor function in trained children with cerebral palsy (CP). Method entails recruiting thirty children with CP (16 females, 14 males), with mean (SD) age 11.8 (3.5) and training experience 3.4 (3.5), years were assigned to either WART or CT groups. The energy Expenditure Index (EEI), the Gross Motor Function Measure 66 (GMFM), self-selected and fast walking velocity (SSV and FV, respectively), and cadence are administered by a trained physical therapist. The intervention period is six months, with two sessions per week.</brief_summary>
