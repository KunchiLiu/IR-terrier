	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide together with total-body irradiation and rituximab works in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are undergoing an allogeneic (donor) bone marrow transplant. The type of bone marrow transplant is a less intensive or "mini" transplant using a relative as the bone marrow donor. The donated bone marrow stem cells may replace the patient's immune system cells and help destroy any remaining cancer (graft-versus-tumor effect). Patients undergoing this type of transplant often have more than one relative who could be a donor. The trial is also studying a new way of choosing amongst possible donors which might improve how the rituximab works.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized Donor Selection, Nonmyeloablative BMT for B-cell Lymphomas With Post-transplantation Cy and Rituximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II for relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies builds on the platform of nonmyeloablative, related-donor, HLA-matched or HLA-haploidentical BMT with post-transplantation high-dose cyclosphosphamide administered for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection. Rituximab is added to the transplant regimen with the goal of augmenting anti-tumor activity. In patients with B-cell lymphomas, specific polymorphisms in the immunoglobulin Fc receptor have been associated with greater sensitivity to rituximab or rituximab-based therapies, translating in some series into higher response rates and improved progression-free survival. This raises the possibility of selecting donors who carry this permissive polymorphism. This trial identifies and selects donors who have the favorable polymorphism at FcgammaR3A-158, thereby potentially conferring greater sensitivity to rituximab in the host after BMT.</detailed_description>
