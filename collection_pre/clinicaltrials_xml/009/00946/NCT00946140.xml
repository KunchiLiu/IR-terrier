	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop new image analysis method using Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) for ovarian cancer. MRI is not currently part of the standard care for ovarian cancer. In this method, a contrast agent is used to make ovarian cancer visible during imaging.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Ovarian Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with measurable disease with evidence of at least one unidimensionally measurable tumor (&gt; 1 cm) by CT or MRI scan according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) that the tumor has not been initially treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Patients who will start treatment with bevacizumab combined with or without cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days from signing consent. Patients treated on an approved IRB therapeutic protocol for recurrent ovarian cancer with bevacizumab are eligible. Patients with histologically confirmed ovarian epithelial cancer including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube adenocarcinoma. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to the study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception. Patients who are older than 21 years of age. Patients who are able to understand and sign informed consent. Patients treated on an approved IRB therapeutic protocol with a blinded arm of bevacizumab or placebo are not eligible (IRB 07078 and IRB 05138). Patients with cardiac pacemakers. Patients with certain prosthetic devices and implants who are not compatible with the high magnetic field present in the DCEMRI scanners. Patients who have experienced a prior adverse reaction to the gadolinium complex contrast agent used in DCEMRI imaging and who don't meet criteria for creatinine and nephrogenic systemic sclerosis risk per guidelines of department of radiology. Patients prone to claustrophobia. Patients on dialysis.</criteria>
