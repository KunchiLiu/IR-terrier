	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that certain parenting styles are associated with greater non-adherence to therapy in children and teens with type 1 diabetes. To test their hypothesis, the investigators will use standardized and validated questionnaires for parents and children to determine: parenting styles (the investigators will measure parental strictness, parental attachment, and parental monitoring), parent ability to cope with stress, parent comfort with the parenting role, parent and child level of depression and parent perception of financial resources. The investigators will also measure parent and child's perception of the child's underlying temperament and parent-child conflict. The investigators will correlate these findings with both parent and child subjective measures of adherence to therapy. The investigators will also obtain objective measures of therapy adherence including: HbA1c, number of hospitalizations for diabetes ketoacidosis and number of missed outpatient appointments. These measures will be correlated with our other findings.</brief_summary>
