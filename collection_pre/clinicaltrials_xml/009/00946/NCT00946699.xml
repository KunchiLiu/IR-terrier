False positive tests are not included. Deep space/tissue infection (eg, fasciitis, abscess, osteomyelitis, or infected joint replacements) within 1 year before randomization into the study Any opportunistic infection or serious infection (in the opinion of the investigator) within 6 months prior to screening Any of the following within 21 days before randomization into the study: Clinically significant active infection, including ongoing, chronic infection Any infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV antiinfectives Completion of a course of oral antiinfectives within 14 days before randomization into the study Any acute illness or evidence of clinically significant active infection, such as fever ≥ 38.0 degrees C (≥ 100.5 degrees F) at screening or at Day 1 Evidence of active tuberculosis (TB), either treated or untreated, or latent TB without completion of an appropriate course of treatment or appropriate ongoing prophylactic treatment. Evaluation and treatment will be according to the local standard of care and may consist of history and physical examinations, and/or chest X ray, and/or TB test (eg. purified protein derivative) testing, with the standard of care as determined by local guidelines History of primary immunodeficiency or underlying condition that predisposes the subject to infection (eg, splenectomy) Receipt of any live or attenuated vaccine within 21 days before randomization into the study or anticipated to be given within 5 halflives of the last dose of investigational product administration, halflife is estimated to be approximately 15 days. Therefore, receipt of live attenuated vaccine should be avoided for 75 days post dose of investigational product Medically indicated adult immunizations that are not current (eg, pneumococcal vaccine) Current evidence of alcohol, drug or chemical abuse, or a recent history of such abuse &lt; 1 year prior to randomization into the study History of cancer except basal cell carcinoma treated with apparent success with curative therapy ≥ 1 year prior to randomization into the study Major surgery within 8 weeks before randomization into the study or elective surgery planned from screening through the Early Discontinuation Visit/End of Study (Day 85, singledose cohorts) History of any disease, evidence of any current disease (other than scleroderma), any finding upon physical examination, chest xray, or any laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, may compromise the safety of the subject in the study or confound the analysis of the study Any institutionalized individual Employees of the clinical study site or any other individuals involved with the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such individuals Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study with the exception of observational or interventional studies that do not involve therapeutic strategies or invasive diagnostic tests Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study with an investigational product administered within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 or within 5 halflives of the investigational product, whichever is longer Known sensitivity to acetaminophen/paracetamol, diphenhydramine, and methylprednisolone or equivalent glucocorticoid</criteria>
