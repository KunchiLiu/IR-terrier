	<brief_summary>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective and CBT with parental involvement has potential in preventing and treating adolescent depression. The purpose of this study was to compare the short- and long-term effectiveness of CBT alone and CBT plus parental education for community-based adolescents at risk for depression and suicide in Taiwan. It is hypothesized that the CBT alone and CBT with parental education group are more effective than the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Application and Evaluation of Group Cognitive Intervention for Depressed Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is well known for its active, directive, time-limited, and structured approach. Despite an increasing prevalence of adolescent depression in Taiwan, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of CBT for community-based adolescents at risk for depression and suicide. Also, little is known about the effectiveness of the involvement of parents in CBT groups. The Adolescent Coping with Depression Course (CWDA) (19) is an effective CBT-oriented group intervention for adolescent depression. However, it has not been tested in specific cultural groups. The primary purpose of this study was therefore to compare the immediate and long-term effectiveness of CBT alone, CBT with parental education, and control groups for community-based adolescents at risk for depression and suicide.A quasi-experimental research design was used in this study. Community-based high school students at risk for depression and suicide were recruited and assigned to one of two experimental groups or a control group. Students in the experimental groups received CBT plus parental education (group A, n = 9) or CBT alone (group B, n = 10). The control group was designed as a waiting list group (group C, n = 12). Both experimental groups received a follow-up session 1 year after the intervention. Several outcome variables (depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, cognitive triad, learned resourcefulness [LR], and salivary cortisol level) were used to determine the effectiveness of treatment.</detailed_description>
