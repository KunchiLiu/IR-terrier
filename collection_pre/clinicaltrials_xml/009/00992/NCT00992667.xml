	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of inhaled apocynin on ROS (reactive oxygen species) and NOS (reactive nitrogen species) synthesis in 10 nonsmoking mild asthmatics. Effects of nebulized apocynin (0.5 mg/ml, 6 ml) are assessed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) after 30, 60 and 120 minutes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study had a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, consisted of 2 visits, separated 30 ± 10 days. If during the first visit the drug was used, in the second visit - placebo or vice versa. Before and after procedure, safety measures (arterial blood pressure, heart rate value, and cough scale) were performed. The effect of a possible inhibitor of ROS formation was performed using corticosteroid-naive asthmatic subjects, which are more prone to oxidative stress than healthy non-smoking subjects. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medical University of Lodz (no. RNN/12/08/KE) and written consent was obtained from every subject prior to the study. EBC was collected using a modification of the method described previously by Doniec et al.2005. The subjects breathed spontaneously through a mouthpiece for 20 min. Each subject wore a nose clip during this procedure. Approximately 2 ml of condensate was collected and immediately stored at −80°C until the procedure of H2O2, NO2- and NO3- measurement. 6 ml of apocynin of total dose 3 mg (0.5 mg/ml) has been nebulized through the mouthpiece with using of a nose clip. The H2O2 concentration in EBC was measured according to the method applied previously by Nowak et al.2001. Determination of NO2- and NO3- with Griess solution was performed by micromethod, carried out in 96-well plates, according to Griess' method, modified the method described by Dziedzic et al.2003.</detailed_description>
