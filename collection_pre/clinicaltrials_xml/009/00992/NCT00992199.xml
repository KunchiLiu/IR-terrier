	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer is the leading cause of death from a intestinal tract cancer in China.In most cases, the high death rate is due to tumor that has spread beyond the gastric cancer at the time of diagnosis. In China, the standard chemotherapy for the initial treatment of gastric cancer is a combination of a platinum analogue with 5-Fu.With modern surgical interventions and contemporary chemotherapy, most patients attain better clinical remission.The majority of them, however, will eventually have a relapse and die of the disease. The peritoneal cavity is the principal site of disease in gastric cancer.Although the intensity of intravenous chemotherapy is limited mainly by myelotoxicity, several active drugs can be administered directly into the peritoneal cavity. The rationale for intraperitoneal therapy in gastric cancer is that the peritoneum, the predominant site of tumor, receives sustained exposure to high concentrations of antitumor agents while normal tissues, such as the bone marrow, are relatively spared. The investigators conducted this trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
