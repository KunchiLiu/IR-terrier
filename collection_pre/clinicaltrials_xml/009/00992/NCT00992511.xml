Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccine or planned use during the study period. Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Presence of an axillary temperature &gt;= 37.5°C (99.5°F), or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination. Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within 6 months preceding the study start. Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs within 6 months of study enrolment or planned administration during the study period. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with coumarin derivatives, other vitamin K antagonists or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of 24 hours prior to vaccination are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., lowdose acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. Any contraindication to intramuscular administration of the influenza vaccines. An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of GuillainBarré syndrome. Administration of any vaccines within 30 days before vaccination. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines; a history of anaphylactictype reaction to any constituent of influenza vaccines; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.
