	<brief_title>Optimisation of Hydromorphone - Naloxone Ratio for the Treatment of Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects suffering from cancer or non-cancer pain suffering from constipation cased or aggravated by opioids will be randomised to one of four ratios of hydromorphone PR plus naloxone PR or Hydromorphone PR plus placebo to investigate whether a hydromorphone/naloxone combination will lead to comparable analgesia, with a decrease in constipation, and to investigate the optimal dose ratio of hydromorphone and naloxone.</detailed_description>
