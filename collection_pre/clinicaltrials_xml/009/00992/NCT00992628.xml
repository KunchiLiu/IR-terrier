	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing surgery or intensive care management often require a tube to be inserted into the trachea allowing lung ventilation. Usually a laryngoscope is used to allow visualisation of the larynx and facilitate intubation. During direct laryngoscopy, the blade of the laryngoscope is inserted into the patient's mouth and the structures pulled upwards out of the line of vision. If visualisation is difficult, users often exert excess force on the tissues to obtain an adequate view. Generally the applied force is evaluated by the patient's stress response such as increased heart rate, blood pressure or plasma cortisol levels. These changes, while important, may be confounded by a variety of patient factors, as well as anaesthesia. An increased force may also be associated with tissue trauma, dental damage, and prolonged attempts. The investigators' objective is to compare the force exerted on patient's tissues by the Macintosh laryngoscope and GlideScope video-laryngoscope. Video-laryngoscopes may be associated with the application of reduced force to the soft tissues of patients during intubation. While this is a common contention, it has not been proven. The GlideScope has a micro camera in the distal portion of the blade meaning a direct line of vision is not required. An adequate view can therefore be obtained with less displacement of tongue tissue. If the force exerted by the video laryngoscope is less, this would have beneficial implications by reducing stress response, neck movement, and trauma.</brief_summary>
