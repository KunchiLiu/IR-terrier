	<brief_title>An Open-Label Pharmacodynamic Study of Bevacivumab and Pazopanib in Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre, two-part, open-label study is designed to evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of bevacizumab and pazopanib in subjects with renal cancer who experience disease progression following at least one prior therapy of documented clinical benefit. In Part I, subjects will receive 3 infusions of 10 mg/kg bevacizumab, administered at 2-week intervals. The PD response to bevacizumab will be evaluated over 6 weeks using imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging; computed tomography [CT]; and positron emission tomography), intratumoural VEGF signaling by immunohistochemisty, plasma and serum biomarkers, and circulating tumour cells. Subjects may continue into Part II if, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject would derive continued clinical benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy. In Part II, each subject will receive sequentially escalating doses of oral pazopanib in 3-week cycles as follows: 1) 200 mg twice weekly, 2) 200 mg every other day, 3) 200 mg daily, 4) 400 mg daily, 5) 800 mg daily, and 6) 1200 mg daily. Subjects entering Part II will be randomised to receive treatment either throughout each 3-week cycle (Group 1) or for the first 2 weeks of each cycle only, followed by a 1 week treatment holiday (Group 2). After completion of Part II dose escalation subjects will receive continuous pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg daily in repeating 3-week cycles. These subjects will receive pazopanib until loss of clinical benefit, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for other reasons.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically (any histological subtype) or cytologically confirmed unresectable RCC with a clear cell component. Experienced documented evidence of radiological progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] while on first line (or greater) RCC therapy and within 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication (bevacizumab). Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease (i.e., at least 1 malignant tumour mass that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension with the longest diameter greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional CT or MRI or V10 mm with spiral CT scan [if spiral CT scan is used, minimum lesion size should be twice the reconstruction interval used, e.g., if reconstruction size is 7 mm, lesion size should be greater than or equal to 14 mm]) Note: Subject should be excluded if all baseline measurable lesions are within previously irradiated areas. Free of any malignant disease other than RCC for at least 5 years prior to the first dose of study medication (bevacizumab) in this study, with the exception of the following: Cervical carcinoma in situ, Melanoma in situ, Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1 Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgical procedures to NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or less. Adequate organ function as defined by laboratory ranges Note: Laboratory values just outside of these ranges may be included if in the view of the investigator and medical monitor, these findings will not interfere with the study or pose an unacceptable risk to the subject. Capable of giving written informed consent, and willing and able to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Males and females greater than or equal to 18 years of age at screening. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential (see below) or if she is of childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the defined contraception methods from the time of first dose of study medication (bevacizumab) until 4 months after the last dose of study medication (bevacizumab or pazopanib). Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenopausal females with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal females with 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. If the exact duration of amenorrhea is unknown, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than or equal to 40 MIU/mL and estradiol less than or equal to 40 pg/mL (less than or equal to 140 pmol/L) will be required as confirmation. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. A male subject is eligible to participate if he agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in from the time of first dose of study medication (bevacizumab) until 4 months after the last dose of study medication (bevacizumab or pazopanib). Inclusion criteria for progression to Part II The subject met all eligibility criteria (inclusive of inclusion and exclusion criteria) for participation in Part I of the study. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject would derive continued therapeutic benefit from antiangiogenic therapy. In the opinion of the Investigator, there are no safety concerns that would present an unacceptable benefit:risk profile for treatment with pazopanib. The subject is able to swallow and retain oral medication. Clinical evidence of cancer metastatic to the central nervous system or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Previous treatment with bevacizumab or pazopanib, either alone or in combination with other therapy.

If antihypertensive medications are initiated or adjusted, blood pressure must be reassessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 24 hours. The SBP/DBP values from each blood pressure assessment must be geater than 140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study. History of pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have been treated with therapeutic anticoagulating agents for at least 6 weeks are eligible.
