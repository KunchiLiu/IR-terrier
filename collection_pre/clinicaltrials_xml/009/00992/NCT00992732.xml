	<criteria>Histologically confirmed lymphoid malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder with EBV detected by either immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization. Pathology can be assessed on either a current or previous biopsy. All disease stages are eligible Disease that is refractory or relapsed after at least one prior standard therapeutic regimen, which includes biologic agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies), chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy regimens. Prior therapy may include high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue or bone marrow transplantation Bidimensionally measurable disease by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; patients with sensitivity to contrast or for tumor types that are less accurately measured by CT) scan or physical measurement (cutaneous lesions only) with at least 1 lesion ≥ 10 mm in the greatest diameter. PETCT should be used at baseline for patients with Hodgkin's Disease (HD) or diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL). Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mm3 and platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN) with the exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome (bilirubin ≤ 3.5 times ULN allowed), and both AST and ALT ≤ 3 times ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Patients who have not recovered from previous treatment with chemotherapy Patients who have been treated with biologic agents within two weeks prior to first dose of HQK1004 Uncontrolled ischemic heart disease or uncontrolled congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the past 3 months</criteria>
