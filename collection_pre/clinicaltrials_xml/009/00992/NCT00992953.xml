	<brief_title>Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the treatment development phase, participants will be enrolled in Virtual Reality therapy. The therapy will be based on principals of exposure therapy, but will also incorporate aspects of physiological monitoring, and cognitive restructuring. The therapy will be modified as indicated by clinical feedback, with a fixed protocol to be developed (with length of treatment and exact methods to be used to be determined). After a fixed protocol is agreed upon, the project will enter the randomized phase. In this portion, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either the Virtual Reality Treatment, or sent back to a waiting list during which time they will receive usual treatment. Participants will be assessed to determine which treatment (VR or treatment as usual) results in the greatest improvements in PTSD, as measured by independent assessors using the Clinician Administered PTSD scale.</detailed_description>
