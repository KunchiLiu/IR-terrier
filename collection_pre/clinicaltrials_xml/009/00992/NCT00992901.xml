	<brief_summary>RYGB (roux-en-y gastric bypass) has been reported to reverse type 2 diabetes (T2DM) immediately after surgery before any significant weight loss. In addition, a growing number of patients have been recognized with life-threatening hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia several years following their surgery. While the mechanisms by which RYGB improves glucose metabolism or alters islet cell function in patients after RYGB are not understood, recent studies suggest that increased secretion of GI hormones, primarily glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), as well as alteration in neural activity may contribute to enhanced insulin secretion in general, and to a greater extent in patients with hypoglycemia. The proposed research is designed to address the role of RYGB on insulin secretion by evaluating the contribution of stimulatory factors (neural and GI hormone) on islet cell function and the islet cell responsiveness to the physiologic stimulatory factors, in RYGB patients with and without hypoglycemia and non-operated controls.</brief_summary>
