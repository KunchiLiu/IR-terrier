	<brief_summary>The ultrasound guided supraclavicular block is a peripheral nerve block which is considered safe, has a fast onset, is dense and provides complete block of the nerves supplying the hand, forearm and arm. However retrospective studies done at Toronto Western Hospital have highlighted the fact that most commonly the ulnar nerve fibres (responsible for sensations in the ring finger, little finger and the corresponding part of hand), sometimes escape this block and need additional supplementary block at a distal peripheral nerve site. It is a confusing fact since all nerve fibres are compactly arranged in a sheath at the supraclavicular level. The local anaesthetic agent at this level should be equally distributed among all nerve fibres. The purpose of this study is to compare two different approaches (medial and lateral) adopted by our clinicians to perform this block and to test the effectiveness of each approach for successful ulnar nerve fibre blockade.</brief_summary>
