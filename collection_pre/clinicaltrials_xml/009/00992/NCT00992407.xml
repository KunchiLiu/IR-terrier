	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Long Acting Injectable Risperidone and Oral Risperidone in Participants With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (treatment group assigned by chance), open-label (all involved people know the identity of the study drug), active-controlled study to evaluate the improvement in social functioning among participants with schizophrenia taking LAI risperidone and oral risperidone tablet. The study drug will be administered for 52 weeks in flexible dose (range as per Investigator's discretion) and a total of 11 assessment visits will be conducted per participant, including Screening. The participant may be withdrawn from the trial for any medical reason at the sole discretion of the investigator. Before starting the study treatment, participants undergo the period of switching from the previous medication to risperidone for 4 weeks, and then they will be evaluated for tolerability for 2 weeks (run-in period for stabilizing to risperidone). In this 2-week period, participants will take oral risperidone. The efficacy will be primarily evaluated through Personal and Social Performance Scale. Safety will be evaluated through Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
