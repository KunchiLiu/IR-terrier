	<brief_title>Local Infiltration Analgesia or Intrathecal Morphine in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain is often severe following total knee arthroplasty. Spinal anesthesia is a common method in total knee arthroplasty. Adding morphine to the local anesthetic injected intrathecally prolongs the analgetic effect, but may give the usual opioid side effects. The Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) technique has proven effective in reducing postoperative pain in total knee arthroplasty. In the LIA technique a long-acting local anesthetic (ropivacaine), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine are infiltrated intraoperatively and via an intraarticular catheter postoperatively. The aim of this study is to evaluate if spinal anesthesia together with the LIA technique provide better postoperative pain relief and mobilization than spinal anesthesia with addition of morphine to the local anesthetic intrathecally. Primary end-point is morphine consumption the first 48 postoperative hours. Secondary end-points are pain intensity, knee function, time to home readiness, hospital stay, side effects and patient satisfaction. Patients are followed up to 3 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
