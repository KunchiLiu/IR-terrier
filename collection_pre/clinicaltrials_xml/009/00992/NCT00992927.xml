	<brief_title>Should the Joint Capsule of the Painful Stiff Shoulder be Ruptured During Intra-articular Hydraulic Distension?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Painful stiff shoulder (PSS), or the adhesive capsulitis, involves stiff and contracted joint capsule from fibrosis in the glenohumeral joint. Intra-articular hydraulic distension (IHD) enlarges the stiffened capsule by deforming it with excessive volume and pressure within the joint space. Although IHD is one of the most common treatment options for the PSS, the diversity of the IHD technique spans wide range. Specifically, it is not generally agreed as for which, between capsule-rupturing and capsule-preserving IHDs, is superior for PSS treatment. Capsule-preserving IHD might fail to infuse sufficient amount of fluid to avoid rupture, thus producing less satisfactory outcomes. However, we devised in our previous study a novel technique that enabled a physician to infuse the possible largest volume without rupturing the capsule. By employing the technique, we aim to compare the clinical efficacy of capsule-rupturing versus capsule-preserving IHDs in patients with PSSs.</detailed_description>
