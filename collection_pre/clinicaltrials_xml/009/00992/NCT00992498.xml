	<brief_summary>A retrospective analysis on a cohort of unselected COPD patients admitted to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) performed in one rehabilitation centre has shown that the usual program is feasible and effective even in the presence of complex comorbidities, although some combined diseases might reduce the overall proportion of patients who respond to pre-defined outcomes criteria (Crisafulli E, et al. Thorax 2008;63:487-92). The aim of this prospective study is to describe the pattern of prevalence of the most frequently associated COPD-comorbidities and the clinical impact on rehabilitation outcomes, referred to 3 teaching and 1 private hospitals admitting for pulmonary rehabilitation purposes.</brief_summary>
