	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to learn about a possible new medicine, apremilast, for treating acute gout and compare how it works to indomethacin, a medication that has been used to treat gout for over 50 years. In order to learn about apremilast, half the participants in this study will receive apremilast and half the participants in this study will receive indomethacin. This study will measure the severity and duration of acute gout attacks in research participants, as well as measures of quality of life and any side effects or adverse reactions to the medication. There will be three study visits: a screening/baseline visit on Day 1, a visit to evaluate response to treatment with study medication at Day 7, and a follow-up visit at Day 21.</brief_summary>
