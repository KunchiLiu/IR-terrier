	<brief_summary>This Phase I study of sorafenib in high risk hepatocellular cancer patients after liver transplantation will study 24 subjects for about 5 years. Each subject will receive sorafenib for 6 months. Safety and effectiveness on the post transplant, high risk HCC patients will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC) Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cancer and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The recommended daily dose of Sorafenib is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken twice daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Studies of single-agent sorafenib showed treatment was well-tolerated with manageable side effects. The results seen with sorafenib in the Phase III (SHARP) trial suggest that VEGF and RAF kinase inhibition prolong survival in patients with advanced HCC. It is not known whether a drug which is considered primarily cytostatic will be effective in preventing cancer recurrences in the setting of minimal residual disease. This is a phase I, single center, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and overall safety profile of daily sorafenib as therapy to prevent HCC recurrence in liver transplant subjects with high-risk HCC. For each subject, the study will consist of two phases: a treatment phase and an extension phase.</detailed_description>

Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE Grade 2. Thromboembolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks) within the past 6 months. Any hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first study drug.

Any condition that impairs patient's ability to swallow whole pills. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the patient is to be treated. Prior malignancy treated during the prior 5years (other than localized nonmelanoma carcinoma of the skin). Any condition or social situation that may limit patient's compliance with the study regimen Known brain metastasis. Patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis prior to enrollment. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection will not be exclusion criteria.
