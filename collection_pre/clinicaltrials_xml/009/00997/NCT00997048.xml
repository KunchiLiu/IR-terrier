	<brief_summary>A pilonidal sinus is a cyst or abscess near or on the natal cleft of the buttocks that often contains hair and skin debris. The condition is common and requires surgery to be cured. Several surgical procedures are described in literature. The most common surgical procedure in Sweden is excision of the sinus followed by suturing the subcutaneous tissue and skin. This method, however, has some problems regarding healing and recidives. Therefore this study is comparing the standard excision procedure to another surgical procedure, laying open. Healing frequency is the main variable, but postoperative pain, sick leave time and patient satisfaction is also measured.</brief_summary>
