	<brief_title>Changes in Adrenal Hormones During Adrenal Radiofrequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenal radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been increasingly used for the treatment of unresectable adrenal tumors. But one of the major complication is a increase in blood pressure. Hormonal release during RF ablation is considered the cause of hypertension. But there has been no evidence that adrenal hormones affects changes in blood pressure. In this prospective study, we evaluate the changes in adrenal hormones during RF ablation and clarify the cause of hypertensive crisis.</detailed_description>
