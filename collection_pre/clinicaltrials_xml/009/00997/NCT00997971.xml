	<brief_title>Growth, Tolerance in Healthy Infants Fed a Partially Hydrolyzed Rice Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This objective will result in the study of non-inferiority of the experimental formula in terms of variation of weight compared with growth curves after 3 to 6 months of exclusive regime with the experimental formula. Parents provide informed written consent. 4 visits are forecasted in pediatric surgeries: V1(inclusion), V2 (2 months), V3 (4 months) and V4 (6 months). The last visit corresponds to the beginning of the food diversification decided by the pediatrician. Ideally it takes place at 6 months. If the food diversification starts at 4 months, then V3 and V4 constitute the same last visit.</detailed_description>
