	<brief_title>Mycotic Ulcer Treatment Trial II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fungal corneal ulcers tend to have very poor outcomes with commonly used treatments. There has only been a single randomized trial of anti-fungal therapy for mycotic keratitis, and no new ocular anti-fungal medications have been approved by the FDA since the 1960s. The triazole voriconazole has recently become the treatment of choice for systemic fungal infections such as pulmonary aspergillosis. The use of topical ophthalmic preparations of voriconazole has been described in numerous case reports, however there has been no systematic attempt to determine whether it is more or less clinically effective than natamycin. Additionally, there have been many case reports of the use of oral voriconazole in the treatment of fungal corneal ulcers, however there has been no systematic attempt to determine if it improves outcomes in severe ulcers. This study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to determine if the use of oral voriconazole in severe ulcers reduces the rate of perforations. 240 fungal corneal ulcers with baseline visual acuity worse than 6/120 presenting to the Aravind Eye Hospitals and the UCSF Proctor Foundation will be randomized to receive oral voriconazole plus topical voriconazole and topical natamycin, or oral placebo plus topical voriconazole and topical natamycin. The primary outcome is the rate of perforation over the three month follow-up period.</detailed_description>
