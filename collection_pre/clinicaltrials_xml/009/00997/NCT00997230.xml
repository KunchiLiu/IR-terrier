	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to collect epidemiological data on EGFR mutation status (M+, M-) in a population of predominantly Caucasian ethnicity and to correlate EGFR mutation status with clinico-pathological characteristics (e.g. smoking status, sex, histology, etc). In particular, the study will aim to determine the frequency of EGFR M+ lung cancers in patients with clinico-pathological characteristics that are not commonly associated with EGFR mutation positivity (i.e., smokers, men, and non-adenocarcinoma).</brief_summary>
