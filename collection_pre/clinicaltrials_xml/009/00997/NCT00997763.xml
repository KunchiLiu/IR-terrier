	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of coronary stenting with the Everolimus- Eluting stent compared to the Sirolimus-Eluting stent in the treatment of de novo coronary stenosis in patients with diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Everolimus-Eluting Stent vs Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With DIABETES Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic patients often present unfavorable coronary anatomy with small and diffusely diseased vessels (1) and exhibit exaggerated neointimal hyperplasia after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation as compared with nondiabetics (2). Although drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation significantly reduced the neointimal hyperplasia and angiographic restenosis compared to BMS in diabetic patients (3), presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) have been still associated with an increased risk of restenosis and unfavorable clinical outcomes in the era of DES (4,5). Recently, the relative efficacies of sirolimua-eluting stent (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) in patients with DM have been evaluated in randomized and registry studies (6-10). The present study, ESSENCE-DIABETES Study, compare 8-month angiographic and 1-year clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus treated with sirolimus-eluting stent (CYPHER) or everolimus-eluting stent (XIENCE V)</detailed_description>
