	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Lornoxicam in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed drugs in the world. There are a lot of controversial information published during recent years about NSAID cardiosafety. It is still unclear do NSAIDs develop cardioprotective or cardiotoxic effects in acute and chronic heart disease patients. Aim of the study was to investigate safety and efficacy of Lornoxicam, nonselective COX-inhibitor, in patients with acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation (NSTEACS) and to evaluate the influence of Lornoxicam on C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, IL-10 levels.</detailed_description>
