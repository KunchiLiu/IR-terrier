	<detailed_description>Recent research suggests that in addition to playing a role in disease prevention and menopausal symptom reduction, phytoestrogens can reduce anxiety-related behaviors in animals and improve memory in both animals and humans. This project seeks to investigate the potential anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and cognition-enhancing effects of phytoestrogen treatment, in comparison to another popular treatment, estradiol, and placebo, for perimenopausal women. Given the detrimental effects of stress on memory performance, a widely used laboratory stressor will be implemented to investigate whether phytoestrogens and/or estradiol enhance memory by counteracting the negative effects of stress on memory processes. Estrogen and Anxiety Recent animal studies suggest that estrogen can play an important role in modulating anxiety, yet there has been little human research on this topic. Research suggests that the anxiolytic effects of estrogens are mediated by estrogen receptor-beta 1 (ER-beta), one of two known estrogen receptors in the brain 2. ER-beta agonists decreased the release of stress hormones after immobilization stress in rats compared to no treatment and treatment with ER-alpha agonists 3. Additionally, transgenic female mice lacking ER-beta exhibited increased anxiety and decreased serotonin in several brain areas, including the hippocampus 4. The regulation of anxiety by ER-beta is likely to be related to the effects of ER-beta on serotonin transmission 5. The inhibition of anxiety-related behaviors in female rats is mediated by ER-beta in the hippocampus 6. Whereas ER-beta agonists decrease anxiety-related behaviors in female rats, ER-alpha agonists may work in an opposite fashion 3,7. Phytoestrogens and Anxiety Unlike estrogen, which binds equally to ER-alpha and ER-beta, phytoestrogens have a much greater affinity for ER-beta than ER-alpha 8. Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to endogenous estrogens and are currently being widely investigated to determine their potential role in disease prevention. Phytoestrogens have been shown to have anxiolytic effects in female rats. Specifically, female rats fed soy diets or soy supplements exhibited less anxiety-related behavior in a well-validated behavioral maze task compared to control-fed counterparts 9. Though the animal literature supports a role for phytoestrogens in reducing anxiety and/or stress responses following an acute stressor, current research in humans is inconclusive and is based on self-report measures of day-to-day stress rather than responses to acute stressors. Trials examining the effects of different soy-based preparations and diets on cognition and menopausal complaints have yielded inconsistent results. To date, three trials have found improved overall mood, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms or better reaction to the stress of testing 10,11 while five trials have shown no changes in these outcomes 12-15. No human studies have examined the potential anxiolytic effects of phytoestrogens on stress and anxiety following a laboratory stressor. Past studies have shown mixed evidence for whether phytoestrogens are beneficial in regards to menopausal symptoms. A recent study has shown that women who have a specific intestinal microflora, and thus are able to produce the isoflavan equol, are the ones who receive the benefit from the phytoestrogens, such as reduced anxiety, as equol has a greater estrogenic activity and affinity for both estrogen receptors (Ishiwata et al., 2009). Stress and Anxiety in Midlife Women Recent studies demonstrate notable age and sex differences in stress responsivity. Postmenopausal women have larger increases in salivary cortisol after psychosocial laboratory stressors compared to premenopausal women 16. This finding was corroborated by a recent meta-analysis which indicated that the effect of aging on cortisol response to pharmacological or psychological challenge was about three times greater in women compared to men 17. A community-based study of adults in their 70s found greater 12-hour free cortisol excretion to be associated with poorer delayed verbal recall for women only 18. Women in this study who exhibited increases in cortisol excretion two and a half years later were more likely to show declines in memory performance at that time compared to women without increased cortisol excretion. Using a well-validated psychosocial laboratory stressor, Wolf and colleagues found a stronger detrimental effect of psychosocial stress on visual-verbal memory (pictorial memory for common items) for older women compared to older men 19. These data suggest that interventions that lower cortisol, particularly in women, may lower age-related memory declines. Phytoestrogens and Cognition Soy isoflavones have been shown to enhance hippocampal (memory) and frontal lobe (executive) functioning in both clinical trials and animal studies. Research indicates that the neuroprotective properties of phytoestrogens include a positive impact on choline acetyltransferase and nerve growth factor in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of female rats 20 and a weakening of tau phosphorylations associated with Alzheimer's disease in primates 21. Cognitive improvements such as enhanced working memory and visual-spatial memory have been noted for female rats fed phytoestrogen-rich diets or supplements 22. Clinical trials have revealed a consistent improvement in mental flexibility and planning abilities (complex executive tasks) in samples of postmenopausal women (17, 18) as well as younger men and women (16). Further research examining the effects of phytoestrogens on executive tasks is warranted, as many trials, including a large recently published trial have not adequately tested this cognitive domain (15, 19-21, Ho et al., 2007). To date, seven randomized trials in humans have been published which examine the effects of phytoestrogens on verbal memory. Results indicated significant verbal memory improvements with phytoestrogens in young men and women 11 and non-significant trends toward improved verbal memory in four additional trials of younger postmenopausal women 12,13. Phytoestrogen treatment did not benefit verbal memory in the one trial involving only older postmenopausal women 14 and a recent trial of women aged 55-76 (Ho et al., 2007). Interestingly, these findings are largely consistent with the "critical period hypothesis" that proposes estrogen therapy benefits cognitive functioning only when initiated during the menopausal transition or shortly thereafter 23. Accumulating evidence suggests that phytoestrogen treatment may also specifically enhance cognition in the early menopause.</detailed_description>
