	<brief_title>An Exploration of Genetic Testing for Prostate Cancer Susceptibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will use a mixed methods approach to follow men as they move through the genetic testing process, from initial contact through to receiving their genetic testing results. A questionnaire will be used to measure variables at both baseline and after proceeding through the testing process. A small cohort of men will be invited to be interviewed to gather some in depth qualitative data about the issues that have arisen during the study process.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. The definition of a positive family history will be: Men with a first degree relative with prostate cancer diagnosed at &lt;70 years; Men with two relatives with prostate cancer where at least on is diagnosed at &lt;70 years; Men with three relatives with prostate cancer diagnosed at any age Age 4069 years No previous biopsy for raised PSA Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographic situation potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule. Previous prostate cancer Men from families where there is known to be a mutation in a highrisk prostate cancer gene Men who have had a prostate biopsy within the last 12 months.</criteria>
