	<brief_summary>This research is to investigate the nutritional supplement chromium picolinate. A large number of people use chromium picolinate from health food stores to improve the function of the hormone insulin. The investigators are testing how effective this supplement is and are also monitoring its safety. In patients with diabetes, chromium has been shown to increase sensitivity to the hormone insulin. Since obesity can cause insensitivity or resistance to insulin, the investigators are studying obese individuals with documented insulin resistance. The investigators would like to know if chromium is also effective in treating the insulin resistance associated with obesity.</brief_summary>
