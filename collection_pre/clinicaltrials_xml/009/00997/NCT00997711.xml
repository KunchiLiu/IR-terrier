	<brief_title>Evaluation of Diabetic Effects on Clinical Outcomes After Sirolimus-Eluting Stents in the AsIAN Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design This is a multi center, prospective, post market surveillance study of diabetic patients who underwent CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent implantation. For comparison, non-diabetic patients treated with SES in the concurrent period will be simultaneously enrolled. Data will be collected in consecutive subjects treated with commercially available product and following standard clinical practice. This registry will be limited to subjects who have received only the CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent during the index procedure. All subjects should be treated according to the Instructions For Use (IFU) including conduct of the stenting procedure and administration of anti-platelet and diabetic medications; any other medical therapy should be provided according to local standard care. Brief study design is as depicted in the following figure. STUDY POPULATION The registry will be conducted at approximately 15 centers in Korea where CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is approved for commercial use. Data will be collected on approximately 3,600 subjects treated with the CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent only. Assuming the proportion of diabetic patients as 30%, approximately 1,100 diabetic patients will be enrolled. Enrolled diabetic patients are confirmed and diagnosed with Diabetes before or during the index procedure hospitalization, i.e., those receiving active treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin, patients with diagnosis of diabetes who were on dietary therapy alone or patients with an abnormal blood glucose level after an overnight fast. Enrolled non-diabetic patients should be treated with CYPHER SELECT™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent only. STUDY PROCEDURE As regulated by data protection and privacy laws and in accordance with local Ethics Committee requirements, subjects will be informed and requested to grant their approval to review their medical records and collect and analyze personal medical information, while maintaining the confidentiality of the records at all times. They will be also asked to agree to be contacted during a 1-year follow-up period. Subjects will be followed at 1, 6 and 12 months, by phone call, office visit, or by contacts with primary physicians or referring cardiologists, according to each investigator's preference. Angiographic follow up will be performed at the physician's discretion. In diabetic patients, fasting glucose level and HbA1c level assessment will be performed at the index procedure and at the 12-month follow up.</detailed_description>
