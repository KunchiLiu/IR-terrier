	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that lives commonly in the anterior nostrils, is seen in about 30% of healthcare workers. Applying mupirocin ointment, a prescription, to the nostrils twice daily for 5 days is the current standard of care for treatment to clear this bacteria. This research study is designed to determine the rate of clearance of this bacteria in healthcare workers who are carriers when using triple antibiotic ointment instead of mupirocin ointment.</brief_summary>
