	<brief_summary>Rationale: Management of blood pressure (BP) in the acute phase of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial. Although it has been established that there is a transient moderate reduction of perihematoma cerebral blood flow (CBF) in acute ICH, the effect of BP treatment is unknown. The potential for exacerbation of CBF has precluded routine aggressive BP reduction. Aim and Hypothesis: The primary study aim is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of acute BP reduction to &lt; 150 mmHg systolic using a standardized protocol in ICH patients. It is hypothesized that CTP will not demonstrate evidence of perihematoma ischemia following acute BP reduction. Design: ICH ADAPT is a randomized blinded endpoint trial. Acutely hypertensive ICH patients are randomized to a target systolic BP of &lt; 150 mmHg or &lt; 180 mmHg. Patients are treated with intravenous (IV) labetalol/hydralazine/enalapril. Study Outcomes: The primary outcome is cerebral blood flow in the perihematoma region, measured with CT perfusion, 2 hours after randomization. Secondary outcomes include the difference in BP at 1 and 2 hours post-randomization in the two treatment groups and hematoma expansion rates at 24 hours. Discussion: ICH ADAPT is the only randomized trial designed specifically to identify any hemodynamic changes in the perihematoma region secondary to aggressive BP management. The results of this trial will facilitate ongoing and future studies aimed at determining the efficacy of rapid BP reduction in acute ICH.</brief_summary>
