	<brief_summary>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is the serous neurosensory detachment that usually involves the macular area. It is common in patients between 30-50 years old and effects male more often than female with the ratio of 5-10. The common risk factors are psychologic stress, type A personality, systemic steroid use, hypertension and pregnancy. The treatment is usually observation especially in the first three-months. The laser or photodynamic therapy should be considered when the condition does not improve after that time. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of CSC is still not well understood but the study from indocyanine green angiography showed the choroidal vascular hyperpermeability and abnormal leakage. The causes of this abnormality are supposed to be from nitric oxide, prostaglandins or even free oxidative radicals. From this hypothesis, the oxidative process might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease especially in the early stage. This study is to determine the effect of antioxidants drugs in the acute stage of CSC and to determine whether they can improve the outcomes of the disease.</brief_summary>
