	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Psychological Well-being in Patients With Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today, the consideration of the side effects of intensive treatment measures and their influence on quality of life are regarded as standard procedures in oncology. Quality of life measurements have found their way into clinical studies as patient-reported outcomes. In comparison to other tumor types, the field of dermato-oncology has had less research activity concerning quality of life. However, in recent years more attention has been paid to health related quality of life in malignant melanoma patients, especially under adjuvant treatment with interferon-alpha. Data about high dose IFN-α treatment, especially from the USA, show that there are significant physical and psychological side effects, such as fatigue and depression, which often lead to dosage reduction or termination of treatment. As yet, there are very few systematic studies about low dose IFN-α treatment, especially in regard to the side effects during the course of the disease. Concerning treatment side-effects it is known throughout various areas of oncology that specific psycho-oncological interventions assist in the patients' adaptation to the illness and handling of the side effects of therapy.</detailed_description>
