	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from dendritic cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the tolerability of autologous dendritic cell vaccine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission. Secondary - Evaluate the emergence of an immune response. - Determine the relapse rate. - Assess the occurrence of residual disease. OUTLINE: Patients receive increasing doses of blastic cells transformed in vitro by autologous dendritic cells (1/3 subcutaneously and 2/3 IV) every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses.</detailed_description>
