	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (ie, blood levels of JNJ-28431754) and pharmacodynamics (ie, urine and blood levels of glucose) of JNJ-28431754 compared to placebo in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics Study of JNJ-28431754 in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician, patient nor the sponsor knows the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled, single and multiple (14 days) ascending dose, parallel group study in 3 study centers (United States, Germany and South Korea). Five cohorts (groups) of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will be studied. One dose level will be evaluated in each cohort. Sixteen (16) patients will be randomly assigned to receive JNJ-28431754 and four (4) patients to receive matching placebo within each cohort. The planned doses are 30, 100, 300 and 600 mg per day. Twice-daily dosing may also be evaluated in one or more of the cohorts. An additional cohort of Asian patients will also be evaluated at a dose level, which was previously tested in a prior cohort and considered to be well tolerated. Blood and urine samples will be collected from patients during the study for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. The safety and tolerability of JNJ-28431754 will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
