	<brief_title>VA111913 Dysmenorrhoea Efficacy and Safety Proof of Concept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysmenorrhoea is suffered by between 50% and 90% of women of child bearing age. Up to 30% of these women are non-responsive to the currently prescribed therapies. As such it represents an area of unmet medical need. VA111913 inhibits vasopressin-induced contractions of human myometrial strips and human myometrial blood vessels in vitro. By this mechanism, it is anticipated that the pain of dysmenorrhoea, a condition in which myometrial tone and contractions are increased and blood flow to the uterus is decreased compared to normal, may be reduced. Subjects will be dosed with VA111913 TS and placebo in a cross over design during two consecutive menstrual cycles. They will be dosed for up to a maximum of 6 days, beginning 2 days before the onset of menstruation. Subjects will then assess the menstrual pain, bleeding and amount of analgesia required to treat symptoms during each cycle</detailed_description>
