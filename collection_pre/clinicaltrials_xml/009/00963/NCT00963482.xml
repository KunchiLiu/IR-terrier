	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation in Alcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a randomised, controlled trial conducted in an inpatient alcohol treatment institution. Shortly after alcohol detoxification, smokers are offered to voluntarily participate in a smoking cessation program. Participation is possible if patients either want to stop smoking or to reduce their consumption for at least 50%. Patients are asked about their smoking behaviour at the following time points: at admission (T0), after finishing the smoking cessation program or the control condition (T1), one month later by phone (T2) and six months later in a closing meeting (T3). Urine samples and CO-breath controls are taken to check both nicotine and alcohol abstinence.</detailed_description>
