	<brief_summary>Liver resection and liver transplantation are the acceptable treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). But the long-term survival is unsatisfactory as a result of high rate of intra and extra hepatic recurrences. Microvascular invasion (MVI) is the most significant risk factor affecting recurrence-free survival in patients following liver resection and liver transplantation. Tumor hypoxia (lack of adequate blood supply) is the single most important factor that predict MVI and post surgical prognosis. Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI is a non-invasive diagnostic method of assessing tumor hypoxia by detecting signal changes secondary to changes in blood flow and oxygenation. BOLD MRI assessment of tumor hypoxia in HCC has never been correlated with pathological confirmation of MVI, the gold standard to assess MVI in HCC. In this study, the investigators propose to assess the ability of BOLD MRI to provide a discriminating quantitative threshold of intratumoral oxygenation predictive of MVI.</brief_summary>
