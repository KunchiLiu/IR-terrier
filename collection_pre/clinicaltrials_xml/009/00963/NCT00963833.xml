	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is mainly known as a disease of young to middle adulthood but approximately 5% of all MS cases worldwide involve children that are younger than 16 years. The aim of care of children with Multiple Sclerosis is to prevent or at least to delay any neurological and cognitive impairment as well as progression of the disease as far as possible. Therefore, it is very crucial to diagnose the disease at an early stage as immunomodulatory treatments are available that can delay the progression of Multiple SclerosisTreatment with the immunomodulatory agent Betaferon® in children diagnosed with RRMS and being 12 years or older has been approved by the health authorities. The aim of this observational study is to obtain further data on the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of Betaferon® under daily living conditions. As this is a non-interventional observational study, routine clinical practice is observed. The application of diagnostic measures and medications as well as physician visits follow the normal routine and is decided upon by the treating physician under recognition of the package insert.</brief_summary>
