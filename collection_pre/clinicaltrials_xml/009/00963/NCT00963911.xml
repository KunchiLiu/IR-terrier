	<brief_title>Questionnaire in Screening Older Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Validate a new screening tool (G8). Secondary - Validate the French version of the screening tool "Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13)". - Evaluate the merits of the screening tools (G8 and VES-13). - Assess the screening tool in specific populations. - Assess the number and type of interventions proposed after thorough geriatric assessment. - Compare the two new tools (G8 vs VES-13). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. During the first consultation, patients have an initial clinical evaluation questionnaire comprising the G8. They also complete the self-questionnaire VES-13. Within 30 days, patients have a thorough geriatric assessment, including quality of life and physical function, by a physician without access to the G8 or VES-13 questionnaires. A blood specimen is also collected. Information on health status and quality of life is collected from medical records or from the doctor after 1 and 5 years.</detailed_description>
