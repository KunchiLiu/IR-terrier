	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help measure oxygen levels in tumor cells. It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well MRI works in assessing hypoxia in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI in Assessing Hypoxia in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To characterize the status of global hypoxia within the prostate before stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI. - To characterize tumor vasculature and metabolism within the prostate before SBRT as assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, respectively. - Correlate prostate and normal tissue hypoxia before SBRT with clinical outcomes (toxicity and biochemical [PSA] control) after SBRT. OUTLINE: Within 1-3 weeks before beginning stereotactic body radiotherapy, patients undergo T2-weighted anatomic MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.</detailed_description>
