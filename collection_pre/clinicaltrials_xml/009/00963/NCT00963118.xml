	<brief_summary>To achieve optimal health and to reduce the risk of age-related chronic diseases through an easily achievable dietary modification not achievable by the limited mixture of antioxidant supplements in older subjects, the investigators will focus their attention on the biological functions of bioactive plant food (Angelica keiskei and/or Glycine max) and its effect on genomic stability using noble assays. The investigators propose to study the ability of bioactive plant-based food (Nutrition bar made from Angelica keiskei and/or Glycine max) to 1) exert biological functions: increase total antioxidant performance, decrease oxidative stress in vivo, and 2) affect genomic stability: decrease DNA damage and modify DNA methylation. The investigators hypothesize that bioactive plant food (green leafy vegetable power, and/or black bean power) will exert biological functions and affect genomic stability far more efficiently than the limited mixture of purified antioxidant supplements in the vulnerable population, older subjects (&gt; 50 years, men and postmenopausal women) with and without metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>

Study participants will be screened for normal hematologic parameters, normal serum albumin, normal liver function, normal kidney function, absence of fat malabsorption. 2. Subjects with a history of kidney stones, active small bowel disease or resection, atrophic gastritis, insulinrequiring diabetes, alcoholism, pancreatic disease, or bleeding disorders will be excluded from the study. 3. Exogenous hormone users will be excluded from the study. 4. Moreover, subjects will be nonsmokers and will not have taken vitamin or carotenoid supplements for at least 6 weeks prior to the study and throughout the study for both healthy subjects and subjects with metabolic syndrome.</criteria>
