	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that realization of guided biopsies by multimodal imaging with 18F-fluorocholine PET / CT and MR Imaging/spectroscopy would allow to increase the rate of detection prostate cancer compared with the current approach and give an information about location and tumoral volume before surgery.:</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F-18-Fluorocholine PET/CT and MR Imaging/ Spectroscopy in the Management of Primary and Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To evaluate the utility of F-18-FCH-PET/CT and MR imaging with 3-D MR spectroscopy in detecting, localizing, and estimating the volume of initial primary prostate cancer as compared to the current standard work-up using TRUS-guided biopsy. All imaging findings will be correlated with "gold standard" step slice histological examination. The hypothesis is that the combination of noninvasive imaging will improve the preoperative work-up as compared to the current approach. 2. To evaluate FCH-PET for the restaging of prostate cancer after biochemical relapse in a large patient cohort. This will run in parallel to the work-up of primary prostate cancer, as the FCH radiopharmaceutical will be available during the time of study at absolutely no cost to patients or CHUV. A number of studies have demonstrated the benefits of F-18-FCH-PET/CT for these patients and this indication is currently not reimbursed by Swiss obligatory health insurance providers.</detailed_description>
