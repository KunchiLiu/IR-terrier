	<brief_summary>In patients who have never bled from gastric varix (GOV2 and IGV1), cyanoacrylate injection will be better than both beta-blocker therapy and no treatment in prevention of gastric variceal bleed. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial in patients with gastric varix (GOV2 and IGV1) who never bled before, to study the efficacy of treatment with cyanoacrylate injection versus beta-blocker versus no treatment in prevention of first bleed from gastric varices.</brief_summary>
