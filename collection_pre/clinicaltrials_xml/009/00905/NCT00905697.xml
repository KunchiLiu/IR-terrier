	<brief_title>Patient Reported Outcomes in Living Donor Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Japan, living donor lung transplantation has been established as an alternative therapy for brain-dead lung transplantation, as the number of organs for transplantation is absolutely short. However, how patient reported measurements including health status, dyspnea, psychological status and sleep would change after lung transplantation has not been well evaluated. Therefore, in the present study, we aim (1) to compare them before and after transplant operations and (2) to analyze how they will change for 5 years.</detailed_description>
