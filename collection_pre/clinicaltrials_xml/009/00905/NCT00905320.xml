	<brief_title>Hernia Repair With or Without Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study in which subjects will undergo one or two currently accepted techniques of mesh fixation during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Subject will undergo mesh fixation with either trans-abdominal sutures and metallic tacks or metallic tacks only. Pain will be assessed through week 12, and hernia recurrence will be assessed for 2 years after surgery. Subjects will complete pain questionnaires at baseline, each day during hospital stay, and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge. Quality of life questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at discharge from hospital, and during follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Demographics: Age ≥ 18 years old If female, negative pregnancy test PreOperative Findings: Presence of an abdominal hernia associated with previous surgical incision Midline ventral\incisional hernia demonstrated either on physical examination by investigators or radiologic imaging tests. CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound No evidence of incarceration, strangulation Size of hernia ≥ 4 centimeters or ≤ 20 centimeters (crosssectional diameter) Multiple hernias cumulative size ≤ 20 centimeters in crosssectional diameter PreOperative History: Severe medical comorbidities that prevent safe performance of laparoscopic surgery including coronary artery disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, etc. History of the following: Connective tissue or wound healing disorder (e.g. EhlersDanlos syndrome) Chronic use (defined as greater than 3 months) of narcotic analgesic for pain other than from the hernia that is intended to be repaired Allergy to products used in hernia repair including surgical mesh Any abdominal ventral incisional hernia previously repaired with permanent synthetic mesh placed inside the peritoneal cavity Loss of abdominal domain (i.e. majority of abdominal organs lie outside confines of the abdominal musculature and fascia) Presence of simultaneous intraabdominal infection Simultaneous presence of a bowel obstruction History of suspected or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years. Uncontrolled anxiety, schizophrenia, or other psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with study assessments or compliance. Intraoperative Findings: Simultaneous performance of another surgical procedure during hernia repair other than acts necessary to complete hernia repair (e.g. cutting of abdominal adhesions) Intraoperative identification of full thickness injury to intestine (i.e. enterotomy), liver, bladder, etc.</criteria>
