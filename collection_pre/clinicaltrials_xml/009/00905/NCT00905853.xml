	<brief_summary>This study will compare aggressive antiarrhythmic therapy to catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia in patients who have suffered prior myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimal management of patients presenting with recurrent VT and receiving ICD therapy in spite of first-line antiarrhythmic drug therapy. The hypothesis is catheter ablation is superior to aggressive antiarrhythmic drug therapy for recurrent VT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Ablation or Escalated Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, parallel group, two arm, unblinded, randomized clinical trial to compare two management strategies for patients with ischemic heart disease and recurrent ICD therapy despite at least one antiarrhythmic drug. The primary endpoint will be a composite of appropriate ICD shocks or death.</detailed_description>
