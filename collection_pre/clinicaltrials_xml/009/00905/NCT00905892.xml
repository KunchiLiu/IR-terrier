	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the partitioning of exogenous lipids in the postprandial period while a study of overfeeding. The method is based on the incorporation of a stable isotopic tracer (d31_palmitic acid, d31_C16) in lipoprotein triglycerides (TG-CHYLOMICRON and TG-VLDL) and in free fatty acids (FFA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy overweight and lean young men are subjected to an overfeeding during 56 days which corresponds to a supplement of 761 Kcal/day. During two exploration days (before : D0 et after : D56 overfeeding) they have ingested a breakfast with tracer (d31_palmitic acid, d31_C16, 20mg/kg) and blood and urine samples were collected every hour of each exploration day. The enrichment in deuterium was measured by gas chromatography-organic mass spectrometry (GC-OMS) in palmitic acid pool of lipid fractions.</detailed_description>
