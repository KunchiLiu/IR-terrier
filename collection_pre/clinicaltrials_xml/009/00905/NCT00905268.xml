	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of idebenone in 12 months of treatment in children and adults with Friedreich's Ataxia. This is a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial conducted in Europe. Efficacy outcomes include measures of neurological impairment and function, and measures of the heart.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Idebenone in the Treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idebenone, a short-chain analogue of Co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10), has the potential to moderate underlying causes of Friedreich's Ataxia through its antioxidant activity and its role as an electron carrier in the respiratory chain promoting mitochondrial ATP production. The current 12-month placebo-controlled treatment study in 232 patients aims to confirm the positive effect of idebenone on neurological function, as for instance observed in the recent 48-patient, 6-month NICOSIA study in children, using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and the newly developed Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS). In addition, the study aims to confirm the positive effect on cardiomyopathy associated with FRDA observed in several small studies. Cardiac anatomy and function will be assessed using echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging and cardiac MRI methods in patients with FRDA cardiomyopathy. In addition exercise capacity, measured as peak workload, will be assessed in patients able to comply with a modified exercise protocol.</detailed_description>
