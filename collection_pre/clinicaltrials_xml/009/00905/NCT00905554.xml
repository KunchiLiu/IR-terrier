	<brief_summary>Unsedated colonoscopy is characterized by lower costs, recovery time and incidence of drug-related side effects, although it may be painful for the patient. Based on recent reports, the investigators designed this randomized controlled trial hypothesizing that the use of water irrigation versus air insufflation during the insertion phase of colonoscopy might increase the global tolerability of the examination and the proportion of patients undergoing complete colonoscopy without sedation.</brief_summary>
