	<detailed_description>This is a prospective cohort study among adult patients requiring warfarin therapy. Patients presenting for anticoagulation will be identified at the start of therapy and followed throughout their course until they reach maintenance dose. We will then develop a dosing equation for warfarin using patient, environmental and genetic factors.</detailed_description>
