	<brief_summary>It is well known that femoral neck fractures carry a significant increase in patients' mortality and that surgical intervention is the preferred treatment. Any delay in operating on such patients would inevitably increase their risk of developing complications. One of the reasons for such unintentional delay would be the hypercoagulative status of patients taking warfarin. The CHEST 2008 guidelines suggest reversing warfarin with Vitamin K for patients who need urgent operation. The aim of this study is to compare different roots and doses of Vitamin K.</brief_summary>
