	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) works in evaluating response to dasatinib in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases. Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography in Evaluating Response to Dasatinib in Patients With Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if changes in regional fluoride incorporation, measured by 18F-fluoride PET (SUV and Ki), occur in both castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases and normal bone as a response to treatment with dasatinib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if changes in 18F-fluoride transport (K1), an indicator of blood flow, and therefore, an indirect marker of angiogenesis, occur in both castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases and normal bone as a response to treatment with dasatinib. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET scan at baseline and then at 12 weeks after initiation of treatment with dasatinib. PET parameters (SUV, Ki, and Kl) are also analyzed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must be able to provide a written informed consent Men 18 years or older with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer enrolling onto the Febbo clinical trial with dasatinib therapy (must meet all inclusion criteria for dasatinib treatment study and comply with requirements of that specific clinical trial) Histologic confirmation of original prostate cancer diagnosis Presence of at least one convincing bone metastasis as defined by bone scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT) scan (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] if indicated), or plain Xray Must currently have castrate testosterone levels (&lt; 50 ng/dL) from orchiectomy or maintenance on a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or LHRH antagonist On the nilutamideonly arm (Arm A of the clinical therapeutic trial) Note: However, if a patient crossesover from nilutamide at the time of progression to add dasatinib therapy, he may be eligible for 18Ffluoride PET imaging protocol if he meets all inclusion criteria for this trial Any condition that would alter the patient's mental status, prohibiting the basic understanding and/or authorization of informed consent A serious underlying medical condition that would otherwise impair the patient's ability to receive treatment and imaging studies Expected lifespan of 12 weeks or less Extremely poor intravenous access, prohibiting the placement of a peripheral IV line for injection of radiotracer Initiation of bisphosphonate therapy less than 4 weeks from the first PET scan Radiation treatment to bone less than 4 weeks from first PET scan Radiopharmaceutical treatment to bone less than 4 weeks from first PET scan Treatment with granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) or granulocyte CSF (GCSF) within 4 weeks prior to first PET scan Inability to lie still for the imaging Weight &gt; 300 lbs.
