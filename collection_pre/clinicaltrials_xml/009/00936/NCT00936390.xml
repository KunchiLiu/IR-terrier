	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen-deprivation therapy may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without androgen-deprivation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with radiation therapy given together with androgen-deprivation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With or Without Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Demonstrate an overall survival (OS) advantage in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated radiotherapy (RT) with versus without short-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Secondary - Determine whether the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT versus RT alone improves clinical failures, biochemical failure by the "nadir +2", freedom from failure, rate of salvage ADT, and prostate cancer-specific mortality in these patients. - Estimate the magnitude of benefit of ADT with respect to OS in patients treated with different RT modalities (i.e., external-beam radiation therapy alone vs low-dose rate brachytherapy boost vs high-dose rate brachytherapy boost). - Compare acute and late treatment adverse events of these regimens and correlate these events with the presence or absence of pre-existing comorbidity as documented by the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 assessment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of radiotherapy. Patients are stratified according to number of risk factors (1 vs 2-3), comorbidity (ACE-27 grade ≥ 2 vs &lt; 2), and radiotherapy (RT) modality (dose-escalated external-beam RT [EBRT] vs EBRT and low-dose rate brachytherapy boost vs EBRT and high-dose rate brachytherapy boost). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo EBRT* once daily on days 1-5 for about 9 weeks (44 treatments). Some patients instead receive EBRT with high-dose rate or low-dose rate brachytherapy implant on days 1-5 for about 5 weeks (25 treatments). NOTE: *Type of RT is at discretion of treating physician and may include either 3D-conformal RT or intensity-modulated RT. - Arm II: Patients receive androgen-deprivation therapy comprising luteinizing-hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist (leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, or triptorelin) subcutaneously or as an injection every 1 to 3 months AND an oral antiandrogen therapy (flutamide 3 times daily or bicalutamide once daily) for 6 months. Beginning 8 weeks after the first LHRH injection, patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed within the past 180 days and at intermediaterisk for recurrence by meeting 1 or more of the following criteria: Gleason score = 7 Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) &gt; 10 and ≤ 20 ng/mL Baseline serum PSA value performed within 60 days with an FDAapproved assay (e.g., Abbott, Hybritech) Baseline PSA must not be obtained during any of the following time frames:10day period after prostate biopsy, after initiation of androgendeprivation therapy, or within the past 30 days after discontinuation of finasteride (90 days for dutasteride) Clinical stage T2b or T2c disease Patients previously diagnosed with lowrisk (Gleason score &lt; 6, clinical stage &lt; T2a, and PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL) prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance who are rebiopsied and found to have intermediaterisk disease according to the protocol criteria are eligible for enrollment within 6 months of the repeat biopsy procedure Patients with Gleason Score ≥ 8, PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL, OR clinical stage ≥ T3 are ineligible for this trial If findings of extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion are noted on prostate MRI, this study, if used, will not render patients ineligible for accrual to this protocol Primary tumor staging for eligibility purposes is to be based on palpable or core biopsy evidence only with respect to extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle involvement No patients with all 3 intermediaterisk factors who also have ≥ 50% of the number of their biopsy cores positive for cancer The percentage of biopsy cores involved will only be considered with respect to eligibility for those patients with all 3 of the above risk factors (i.e., patients with one or two of the above risk factors are eligible irrespective of the percentage of biopsy cores involved) Clinically negative lymph nodes as established by imaging (pelvic and/or abdominal CT scan or MRI), nodal sampling, or dissection within the past 60 days (required for patients with 23 risk factors) Abdominal imaging not required for a single intermediaterisk factor (these studies may be obtained at the discretion of the treating physician) Lymph nodes that are equivocal or questionable by imaging allowed without biopsy if nodes ≤ 1.5 cm Any node &gt; 1.5 cm on imaging requires a negative biopsy No evidence of bone metastases on bone scan within the past 60 days Bone scan not required for patients with a single intermediaterisk factor (scan may be obtained at the discretion of the treating physician) Equivocal bone scan findings allowed if plain film xrays negative for metastasis PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Zubrod performance status 01 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,800/mm^3* Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3* Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (transfusion or other intervention to achieve level allowed)* NOTE: *For patients undergoing brachytherapy only.
