	<brief_title>Females With Severe or Moderate Hemophilia A or B: an International Multi-center Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involves two questionnaires: one on the diagnosis, symptoms, complications and treatment of each participant to be completed by a staff member; the other is a questionnaire to be completed by the participant on how the disease has affected her life. Finally, for those participants who have not previously had genetic testing, the third part of the study is an optional blood test to determine the genetic cause, what change in the factor VIII or factor IX gene, caused the hemophilia. The test results will be available to those participants who wish to learn their results. With the data we collect we will compile a database to examine the connection between the genetic cause of hemophilia and the course and symptoms of the disease.</detailed_description>
