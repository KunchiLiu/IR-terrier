	<brief_summary>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common co-occurring psychiatric disorders (30-50%) in adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD). Yet, little is known about the safety and efficacy of medications for ADHD in adolescents with SUD, since such youths have been excluded from most medication trials. Clinicians are therefore understandably reluctant to treat ADHD in substance abusing adolescents, often first referring such youths to substance treatment. Untreated ADHD is associated with poorer substance treatment outcomes. We address this research gap by proposing a randomized controlled trial of bupropion vs placebo in 130 adolescents (13-19 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV) ADHD, nicotine dependence and cannabis use disorder (not excluding other SUD). Participants in both bupropion and placebo treatment groups will receive weekly individual manualized-standardized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting SUD (at no cost to them) throughout the 16 weeks of the medication trial. Bupropion also is effective in treating nicotine dependence in adults; the majority of adolescents with marijuana and other drug abuse also smoke tobacco. More recent research in adults indicates that bupropion may reduce craving and use of other substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamine, cocaine). It's possible impact on cannabis use disorder (the addiction for which most teens are referred to treatment) has not yet been evaluated. However since all drugs of abuse have a final common pathway leading to addiction via action in the so called brain reward system (ventral tegmental area (VTA), accumbens) -an important secondary aim is to evaluate bupropion's potential impact on craving and use of marijuana (MJ) in addition to its known similar action on nicotine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bupropion for ADHD in Adolescents With Substance Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown that bupropion is a safe and effective treatment for both ADHD and nicotine dependence in individuals without SUD, and newer research provides empirical support for its unique pharmacotherapeutic properties and potential for treating other addictive disorders (e.g., methamphetamine dependence, pathological gambling). No controlled studies have yet evaluated bupropion's safety and efficacy for ADHD and SUD (including nicotine and cannabis) in adolescents. The lack of research on the safety and efficacy of medications in adolescents with SUD and psychiatric comorbidities contributes to a serious lack of integrated treatment for commonly co-occurring mental health and substance problems in community-based adolescent drug treatment programs. This then contributes to poorer treatment outcomes and prognosis for the large number of comorbid youths with substance abuse and mental health problems that significantly impact public health. The specific aims of the proposed study will address this research gap by conducting a 16-week randomized controlled trial of bupropion vs. placebo to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this low abuse potential medication on ADHD, nicotine dependence, and cannabis use disorders (not excluding other SUD) in 130 adolescents (13-19) receiving concurrent outpatient substance treatment (CBT). The study design and analytic approach will enable assessment of the complex inter-relationship between change in ADHD, depression/dysphoria (and other psychiatric symptoms) and change in nicotine, cannabis and other substance use within and between treatment groups. Thus, the study addresses important research gaps in at least two priority areas of the National Institute on Drug Abuse/ National Institutes of Health(NIDA/NIH) research agenda: 1) research on effective treatments for adolescents with addiction and psychiatric comorbidity, and 2) medications development research for nicotine and cannabis use disorders in adolescents.</detailed_description>
