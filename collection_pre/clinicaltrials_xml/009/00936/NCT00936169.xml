	<criteria>A complex lesion is regarded as a lesion where the operator would expect a lower immediate and long term success rate compared to noncomplex lesions (according to the results of Randomized Controlled Trials and from large Registries). The operator must consider the implantation of a drugeluting stent, feasible and appropriate for this particular complex lesion Contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy. Ejection fraction &lt;30%. Renal failure (creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL). Significant comorbidity precluding clinical followup. Acute myocardial infarction in the 48 hours prior to the procedure. Instent restenosis Prior brachytherapy Thrombocytopenia &lt;100,000 Unprotected left main stem stenosis Venous or arterial grafts Recipient of heart transplant A positive pregnancy test in women with child bearing potential Acute infections Major surgery planned which will lead to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy Patients with prior BMS or DES implanted in the target vessel less than one year prior to the enrollment, including one year from any intercurrent restenotic or thrombotic event Age under 18 years old. There is no maximum number of lesions which can be treated</criteria>
