	<brief_summary>Participants in study C-1073-400 (NCT00569582) will be invited to participate in this extension study to examine the long term safety of mifepristone in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Total treatment duration may be up to 12 months or longer at the discretion of the Investigator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Extension Study of CORLUX in the Treatment of Endogenous Cushing's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 50 subjects will receive mifepristone daily. Subjects completing 24 weeks of mifepristone treatment under Corcept protocol C1073-400 (NCT00569582) will be eligible to continue treatment for an additional 1 year. Assessments of safety, as evaluated by physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events, will be made. Persistence of improvement in response to mifepristone treatment will also be evaluated during this extension study by assessing the continued or sustained improvement in the signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome.</detailed_description>

Female patients of reproductive potential, who are pregnant or who are unable or unwilling to use medically acceptable, nonhormonal methods of contraception during the study. Have received investigational treatment (drug, biological agent or device) other than CORLUX (mifepristone) within 30 days of Entry Have a history of an allergic reaction or intolerance to CORLUX (mifepristone) Have uncorrected hypokalemia (potassium level of &lt;3.5 mEq/L) at Entry. Spironolactone or eplerenone is allowed to control hypokalemia.
