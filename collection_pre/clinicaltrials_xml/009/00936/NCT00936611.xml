	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to assess the response rate of LBH589 in patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. LBH589 is a newly discovered compound that has killed Waldenstrom cells in laboratory studies, however, it is not known if LBH589 will show the same activity in people with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. This drug has been used in research for the treatment of other types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Each cycle lasts 4 weeks (28 days). Participants will take LBH589 orally once a day on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week. - While participants are receiving LBH589, and before the start of each study cycle, they will come to the clinic for the following tests and procedures: physical examination, blood work and EKG. - Participants may continue to receive LBH589 for as long as the study doctor determines that they are benefiting.</detailed_description>
