	<brief_summary>Intestinal parasitic infections, malnutrition and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) are still considered as public health problems in rural Malaysia especially among Orang Asli children. Despite intermittent control programmes, the prevalence of these problems is still high suggesting the need of other control and interventions measures. This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out among Orang Asli schoolchildren from Sekolah Kebangsaan Betau in Pos Betau, Pahang (200 km northeast Kuala Lumpur) to investigate the effects of vitamin A supplementation on intestinal parasitic reinfections, growth, iron status and educational achievement. HYPOTHESES 1. Vitamin A supplementation has a negative effect on intestinal parasitic reinfections and the worm burden of infections among Orang Asli schoolchildren in Pos Betau, Kuala Lipis, Pahang. 2. Vitamin A supplementation has a positive effect on growth (weight and height) among Orang Asli schoolchildren. 3. Vitamin A supplementation is effective in improving serum iron status among Orang Asli schoolchildren. 4. Vitamin A supplementation has a positive effect on cognitive function and educational achievement among Orang Asli schoolchildren.</brief_summary>
