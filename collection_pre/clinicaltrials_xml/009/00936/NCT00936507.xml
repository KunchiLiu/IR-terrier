	<brief_title>Does Portion Size Influence Intake of Low-Energy-Dense Foods in Preschool-Aged Children?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this investigation is to examine the impact of portion size on intake of a low energy dense food (fruit). Preschool-aged children will be provided with a small and large portion of applesauce (low-energy-dense food) and chocolate pudding (higher-energy-dense food) and allowed to eat the foods ad libitum during an afternoon snack in their usual preschool classroom. Measures of the amount of each food (grams and kilocalories) consumed will be taken. The following hypotheses are proposed: 1. A significant main effect of portion size will occur, such that children will consume more food, both in grams and kilocalories, in the large portion as compared to the small portion conditions. 2. A main effect of food type on caloric intake will occur, such that children will consume less calories in the applesauce condition as compared to the pudding condition, due to the differences in energy density of these foods. It is not anticipated that a difference in grams consumed from each food will occur.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All children that are â‰¥3 years of age enrolled in the ELC preschool with parental consent can participate. Eligible children must also like both the applesauce and the pudding, and be able to consume foods with a spoon. Children allergic to applesauce or chocolate pudding or who are lactose intolerant will not be included in the study. Did not attend all feeding sessions. Did not consume more than 5 grams from any of the foods on an occasion.</criteria>
