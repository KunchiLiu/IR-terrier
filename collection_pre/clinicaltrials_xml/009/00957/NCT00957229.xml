	<brief_title>To Determine The Efficacy and Safety of GDC-0449 in Patients With Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (BCNS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, 18 month, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled, two arm multicenter clinical study design. During the 18-month treatment period, the safety and chemopreventive efficacy of 150 mg/day GDC-0449 versus placebo will be assessed, and include evaluations of the skin at monthly intervals for the first three months and then every 3 months for the next 15 months. Removal of new surgically eligible BCCs (SEBs) will be done by primary skin care physicians (PSCPs) or at Study Centers. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review unblinded results for an interim analysis when 20 subjects have completed 12 months of drug. This review will focus on adverse events and efficacy results. Subjects will be monitored for the development of new SEBs after they discontinue study treatment. At the end of the 18 months, given that the observed adverse events are minimal, patients on placebo will be offered the opportunity to take GDC-0449 for 18 months in an open label continuation, followed by six months observation, and patients on GDC449 will be monitored for the next 24 months for assessment of the duration of benefit after stopping the drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject: has had diagnosed at least 10 SEB (of diameter 3 mm diameter or greater on the nose or periorbital skin, 5 mm or greater elsewhere on the face, or 9 mm or greater on nonfacial areas excluding the skin below the knees) during the two years before study entry, as documented histologically in physicians' records and/or diagnosed clinically by a Study Investigator at baseline. meet diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome is willing to abstain from application of nonstudy topical medications to the skin for the duration of the study, including prescription and over the counter preparations. Subjects will be encouraged to use sunscreen (SPF 15) at least once daily on all exposed skin sites. is willing to forego treatment of BCCs unless the BCCs are documented by Study Investigators, preferably on two separate visits, except when the PSCP believes that delay in treatment potentially might compromise the health of the subject. has normal laboratory tests as defined by the following: Normal hematopoietic capacity, Normal hepatic function: AST and ALT greater than or equal to 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin within normal range 0.20 mg/dl to 1.50 mg/dl or within 3x ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease Normal renal function: normal serum creatinine or measured creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/minute.

His partner must also use a form of birth control The subject: has used topical or systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of the study medication during the study. Specifically these include the use of: (i) glucocorticoids to more than 5% of the skin (ii) retinoids systemically or topically to more than 5% of the skin during the six months prior to study entry; (iii) alphahydroxy acids to more than 5% of the skin during the six months prior to study entry (iv) 5fluorouracil or imiquimod systemically or topically to the skin above the knees during the six months prior to study entry. (v) treatment with systemic chemotherapy within one year prior to starting study medication. has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medication formulations. is unable to return for followup visits and tests. has uncontrolled systemic disease, including known HIV positive patients. has history of congestive heart failure. has uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypokalemia has clinically important history of liver disease, including viral or hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis. has any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may put the subject at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study. has a history of invasive cancer within the past five years excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or CLL Stage 0. has current, recent (within 4 weeks of Day 1), or planned participation in an experimental drug study while enrolled in this study. is a female who is pregnant, plans to ever to become pregnant, capable of becoming pregnant or is breast feeding. is a male who is unwilling or unable to comply with pregnancy prevention measures.</criteria>
