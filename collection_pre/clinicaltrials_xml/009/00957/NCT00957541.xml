	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a new sensor-based diagnostic feature, which has been implemented in a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. This trial will study the effectiveness of the diagnostic feature to detect heart failure events in medically stable, ICD-indicated, congestive heart failure patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a new sensor-based diagnostic feature, which has been implemented in a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. This trial will study the effectiveness of the diagnostic feature to detect heart failure events in medically stable, ICD-indicated, congestive heart failure patients. The ability of the diagnostic feature to 'detect' and 'predict' heart failure events will be studied.</detailed_description>
