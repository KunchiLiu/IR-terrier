	<detailed_description>Stress shielding related bone resorption in the proximal femur after total hip arthroplasty continues to be a problem. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to evaluate which of the two anatomical stem designs achieved a more physiological load transfer by assessing bone mineral changes in the proximal femur after stem implantation.</detailed_description>
