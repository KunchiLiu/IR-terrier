	<brief_title>Accolade® TMZF® Hip Stem Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, post-market, multi-centered clinical evaluation of the Accolade® TMZF® hip stem device. All patients enrolled will receive the study device. All study patients will undergo a preoperative central Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to determine bone mineral density (BMD) values.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Patient is a candidate for a primary total hip replacement. 2. Patient has primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). 3. Male and nonpregnant female patients ages 18 to 90. 4. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form. 5. Patient willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation. 6. Patient capable of undergoing a preop central DXA (dualenergy xray absorptiometry) scan for a bone mineral density (BMD) reading. 1. Patient has an active infection within the affected hip joint. 2. Patient requires a revision surgery of a previously implanted total hip arthroplasty or hip fusion to the affected joint. 3. Patient who is morbidly obese, Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40. 4. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits ability to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device. 5. Patient has the following diagnosed systemic diseases: Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic bone disease and sickle cell anemia. 6.
