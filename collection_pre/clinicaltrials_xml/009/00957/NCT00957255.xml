	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, multi-center, controlled study for patients undergoing open rotator cuff repair. Patients are stratified based on tear size to one of three groups. Each group is then randomized 1:1 to either repair with OrthoADAPT or repair without OrthoADAPT.</brief_summary>
