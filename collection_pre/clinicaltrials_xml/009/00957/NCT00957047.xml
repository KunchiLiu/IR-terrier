	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate once-daily at doses of 400 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy over a 12-week maintenance period. Patients who complete Part I may enter a 1-year open-label extension.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part I was a 22-week parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled period (8 weeks baseline, 2 weeks double-blind titration, and 12 weeks maintenance). After completing the baseline period, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 3 ESL dose levels or to placebo. Part II was a 1-year open-label extension for patients who had completed Part I. The starting dose was 800 mg once daily and could be titrated up or down at 400-mg intervals between 400 and 1200 mg.</detailed_description>
