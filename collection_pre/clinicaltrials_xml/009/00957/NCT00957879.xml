	<brief_summary>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a new hormone which controls phosphate and vitamin D levels in humans. Excess FGF23 is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease. In this study the investigators are investigating the effects of different forms of vitamin D on FGF23 levels in the blood in order to increase our understanding of how this important hormone works.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a novel hormone involved in phosphate and vitamin D physiology. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), and tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO) are 3 rare diseases characterized by rickets/osteomalacia, fractures, and hypophosphatemia secondary to renal phosphate wasting and inappropriately low levels of activated vitamin D (calcitriol), which are caused by excess amounts of or mutated FGF23. FGF23 excess also occurs in renal failure, where elevated FGF23 levels predict increased mortality. Thus, abnormal FGF23 appears to be central to both rare and common diseases. While FGF23 appears to be regulated by vitamin D, dietary and serum phosphate, much is still unknown. The effects of different forms of vitamin D on FGF23 stimulation are not well characterized. Similarly, any racial differences in the regulation of FGF23 by vitamin D have not been investigated. To address these knowledge deficits, we will randomize 52 vitamin D deficient (25OHD &lt; or = 24 ng/mL by LC/MS) Caucasian and African-American men and women to treatment with either dietary vitamin D or activated vitamin D for 12 weeks. Our primary endpoint will be the change in FGF23 with dietary versus activated vitamin D.</detailed_description>
