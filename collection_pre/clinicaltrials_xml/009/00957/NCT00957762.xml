	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate different methods of measuring body composition (amount of fat, muscle, bone, and water in your body) and to determine relationships between body composition and other medical problems associated with spinal cord injury (SCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Composition Assessment in Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A preliminary investigation in our laboratory has demonstrated the advantage of using 4-compartment modeling to assess body composition in SCI adults. In comparing body composition analyses techniques in 20 individuals with SCI, we found Total Error to be 8.0% with Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, 8.4% with hydrodensitometry, 11.5% with bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 21.8% with standard skinfold equations when compared to 4-compartment modeling, the currently accepted gold standard for body composition assessment. To date there is no gold standard for the determination of body composition in SCI individuals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria for participation will include men and women within the age range of 1865 years old with C5L2 MotorComplete (ASIA A&amp;B) SCI of duration greater than 12 months to ensure a homogenous sample. Persons with uncompensated hypothyroidism, and/or renal disease will be excluded from the study. Additionally, individuals with uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia, recent (within 3 months) deep vein thrombosis Pressure ulcers &gt; Grade II will be excluded.</criteria>
