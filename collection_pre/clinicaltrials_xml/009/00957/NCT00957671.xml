	<brief_summary>Fifteen to twenty percent of adults who suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that requires hospitalization and rehabilitation have been found to have growth hormone (GH) deficiency by GH stimulation testing. Moreover, abnormalities have also been established for the cortisol and thyroid axis. The hypothesis of this proposal is that hormone replacement in TBI patients with documented abnormalities in the GH, thyroid, or cortisol axis will improve muscle function, body composition, aerobic capacity (GH) and tests of neuropsychologic function (GH, thyroid, cortisol).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Pituitary Hormone Replacement in Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol is designed to screen and detect evidence of pituitary hormone deficiency in adults following traumatic brain injury. Treatment period for thyroid or cortisol deficiency will be six months. Growth hormone deficiency will be replaced for a period of one year followed by a second year of open label treatment to allow individuals in the placebo group an opportunity to demonstrate a response to hormone replacement. Subject will not be screened until at least one year following brain injury to allow for natural recovery of hormone function.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged 21 and older. Documented moderate to severe traumatic brain injury at least one year post injury. The only absolute exclusionary medication will be an anticoagulant (Coumadin) because of the risk of bleeding during the possible muscle biopsy procedure and daily injections of rhGH in the GH arm of the study. Any subject with a history of hepatitis or a 3fold elevation of liver function tests (Alk phos, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)). We are uncertain of the effects of hormone replacement such as rhGH on the liver, so we will exclude any subjects with hepatitis. This exclusion applies only to subjects who would be enrolled in the GH arm of the study. Subjects who are deficient in cortisol or thyroid at screening will be excluded until hormone abnormalities have been corrected. Subjects with chronic pain who are being managed with narcotics will be excluded as the effects of central nervous system depressants may interfere with study test results.</criteria>
