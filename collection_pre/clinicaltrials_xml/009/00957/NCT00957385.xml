	<brief_title>Maintenance Therapy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present, the majority of AML patients &gt;60 years of age that achieve CR and thereafter successfully complete further chemotherapy, are not candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) due to their age. Rather, this group of patients is simply observed until relapse occurs. In this age group, the median duration of CR is only ~10 months. The survival of patients &lt;60 years of age who are not candidates for transplantation (due to donor unavailability), and who are in CR2 or higher is also extremely poor. Several lines of evidence suggest that the immune system - and in particular AML specific CTLs and NK cells - is capable of recognizing and clearing AML cells.</detailed_description>
