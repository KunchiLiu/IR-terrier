	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Alogliptin in Children, Adolescents and Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alogliptin is a selective, orally available inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 being developed by Takeda Global Research &amp; Development as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) prolongs the action of 2 important incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). These hormones are responsible for increasing insulin synthesis, regulating β-cell proliferation, inhibiting gastric emptying, and inhibiting glucagon secretion. To date, alogliptin has not been studied in participants less than 18 years of age. As with adults, there is growing evidence of an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents. This study is designed to determine the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of alogliptin in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These profiles will be compared with those of similarly matched adult participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and safety endpoints will be analyzed.</detailed_description>

Participant was capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements and was willing to sign the ICF prior to the initiation of any study procedures for gender and race matched adult participants with T2DM only. 11. Participant weighed at least 50 kg (110 pounds) and had a Screening BMI between 23 kg/m^2 and 45 kg/m^2 (except for Asian or Asiandescendant participants for whom the range was between 20 kg/m^2 and 35 kg/m^2), inclusive for gender and race matched T2DM adult participants only. 12. Participants had a diagnosis of T2DM (noninsulin dependent) based on diagnostic criteria of the ADA. Criteria included: 1. Fasting plasma glucose level of ≥ 126 mg/dL where fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours, or 2. 2hour plasma glucose level of ≥ 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test, or 3. random plasma glucose level of ≥ 200 mg/dL, or 4. HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. 13. Diagnosis could have been historical (documented) or participants could have been diagnosed for this study. 14. Participants may have been taking concomitant metformin if the dose was stable for at least 30 days prior to Day 1. 15. Participants may have been taking statin or antihypertensive drugs if the dose was stable for at least 30 days prior to Day 1. Inclusion criteria for all participants (Groups 1, 2, and 3): 16. Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants who were sexually active agreed to routinely use adequate contraception from Screening until 30 days after receiving the dose of study drug. NOTE: Women not of childbearing potential were defined as those who were surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation) or who were postmenopausal (defined as at least 45 years of age and 1 year since last regular menses). 17.
