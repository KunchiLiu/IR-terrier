	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer kills forty five people in France every day. Epidemiological studies suggest that two cases out of three could be prevented and show that processed meat intake is a consistent risk factor. The aim of this study is to understand how meat promotes cancer, to find protective strategies, and to make compelling dietary recommendations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>18 healthy volunteers will be randomized and will start the study. The study will last 4 weeks for each subject. The first week will be a week of adaptation (or run-in period) to the diet which they will have to follow for the duration of study. During this period, they will collect 2 samples of stools and urine. Then subjects will alternate 4 days of diet either with ham, or with ham and calcium, or with ham enriched with vitamin E. At least, 3 days will separate every period (wash-out) of nutritional intervention. Urines and stools will be collected last 3 days of every interventional period and also last day of every wash out period.</detailed_description>
