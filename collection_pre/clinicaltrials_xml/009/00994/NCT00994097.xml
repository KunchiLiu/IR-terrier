	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) when NGR-hTNF is added to standard chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin/gemcitabine or cisplatin/pemetrexed) in locally advanced (stage IIIb with supraclavicular lymph node metastases or malignant pleural or pericardial effusion), metastatic (stage IV) or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NGR-hTNF in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy to Treat Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to a standard chemotherapy regimen plus low-dose (0.8 mcg/m^2) NGR-hTNF or standard chemotherapy alone, through a centralized randomization process using the following stratification factors: performance status (0 vs 1) and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). In both arms the choice between the two chemotherapy regimens will be based on the histologic subtype: in patients with squamous histology (including also generic diagnosis of NSCLC without further subtype classification) is recommended cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen, in patients with nonsquamous histology (including adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma) is recommended cisplatin/pemetrexed regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Histologically or cytologically documented inoperable, locally advanced (stage IIIb with supraclavicular lymph node metastases or malignant pleural or pericardial effusion), metastatic (stage IV) or recurrent NSCLC. Mixed tumors should be categorized according to the predominant cell type. 2. Age ≥18 years 3. Life expectancy more than 3 months 4. ECOG performance status 01 5. At least one unidimensional measurable lesion (as per RECIST criteria) 6. Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows: Neutrophils &gt;1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN AST and/or ALT &lt;2.5 x ULN in absence of liver metastasis AST and/or ALT &lt;5 x ULN in presence of liver metastasis Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance (estimated according to CockcroftGault formula) ≥ 50 ml/min 7. Patients may have had prior therapy providing the following conditions are met: Radiation therapy: washout period of 28 days Surgery: washout period of 14 days 8. Patients must give written informed consent to participate in the study Exclusion criteria: 1. Prior chemotherapy or treatment with another systemic anticancer agent (for example monoclonal antibody, tyrosine kinase inhibitor). 2. Patients must not receive any other investigational agents while on study 3. Patients with myocardial infarction within the last six (6) months, unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart failure, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication 4. Uncontrolled hypertension 5. Prolonged QTc interval (congenital or acquired) 6. Patient with significant peripheral vascular disease 7. History or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease unless adequately treated (e.g., primary brain tumor, any brain metastasis, seizure not controlled with standard medical therapy, or history of stroke). 8. Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic disease/infections or with serious illness or medical conditions, which is incompatible with the protocol 9. Known hypersensitivity/allergic reaction or contraindications to human albumin preparations or to any of the excipients 10. Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol 11. Pregnancy or lactation. Patients both males and females with reproductive potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to registration.</criteria>
