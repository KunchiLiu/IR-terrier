	<brief_summary>We previously published a comparative split-face study which has shown a significant, albeit moderate, effect of ablative fractional laser treatment. While indicating that a single session with fractional ablative lasers can be effective in the treatment of peri-orbital wrinkles, the trial also revealed substantial disagreement between the different end points (profilometry, Fitzpatrick wrinkle score, patient satisfaction). Since the PBI is a patient-related index it could not be included in the aforementioned split-face trial; the present study therefore attempts to further elucidate the patient-related benefit of a single fractional ablative laser treatment session as well as carefully analyse the respective correlations between the outcome parameters employed.</brief_summary>
