	<brief_summary>The objective is to test a novel paradigm for the inhibition of human preterm uterine contractions. The study hypothesis is that human preterm contractions can be safely inhibited with a weak electrical current provided by an electrical inhibition/uterine pacemaker device. Preterm birth is still a major problem. Current methods of preventing the uterine contractions of preterm are limited and associated with many side-effects affecting both the mother and baby. A reliable method of preventing preterm uterine contractions would be an important discovery. Such a method could eventually lead to a long-term goal of decreasing neonatal morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Electronic Uterine Contraction Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design is a Pilot Study to confirm the safety of the uterine inhibitor/pacemaker and measure its effect on women experiencing preterm labor. A total of 10 (ten) patients will be enrolled in this pilot study to confirm the methodology and safety of the device. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be recruited for the study. The study device (EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker) has been classified by FDA as an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) number G080036, Class A device. The EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device is FDA cleared for research of the prevention of the prevention of the human contractions of preterm birth. This proposal is for an initial prospective FDA approved pilot study. After FDA evaluation of the pilot study findings and approval, the pilot study may lead eventually to a prospective randomized controlled clinical study. Only adult women who are experiencing uterine contractions due to the birthing process are eligible. Study patients will be informed about the purpose of the EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device and give informed consent prior to its use. The device will be used for only 20 minutes, preceded and followed by a 20 minute control period. During the birthing process recordings of the uterine contractions will be recorded. Comparison will be made of these uterine contraction records pre and post use use of the EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device. The uterine contraction tracings will be compared and analyzed for differences in the frequency of contractions. The patients will also be told how to express the strength of any of their subjective pain in a manner that can be documented in a questionnaire. Study patients will also have their record of the type and amount of pain medication they have received noted on their patient log forms. RISK: Previous human and animal studies indicate minimal risk to either baby or mother. Human studies showed no effect on the fetal or maternal heart rate. Real-time monitoring of the fetal and maternal heart rate during the study will protect against there potential risks. BENEFIT: Reducing the frequency of preterm uterine contractions is a first step to preventing preterm birth,but the proposed investigation is not, itself, expected to prevent any preterm births. However, the investigation could have great benefit to future mothers and their babies.</detailed_description>
