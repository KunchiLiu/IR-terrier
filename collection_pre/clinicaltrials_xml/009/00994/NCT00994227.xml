	<brief_summary>this study is to analyze and compare the ultrastructure of the retinal and vitreous plane of the epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane removed during macular surgery and to evaluate relation between the ultrastructure of the epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane and surgical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinicopathologic Findings for Macular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>prospective, interventional study and includes patients who underwent vitrectomy,peeling of an epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane excision with or without intraoperative intraocular ICG injection. Excised specimens were placed on a Millipore filter, fixed in a paraformaldehyde solution, and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate-lead citrate and inspected in a Zeiss EM electron microscope. The assessment was done in a blinded, masked fashion so that the clinicians who reviewed the histologic specimens</detailed_description>
