	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravenous magnesium infusion before reperfusion with employing some clinical parameters including blood lactate levels, because the intraoperative changes in the blood lactate levels after hepatic allograft reperfusion served as an accurate predictor of the initial graft function in living donor liver transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinically significant hemodynamic deterioration occurs immediately after reperfusion of the grafted liver by unclamping of the portal vein. Profound hypotension, bradycardia, systemic vasodilation, and a decrease in cardiac output have been reported, and this is described as postreperfusion syndrome (PRS). This hemodynamic instability usually requires adequate and aggressive cardiovascular pharmacologic management and fluid support, and recovers slowly over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.Because the severity of PRS correlates with patient and allograft outcome, prevention of its occurrence or attenuation of the hemodynamic changes may improve outcome. However, not much is known about how to protect against this reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury also occurs in myocardial infarction, ischemic spinal cord injury and stroke. Recent experiments have shown protective effects of magnesium to reduce the reperfusion injury of these conditions. Magnesium administration may provide cellular protection during ischemia and reperfusion with stabilizing the cellular transmembrane potential, suppressing excessive cellular calcium influx and energy demand.</detailed_description>
