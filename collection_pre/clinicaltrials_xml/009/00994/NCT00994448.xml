	<brief_summary>Dr Keith Heinzerling, who is a doctor at UCLA, is doing a research study with Behavioral Health Services in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles to find out if a medication called bupropion can help adolescents (age 14-21) reduce or stop using methamphetamine. Bupropion is a drug that is already on the market, which means it has been approved by the FDA, but it has not been approved to treat methamphetamine abuse. What the study is trying to find out is if bupropion helps people to stop using methamphetamine. The study lasts up to 14 weeks and involves visits to the BHS clinic in Lincoln Heights twice a week. The first two weeks involve completion of questionnaires and assessments, including a physical exam, a blood test, EKG (a test that checks for problems with the electrical activity of a person's heart), and a psychological interview, to see if you are eligible for the study. If you are eligible, then you will be assigned by chance to take either the bupropion pills or placebo pills, which are pills that look the same, but contain no medication. This type of study is called a "double blind study" because neither you nor any of the study staff will know which medication you are taking. During the 8 weeks of taking the pills, you'll visit the clinic to complete additional questionnaires and assessments, to provide urine samples for testing for methamphetamine, and for once a week drug abuse counseling. At the end of your treatment, you'll have another physical exam including blood tests and the same test on your heart and then we'll ask you to come to the clinic once a week for four weeks for follow-up assessments. You'll be compensated for time spent doing research activities and for returning empty medication packages. The total compensation possible is $332 in gift cards for places such as Target, iTunes, groceries, and gas. Your participation in the study is voluntary and deciding not to participate or deciding to stop participating at any time during the study is okay.</brief_summary>
