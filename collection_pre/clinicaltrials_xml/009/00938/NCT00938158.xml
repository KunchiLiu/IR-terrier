	<brief_title>A Study of the Pharmacokinetics of Albiglutide in Normal and Renally Impaired Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This adaptive design, non-randomized, open-label, staggered parallel group study evaluates the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single subcutaneously injected dose of albiglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with varying degrees of renal function. During Stage 1, a single dose of albiglutide will be administered to subjects with normal renal function and subjects with moderate-to-severe renal impairment not requiring hemodialysis. In addition to subjects with normal renal function and moderate renal impairment, Stage 2 of the study will also include cohorts of subjects requiring hemodialysis, subjects with severe renal impairment not requiring hemodialysis, and potentially subjects with mild renal impairment.</detailed_description>
