	<brief_title>A Multicenter, Open-Label Study To Investigate The Safety And Pharmacokinetics Of Lacosamide In Children With Partial Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six subjects aged 5-11 (Cohort 1) were initially enrolled at the 8 mg/kg/day dose level. Upon completion of the study for these subjects, pharmacokinetic and safety data were analyzed to determine the target dose for the remaining subjects (either 8, 10 or 12 mg/kg/day). Depending on the selected target dose, four additional age-based cohorts of subjects were to be enrolled. LCM was increased 2 mg/kg/day per week until the target dose or maximum dose able to be tolerated was achieved.</detailed_description>
