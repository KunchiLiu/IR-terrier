	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that pregabalin will decrease post-operative pain scores and analgesic use following total mastectomy compared to placebo. The primary outcome will be acute postoperative pain, measured by a verbal numerical rating score (VNRS) and total analgesic consumption during postoperative 48 hours. The secondary outcome will be VNRS at 1 week and 1 month after operation.</brief_summary>
