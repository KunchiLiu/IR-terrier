	<brief_title>Comparing Local Anesthesia With General Anesthesia for Breast Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental and clinical studies have shown that surgical trauma and stress affects the immune system including both the innate and adaptive immune responses. The break of immune homeostasis might enhance tumor growth and spread. Minimal invasive surgical procedures have been shown to be beneficial to patients in terms of preserving better systemic immune function. Impaired cellular immunity after general anesthesia has significant undesirable effects on tumor surveillance after breast surgery. The local block technique might avoid the surgery inducing neuroendocrine, metabolic, and cytokine responses, which will offer some advantages from better preservation of early postoperative cellular immune function and attenuate disturbance in the inflammatory mediators. Our research will focus on the effects of local block anesthesia on mediators that may be important in inflammatory response, tumor cell dissemination, deposition, and propagation in the early postoperative period. As importantly, local block method is not only a safe procedure but also reduces the need for post operative opioids and prevents nausea following breast cancer which can result in markedly reduced hospital stay and health costs. It is plausible that inhibition of the surgical responses by local block anesthesia may attenuate perioperative tumor enhancing factors and/or potential beneficial actions of lidocaine infiltration combined with propofol sedation per se in anticancer effect to have better cancer control.</detailed_description>
