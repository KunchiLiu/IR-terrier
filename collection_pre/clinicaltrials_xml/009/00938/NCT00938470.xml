	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy works compared with fluorouracil when given together with oxaliplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine, Fluorouracil, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Cancer of the Esophagus or Gastroesophageal Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess and compare the pathologic complete response (PCR) rate of patients in Arm A receiving the sequence docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (DOC) followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and radiation therapy (RT) with patients in Arm B receiving only 5-FU, oxaliplatin and RT in patients with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma (ACA) of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or gastric cardia. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the adverse event (AE) profile and safety of the proposed treatment in this population. II. To assess and compare the overall survival (OS) between treatment arms. III. To assess and compare the disease-free survival between treatment arms. IV. To assess and compare the clinical tumor response rate of the proposed regiments when administered before surgery between treatment arms. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the second course, patients receive fluorouracil* IV continuously on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy** 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 4-12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients undergo surgery. ARM II: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy and then surgery as in Arm I. - NOTE: * Fluorouracil continuous IV infusion begins within 24 hours of radiotherapy and ends within 24 hours of radiotherapy completion. - NOTE: ** Radiotherapy should begin within 2-6 weeks after completion of 2 courses of docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
