	<brief_summary>This multicenter, prospective, observational registry will assess efficacy and safety outcomes associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of the CYPHER Select™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stents in Chinese diabetic patients with coronary artery disease in routine clinical practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study objective is to assess the incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; defined as a composite of clinically driven target-lesion revascularization, cardiac death, any myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis) at 12-month follow-up, and of stent thrombosis at 1-day, and 1- and 12-month follow-up. Pre-specified analyses will be performed among patient subpopulations according to level of glycemic control (HbA1c level &lt; 6.5% or &gt; 6.5%); reference vessel diameter by quantitative coronary angiography (&lt; 2.5 mm and &gt; 2.5 mm); and stented length (8-18 mm; 23-33 mm; and &gt;33 mm). Quantitative coronary angiographic (QCA) analysis will be performed at the core lab of the China Cardiovascular Research Foundation for all pre- and post-index procedure angiograms and during the 12-month follow-up period for the pre- and post-reintervention procedures in those cases of clinically-driven PCI revascularization. Also, multivariable analyses will be conducted to investigate potential predictors of 12-month MACE rate in routine clinical practice. The registry will be conducted at about 45 centers in China, where the CYPHER Select™+ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is commercially available. Data will be collected on 2,500 diabetic patients treated with the CYPHER Select™ + Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent only. Primary outcome: MACE (clinically driven TLR, cardiac death, MI, ST) at 12 months Secondary outcome: ARC (probable + definite) ST at 1-day, and 1 and 12 months</detailed_description>
