	<brief_summary>This protocol is designed to evaluate the BRADA and ABILHAND questionnaires in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients that will be treated with an effective therapy. Patients with moderate to severe RA treated with tocilizumab will be asked to complete the BRADA and ABILHAND questionnaires at screening, baseline, after 12 weeks and after 24 weeks of treatment. All other assessments and questionnaires from daily clinical practice (such as the global assessment of disease activity by the patient, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the SF36 questionnaire, measurement of ESR and CRP and the DAS 28 calculation), will also be used to evaluate these questionnaires.</brief_summary>
