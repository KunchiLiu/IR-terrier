	<brief_summary>Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer can be treated successfully with chemotherapy and radiation. However, the cure rate is low. This study is carried out to find out whether giving radiotherapy at a higher dose over fewer treatment sessions with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can improve the treatment outcome. This study aims to recruit 43 patients from National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital over a period of about 2 years.</brief_summary>
