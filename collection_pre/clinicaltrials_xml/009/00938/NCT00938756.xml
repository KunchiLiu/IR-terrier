	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with cancer or meningeal syndrome may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying cerebrospinal fluid samples in diagnosing carcinomatous meningitis in patients with cancer or meningeal syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cerebrospinal Fluid Samples in Diagnosing Carcinomatous Meningitis in Patients With Cancer or Meningeal Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the validity of determining CA 15-3 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using automated immuno-enzymatic methods. Secondary - Determine the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in assessing CA 15-3 in CSF. - Assess favorability of intrathecal production of CA 15-3. - Determine threshold interpretations of CA 15-3 levels in CSF. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Within 15 days of suspected meningeal involvement, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected. Samples are examined by immunoenzyme assays. Patients with suspected cases of carcinomatous meningitis undergo cerebrospinal MRI.</detailed_description>
