	<brief_title>Metabolome and Microbiomic in Fecal Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Human fecal collection for clinical or research studies usually occurs at the residence of the subject, an environment not equipped with measures to accommodate proper preparation and storage of samples for microbiome and metabolome analysis. Aims To evaluate the effects of storage and handling on fecal samples collected for metabolomic, proteomic and microbiomic and analysis. Methods Fecal samples will be collected within several minutes of voiding from healthy infants at the time of diaper change at day-care center. Samples will be divided into 7 tubes, and subjected to different storage temperatures, before preforming microbial analysis by DNA sequencing, and metabolome analysis by H1NMR spectroscoty.</detailed_description>
