	<brief_summary>Asses the effect of the use of Patient State Index (PSI) monitoring on difference in emergence profiles in the elderly (age &gt;65 yrs) population to develop a cost-benefit profile. Assess differences in Quality of Life using the QoR-40 (a validated 40-item questionnaire on quality of recovery from anesthesia) between the two treatment groups.</brief_summary>
