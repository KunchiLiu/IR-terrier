	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. Specific attention should be given to the compliance potential of subjects with suspected or known drug or alcohol abuse. A man or woman 65 years of age or older at the time of vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Free of an acute aggravation of the health status as established by clinical evaluation before entering into the study. Any confirmed or suspected influenza illness within the last 6 months. Previous vaccination against influenza with any seasonal vaccine since December 2008. Planned administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccines during the entire study period. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrolment in this study. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol up to Visit 2. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone &gt;= 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s) including egg and chicken protein, included history of hypersensitivity to a previous dose of influenza vaccine. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 37.5Â°C on oral setting. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Any medical conditions in which intramuscular injections are contraindicated.</criteria>
