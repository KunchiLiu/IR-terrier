	<brief_title>Calmer Life: A Worry Reduction Program for Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary work in a related study (H-22763) suggests that a significant percentage of older patients think that incorporating religion and/or spirituality into counseling is important. Based on data from this study, available scholarly literature, and input from consultants, we have developed an initial version of Calmer Life that is sufficiently flexible to incorporate a range of religious and spiritual beliefs and coping skills based on each patient's unique values and beliefs. The manual for this treatment includes intervention components from evidence-based treatment for late-life anxiety (H-23798; H-15958), suggested strategies for incorporating religion or spirituality into the coping skills for anxiety and depression, and spiritually-based interventions (e.g., forgiveness, gratitude). Patients have a choice to include or not include religious or spiritually based components. The proposed project will begin to test this broad spiritually based CBT for older adults (Calmer Life) with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with or without depression. Further modifications to the Calmer Life manual and in the treatment approach will be made based on patient, clinician, and consultant input.</detailed_description>
