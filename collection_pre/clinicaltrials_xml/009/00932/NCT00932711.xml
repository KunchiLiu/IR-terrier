	<brief_title>Effect of Educational Intervention in Patients With Low-Risk Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is growing evidence about the effectiveness of case management in preventing adverse events in patients with high-risk chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). But the majority of COPD patients belong to the low-risk category. We propose that a less intense educational intervention will have a similar beneficial effect in reducing hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits in this larger group of low-risk COPD patients.</detailed_description>
