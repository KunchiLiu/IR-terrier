	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open labeled, prospective, randomized, controlled phase I/II study designed to assess the clinical performance of chemoembolization with LC Bead, loaded with irinotecan in combination with intravenous chemotherapy and bevacizumab versus intravenous chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in the treatment of unresectable liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: Patients over 18 years of age, of any race or sex, who have histologic or radiologic proof of colorectal cancer to the liver, who are able to give informed consent, will be eligible. Patients with at least one measurable liver metastases, with size &gt; 1cm (modified RECIST criteria) Patients with liver dominant disease defined as ≥80% tumor body burden confined to the liver Patients with patent main portal vein ECOG Performance Status score of &lt; 2 Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months Nonpregnant with an acceptable contraception in premenopausal women. Hematologic function: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥75 x109/L, INR ≤1.3* (*If patient is on anticoagulants, they must be able to stop medication temporarily prior to TACE and must have INR ≤1.3 prior to receiving TACE) Adequate liver function as measured by: Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dl, ALT, AST ≤5 times ULN, albumin ≥2.5g/dl, Adequate Hemoglobin and Hematocrit as measured by (Male: for approximate 45 62%; and approximate Female: 37 48%) or Hemoglobin (Male: approximate 13 18 gm/dL Female: approximate 12 16 gm/dL). If patient is asymptomatic with Hemoglobin for male 10 to 12.9 or Female 9.5 to 11.9 and do not wish to be transfused they still will be eligible for treatment. Adequate renal function (creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dl) Women of child bearing potential and fertile men are required to use effective contraception (negative serum βHCG for women of childbearing age) Signed, written informed consent Patient is at least one month out from any treatment for Stage III colorectal cancer Patient is at least one year out from any treatment for their Stage IV colorectal cancer. these patients should not be candidates for curative treatments, and will have recovered from any chemotherapeutic toxicities' they may have experienced." Less than 60% liver tumor replacement Exclusion: "Any patient eligible for curative treatment (i.e. resection or radiofrequency ablation). Note: resectability is defined as a single tumor &lt;5cm with adequate liver function defined: Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dl" nonresectability includes patients with greater than 6, tumors close to blood vessels, patients with hepaticpulmonary shunting, or patients of poor performance" Active bacterial, viral or fungal infection within 72 hours of study entry Women who are pregnant or breast feeding Allergy to contrast media that cannot be managed with standard care (e.g. steroids), making magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) contraindicated. Presence of another malignancy with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and stage I basal or squamous carcinoma of the skin. Any contraindication for hepatic embolization procedures: Large shunt as determined by the investigator (pretesting with TcMMA not required) Severe atheromatosis Hepatofugal blood flow Main portal vein occlusion (e.g. thrombus or tumor) Other significant medical or surgical condition, or any medication or treatment, that would place the patient at undue risk and that would preclude the safe use of chemoembolization or would interfere with study participation Patients with prior contraindications for the use of irinotecan therapythis would include chronic inflammatory bowel disease and or bowel obstruction, history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to irinotecan hypochloride, trihydrate, lactic acid or to any of the excipients of Camptostar, severe bone marrow failure, history of Gilbert Syndrome or concomitant use with St. John's Wort Patients with prior contraindications for the use of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin or bevacizumab</criteria>
