	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2 trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PF-02341066 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a specific gene profile involving the ALK gene. This trial will also allow patients from a Phase 3 trial who received standard of care chemotherapy (Study A8081007) to receive PF-02341066.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer positive for the ALK fusion gene (test provided by either a central laboratory. Local laboratory may be used for certain cases) may have received pemetrexed or docetaxel from previous Phase 3 trial (A8081007) and discontinued treatment due to Response Evaluation Criterion in Solid Tumors (RECIST)defined progression. or, once the primary endpoint of Study A8081007 has been analyzed and the results made available, at any time without RECISTdefined progression. Tumors can be measurable or non measurable prior treatment with PF02341066 received no prior systemic treatment, chemotherapy or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer current enrollment in another therapeutic clinical trial</criteria>
