	<brief_title>The Effect of Kinesio Taping on Ankle Proprioception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The a priori hypothesis of this study is that proprioception (knee repositioning error) and balance (sway velocity and center of pressure) will improve significantly after intervention (Kinesiotape) in participants with a history of acute or chronic ankle sprains/strains.</detailed_description>
