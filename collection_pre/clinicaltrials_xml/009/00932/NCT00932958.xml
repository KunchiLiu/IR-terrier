	<brief_summary>This protocol describes an observational study whose goal is to collect de-identified Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) acquisition factors and interpretations (findings) from several hundred U.S. and international imaging facilities. The study uses an electronic data capture tool to collect de-identified CCTA utilization parameters and clinical findings in order to create a multi-center registry. This registry will be used for scientific analysis and publication of pertinent medical trends such as CT utilization, radiation dose, and common cardiovascular findings. The registry will be used to determine areas of interest for future randomized controlled trials. All data will be collected with patient identifiers removed and in complete accordance with HIPAA regulations. All data will be analyzed in aggregate, thus further minimizing the risk of patient confidentiality violations.</brief_summary>
