	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare functional and radiographic results, range of motion of the knee, patient satisfaction, femoral component, revision and complication rates in patients receiving either a standard posterior cruciate substituting-flex (LPS-flex) or gender-specific posterior cruciate substituting-flex (LPS-Flex) total knee prosthesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Gender-Specific Posterior Cruciate-Substituting High-Flexion Knee Prosthesis Does Not Improve Fit and Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently much debate and discussion has focused on the effect of gender-specific total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to compare functional and radiographic results, range of motion of the knee, patient satisfaction, femoral component, revision and complication rates in patients receiving either a standard posterior cruciate substituting-flex (LPS-flex) or gender-specific posterior cruciate substituting-flex (LPS-Flex) total knee prosthesis.</detailed_description>
