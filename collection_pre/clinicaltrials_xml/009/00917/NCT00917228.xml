	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the feasibility of a biofeedback system aimed at reducing overpressures during seated posture. The system consists of (1) a pressure sensors map, (2) a laptop that couples sensors with actuators, (3) a Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a wireless circuit embedded in a dental retainer with a matrix of electrodes. The principle of this biofeedback system consists in (1) detecting overpressures in people who are seated over long periods of time, (2) estimating a postural change that could reduce these overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional information transmitted by the TDU. It is hypothesized that overpressures are diminished after biofeedback.</brief_summary>
