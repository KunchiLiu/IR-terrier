	<brief_summary>The purpose of the investigation is to verify the efficiency of the HyperQ™ system in detecting exercise induced ischemia, with higher specificity and sensitivity than conventional ECG Stress testing. The study will be carried out by applying the HyperQ™ system during cycle ergometer stress testing in patients who are referred for angiography at the Department of Cardiology, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany. The HyperQ™ results will then be compared to the standard ECG stress test results using the angiography results as the gold standard. The study will be considered successful if analysis of the HyperQ provides a statistically significant improvement over the diagnostic accuracy of conventional ECG stress testing analysis.</brief_summary>
