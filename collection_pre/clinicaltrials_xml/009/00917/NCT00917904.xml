	<brief_title>An Expanded Safety Study of Dapivirine Gel 4789 in Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To reduce the influence of adherence as a factor in the interpretation of efficacy results, IPM is considering using a DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) based method for vaginal microbicide gel delivery in a future Phase III study. IPM has denoted this DOT based method as Daily Monitored Adherence (DMA). IPM014B is a Phase I/II study designed: (1) to assess and compare the safety of a once daily application of Dapivirine Gel 4789, 0.05% 2.5g and a matching vehicle placebo gel; (2) to assess the acceptability of a once daily application of Dapivirine gel 4789, 0.05% 2.5g and a matching vehicle placebo gel; and (3) to assess the feasibility of utilizing the DMA method for a large-scale phase III efficacy study.</detailed_description>
