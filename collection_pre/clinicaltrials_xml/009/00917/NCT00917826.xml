	<criteria>Age ≥ 3 years. (No dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of valganciclovir in patients &lt; 16 years of age.) Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months. ECOG Performance Status 02 or Karnofsky Performance Scale ≥ 60%. Baseline (untransfused) HbF level &gt; 2% Normal organ and marrow function defined as: (i) absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1,000/µL. (ii) platelets ≥ 50,000/ µL. (iii) total bilirubin of ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of normal. (iv) AST (SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) of ≤ 2.0 x institutional upper limit of normal. (v) creatinine within normal range for institution. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Able and willing to give informed consent. Patients that have received chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entry, or those who have not recovered form adverse events due to agents administered 4 weeks earlier. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Arginine Butyrate, ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Patients who have an acute myocardial infarction or onset of atrial fibrillation within the past 6 months. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to , ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Tumor impinging on an organ or anatomical structure deemed critical by the investigator. Pregnant women.</criteria>
