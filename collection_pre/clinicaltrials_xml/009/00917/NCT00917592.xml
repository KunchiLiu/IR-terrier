	<brief_summary>Medical treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is not standardized and there is an enormous diversity in clinical practice. The investigators' aim was to demonstrate that uncomplicated diverticulitis can be managed with oral amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid with a short hospital admission.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Assessing the Efficacy of a Short Course of Intravenous Antibiotic Followed by Oral Antibiotic in Uncomplicated Acute Diverticulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized trial was established to compare patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who received oral antibiotic after a short course of intravenous antibiotic, with those who received intravenous antibiotic for a longer period. We included 50 patients, 25 in each group. Patients in group 1 begun oral antibiotic as soon as they improved and were discharged the day after. Patients in group 2 received intravenous antibiotic for 7 days. Both groups received oral antibiotic at discharge. The endpoint of the study was "failure of treatment" which was defined as the impossibility of discharging on the expected day, emergency admission or hospital readmission.</detailed_description>
