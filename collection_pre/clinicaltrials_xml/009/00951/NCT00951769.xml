	<brief_summary>This is a non-human study, conducted in a simulation environment, with simulator manikins, and volunteers from anaesthesia. Trainees in their first 2 years of anaesthetics training will be randomised to a control group, a group following the Difficult Airway Society UK's Guidelines and the Australian Difficult Airway management algorithm. A simulated difficult airway will be created during the induction of anaesthesia. The investigators will examine adherence to guidelines, which would have been provided to participants before the experiment, as well as compare their performance with the guidelines.</brief_summary>
