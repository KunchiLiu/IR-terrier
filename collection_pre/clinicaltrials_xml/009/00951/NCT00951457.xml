	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the percentage of patients achieving a response, defined as the percentage of patients achieving complete response, partial response and stable disease/ no change upon treatment with the combination therapy according to NCI response criteria (also established according to IWCLL guidelines) upon treatment with a combination of bendamustine and alemtuzumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Combined With Alemtuzumab in Pretreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bendamustine combined with alemtuzumab in patients with pretreated CD20-positive CLL (according to the revised NCI/ IWCLL criteria). Eligible patients will receive bendamustine as 4 courses of 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 every 28 days and 30 mg alemtuzumab s.c. continuously on days 1, 3 and 5 of every week, for a maximum of 16 weeks. Safety assessments will be conducted weekly; efficacy assessments including imaging will be performed at months 2, 4, 6, 10 and 16. Bone marrow biopsies will be performed upon CR (according to the 2008 IWCLL response criteria) or fixed at 6 and 16 months. Following recruitment of the first 3 and 7 patients safety evaluations will be performed by a data safety monitoring board. An interim analysis for response and safety as well as maximum tolerated dose levels will occur after the first 7 patients have completed treatment (Gehan timepoint). If the treatment is deemed clinically safe a further 13 patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
