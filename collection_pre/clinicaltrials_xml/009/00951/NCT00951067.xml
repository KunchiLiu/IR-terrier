	<brief_title>Pneumatic Compression Treatment For Upper Extremity Acquired Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will compare 5 non-invasive lymphedema treatments. Patients will be assigned to either: - A combination of arm exercises, arm elevation, and wearing of a compression garment every day OR - One of four possible pneumatic compression devices for just two hours every day. Pneumatic compression devices are made up of an inflatable sleeve connected to a small controller unit that is plugged into the wall. They feel like having your blood pressure taken. None of the treatments are experimental. None of the treatments are invasive. All the treatments are considered standard of care and are used in clinics throughout the United States. All of the treatments will be done at home. The trial will last for 7 and 1/2 months and will require follow-up visits to monitor progress.</detailed_description>
