	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to utilize Trinity Evolution in conjunction with an interbody spacer and supplemental anterior fixation of the surgeon's choice and to follow the patients to measure the clinical outcomes and rate of fusion. The hypothesis of the study is that Trinity Evolution combined with an interbody spacer and supplemental anterior fixation will result in fusion rates and clinical outcomes similar to those with other routinely used autograft and allograft materials including: fusion, improvement in pain and function, maintenance of upper extremity neurological function, and absence of serious adverse events related to the use of the Trinity Evolution product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trinity Evolution in Anterior Cervical Disectomy and Fusion (ACDF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When conservative care fails to alleviate the pain and neurological deficits caused by degenerative disc disease in a cervical spine, the most common recourse is surgical decompression of the affected nerves and/or spinal cord. Decompression is often accomplished via an anterior approach whereby essentially the entire disc as well as any bony osteophytes and ligaments that are compressing the spinal cord and/or nerves are removed. While usually successful at decompressing affected neural structures, the decompression often results in collapse of the disc space, instability and recurrent symptomatology. Most anterior cervical decompressions therefore are followed by insertion of a structural interbody spacer such as a bone graft from the patient's iliac crest (autograft) or a bone graft from a cadaver (allograft). The "gold standard" for aiding healing in spinal fusion surgeries is the harvesting of autograft from the patient's iliac crest and placing it in and around the segments of the spine that are intended to be fused. Autograft is considered the "gold standard" because it contains the essential elements required for successful bone grafting: osteogenesis, osteoconduction, and osteoinduction. However, the morbidity of harvesting autograft has been well documented and includes chronic donor-site pain, infection, neurologic injury, blood loss, deformity, bowel injury, hernia, and prolonged surgical and hospitalization time. There are now a number of products on the market to minimize or replace the use of autograft. However, few of these products contain all three essential bone-forming elements (osteogenesis, osteoconduction, and osteoinduction) in a single, stand alone product. Trinity Evolution is a novel, allogeneic cancellous bone matrix containing viable osteoprogenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells and demineralized cortical bone (DCB) component to provide the required osteoconduction, osteogenesis, and osteoinduction necessary for successful bone grafting. Preclinical studies with Trinity Evolution have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo safety and effectiveness. Trinity Evolution is considered an allograft and as such is a "minimally manipulated" tissue and is labeled for bone repair for spinal, orthopedic and podiatric indications where autograft is used. The dosage will be dependent upon the specific requirements of the case.</detailed_description>
