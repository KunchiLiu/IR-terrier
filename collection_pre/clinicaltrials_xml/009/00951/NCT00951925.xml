	<brief_summary>Potential donors who are undergoing bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow donation as part of clinical care will be asked by the principal investigator (PI) if they might be interested in donating marrow for this research project. If they are interested, the PI will meet with the prospective donor to review the information contained in the informed consent document and to answer any questions the potential subject may have. Bone marrow aspirates of approximately 5cc will be obtained from the posterior iliac crest of subjects using standard techniques.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanisms that regulate human globin gene expression by analyzing the function of cell signaling pathways and the expression of other related genes and their protein products in the bone marrow cells of people without blood diseases. This includes the effects of drugs and other in vitro manipulations of the cells once they are removed from donors. These assays will include, but are not limited to, determinations of DNA methylation status, histone acetylation profiles, DNAse sensitivity, transcription factor binding to DNA, levels of various proteins, messenger RNAs and miRNAs in the cells of the marrow samples. By understanding how this process occurs in people without blood diseases, we hope to to design future treatments for people with diseases such as sickle cell disease and B-thalassemia.</detailed_description>
