	<brief_title>Depression and Cardiovascular Risk Markers: Effects of Rosuvastatin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, in which one possible mechanism is systemic inflammation. Further, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, rosuvastatin decreases the risk, especially among patients with increased inflammation.
