	<brief_summary>People with Down syndrome are at increased risk of sleep apnea, not only from obstruction of the upper airway, but also of central origin. According to published data, sleep apnea may occur in at least 40% of children and adults with Down syndrome. Consequences of these sleep apnea are numerous : failure to thrive, cognitive decline, high blood pressure, heart disease, accident due to day sleepiness, fatigue. This condition is treatable in people with Down syndrome, as it is in ordinary people. Diagnosis of sleep apnea in people with Down syndrome is therefore a major concern. In addition, data regarding age of apparition of this complication are missing, making repeated screening necessary. Polysomnography is the method of choice for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. Unfortunately, it is time consuming and sleep departments are heavily busy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Simplified Method for Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea in Children and Adults With Down Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of our study is to evaluate an easier screening strategy combining questionnaire and overnight recording of few data, compared to polysomnography. We hope our strategy will permit regular screening for people with Down syndrome, helping us to draw guidelines for the survey of sleep apnea in this population.</detailed_description>
