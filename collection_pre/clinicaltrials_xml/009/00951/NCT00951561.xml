	<brief_title>A Comparison Study of Pain Relief From Dysmenorrhea Between the Vipon Tampon and Ibuprofen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain caused by dysmenorrhea can range from mild to severe. At least 50% of all menstruating women experience appreciable pain at some time during their menstruation. An estimated 600 million work hours are lost annually to this affliction with an average loss of time of two or more workdays per year per female employee. Treatment of dysmenorrhea may include either non-pharmacological or pharmacological measures. Pharmacological treatments include oral contraceptives to treat hormonal imbalances, over-the-counter analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The Vipon is a tampon with a small motor unit within, which produces vibratory stimulation. This study aims to provide information on the safety and efficacy of the Vipon in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</detailed_description>
