	<brief_summary>The goal of the Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Patient Registry is to collect data on individuals with neonatal lung disease to better understand the illness and ultimately improve their care and survival. The Patient Registry was established in 2008 as a means to monitor important trends in the BPD population and to improve understanding, treatment, and survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BPD Patient Registry is used by both clinicians and researchers to better understand BPD and to improve care of individuals with BPD. Each year the data in the Patient Registry will be analyzed and an annual report of BPD health trends will be created. Using this information, BPD clinicians can address quality improvement initiatives, and examine changing health care issues, including nutritional status, infection control, pulmonary treatment and/or metabolic issues rapidly and effectively. The Patient Registry will also play an important role in directing clinical care and in the design of clinical research studies. Researchers use the registry to help in investigating various aspects of neonatal lung diseases like BPD, including medications, diagnostic procedures, and eligibility for clinical trials.</detailed_description>
