	<brief_summary>Rationale: Forced spirometry maneuvers are not routinely performed in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T), even though they suffer from respiratory illnesses. Objectives: To study the feasibility and validity of forced spirometry in A-T patients. Methods: Patients will perform spirometry during clinical visits. Parameters studied will be technical quality, relation to predicted values, age, pulmonary illness, body mass index, mutational status and mutation.</brief_summary>
