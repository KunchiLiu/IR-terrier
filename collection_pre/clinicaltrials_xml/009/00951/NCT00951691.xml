	<brief_title>Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation for Disablement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disabling medical events are common for elderly people, causing immobilization, requiring extensive rehabilitation, and generating fears of loss of function and need for institutionalization. Existing acute medical rehabilitation settings—skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs)—often do not adequately meet the needs of depressed elders, resulting in a missed opportunity for effective and functional recovery. This study will test a new program that will enhance acute rehabilitation in SNFs to target mood, motivation, and functional recovery in the 2 to 4 weeks after hospitalization. This program, developed by the research team, increases the intensity and engagement of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT). Participation in this study will last until discharge from the SNF, with follow-up assessments lasting until 3 months after entry. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the enhanced acute medical rehabilitation or treatment as usual. Participants receiving the enhanced care will complete up to 3 hours of enhanced PT and OT per day from study entry until discharge, excluding weekends. Participants receiving treatment as usual will receive standard PT and OT. Study assessments will take place at baseline, after 8 and 15 days, and after discharge. Follow-up assessments will occur after 30, 60, and 90 days. Assessments will include questionnaires and interviews measuring positive and negative affect, and functional impairment and disability.</detailed_description>
