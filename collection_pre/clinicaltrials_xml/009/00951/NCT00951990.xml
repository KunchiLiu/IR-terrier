	<brief_summary>Despite the widespread use of hip and knee replacement surgery, there is a considerable lack of consensus regarding postoperative treatment and rehabilitation, mostly because of the lack of well-designed studies testing the efficacy and effectiveness of such practices. In particular there are no recommendations regarding the use of ergometer cycling after hip or knee replacement surgery. Therefore the investigators initiated a multicenter controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of ergometer cycling versus no ergometer cycling after hip or knee replacement surgery.</brief_summary>
