	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of critical limb ischemia defined as persistent, recurring ischemic rest pain for at least two (2) weeks, and/or ulceration or gangrene of the foot or toe, with ABI &lt; 0.6 or/and TBI &lt; 0.4 2. Rutherford category 45 3. Non candidate for revascularization or endovascular intervention based on unfavorable vascular anatomy or significant comorbid medical conditions as confirmed by vascular study (e.g., angiogram, MRA) obtained within 3 months prior screening visit and signed approval of vascular surgeon. The decision to classify the subject as a noncandidate will be made by the investigator and confirmed by an independent third party vascular surgeon who is not participating in the study. 4. In the opinion of the investigator, major amputation is not anticipated over a period of three (3) months. 5. Those diabetic subjects who are on optimal diabetes medication, with an HbA1c &lt; 8% 1. Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg or systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg during screening). 2. Wounds with severity greater than Grade 2 on the Wagner Scale 3. Lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia except if an ICD is implanted or unstable angina characterized by increasingly frequent episodes with modest exertion or at rest, worsening severity, and prolonged. 4. ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and/or TIA/CVA within six (6) months prior to enrollment.Patients with severe congestive heart failure (i.e. NYHA Stage IV) 5. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient is unsuitable for cellular therapy.</criteria>
