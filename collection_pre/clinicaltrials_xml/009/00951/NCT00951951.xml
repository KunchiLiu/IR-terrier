	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study is to compare gait kinematics and the return to normalization of gait in patients that have undergone a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) via the direct anterior approach versus the posterior approach. Gait kinematics will be measured using the IDEEA LifeGait device from Minisun (Fresno, CA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Analysis of Anterior Versus Posterior Approach in Performance of Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study of two different surgical approaches to THA, direct anterior vs posterior approach in approximately 64 patients that meet the standard criteria for the implantation of primary total hip replacement utilizing the Medacta implants and have elected to undergo THA.</detailed_description>
