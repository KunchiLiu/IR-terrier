	<brief_title>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Before and After Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators studied the impact of this surgical procedure on GERD in patients with morbid obesity. Esophageal syndromes were evaluated according to the Montreal Consensus, where troublesome symptoms were defined as score â‰¥ 2 on a validated questionnaire of symptoms for Portuguese language along with esophageal syndromes with injury assessed through upper endoscopy. Esophageal acid exposure was determined through 24h pH monitoring. Increased acid exposure was characterized when total esophageal pH &lt; 4 for at least 4% of the total monitoring time.</detailed_description>
