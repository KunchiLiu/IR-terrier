	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vernakalant injection in subjects with recent onset (AF &gt; 3 hours to &lt;= 7 days), symptomatic atrial fibrillation and no evidence or history of congestive heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3b Study of Vernakalant Injection in Patients With Recent Onset Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation (AF)(MK-6621-045)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants received a 10-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of vernakalant (3 mg/kg) or an equivalent amount of normal saline (placebo), followed by a 15-minute observation period. If the participant was still in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, a second 10-minute IV infusion of vernakalant (2 mg/kg) or an equivalent amount of placebo was administered unless the participant experienced any dose-stopping criteria after the start of the first infusion. If a participant converted to sinus rhythm during the first or second infusion, that infusion was completed.</detailed_description>
