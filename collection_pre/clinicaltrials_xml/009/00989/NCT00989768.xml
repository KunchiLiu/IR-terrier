	<detailed_description>This was a monocentric, prospective, randomized and double-blind study. Twenty nine female patients, presenting with moderate to severe forehead wrinkles, with sweating ability who had never undergone previous BoNT-A injections were enrolled. Subjects have received botulinum toxin type-A injections in two forehead sites, Botox 2U and Dysport 5U, both reconstituted in the same volume of 0.02 mL per point. Baseline, twenty-eight and 112 days later, clinical and photographic assessments, Minor´s test, and electromyographic (EMG) evaluations were performed.</detailed_description>

Subjects with positive Minor's test showing sweating on the forehead in standardized conditions described in Annex 2 *The Minor's Test will be the last inclusion criterion to be evaluated. Only these patients eligible according to the other inclusion criteria will undergo the Minor's Test to evaluate their sweating on the forehead. The cut off point is a positive Minor's Test (Level +1) only subjects with Minor's Test (Level +1) will be recruited in the study (Annex 2). 7. Medical history and physical examination which, based on the investigator's opinion, do not prevent the patient from taking part in the study and use the products under investigation 8. Subjects of childbearing age should present a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline and should be using an effective contraceptive method; 9. Availability of the patient throughout the duration of the study (112 days) 10. Subject agrees not to undergo other cosmetic or dermatological procedures during the study 11. Subjects with sufficient schooling and awareness to enable them to cooperate to the degree required by this protocol 1. Pregnant women or women intending to become pregnant in the next 4 months after screening for eligibility 2. Subjects who are lactating 3.
