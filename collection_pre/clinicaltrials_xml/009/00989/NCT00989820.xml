	<brief_title>Efficacy of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in the Treatment of Osteoradionecrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late radiation damage to the lower jaw (osteoradionecrosis (ORN)) is often seen in patients treated with radiotherapy for a tumor in the head and neck region. Part of the lower jaw becomes non-vital and has to be treated. ORN proofs to be a condition difficult to treat and the treatment for this condition varies. In many countries hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is added to the surgical treatment of ORN. Unfortunately there is no consensus whether the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to the treatment of ORN is beneficial or not. This study has the aim to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of HBOT in the treatment of ORN</detailed_description>
