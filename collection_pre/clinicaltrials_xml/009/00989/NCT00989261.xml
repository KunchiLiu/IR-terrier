Males and females age ≥60 years in first relapse or refractory. 3. Must have baseline bone marrow sample taken. 4.

In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of AC220 administration will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents or at least 5 halflives for noncytotoxic agents. The use of chemotherapeutic or antileukemic agents other than hydroxyurea is not permitted during the study with the possible exception of intrathecal (IT) therapy at the discretion of the Investigator and with the agreement of the Sponsor. 8. Persistent chronic clinically significant nonhematological toxicities from prior treatment must be ≤Grade 1. 9. Prior therapy with FLT3 inhibitors is permitted, except previous treatment with AC220. 10. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 30 mL/min 11. Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels should be at least within institutional normal limits. 12. Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN 13. Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN 14. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine βhCG). 15. Females of childbearing potential and sexually mature males must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study. 16. Written informed consent must be provided. 1. Patients over the age of 85 years except at the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of the Sponsor. 2. Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia 3. Diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis 4. AML in relapse or refractory after 3 or more previous lines of chemotherapy (and/or HSCT) treatment 5. AML or antecedent MDS secondary to prior chemotherapy 6. Persistent clinically significant nonhematological toxicity that is Grade &gt;1 by NCI CTCAE v4 from prior chemotherapy 7. Patients who have had HSCT and are within 100 days of transplant and/or are still taking immunosuppressive drugs and/or have clinically significant graftversushost disease requiring treatment and/or have &gt;Grade 1 persistent non hematological toxicity related to the transplant 8. Clinically active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. Patients with CNS leukemia, which is controlled, but who are still receiving IT therapy at study entry may be considered eligible and continue receive IT therapy at the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of the Sponsor. 9. Patients who have previously received AC220 10. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (diagnosis by laboratory or clinical assessment) 11. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study 12. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to, or concurrent with study 13. Use of concomitant drugs that prolong QT/QTc interval and/or are CYP3A4 inhibitors are prohibited with the exception of antibiotics, antifungals, and other antimicrobials that are used as standard of care to prevent or treat infections and other such drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the care of the patient. 14. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease 15. Women who are pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to use contraception if of childbearing potential 16. Men who are unwilling to use contraception if their partners are of childbearing potential 17. Active, uncontrolled infection 18. Human immunodeficiency virus positivity 19. Active hepatitis B or C or other active liver disease 20.
