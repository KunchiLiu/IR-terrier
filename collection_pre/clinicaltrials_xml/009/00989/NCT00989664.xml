	<brief_summary>The results from Phase 1/2 (RIT-I-000) and Phase 2 (RIT-II-001) studies of Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab (TST/I-131 TST) demonstrated that TST/ I-131 TST produced a high response rate in patients with chemotherapy-relapsed/refractory, low-grade or transformed low-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). On the basis of these results this study was designed to compare the efficacy of TST/ I-131 TST to the last qualifying chemotherapy regimen in patients with chemotherapy-refractory, low-grade or transformed low-grade NHL.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects â‰¥18 years of age with histologically confirmed at initial diagnosis, previously treated (at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens), lowgrade NHL or lowgrade lymphoma that had transformed to intermediate or highgrade histology. Subjects with more than an average of 25% of the intratrabecular marrow space involved by lymphoma in bone marrow biopsy specimens as assessed microscopically within 42 days of study entry. Bilateral posterior iliac crest core biopsies are required if the percentage of intratrebecular space involved exceeds 10% in a unilateral biopsy. The mean of bilateral biopsies must be no more than 25%. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunosuppressants, or cytokine treatment within 4 weeks prior to study entry or persistent clinical evidence of toxicity. Prior stem cell transplant. Active obstructive hydronephrosis. Evidence of active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics at the time of study entry. New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease or other serious illness that would preclude evaluation. Prior malignancy other than lymphoma, except for adequately treated skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has been diseasefree for 5 years. Known HIV infection. Known brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing. Previous allergic reactions to iodine. This does not include reactions to intravenous iodinecontaining contrast materials. Prior exposure to monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies of any nonhuman species for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, including engineered chimeric and humanized antibodies. Prior radioimmunotherapy. Progressive disease within 1 year of irradiation arising in a field that has been previously irradiated with &gt;3500 cGy. Current use of either approved or nonapproved (through another protocol) anticancer drugs or biologics De novo intermediate or highgrade lymphoma.</criteria>
