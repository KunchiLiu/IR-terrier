	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve antibiotic prescribing practices of Mexican primary care physicians for patients seeking care for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs). The investigators will employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and evaluate a patient education and physician decision-support intervention. Hypothesis 1: The investigators will identify barriers and facilitators of appropriate antibiotic use for ARIs that can be addressed through patient education and physician decision-support. Hypothesis 2: The proportion of patients who report desire for antibiotics as a "very important" reason for seeking care will decrease from 50% to 30% following exposure to the educational intervention; and 90% (95% confidence interval: 80% to 100%) of patients will report that they trust the information provided by the computer. Hypothesis 3: Antibiotic prescribing for adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis will decrease from 80 percent to 40 percent following the introduction of a real-time clinical decision support tool.</brief_summary>
