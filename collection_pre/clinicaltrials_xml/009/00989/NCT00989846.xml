	<brief_summary>Disease related biomarkers have been established decades ago, e.g. blood glucose for diabetes diagnosis and management. Their discovery has grown dramatically during the past decade and they have the potential to lead the physician in diagnosis -especially differential diagnosis - and therapy. However, a specific serum-biomarker in lung diseases has not been established. Aim of the current study is to to measure lung specific proteins in the serum in patients with various lung diseases and to correlate those with disease severity, lung function and other laboratory results</brief_summary>
