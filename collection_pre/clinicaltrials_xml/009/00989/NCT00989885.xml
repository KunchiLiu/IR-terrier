The data were collected from records, wich are of questionnaires, including the ESE, prepared by the CESF professionals and responded, previously, by the own patients. The study compared the result obtained in the scale of Epworth with the data of polysomnography. The analysis of data was performed using the SPSS, based on descriptive and inferential statistics, being used the average considering the standard deviation, and, to the crossing of variables, was used the chi-square test of Pearson, considering as significant statistically values of p&lt;0.05.
