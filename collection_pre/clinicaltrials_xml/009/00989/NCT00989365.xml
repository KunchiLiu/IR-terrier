	<brief_title>Effect of Aerobic Training on Asthmatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-hundred patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma, age ranging from 20 to 50 years-old recruited after a medical consultation. Asthma diagnosis based on GINA1 and patients were under medical treatment for at least 6-months and considered clinically stable (no crises and changes in medication for at least 30 days). Patients diagnosed with cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculoskeletal diseases impairing exercise training were excluded. Experimental Design: Patients were studied between 2 medical consultation to avoid changes in medication during the study and patients were randomized (by drawing lots) into either Control or Training groups. CG was submitted to a 4-hour educational program and a breathing exercise program and TG was submitted to the same CG procedures plus an aerobic training program individually based on VO2max. Before and after the intervention, patients performed pulmonary function test and cardiopulmonary exercise testing and as well as fulfilled questionnaires to quantify asthma specific HRQL and anxiety and depression levels. Asthma daily symptoms were evaluated monthly.</detailed_description>
