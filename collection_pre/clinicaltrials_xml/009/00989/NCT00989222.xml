	<brief_summary>Promising results have been reported after volar locked plating of unstable dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius. It offers stable fixation and early mobilization. The investigators' aim is to test if volar locked plating results in better patient-perceived, objective functional and radiological outcomes compared to the less invasive external fixation that has been the standard operation for decades.</brief_summary>
