	<criteria>Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) or World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines with HbA1c not more than 10.0% at screening (Visit 1). Patients should be on diet, exercise, and/or pharmacological treatment for diabetes. Patients with visual impairment due to focal or diffuse Diabetic Macular Edema in at least one eye who are eligible for laser treatment in the opinion of the investigator. If both eyes are eligible, the one with the worse visual acuity, as assessed at Visit 1, will be selected for study treatment unless, based on medical reasons, the investigator deems the other eye the more appropriate candidate for study treatment. The study eye must fulfill the following criteria at Visit 1: BestCorrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) score between 78 and 39 letters, inclusively, using Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS) chartlike visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/32 to 20/160). Decrease in vision is due to DME and not due to other causes, in the opinion of the investigator. Medication for the management of diabetes must have been stable within 3 months prior to randomization and is expected to remain stable during the course of the study. Ocular concomitant conditions/ diseases: Concomitant conditions in the study eye which could, in the opinion of the investigator, prevent the improvement of visual acuity on study treatment. Active intraocular inflammation in either eye. Any active infection in either eye. History of uveitis in either eye. Uncontrolled glaucoma in either eye. Ocular treatments: Panretinal laser photocoagulation in the study eye within 6 months prior to or during the study. Focal/grid laser photocoagulation in the study eye within 3 months prior to study entry. Systemic conditions or treatments: History of stroke Renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant or renal insufficiency with creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL. Untreated diabetes mellitus Blood pressure systolic &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg Compliance/ Administrative: Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
