	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open label multi-center study to determine safety and the performance of the treatment of cartilage lesions located on the femoral condyle with GelrinC. Patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening will be enrolled into the study, and will receive treatment implantation into their cartilage lesions. Treatment will consist of GelrinC implantations at the symptomatic lesion of femur rated as ICRS III, or IVA with less than 6 mm of bone loss below the subchondral plate. The patients will undergo a rehabilitation program during the follow up period.</brief_summary>
