	<brief_title>Photo-Plethysmographic Camera to Monitor Heart Rate, Respiration Rate and Oxygen Saturation in Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plethysmographic signal is typically strong on children. This provides a reliable heart rate monitor. However, to measure oxygen saturation, a quantitative value of the strength at two wavelength regions (green and red) is required. It is also not known if the normal ambient light is spectrally appropriate to analyze the video signals for oxygenation. With the current prototype of our system, we can monitor heart rate reliably and estimate oxygen saturation in adults, using normal artificial light or daylight, entering through a window. Heart rate and oxygen saturation will be extracted from the plethysmographic signal off the cheek, forehead or hand while the respiration rate may be retrieved from the plethysmographic signal off the chest area.</detailed_description>
