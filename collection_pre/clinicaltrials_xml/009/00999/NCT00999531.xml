	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated doses of GS-9411 in healthy volunteers. GS-9411 is a sodium channel inhibitor, that may restore airway hydration and mucociliary clearance in the lung.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multiple Dose Trial of GS-9411 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GS-9411 is being evaluated as a potential therapy to improve airway hydration and mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. This study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of 3 dose levels of GS-9411 as an inhaled product, compared to a matched placebo, administered twice daily for 14 days.</detailed_description>
