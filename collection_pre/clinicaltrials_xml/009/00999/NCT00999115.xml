	<criteria>Signed informed consent. Patients with Crohn´s disease diagnosed at least 12 months earlier in accordance with accepted clinical, endoscopic, anatomopathological and/or radiologic criteria. Fulfilling one of the following criteria: At least, one previous surgery for fistulous disease. Physical status which discourage liposuction. Rectovaginal fistula. Women of a childbearing age. Good general state of health according to the findings of the clinical history and the physical examination. Presence of severe proctitis (prominent friability, spontaneous bleeding, multiple erosions, deep ulcers) or dominant active luminal disease requiring immediate therapy, assessed by rectosigmoidoscopy Patients with CDAI≥201 Patients with an abscess unless a complete toilet of the area with drainage of the collections and the absence of abscess and other collections is confirmed prior to treatment start Patients who have received infliximab or any other anti TNF agent in the 8 weeks before the cell treatment administration Patients who have received tacrolimus or cyclosporine in the 4 weeks before the cell treatment administration Patients with a history of abuse of alcohol or other addictive substances in the 6 months prior to inclusion Patients with malignant tumor, except for basal cell or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or patients with a prior history of malignant tumors, unless the neoplastic disease has been in remission for the previous 5 years Patients with cardiopulmonary disease which, in opinion of the investigator, in unstable or sufficiently serious to exclude the patient from the study. Patients with any type of medical or psychiatric disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could be grounds for exclusion from study Patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. HIV, HBV, HCV or treponema infection, whether active or latent. Patients allergic to local anesthetics or gadolinium (MRI contrast) MRI is unfeasible (e.g. due to the presence of pacemakers, hip replacements or severe claustrophobia) Patients who have suffering major surgery or severe trauma in the prior 6 months Pregnant or breastfeeding women Patients currently receiving, or having received within 1 month prior to enrolment into this clinical trial, any investigational drug.</criteria>
