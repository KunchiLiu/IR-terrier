	<brief_summary>In this study 126 eyes in 63 patients with moderate bilateral myopia and astigmatism between -3 and -5 (SE difference between two eyes should not be more than 0.75 and the residual corneal thickness&gt;350 Î¼ ) were entered in the study. One eye went randomly under PRK with mitomycin C 0.02% in 15 min and then the other eye went under the operation without MMC. UCVA,BCVA, refractory error after the operation and the number of endothelial cells before and after the surgery would be compared in 6 months.</brief_summary>
