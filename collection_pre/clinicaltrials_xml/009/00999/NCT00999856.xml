	<brief_summary>The study is intended to evaluate a non-invasive method of glucose measurement in diabetics. The medical device that is evaluated consists on a sensor-insert which is placed under the conjunctiva of the eye of diabetic patients and a photometer. The goal is to prove that the sensor signal correlates with the blood glucose of the patients determined by standard laboratory blood glucose measurement.</brief_summary>
