	<brief_summary>Addressing the issue of opioid dependence and tolerance has public health implications for the treatment of opioid abuse (both heroin as well as pharmaceutical opioids) and for the treatment of pain. Recent preclinical data suggest a role for Substance P (NK-1) receptors in modulating both the acute and chronic response to opioids. The objective of this study is to determine whether pretreatment with aprepitant, a selective neurokinin-1 (NK-1) antagonist can reduce the direct response to an opioid agonist (oxycodone) on measures related to abuse liability and reinforcing effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy adult volunteers with histories of illicit opioid use by the intranasal and oral routes will be admitted to this 6-week inpatient, crossover study. They will participate in 15 experimental test sessions, each lasting approximately 6.5 hours, during which they will receive a range of acute doses of aprepitant, including placebo, followed by challenge with oxycodone or placebo (given intranasally or orally). Multi-dimensional outcomes, including physiological (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pupil diameter), subjective (questionnaires related to mood, abuse liability) and observer ratings will be collected repeatedly throughout each session. Data will be analyzed using parametric approaches to within-subject designs.</detailed_description>
