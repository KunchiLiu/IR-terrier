	<brief_title>High Volume Specialty Knee Replacement Surgeons Achieve Better Clinical and Quality-of-Life Scores</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary total knee replacements are becoming a commonly performed procedure. Many general orthopaedists can perform large numbers of such surgeries. Thus, we aim to find out if there is value of having surgeons with AR fellowship training to perform primary total knee arthroplasty. This has an implication in the direction of the training of future AR surgeons and in the distribution of operative cases.</detailed_description>
