	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information over time from laboratory tests of patients with newly diagnosed malignant supratentorial astrocytoma may help doctors learn more about the effect of treatment on white blood cell count and the risk of infection. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood samples and risk of infection in patients with newly diagnosed malignant supratentorial astrocytoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Blood Samples and Risk of Infection in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Malignant Supratentorial Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency and severity of decreases in CD4 counts as a function of therapy in patients with newly diagnosed malignant astrocytoma. - Determine whether the decrease in CD4 counts is a significant predictor of infections or adverse outcomes in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo monthly collection of blood for serial CD4 counts and heme-8 with differential for 1 year for quantitative analysis. Patients also complete a monthly questionnaire about infections and antibiotic use. Patients are followed every 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients (100 with high-grade disease and 25 with low-grade disease) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
