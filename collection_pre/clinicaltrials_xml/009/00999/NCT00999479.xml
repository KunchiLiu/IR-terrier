	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether or not continuous combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP's) decrease the risk of recurrent endometrioma formation. The investigators' hypothesis is that patients who have endometriomas surgically removed and then are started on COCP's will have a decreased incidence of recurrent endometrioma formation. The investigators' research protocol is designed to show a statistically significant decreased incidence of endometrioma formation in the hopes that physicians will use COCP's in patients they have removed an endometrioma in who do not desire immediate fertility. Long term, the investigators hope to establish a standard of care that COCP's be used postoperatively in appropriate candidates to decrease the chance of recurrent endometrioma formation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan to identify patients planning to undergo conservative surgery for endometrioma at the University of Oklahoma private practice OB/GYN clinic and at the University of Oklahoma Resident Women's clinic. After clear and appropriate consent and discussion regarding options, we plan to randomize patients to monophasic OCPs vs. placebo following surgery. We plan to enroll 35 patients in each arm and follow them for 24 months following the surgery. Surveillance with pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasonography will occur at 2, 6 and 12 months. The patients surgery will be done prior to enrolling in our study. We will use information from their surgery only to confirm the diagnosis of endometrioma. The only procedure the subjects will undergo during the protocol are periodic transvaginal ultrasonography.</detailed_description>
