	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Effects of Nebivolol and Hydrochlorothiazide in African Americans With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many blood pressure medications are not effective in African American men and women. The two lower chambers of the heart contract to pump blood to the body. The lower chambers have to relax so they can refill with blood to pump out again. Many patients with high blood pressure have stiffness in the lower chambers which prevents the heart from relaxing so it can properly fill with blood. Some patients with the stiffness in the lower chambers of the heart will develop heart failure. The study is to test whether or not Nebivolol (Bystolic)and a diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) will help the heart relax so the heart can properly fill and prevent stiffness of the lower heart chambers.</detailed_description>
