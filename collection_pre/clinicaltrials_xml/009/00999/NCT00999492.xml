	<brief_title>Selection of Aspheric Diffractive Multifocal Intraocular Lens (IOLS) Based on Corneal Wavefront</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Cataract</mesh_term>
	<criteria>18 years of age or older Scheduled to undergo bilateral cataract or refractive lens surgery Visual potential of 20/30 or better in each eye after lens removal and IOL implantation Naturally dilated pupil size (in dim light) &gt; 3.5 mm (with no dilation medications) for both eyes Preoperative regular corneal astigmatism of 2.5 D or less Clear intraocular media other than cataract Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination procedures Ocular disease other than cataract which could potentially limit uncorrected visual acuity or visual performance. Astigmatism not correctable by limbal relaxing incisions (greater than 2.5 D) Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect visual outcomes Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.) Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery Amblyopia or strabismus Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.) Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of worse than 20/30 Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) Pupil abnormalities (nonreactive, tonic pupils or abnormally shaped pupils) Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA lenses, 1 month for gas permeable lenses or 1 week for extendedwear and dailywear soft lenses Requiring an intraocular lens power &lt;15.0 or &gt;26.0 diopters</criteria>
