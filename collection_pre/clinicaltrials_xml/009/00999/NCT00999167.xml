	<brief_title>A Study of Safety and Efficacy of HPN-100 in Subjects With Cirrhosis and Episodic Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A: Open-label, dose-escalation lead-in to assess HPN-100 safety and PK Approximately 10 subjects with HE and cirrhosis classified as Child Pugh B or C will undergo a one-step dose escalation over 4 weeks. Subjects will initially receive 6 mL HPN-100 BID for 1 week. On Day 7 and following satisfactory safety assessment of the subject, the dose will be escalated to 9 mL BID for an additional 3 weeks. In addition to a safety assessment, subjects will undergo 12-hour PK assessments on Days 7 and 28, with sampling at the following time points (relative to the first dose): 0 (pre-first daily dose of HPN-100), 2, 4, 8 (approximately 2 hours before the second daily dose of HPN 100), and 12 hours post-first dose (approximately 2 hours after the second daily dose of HPN-100). Additional PK samples will be collected on Days 8, 15, and 21 (at pre-first dose and 4 hours post-first dose). The DSMB will review all safety information, including laboratory values, to determine if Part B may be initiated. Subjects enrolled in Part A may be eligible for Part B as long as they meet the eligibility criteria. Part B: Randomized, double-blind assessment of HPN-100 in HE subjects Subjects who meet all entry criteria and are judged to be compliant with their prescribed SOC will be eligible for randomization to receive either HPN-100 or matching placebo for 16 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed by the proportion of subjects experiencing episodes of HE, as well as by other outcome measures, including daily home assessments.</detailed_description>
