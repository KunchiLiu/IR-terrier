	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Clinical Impact of a Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Simulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: To compare two different approaches in learning laparoscopic radical prostatectomy , with or without using an online video simulator Design : Prospective randomized multicentric study Methods: 20 surgeons considered as naive concerning their experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy will be randomized into two groups :1 group will use the online video simulator, 1 group will use usual learning methods except the online video simulator. All procedures will be recorded from the beginning till the end.A video review will be preformed concerning all the videos in order to identify the total operative time and time to perform each one of the operative steps of the procedure.Clinical , biological and histological data will be collected in order to compare the two arms.</detailed_description>
