	<brief_summary>ZK 200775 is an antagonist at the Î±-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor and had earned attention a possible neuroprotective agent in cerebral ischemia. Probands receiving the agent within a stroke therapy related Phase I trial reported on an alteration of visual perception. In this trial, the effects of ZK 200775 on the visual system will be analyzed in detail. In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study eyes and vision will be examined before and after the intravenous administration of ZK 200775. The following methods will be applied: clinical examination, visual acuity, ophthalmoscopy, colour vision, rod absolute threshold, central visual field, pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (pVEP), ON-OFF and full-field electroretinogram (ERG).</brief_summary>
