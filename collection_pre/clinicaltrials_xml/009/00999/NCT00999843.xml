	<brief_summary>Patients with liver cancer will receive interventional therapy plus radiotherapy. Maintenance Sorafenib will be taken after the completion of radiotherapy. Hypothesis of the current study is that Sorafenib as a maintenance therapy is safe and superior to radiotherapy combined with interventional therapy in terms of survival in comparison to historical data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Sorafenib Following Combined Therapy of Radiation and TACE for Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with solitary lesion (bigger than 5 cm in diameter) histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC receive TACE (1-3 cycles) plus 3DCRT/IMRT 4-6 weeks later. Maintenance Sorafenib will be administered only for the patients with non-progression disease 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. The dose will be 400 mg, p.o., twice a day. Sorafenib will be continuously given for 12 months unless intolerable toxicities and/or tumor progression. Hypothesis of the current study is that Sorafenib as a maintenance therapy after combined therapy of 3DCRT/IMRT and TACE is safe and superior to radiotherapy combined with TACE alone in terms of time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in comparison to historical data.</detailed_description>
