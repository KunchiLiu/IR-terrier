	<brief_summary>Alcohol consumption is a major health problem worldwide. It affects all systems of the body especially the gastrointestinal tract. Acute or chronic alcohol consumption has deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa vary from increased intestinal permeability, structural changes to sever destruction of the epithelial lining cells. Human data are still limited and most of the studies were performed in chronic alcohol abusers. The investigators hypothesize that moderate alcohol drinking also may increase small intestinal permeability and contribute to the subsequent disruption of the tight junction complex. This study may provide more insight into the effects of moderate alcohol drinking on the small intestinal permeability.</brief_summary>
