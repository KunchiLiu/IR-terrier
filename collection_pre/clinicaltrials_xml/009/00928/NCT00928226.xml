	<brief_summary>We hope to determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3 session (i.e., treatment) stereotactic radiosurgery to treat brain metastases greater than 4.2 cm3 in size. By increasing radiation dose, we will determine if there is a better outcome without greater toxicity (side effects) for patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients age 18 years and older with pathologically proven solid tumor malignancy and 1 to 4 brain metastases, one of which is 4.2 33.5 cm^3. Systemic therapy: Prior cytoxic systemic therapy must be completed &gt;= 5 days prior to radiosurgery. No concurrent cytoxic systemic therapy along with SRS. Cytoxic systemic therapy to start &gt;= 5 days after the completion of SRS. Prior surgery or SRS is allowed as long as the target metastatic lesion in this study has not previously been treated with SRS. Patient must exhibit the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients who have previously been treated with whole brain irradiation. Patients whose metastatic lesion in question had previously been treated with SRS. The patient has greater than 4 total brain metastases at the time of initial evaluation. Pediatric patients (age &lt;18), pregnant women, and patients who are unable to give informed consent will be excluded.</criteria>
