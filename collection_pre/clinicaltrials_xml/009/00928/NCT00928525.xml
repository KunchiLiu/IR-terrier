	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of DT or CDS. Biomolecular or immunohistochemical evidence of Imatinib mesylate target (KIT, PDGFRα PDGFRβ activation and/or presence of PDGFα or PDGFβ) Measurable or evaluable disease Surgical resection of local disease unfeasible radically (or unaccepted by the patient, or amenable to become less demolitive, or easier, or likely more feasible, after cytoreduction) and/or metastatic disease. ECOG Performance status 0, 1, 2 or 3 Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective method of birth control throughout the study. Written, voluntary, informed consent. Previous treatment with any other investigational or not investigational agents within 28 days of first day of study drug dosing Other primary malignancy with &lt;5 years clinically assessed diseasefree interval, except basal cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ. Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria Severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled infection) Known brain metastasis. Known chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis). Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Previous radiotherapy to &gt;/=25% of the bone marrow or within the previous 2 months on target lesion. Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry. Expected noncompliance to medical regimens (e.g. psychiatric diseases).</criteria>
