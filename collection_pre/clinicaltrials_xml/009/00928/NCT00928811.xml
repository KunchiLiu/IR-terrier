	<brief_summary>The study is undertaken to explore the safety of using Simulect at monthly dose intervals to reduce the need of high dose/level CNI's such as Prograf.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety of Chronic Administration of Simulect to Subjects Receiving a First Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of CNI's after kidney transplantation is associated with typical adverse effects such as potential contribution to progressive impairment of renal function, hypertension, and metabolic abnormalities. The study consists of a run-in phase (1 month),and treatment phase (11 months) and safety assessment phase (1 month).</detailed_description>
