	<brief_summary>OZ439 is a synthetic trioxolane that has potential value as a peroxide antimalarial agent. This was a Phase I, single-centre, multi-component, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in healthy male and female subjects. The study was conducted in 3 parts: - Part A investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single oral escalating doses of OZ439. Up to 6 dose levels will be investigated to estimate dose proportionality. - Part B, the effect of food on a single oral dose of OZ439 was investigated in a 2-way crossover design. - Part C investigated the safety, tolerability and PK profile of multiple oral doses of OZ439. The starting oral dose was 50 mg and the maximum single dose to be administered did not exceed 1600 mg per subject. The maximum duration of dosing proposed was 3 days.</brief_summary>
