	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance, accuracy, and handling of the actuation indicator in patients with COPD. The actuation indicator is integrated into mouthpiece of the ipratropium bromide HFA inhalation aerosol device. As part of Boehringer Ingelheim's program to qualify an actuation indicator for use with the ipratropium bromide HFA inhalation aerosol device, this study is intended to complement the results from the ongoing in-vitro studies.</brief_summary>
