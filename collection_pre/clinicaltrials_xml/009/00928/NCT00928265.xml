	<brief_summary>This is a prospective observational multicenter registry to evaluate safety and efficacy data on Neuroform3TM stenting for treatment with endovascular coiling of wide neck aneurysms on an intent to treat basis. The objectives of this study are: 1. Assessment of morbidity-mortality at 1 month and 12-18 months following the treatment of the intracranial aneurysm with Neuroform3TM stent and endovascular coiling using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). 2. to evaluate adverse events. 3. Angiographic assessment at 12-18 months compared to the initial post-treatment assessment via the modified Raymond scale and same/better/worse scale.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There is an increasing perception in the Neurovascular community - supported by extensive peer-to-peer and congress communications - that "stent-assisted coiling" of intracranial wide neck aneurysms improves the long term angiographic outcome of treated patients.</detailed_description>
