	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn how well an instrument called an Actiwatch-2 can determine whether a child is asleep or awake. The Actiwatch-2 (manufactured by Minimitter/Respironics of Bend, Oregon) is the brand name for an actigraphy monitor; that is, a motion sensor that is typically worn on the wrist and looks like a wrist watch. It measures and records the amount of movement a person makes each minute. After being worn overnight, data are transferred from the Actiwatch to a computer, and a program estimates whether a person is awake or asleep by analyzing the recorded movement data. The enrollment target is 80 participants. Although other actigraphy equipment has been used to monitor sleep in children, the Actiwatch-2 has not been validated in the pediatric population.</brief_summary>
