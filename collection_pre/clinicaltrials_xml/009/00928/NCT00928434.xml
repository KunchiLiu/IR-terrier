	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to see if giving Degarelix every month for 7 months then stop treatment for 7 months (intermittent therapy) would show a reduction of negative effects of androgen deprivation therapy by increasing the quality of life while keeping prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels suppressed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Degarelix in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study to determine if degarelix intermittent therapy was non-inferior to continuous androgen deprivation therapy (combination of treatment groups receiving continuous degarelix and leuprolide therapy, respectively) in maintaining PSA levels at ≤ 4.0 ng/mL at 14 months. The study consisted of two phases, Phase A and B. During Phase A, patients in the degarelix intermittent and degarelix continuous arms received 7 months of therapy with degarelix one-month depot formulation and patients in the leuprolide continuous arm received leuprolide one-month depot injection (7.5 mg) followed by two 3-month depot (22.5 mg) injections. After 7 months of treatment, patients with a PSA ≤2 ng/mL continued into Phase B. During Phase B, patients in the degarelix intermittent arm had a 7-month off-treatment period. Patients randomized to the degarelix continuous arm and the leuprolide continuous arm continued to receive degarelix or leuprolide depot as in Phase A for the remainder of the 14 months.</detailed_description>
