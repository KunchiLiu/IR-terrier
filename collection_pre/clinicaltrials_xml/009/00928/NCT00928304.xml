	<brief_summary>To determine the sensitivity of the visual assessment of BAY94-9172 PET images in detecting cerebral β-amyloid in individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) and specificity in individuals without DS. Given that individuals with Down Syndrome develop β-amyloid pathology over the age of 40, the clinical diagnosis of Down Syndrome will serve as the standard of truth.</brief_summary>
