	<brief_title>Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy and Antidepressant Medication in Recurrent Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the Netherlands, treatment as usual for patients with (recurrent) Major Depressive Disorder consists of maintenance antidepressant medication. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a recently developed psychological intervention that appears to be promising in terms of preventing relapse or recurrence in patients with recurrent depression. It consists of 8 weekly group sessions in which meditation exercises are combined with cognitive therapeutic elements such as identifying negative thoughts and monitoring and scheduling activities. In this study, the (cost)effectiveness of a) MBCT on its own, b) antidepressant medication on its own and c) the combination of MBCT and antidepressant medication will be investigated in 350 patients with recurrent depression who are currently in remission.</detailed_description>
