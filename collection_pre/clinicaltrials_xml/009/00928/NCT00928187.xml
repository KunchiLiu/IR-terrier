	<brief_summary>Since the first line antiretroviral (ARV) treatment is now largely accessible in the Sub-Saharian Africa countries, documentation of virological failure, drug resistance patterns and second line treatment evaluation are still to be consolidated in settings where viral load monitoring is not available and non-B HIV subtype is predominant. This trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of 3 different second line treatment strategies: two recommended by WHO combine two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor associated with a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (emtricitabine-tenofovir-lopinavir/ritonavir and abacavir-didanosine-lopinavir/ritonavir); the third strategy combines emtricitabine-tenofovir-darunavir/ritonavir and is not yet evaluated in Sub-Saharian Africa. Darunavir has a potentially superior antiviral efficacy, a better tolerance and its single daily administration may facilitate treatment adherence.</brief_summary>
