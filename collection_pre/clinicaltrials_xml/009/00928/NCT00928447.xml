	<brief_title>Study of the Intradermal Injection of rHuPH20 or Placebo in Subjects With Nickel Allergic Contact Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot Phase II, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rHuPH20 or placebo control administered intradermally (ID) in the prevention and treatment of subjects with contact allergy to nickel. This study will involve two treatment regimens, which will run in parallel (Treatment Regimens 1 and 2).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Females 1860 years of age. Females of childbearing potential must use a standard and effective means of birth control for the duration of the study. Known contact dermatitis to nickel with a confirmed positive patchtest result to nickel sulfate. Intact normal skin without potentially obscuring tattoos, acne, dermatitis, pigmentation or lesions on the posterior aspect of the torso (back) in the area intended for allergen testing and dose administration. Vital signs (BP, HR, temperature, respiratory rate) within normal range or, if out of range, assessed by the Investigator as not clinically significant and it is mutually agreed by both Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor that the subject need not be excluded from the study for this reason. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test (if female of childbearing potential) within 14 days of initial study drug administration. Subject should be in good general health based on medical history and physical examination, without medical conditions that might prevent the completion of study drug injections and assessments required in this protocol. Decisionmaking capacity and willingness and ability to comply with the requirements for full completion of the study. Signed, written Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ECapproved informed consent. Nickel allergen patch test greater than a ++ reaction. Subjects who were treated with chemotherapy agents or systemic corticosteroids within the past 3 months. Use of topical steroids, antihistamines, or immunosuppressants used near the site of allergen testing/injection within 14 days. Use of oral antihistamines within 14 days of study conduct. Extensive ongoing outbreaks of contact dermatitis anywhere on the body. Pregnant or women who are breastfeeding. Subjects with a current disease state that can affect immune response (e.g., flu, cancer, HIV). Known allergy to any hyaluronidase or the ingredients in the dose preparation. History of autoimmune disorder. Subjects with any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might significantly affect their ability to safely participate in the study or affect the conduct of this study. Examples might include asthma, diabetes, heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, etc.</criteria>
