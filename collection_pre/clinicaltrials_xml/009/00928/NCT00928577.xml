	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To compare the rates of myopericarditis (subclinical, suspected, probable, or confirmed) in deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000® vaccine to rates among subjects positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts. - To identify cases of subclinical myopericarditis in deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000 vaccine. Secondary Objectives: - To compare the rates of severe and serious dermatologic adverse events observed in deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000® vaccine to rates among subjects positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts. - To compare the rates of severe and serious neurological adverse events observed in deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000® vaccine to rates among subjects positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts. - To compare the rates of adverse events observed in subjects approximately 10 days following their ACAM2000® vaccination to rates among subjects positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts. - To evaluate potential risk factors associated with the development of confirmed, probable, and/or suspected ACAM2000-associated myopericarditis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Surveillance Cohort Study of Vaccinia Vaccine (ACAM2000®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective safety surveillance study in a US military Department of Defense (DoD) population.

Participant naïve to previous smallpox vaccination and received the ACAM2000 vaccine (Cohort 1), OR, Participant has not received ACAM2000 vaccine within the prior 3 years, AND is ineligible for current ACAM2000 vaccination either because of recency of prior vaccinia vaccination or for reasons solely attributable to conditions or characteristics of their contacts (such as a healthy soldier who is married to someone with a contraindicated condition) (Cohort 2). Exclusion Criteria : Subjects judged by the investigator as unlikely to understand the scope of the study and/or unlikely to be able to be compliant with the study procedures and visits.
