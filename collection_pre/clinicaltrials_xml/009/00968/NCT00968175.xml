	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) with analgesic therapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer as it applies to decreasing the severity of abdominal pain when compared to analgesic therapy alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Guided-Celiac Plexus Neurolysis (CPN) in Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-CPN + analgesic therapy (Group 1) in pain relief of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer when compared with analgesic therapy (Group 2). The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the changes in reported pain severity between those who receive EUS-CPN in addition to analgesic therapy as compared to analgesic therapy alone. The secondary aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-CPN + analgesic therapy in improvement of quality of life (QOL) of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer when compared to when compared with analgesic therapy alone, compare pain medication usage between Group 1 when compared to Group 2, and compare the referral for rescue block during the course of the study between Group 1 and Group 2</detailed_description>
