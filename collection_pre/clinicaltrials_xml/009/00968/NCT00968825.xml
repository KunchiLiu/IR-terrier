	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of RT001 to Treat Moderate to Severe Lateral Canthal Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single administration of RT001 compared to placebo applied as a bilateral application in at least 72 subjects with moderate to severe Lateral Canthal Lines. Subjects will be randomized within each site to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. The efficacy and safety of RT001 compared to placebo will be evaluated. Study follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4 and 6.</detailed_description>
