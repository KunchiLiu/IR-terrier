	<brief_summary>This is a post-market study of the Rebound Hernia Repair Device to further establish the safety, efficacy, and utility of the Rebound Hernia Repair Device in a controlled population. The Rebound Hernia Repair Device will be used for its approved indication in comparison to "standard" hernia mesh. Two-way students t-tests, Chi squared analysis and ANOVA will be used to detect differences in variables. The study is sufficiently powered to detect a 25% difference. The study data will include quality of life assessments, visual analogue scale , SF-36, Carolinas Comfort Scale), recurrence of hernia (technical failure), use of medications (pain) and complications/adverse events.</brief_summary>
