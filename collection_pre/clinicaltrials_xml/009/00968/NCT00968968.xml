	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone as continued HER2 suppression therapy in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Eligible subjects will have completed 12 to 24 weeks of first- or second-line treatment with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, experienced either complete disappearance of all metastatic lesions, or persistence of metastatic disease (stable disease) without unequivocal progression or the occurrence of new lesions, and been indicated to continue to receive trastuzumab alone as maintenance therapy. Eligible subjects entering the LPT112515 study on first-line treatment will have no known history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases; subjects entering the study on second-line treatment will have no known history of CNS metastases or have stable (asymptomatic and off steroids ≥3 months) CNS metastases. The primary objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects with HER2-positive MBC randomized to receive treatment with lapatinib plus trastuzumab versus those randomized to receive trastuzumab alone. The secondary objectives include overall survival, clinical benefit response rate (CR, PR or SD ≥24 weeks) and the qualitative and quantitative adverse event profile of the 2 treatment arms. It is estimated that 280 subjects (140 per group) will be required to observe 193 PFS events.</brief_summary>
