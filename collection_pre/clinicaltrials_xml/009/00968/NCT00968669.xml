	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of MEDI-528 in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of MEDI-528 on asthma control in adults with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe, persistent asthma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Male or female 2. Age 18 through 65 years at the time of screening 3. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations 4. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with nonsterilized male partner must use adequate contraception from screening through the end of the study. An acceptable method of contraception is defined as one that has no higher than a 1% failure rate. Sustained abstinence is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception 1. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception from screening through the end of the study 2. Females or female partners not of childbearing potential must have been surgically sterilized (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as at least 1 year since last regular menses) 3. Sterilized males must be at least 1year post vasectomy and have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate 5. Weight ≥ 45 kg but ≤ 120 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2 6. Physiciandiagnosed asthma by medical chart 7. Currently taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or is a candidate to receive ICS per Expert Panel Report (EPR)3 8. Prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) value ≥ 40% at Day 28 and Day 1 9. A postbronchodilator increase in FEV1 and/or FVC ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL at Day 28 OR meeting any one of the following criteria: 1. Proof of postbronchodilator reversibility of airflow obstruction ≥ 12% documented within 36 months prior to randomization or proof of a positive response to a methacholine challenge documented within 36 months prior to randomization; OR 2. Proof of partial reversibility of ≥ 8% to &lt; 12% improvement in postbronchodilator FEV1 on Day 28 and achievement of ≥ 12% reversibility at a second time between Day 27 and Day 15; OR 3. If a) and b) are not met and all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, subjects with a FEV1 of ≥ 1.5 L and ≥ 60% on Day 14 will be eligible to undergo a methacholine challenge. If the subject achieves a positive response to this methacholine challenge, then this criterion is met 10. Uncontrolled asthma consistent with EPR3. In the 28 days before screening, subjects should have a history of one or more of the following: Daytime asthma symptoms ≥ 2 days/week Nighttime awakening ≥ 1 night/week Albuterol/salbutamol use ≥ 2 days/week 11. An Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score ≥ 1.5 at Day 28 and at Day 1. 12. At least one asthma exacerbation in the 12 months before screening that required intake of systemic corticosteroids after an unscheduled medical encounter or as agreed with a physician based on an asthma action plan that defines when oral steroids can be taken by the subject 13. Ability and willingness to complete the followup period through Day 323 as required by the protocol. Exclusion Criteria Any of the following would exclude the subject from participation in the study: 1. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results 2. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study 3. Employees of the clinical study site or any other individuals involved with the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such individuals 4. Known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the investigational product formulation 5. History of anaphylaxis to other biologic therapy 6. Lung disease other than asthma (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], cystic fibrosis) 7. Severe depression as measured by a depression score &gt; 15 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at either Day28 or Day 1. 8. History of suicidal behavior in the previous 3 years as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at Day 28. 9. Acute illness other than asthma at the screening and randomization visits 10. History of an active infection within 28 days before and during the screening period, or evidence of clinically significant active infection, including ongoing chronic infection 11. History of ingestion of untreated water in a location known to be infected with parasites, resulting in acute or chronic diarrhea; history of recent travel to areas where parasite infestations are endemic within 6 months before screening; or a diagnosis of parasitic infection within 6 months before screening 12. Use of immunosuppressive medication (except oral prednisone up to a dose of 20 mg every other day or equivalent [eg, 10 mg a day or 5 mg twice a day] and inhaled and topical corticosteroids) within 28 days before randomization 13. Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 28 days before randomization 14. Plans to donate blood during the entire study period 15. Donated blood or has had a blood transfusion within 28 days before screening 16. Receipt of any nonbiological study drugs or interventional therapy (including surgical procedures) within 28 days of the first dose of investigational product in this study 17. Receipt of any biologicals including MEDI528 within 5 halflives before the first dose of investigational product in this study 18. History of any known immunodeficiency disorder 19. A positive hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody, as determined by medical history and/or subject's verbal report 20. A positive human immunodeficiency virus test or is taking antiretroviral medications, as determined by medical history and/or subject's verbal report 21. A live attenuated vaccination received within 28 days before screening 22. History of clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG) in the opinion of the investigator 23. Breastfeeding or lactating 24. History of treatment for alcohol or drug abuse within the past year 25. History suggestive of COPD or of tobacco smoking ≥ 10 packyears 26. Evidence of any uncontrolled systemic disease upon physical examination 27. History of cancer, apart from basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma of the cervix treated with apparent success with curative therapy ≥ 1 year before Day 1 or other malignancies treated with apparent success with curative therapy ≥ 5 years before screening 28. Any noninfectious disease involving multiple organs (eg, cystic fibrosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hemophilia, multiple sclerosis, etc.) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study results 29.
