	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy schedule is more effective in treating patients with malignant spinal cord compression. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different radiation therapy schedules to compare their side effects and how well they work in treating patients with malignant spinal cord compression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the response in patients with malignant spinal cord compression treated with single fraction (10 Gy) radiotherapy vs standard multiple fraction (20 Gy) radiotherapy. - To compare the toxicity of these treatment regimens in these patients. Secondary - Examine the safety, practicability, and efficacy of treatment with a single 10 Gy fraction of radiotherapy in these patients. - Analyze the initial neurological status, document the response to treatment, and calculate median survival of these patients. - Perform an economic impact analysis comparing the two treatment arms. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (control): Patients undergo radiotherapy to the area of spinal cord compression once daily for 5 days (total of 20 Gy). - Arm II: Patients undergo a single fraction of radiotherapy to the area of spinal cord compression (total of 10 Gy). Patients complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality-of-life questionnaire at baseline, at 5 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 5 weeks, at 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
