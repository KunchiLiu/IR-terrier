	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with a radioactive form of the hormone progesterone called FFNP will give the same results as hormone receptor testing already performed on tissue used to diagnose breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female patients 18 years of age or older Biopsyproven breast cancer Tumor estrogenreceptor and progesteronereceptor status already determined or scheduled to be determined at time of surgery without intervening therapy. Primary lesion size â‰¥ 1.5 cm as determined by imaging studies (ultrasonography, mammography, CT or MRI) or physical examination Able to give informed consent Not currently pregnant or nursing: Subject must be surgically sterile (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and / or documented hysterectomy), post menopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year), non lactating, or of childbearing potential for whom a urine pregnancy test (with the test performed within the 24 hour period immediately prior to administration of FFNP) is negative. No previous history of hormone therapy; NOTE subjects who were treated with hormone therapy for reasons other than breast cancer or breast cancer prevention may be allowed to participate after review of history by the primary investigator Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5 years Unable to tolerate 6090 minutes of PET imaging per imaging session</criteria>
