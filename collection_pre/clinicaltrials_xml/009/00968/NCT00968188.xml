	<brief_title>Internet-based HIV/STI Prevention for Young MSM Receiving HIV Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presently, there are a limited number of proven HIV interventions culturally tailored to young men who have sex with men (YMSM). This is alarming because Men who have sex with men comprise 68% of HIV/AIDS diagnoses in men, despite representing a much smaller proportion of the population. In addition, MSM are reporting more sexual risk behavior than in previous years and there is significant concern that HIV infection rates may once again be on the rise after more than a decade of remaining relatively stable. The Internet is a viable intervention avenue because of it's high percentage of accessibility and usage, especially among young adults. Moreover, it might hold a strong appeal for YMSM, since its anonymity confers a sense of perceived safety against stigma surrounding HIV prevention information. The purpose of this study is to compare two different versions of an online HIV/STI intervention for YMSM. This study is part of an overall program of research designed to understand and prevent HIV infection among high-risk youth. Participation in this study will help us to determine the usefulness of an tailored and interactive HIV Internet-assisted intervention.</detailed_description>
