	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) in Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Subject: The investigators intend to include 40 well trained runners, 18 years or older. - Design: Following lung function and exercise testing (incremental treadmill test to exhaustion, 5000m run time trial) participants will be randomly assigned to a verum or a control group. The verum group will train with a hand-held, commercially available pressure threshold loading device (POWERbreathe,UK). The control group will perform a sham-training with the same device. After six to eight weeks the the initial tests will be repeated. - Hypothesis: Inspiratory muscle training enhances performance on submaximal work loads and in the 5000m run time trial by changes in breathing pattern. Maximum oxygen uptake remains unchanged.</detailed_description>
