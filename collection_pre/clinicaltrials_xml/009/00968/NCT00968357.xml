	<brief_summary>SCV-07 (Î³-D-glutamyl-L-tryptophan) is a new immunomodulatory compound that has been developed and patented both for composition and immunomodulatory use and is a synthetic dipeptide. The efficacy of SCV 07 in treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is expected to arise from the drug's ability to stimulate the T-helper 1 (Th1) type immune response and to block signal transducers and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mediated signaling. The purpose of this study is to determine if SCV-07 alone and/or SCV-07 in combination with ribavirin is safe and potentially effective for the treatment of genotype 1 compensated chronic hepatitis C in subjects who have relapsed after a response to a previous treatment course of at least 44 weeks with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. All subjects will receive 4 weeks of SCV-07 (Lead-in Phase), followed by 4 weeks of treatment with SCV-07 in combination with ribavirin (Combination Treatment).</brief_summary>
