	<brief_title>A Study of Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor GDC-0449 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors That Are Refractory to Standard Therapy or for Whom No Standard Therapy Exists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy that has progressed after firstline and secondline therapy (if there is a secondline therapy that has been shown to provide clinical benefit); patients with basal cell carcinoma will be excluded from this study unless they do not qualify for another open GDC0449 clinical trial For patients with disease that is evaluable by physical examination only, diagnosis must also include biomarker confirmation Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 Documented negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and agreement to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of the study Adequate hematopoietic capacity Adequate hepatic function Adequate renal function At least 3 weeks since last chemotherapy, investigational agent, radiation therapy, or major surgical procedure and recovery to pretreatment baseline or stabilization of all treatmentrelated toxicities Exclusion Criteria Known, untreated central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or treated brain metastases that are not radiographically stable for â‰¥ 3 months Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics Clinically significant history of liver disease, including cirrhosis, current alcohol abuse, or current known active infection with hepatitis Any medical condition or diagnosis that would likely impair absorption of an orally administered drug (e.g., gastrectomy, ileal bypass, chronic diarrhea, gastroparesis) Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the patient at high risk from treatment complications Pregnant or lactating Treatment with excluded medications, including strong CYP450 inhibitors and inducers</criteria>
