	<brief_title>Effects of Methylprednisolone After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite of being one of the last century's most successful surgical procedures in treatment of advanced osteoarthritis total hip arthroplasty is still associated with postoperative pain and delayed rehabilitation. The investigators therefore decided to evaluate the effects of pre-operative methylprednisolone (125mg iv) versus placebo on postoperative outcome in a well defined fast-track setup after hip arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
