	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the immune response after stem cell transplant in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with hematologic cancer (blood cancer). Studying samples of blood from HIV-positive patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in the immune system after stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response After Stem Cell Transplant in HIV-Positive Patients With Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the development of donor-derived HIV-1-specific immune response following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for treatment of hematologic malignancy in HIV+ patients. II. Examine the affect of HCT on the pool of latently infected cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T cells in HIV+ patients given HCT for treatment of hematologic malignancy. OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis for analysis of HIV-1 latent reservoir at baseline and at days +90, +180, +365, and +730, and then annually thereafter as feasible.</detailed_description>
