	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of RT001 to Treat Moderate to Severe Lateral Canthal Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, repeat dose, single center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a repeat application of RT001 compared to placebo gel in at least 36 subjects with moderate to severe lateral canthal lines (LCL). Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (active versus placebo). At least 36 adult volunteers who have provided informed consent and have met the study eligibility criteria will be enrolled. There will be 18 subjects in each treatment group.</detailed_description>
