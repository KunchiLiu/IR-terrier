	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor and blood samples from postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer enrolled on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA27.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor and Blood Samples From Postmenopausal Women With Primary Breast Cancer Enrolled on Clinical Trial CAN-NCIC-MA27</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To identify genetic variation, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphisms, that is associated with musculoskeletal adverse events in specimens from postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors and enrolled on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA27. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. DNA from tumor tissue and blood specimens that have been previously collected from patients are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms.</detailed_description>
