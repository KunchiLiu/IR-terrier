	<brief_title>CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis-Sulfonylurea (CANTATA-SU) SGLT2 Add-on to Metformin Versus Glimepiride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well recognized as a major public health problem that presents patients with a significant risk of complications including heart disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Various classes of orally administered antihyperglycemic agents have been developed for the treatment of diabetes and although individual agents may be highly effective for some patients, it is still difficult to maintain optimal glycemic control in most patients, thereby resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality in the diabetic population. This is a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, 3-arm, parallel-group, multicenter study to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of canagliflozin compared with a sulfonylurea (glimepiride) in patients with T2DM, 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive, who are not optimally controlled on metformin monotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that the study drug will be non-inferior to glimepiride as assessed by the change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline. The patients will receive capsules taken by mouth of canagliflozin (either 100 or 300 mg), or glimepiride with a starting dosage of 1 mg, which will be increased to a maximum dose of 6 or 8 mg once daily for a total duration of 104 weeks.</detailed_description>
