	<brief_title>Safety and Immune Response to Two Doses of rDEN2/4delta30 Dengue Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue viruses, which cause dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in several of the world's tropical and subtropical regions. The rDEN2/4delta30(ME) vaccine is a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine that may be protective against dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN2). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rDEN2/4delta30(ME) vaccine in healthy adults. This study will last approximately 5 to 7 months with 25 study visits. Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two cohorts. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive an injection of rDEN2/4delta30(ME) or placebo vaccine at Days 0 and 180. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive an injection of rDEN2/4delta30(ME) or placebo vaccine at Days 0 and 120. Participants will be asked to record their temperature in a diary for 16 days after each vaccination. At each study visit a physical examination, symptom history, and blood and urine collection will occur.</detailed_description>
