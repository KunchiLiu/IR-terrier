	<brief_summary>Patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) with non-specific complaints (NSC) such as "not feeling well", "feeling weak", "being tired", "general deterioration" are a very common and well-known, but poorly studied patient group. The differential diagnosis of NSC is extremely broad ranging from insufficient home care to acute life-threatening conditions. Therefore, the evaluation and diagnostic work-up of these mostly elderly patients with NSC is very time-consuming and not straight-forward. Furthermore, the assessment is complicated by comorbidities, polypharmacy or an altered mental status. For this reason, potentially unnecessary diagnostic efforts are undertaken in order to exclude a serious underlying condition, leading to prolonged throughput times and ED observation unit stays. On the other hand, the patients` condition might be underestimated by ED physicians, which may result in ineffective, delayed or inadequate disposition, as well as poor patient outcomes. BANC (formerly BAUCAS) is a series of clinical studies with the intention to investigate the usefulness of clinical findings and biomarker levels combined for disposition of patients with non-specific complaints presenting to the emergency department.</brief_summary>
