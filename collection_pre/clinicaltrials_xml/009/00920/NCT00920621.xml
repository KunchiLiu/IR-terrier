	<brief_title>Randomized Trial: Maternal Vitamin D Supplementation to Prevent Childhood Asthma (VDAART)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is one of the leading causes of morbidity in children with 60% of all cases diagnosed by age 3. Thus, finding factors that can lead to prevention of this disease would be of great public health importance. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women, and thus, represents a potentially modifiable factor for the prevention of disease. Due to the effect of vitamin D in modulating immune responses, we believe that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant mothers leads to faulty immune system development in the neonate, predisposing them to asthma and allergy. We have observational data from two independent birth cohort studies that higher maternal intakes of vitamin D during pregnancy are each independently associated with a 50% reduction in risk for recurrent wheezing and asthma in 3- and 5-yr old children. However, in order to recommend this as a universal treatment to prevent asthma, a randomized, controlled, clinical trial is necessary. Therefore, we propose a two arm, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, clinical trial of Vitamin D, to determine whether higher vitamin D intake and levels in the pregnant mother will prevent asthma and allergy in the child at age 3. We will identify pregnant women who have asthma or allergies or whose partner has asthma or allergies, from obstetric clinics in the three clinical centers participating in this trial. We will recruit 870 pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and randomize them to one of two treatment arms of a 4-year clinical trial: 4000 IU of Vitamin D in addition to usual prenatal vitamins, n=435; and usual prenatal vitamins alone, n=435. Our primary specific aim is to determine whether adequate vitamin D supplementation in the pregnant mother is associated with reduced incidence of asthma in the child during the first 3 years of life. The sub-aims of the study will include (1) To determine whether adequate vitamin D supplementation in the pregnant mother is associated with reduced secondary outcomes in the child of (a) allergic sensitization, (b) doctor's diagnosis of eczema and (c) lower respiratory tract infections during the first 3 years of life; and (2) To determine whether adequate vitamin D supplementation in the pregnant mother is associated with improved vitamin D status in the mothers and their offspring through measurement of 25(OH)D levels in maternal plasma, cord blood, and children's blood at 1 and 3 yrs of age and (3)To determine whether sufficient vitamin D supplementation in the pregnant mother is associated with reduced incidence of preterm birth (birth &lt;37 weeks gestation), preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and/or Hemolytic anemia, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count (HELLP syndrome) (PB/PE) compared to a usual care control group in VDAART. VDAART Analysis Plan (Addendum to Protocol) All analyses of primary and secondary outcomes stated in the VDAART Protocol will be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) paradigm, unless specifically stated. I. Definition of outcomes. A. Asthma and recurrent wheezing. The primary outcome of the trial will be development of a doctor's diagnosis of asthma and/or recurrent wheeze. While asthma is acknowledged to have its roots in early life, making a definite diagnosis is difficult until the child is older, and wheezing illnesses may be precursors of an asthma diagnosis. Thus, we will have a composite definition for the primary outcome. - Asthma will be defined as a parent's report of physician's diagnosis at any time during the first three years of life, based on questionnaire responses. For time-to-event analyses, the time of incident asthma will be determined by the time of first positive questionnaire response. - Recurrent wheezing will be defined as at least one report of wheezing in the third year of life plus any report of wheezing in any of the first two years of life. Recognizing that wheezing symptoms may be modified by medication use, variable age of onset, and other variables, the following will be included in the composite outcome: - children who had at least one wheezing episode (during the 1st 2 years of life), plus an asthma controller medication (defined as steroid inhalers or nebulizers OR steroid pills or liquids OR leukotriene modifiers) in the third year - children who did not report any wheezing in the first 2 years but who report 2 separate episodes of wheezing in the third year OR are on controller medication (defined as above) on at least 2 separate reports in the third year OR at least 1 report of wheezing and at least 1 separate report of controller medication use in the third year For recurrent wheezing (and the other wheezing phenotypes), the time of incident recurrent wheezing will be determined by the time of first report of wheezing, for time-to-event analyses. In the event that the child meets the definition based solely on the use of controller medication, the first report of use of this controller medication will be used to determine the time of onset of wheezing for time-to-event analyses. For these outcomes, because the questions were asked every 3 months, and recognizing that missing questionnaires occurred, event times will be treated as interval-censored. B. Eczema. Eczema will be defined as a positive response to parent's report of physician's diagnosis at any time during the first three years of life based on the questionnaire responses. C. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRI). Lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) will be defined based on parental responses to questionnaires. LRIs will be defined as a parental report of a physician's diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, or croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). LRIs may occur multiple times over a three-year period in a child. Information on repeated episodes of LRI will be employed for rate estimation and comparison. D. Total and specific IgE. Total and specific serum IgE will be measured from cord blood samples, and from year 3 samples from the children. Total IgE will be analyzed as a continuous outcome. Sensitization will be defined as any specific IgE ≥ 0.35 IU. II. Secondary Analyses. A. Analyses based on levels. Secondary analyses using baseline and follow-up maternal 25OHD levels will be performed. We will investigate the effect of baseline and follow-up maternal levels separately on the development of primary and secondary outcomes in the trial. Additionally, we will categorize mothers into categories based on joint baseline and follow-up levels. Mothers who have baseline levels and follow-up levels ≥ 40 mg/dl will be categorized in the HI-HI group; those who have baseline levels and follow-up levels &lt; 40 mg/dl will be categorized in the LO-LO group; mothers who do not meet these definitions will be categorized either in the HI-LO or LO-HI groups based on their baseline and follow-up levels.</detailed_description>
