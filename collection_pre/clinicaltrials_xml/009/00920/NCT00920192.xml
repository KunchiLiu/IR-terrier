	<brief_title>Safety Study of Foretinib (GSK1363089) in Adults With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of foretinib (also known as GSK1363089) when used in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and to assess the safety and tolerability of that dose in this patient population. The MTD will be identified during Phase I, by standard dose-escalation of foretinib. Then Phase II will assess the safety and tolerability of foretinib dosed at MTD.</detailed_description>
