	<brief_summary>The hypothesis for this study is that a preparative regimen that maximizes host immunosuppression without myeloablation will be well tolerated and sufficient for engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells. It is also to determine major toxicities from these conditioning regimens, within the first 100 days after transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stratum 1: Patient must have a hemoglobinopathy receiving a matched related transplant with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells. Stratum 2: Patient must have thalassemia receiving an unrelated donor transplant with bone marrow or umbilical cord blood stem cells. Stratum 3: Patient must have a hemoglobinopathy receiving a minimally mismatched unrelated donor transplant with bone marrow or single or double umbilical cord blood product. Stratum 4: Patient must have a nonmalignant disorder (excluding hemoglobinopathy) receiving a minor mismatched unrelated donor transplant with bone marrow or single or double umbilical cord blood product.
