	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and document appropriate clinical performance of the new 4-SITE Header / Lead interface in the TELIGEN 100 HE 4-SITE (VR and DR) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) PGs (Models F103; F111), the COGNIS 100 HE 4-SITE cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD (CRT-D) PG (Model P108) when connected to any of the RELIANCE Quadripolar (4-SITE) defibrillation leads. Appropriate clinical performance of system components of the 4-SITE systems other than the new 4-SITE header / lead interface has been evaluated and documented already in the previously conducted COGNIS and TELIGEN 100 HE FIELD FOLLOWING STUDY, The COGENT-4 Field Following Study. Data collected may be used to support international regulatory submissions including the FDA and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The 4-SITE Field Following Study (4-SITE FF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following devices will be used (all are CE-marked): - TELIGEN 100 HE 4-SITE (Single and Dual Chamber ICD) - Model Number: F103 (Quadripolar, VR); - Model Number: F111 (Quadripolar, IS-1, DR) - COGNIS 100 HE 4-SITE (CRT-D) o Model Number: P108 (Quadripolar, IS-1, IS-1) - RELIANCE 4-SITE leads (12 different model numbers in total as shown in the table below)</detailed_description>
