	<brief_summary>Lupus erythematosus systemic is an auto-immune disease the evaluation of the activity of which remains very difficult because of an heterogeneousness of the clinical and biological symptoms. The aim of this study is to develop objective, specific and not invasive methods of evaluation of the activity and the forecast of the disease by using an analysis of the transcriptome on circulating blood. A transcriptomic analysis will be realized in parallel by the usual clinico-biological follow-up at the patients affected by systemic lupus, while the diagnosis before treatment, then during every revaluation of the disease during the period of the study. The already treated patients can also be included in this study.</brief_summary>
