	<brief_title>S9925: Collecting and Storing Samples From Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Establish a central lung cancer specimen repository to serve as a resource for current and future scientific studies. - Correlate clinicopathologic information in the Southwest Oncology Group clinical data base with results of studies using the repository. - Test new hypotheses with the specimens in the repository. OUTLINE: Peripheral blood, sputum, and biopsy specimens are collected from patients. Tissue samples are frozen and stored in a lung cancer specimen repository for later use in correlative studies.
