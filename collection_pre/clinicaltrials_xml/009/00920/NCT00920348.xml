	<brief_summary>Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in Canada. COPD is not just a disease of men, nor is it solely a disease in old age. Women have been underrepresented and early disease has not been studied. Underdiagnosis of COPD remains a significant problem, and it may indicate an unmet healthcare need. This can potentially results not only in a patient been misinformed, but can lead to incorrect management. Epidemiological research is needed to develop a framework to combat this major health problem, by better characterization of the population of men and women at risk and patients with early disease, by better understanding which factors modifiable through health interventions are related to health perception (health-related quality of life) and disease evolution. This will be possible through a nationwide study, the Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung disease (CanCOLD), a prospective longitudinal study. The CanCOLD study is built on the current ongoing prevalence nationwide study, the Canadian Obstructive Lung disease "COLD" study. The CanCOLD will be the first study to assess prevalence of disease across Canada and its consequence in men and women, and to evaluate a conceptual model of disease severity based on patient's health perception (health-related quality of life). Ultimately, this project will extend to a longitudinal follow up (3 years or beyond) and will allow to have a better understanding of the lifestyle risk factors, not only smoking but also diet, physical activity, and co morbid conditions. This will be a great asset to shift from management of a single risk factor (tobacco control) to total COPD risk management. The results of the study will greatly help to assist decision makers in developing policies to improve the diagnosis, the management of COPD and to optimize health care services use.</brief_summary>
