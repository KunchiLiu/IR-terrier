	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if a specific kind of MRI, called Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging (USPIO MRI), which uses an FDA-approved therapeutic agent(Feraheme) to see if it is able to identify small and otherwise undetectable lymph node metastases in people who have pancreatic cancer and are scheduled for surgical resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Operative Staging of Pancreatic Cancer Using Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SPIO MRI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- On the first day, study participants will undergo 2 MRI examinations. A scan will be done prior to administration of the contrast agent (Feraheme) and then a second scan immediately after administration. On the second day, study participants will be asked to return for a third MRI. - All MRI scans will be done at Massachusetts General Hospital.</detailed_description>
