	<brief_title>Effect of Plant Stanol Esters on Blood Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The link between high serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and cardiovascular disease has long been recognized. Dietary plant stanol esters have been shown to effectively reduce serum levels of total and LDL cholesterol. Plant stanols decrease the absorption of both biliary and dietary cholesterol from the small intestine and thereby reduce serum LDL cholesterol levels. This study aims to verify the effect of plant stanol esters on blood lipids. Subjects with elevated fasting blood lipid concentrations will be randomized to study groups. The groups consume yoghurt type minidrink containing plant stanol ester (2 g plant stanols per day) or similar minidrink without plant stanol esters. After 10 weeks study period serum total and lipoproteins lipids, non-cholesterol sterols and apolipoproteins will by analyzed.</detailed_description>
