	<brief_summary>Influenza A is one of the best studied viruses, but continues to have a very large impact on human and animal health. In addition to causing outbreaks of winter flu, it sometimes mutates to create a new virus that spreads quickly around the world. It is puzzling that the same virus appears to cause minor or absent symptoms in some people while killing others. Much remains to be understood. We have assembled an unprecedented group of internationally renowned scientists from England and Scotland who will together focus on studying a few hundred people hospitalised during the current swine flu pandemic. Such a largescale project has never before been attempted, but we are now poised to work together and integrate the many recent advances in biomedical science that relate to understanding how influenza causes disease. The ultimate goal of this collaborative, intensive study is to discover new and effective treatments and to develop better vaccines that can be used in future outbreaks. By integrating the information that we will gather, we will create a unique overview of how influenza causes illness and what might be done to improve patient management.</brief_summary>
