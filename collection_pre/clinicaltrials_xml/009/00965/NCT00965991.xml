	<brief_title>Metformin Compared to Glyburide in Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnant women are screened with a one hour 50g glucose challenge. Women with values of 130 mg/dl or greater are then given a 100g glucose tolerance test. Two abnormal values are diagnostic of gestational diabetes. all women are initially counseled on diet and exercise. Women who fail to maintain a fasting of &lt;105mg/dl and 2 hr postprandial &lt; 120 mg/dl are offered participation in the study. Women were randomized to either metformin or glyburide via a computer generated randomization. Women who fail to meet glycemic goals after receiving the maximum dose of study medication were considered treatment failures and insulin therapy was initiated.</detailed_description>
