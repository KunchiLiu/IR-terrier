	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at increasing the safety of the use of anaesthesia in an elderly population (&gt; 60 years). Patients with decreased physiological reserve, including all elderly patients, have an increased risk of getting an erroneous induction bolus. This project will investigate how fast elderly patients (&gt; 60 years) fall asleep during bolus induction of anaesthesia with two of the most used hypnotics, thiopental and propofol, evaluated with BIS-monitoring and clinical signs of anaesthetic depth. The hemodynamic response will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
