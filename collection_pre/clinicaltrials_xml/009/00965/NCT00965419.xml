	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients must meet Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Ed diagnostic criteria for ADHD based Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders &amp; Schizophrenia for School Aged Children Present and Lifetime Version at screening for new patients/rollover patients. Patients must have an ADHDRSIVParent: Inv total score of at least 1.5 standard deviations above the age/gender norm at both screening/randomization. New patients must have a CGIADHDS score greater than or equal to 4 at both screening/randomization. Patients of childbearing potential agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study and for 1 month following the last dose of study drug. Female patients of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment based on a urine pregnancy test. Patients must have laboratory results, showing no clinically significant abnormalities. Parents/patients must have a degree of understanding sufficient to communicate suitably with the investigator/ study coordinator. Patients must be of normal intelligence. Patients/parents must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments for clinic visits/all tests, including venipunctures and examinations required by the protocol. Patients must be able to swallow tablets. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who weigh less than 16 kg at screening/randomization. Female patients who are pregnant/breastfeeding. Patients who have previously withdrawn/discontinued early from this study or any other study investigating LY2216684. Patients who have a history of Bipolar I/II disorder, psychosis, or pervasive developmental disorder. Patients with a history of any seizure disorder or known electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in the absence of seizures. Patients who are at serious suicidal risk. Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than 1 class of medications, or multiple adverse drug reactions, or known hypersensitivity to LY2216684. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse/dependence within the past 3 months of screening, or who are currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any prescribed or overthecounter medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse/dependence. Patients who screen positive for drugs of abuse cannot participate. Patients who have a medical condition that would increase sympathetic nervous system activity markedly, or who are taking a medication on a daily basis that has sympathomimetic activity are excluded. Patients with problems that would be exacerbated by increased norepinephrine tone including a history of cardiovascular disease, thyroid dysfunction, glaucoma, or urinary retention. Patients who at any time during the study are likely to need psychotropic medications apart from the drugs under study. Patients who have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) during the 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with current or past history of clinically significant hypertension. Patients who are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from a clinical trial involving an offlabel use of an investigational drug, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. Patients whose family anticipates a move outside the geographic range of the investigative site during participation in the study or who plan extended travel inconsistent with the recommended visit intervals. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unsuitable in any other way to participate in this study.</criteria>
