	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is possible to improve health outcomes for patients with Type II diabetes, a community-based health care agency will offer care coordination to half of a study group in a family practice office. The intervention will include assessing patients' status using two instruments: a depression screen (the PHQ9) and a motivation to change scale (the Patient Activation Measure, PAM). A masters-level social worker will counsel patients in the intervention group. Changes in patients' health status, PHQ9 scores and PAM scores over one year will be measured. Outcomes will be compared between the study group and the group without intervention.</brief_summary>
