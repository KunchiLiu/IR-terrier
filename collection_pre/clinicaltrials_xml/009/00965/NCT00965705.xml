	<brief_summary>Temple University is looking for women to participate in a study to evaluate the treatment options available to women living with binge eating disorder. Binge-Eating Disorder is a significant public health problem for women. Despite this, there is limited research on how best to treat this disorder at varying levels of severity. The purpose of this NIMH-funded study is to enroll individuals in a brief form of cognitive-behavior therapy. If more intense treatment is needed, individuals will be randomly assigned to more intensive group and individual treatments (Cognitive-Behavior Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy). Both of these treatments are talking therapies that have been adapted for women living with binge-eating disorder and are free of charge.</brief_summary>
