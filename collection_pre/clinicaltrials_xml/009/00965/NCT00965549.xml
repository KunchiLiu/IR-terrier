	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority at six months of a basal plus one insulin regimen (Lantus plus one injection of Apidra) compared with a biphasic insulin regimen (NovoMix 30) at controlling glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes. The secondary objective are: - To compare the proportion of patients in each treatment group reaching HbA1c target (&lt; 7%) at the end of the treatment period - To compare the rates of hypoglycaemia (total, severe, nocturnal) - To compare the change in body weight from visit 10 to visit 24 - To compare the change in diabetes specific quality of life and other patient reported outcomes from visit 10 to visit 24 - Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status and change (DTSQs+c) - Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) questionnaire - Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) - EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ5D) questionnaire - To record the change in the daily dose of insulin from visit 2 to visit 10 and visit 10 to visit 24</brief_summary>
