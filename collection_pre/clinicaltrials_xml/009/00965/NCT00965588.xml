	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine whether the vaccine (UB 311), targeting the amyloid beta peptide (N-terminal amino acids, 1-14), is safe and immunogenic in patients diagnosed with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta was selected as the target antigen based on supporting evidence of the hypothesis that places the accumulation of amyloid beta at the initiating step of AD.</brief_summary>
