	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of doripenem in participants with nosocomial pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs in which the lungs become heavy; pneumonia occurring at least 48 hours after hospital admission), complicated intra-abdominal (in belly) infections and complicated urinary tract infections (bladder infections).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of Doripenem in Participants With Nosocomial Pneumonia, Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections and Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of doripenem in treating Thai participants with nosocomial pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. The study consists of 4 visits: Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 2 (End-of-Treatment [EOT], up to Day 14), Visit 3 (Phone visit, Test-of-Cure [TOC], up to Day 14 after EOT) and Visit 4 (Phone visit, Day 90). Participants will receive 500 milligram (mg) of doripenem as intravenous infusion (directly into the vein) every 8 hours for at least 3 days after clinical response and extended up to 14 days. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by determination of clinical response. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
