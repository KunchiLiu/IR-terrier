	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of the Vessel Sealing System (LigaSure) in Azygoportal Disconnection and Splenectomy in Patients With Portal Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleeding from esophageal and gastric cardia varices is the major life threatening complication in patients with portal hypertension. Patients with portal hypertension have a mortality rate of 30%-50% at the first episode of esophagogastric variceal rupture. The associated 1-year mortality rate is reported to be 75%. The ideal treatment for gastric varices should effectively control bleeding and improve the liver function to optimum levels. Although endoscopic treatments have showed great promise for esophageal varices, there is still controversy regarding the treatment of gastric varices. Hepatic encephalopathy remain a dominant problems after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (TIPS) and surgical shunts. A meta-analysis has shown that the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and mortality was increased significantly either in nonselective or selective shunt operations. Esophagogastric decongestion and splenectomy with or without esophageal transaction were the fundamental operation performed in our department for patients with portal hypertension. Patients under the azygoportal devascularization methods revealed reduction of the encephalopathy as well as diminished rebleeding rates. The crucial point of the procedure is prevention of the brisk bleeding from the dilated vessels like enlarged azygoportal collaterals. Conventional hand-tied ligatures can become dislodged and represent a foreign body, and more important, it is tedious and time-consuming. The LigaSure vessel sealing system (Valleylab, Boulder, Colorado) is a bipolar electrosurgical device, sealing vessels up to 7 mm in diameter, by denaturing collagen and elastin within vessel wall and surrounding connective tissue. This device was tested, with excellent results, in different fields of surgery (gastrointestinal, hepatopancreatobiliary, urologic, gynecologic, laparoscopic, etc), as demonstrated by several recently published studies. Shamiyeh et al confirmed the reliability of LigaSure for the closure of the veins in laparoscopic azygoportal disconnection procedure on the portal hypertension porcine model in 2005, there was no intra- or post-operative bleeding and no conversion to open surgery, and when more than 2 mm far from the thermal energy source, no collateral damage of the solid tissue such as stomach could be detected.</detailed_description>
