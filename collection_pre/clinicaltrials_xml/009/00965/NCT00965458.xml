	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to test whether a drug called alefacept will slow or halt destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas. If the destruction of the beta cells is stopped, the patients might be able to produce insulin on their own longer, which could stop or slow the progression of their type 1 diabetes. This is a multi-center prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomized trial to investigate the ability of alefacept to protect residual beta cells from ongoing autoimmune destruction in adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inducing Remission in Type 1 Diabetes With Alefacept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T1DM is an autoimmune disease that can emerge suddenly, causing dependence on insulin for life. This means that the immune system (the part of your body that helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin (beta cells). As beta cells are destroyed, one's ability to produce insulin is decreased. Insulin helps keep blood glucose (sugar) levels normal. For a period right after diagnosis, the pancreas is still able to make small amounts of insulin. Individuals with diabetes who have the ability to produce some of their own insulin may be able to achieve better blood sugar control than people who produce no insulin at all. Based on previous research, doctors think that giving medicines to affect the immune system soon after diagnosis may stop, delay, or decrease the destruction of beta cells, resulting in better glucose control. This can help prevent secondary complications of diabetes down the road. Research has improved the outlook for T1DM over the last decade. Doctors are investigating, for example, how to save insulin-producing cells and extend the honeymoon period as long as possible. Despite progress towards understanding the science behind T1DM, there remains a significant need to investigate alternative approaches to this disease in order to bring about long-term remission. For this reason, scientists are working hard to develop new treatments that can be given soon after diagnosis to preserve the remaining beta cells. Currently there is no cure for T1DM; however, with new investigational medications and innovative clinical research studies, such as T1DAL, a new approach towards managing T1DM may be on the horizon. Enrollees will receive weekly intramuscular injections of alefacept or placebo for two 12 week periods, with a 12-week pause between treatment intervals. This schedule or drug dosing may be altered due to the needs of the subject or at the discretion of the physician investigator.</detailed_description>
