	<brief_summary>It has been shown that the immediate insertion of intrauterine devices (IUDs) post-abortion prevents repeat abortions. The researchers hypothesize that providing free IUDs post-abortion will be associated with a lower rate of repeat abortion in a Canadian population. Further, the researchers hypothesize that providing free IUDs post-abortion will be associated with decreased costs for the health care system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Abortion IUD &amp; Recurrent Abortion 2001-2004</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researchers intend to demonstrate whether there are statistically significant differences in the rates of repeat abortions between three groups: 1. women choosing to have an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted immediately post-abortion, 2. those choosing to begin oral contraceptives immediately post-abortion, and 3. all other choices for post abortion contraception including those stating an intention to obtain contraceptives at a later time or from an alternate location or to use no contraception. This data will then be used to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of health system provision for cost-free IUDs post-abortion. The researchers will conduct a retrospective observational cohort study by chart review. The researchers propose to review the charts of 600 women undergoing abortions between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2004 at Kelowna General Hospital's Women's Services Clinic. The researchers will record the following data from each chart: age, parity, gestational age, date of index therapeutic abortion (TA), dates of subsequent TAs, contraception used at the time of the index conception, contraceptive method chosen post-abortion, and outcome of follow-up at two weeks, such as expulsion of IUD. The researchers will also record the recurrent pregnancy rates.</detailed_description>
