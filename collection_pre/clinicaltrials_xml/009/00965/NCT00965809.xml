	<brief_summary>Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating anxiety disorder which is widespread in every social level and is very prevalent in outpatient and inpatient settings. A recent open-label study showed that the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist Nabilone had beneficial effects abolishing or greatly reducing nightmares that persisted in spite of treatment with conventional PTSD medications. Furthermore, a big number of patients suffering from chronic PTSD report using smoked marijuana because its tranquilizing effect and sleep quality improvement. According to clinical and epidemiological data different derivates from the cannabis plant are illegally and pervasively consumed by PTSD patients in order to reduce distress.
