	<brief_summary>Dendritic cell therapy is a promising strategy for adjuvant cancer therapy in the setting of minimal residual disease (MRD) to fight off cancer relapse and/or progression. The investigators already performed a phase I safety study in leukemia patients that were in complete remission demonstrating the absence of side effects and feasibility of the therapy. Here, the investigators want to extend on this strategy by studying the clinical efficacy of autologous DC vaccination in patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia and myeloma patients. Effects of DC therapy on the immune reactivity towards leukemia cells as well as clinical parameters such molecular MRD monitoring, time to relapse (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS) will be studied in vaccinated and non-vaccinated (control) patients. Patients will be vaccinated using their own dendritic cells electroporated with mRNA coding for the full-length Wilms' tumor antigen WT1.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): all FAB subtypes except M3. Extent of disease: clinical remission after at least one course of polychemotherapy high risk of relapse due to age (&gt; 60 years) or poor risk cytogenetic/molecular markers or hyperleukocytosis at presentation or previous relapse Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): patients in chronic phase under therapy with tyrosinase kinase inhibitors who have suboptimal response or failure and who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Multiple Myeloma (MM): symptomatic with active disease, independent of earlier and/or concomitant treatment: Presence of serum/urine M protein (&gt; 3 g/dl) Bone marrow plasmacytosis (&gt;1030%) Anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia, and/or lytic bone lesions Overexpression of WT1 RNA in peripheral blood and or bone marrow as assessed by quantitative RTPCR at the time of presentation.For CML: residual molecular disease as demonstrated by BCRABL RTPCR Prior treatments: Patients must have received at least one prior antileukemic chemotherapeutic regimen and must be more than 1 month past the last treatment. Age: ≥ 18 years Performance status: WHO PS grade 01 (Appendix B) Objectively assessable parameters of life expectancy: more than 3 months Prior and concomitant associated diseases allowed with the exception of underlying autoimmune disease and positive serology for HIV/HBV/HCV No concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs adequate renal and liver function, i.e. creatinin and bilirubin = 1.2 times the upper limit of normal absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial Women of childbearing potential should use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation Subjects with concurrent additional malignancy (with exception of nonmelanoma skin cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix) Subjects who are pregnant Subjects who have sensitivity to drugs that provide local anesthesia Subjects needing corticosteroids 1 mg/kg during vaccination; corticosteroids are allowed as part of their treatment when taken ≥ 30 days before the start of vaccination.</criteria>
