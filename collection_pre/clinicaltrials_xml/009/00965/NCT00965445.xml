	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress is an unavoidable event during cardiac surgery. Isoprostanes have been demonstrated to be a reliable biomarker for the evaluation of oxidative stress in vivo.The aims of this study are(1)to develop an accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the detection of urinary isoprostane isomers in samples collected from healthy volunteers(for method quality control) and patients receiving a cardiac surgery (2)to investigate the change of isoprostanes after cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) (3)to investigate the effect of different anesthetics on isoprostanes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enhanced production of oxygen free radicals can lead to the generation of oxidative stress, which is harmful to human tissue and organs. Reactive oxygen species are released abruptly during some surgical procedures, and they are the major causes of ischemia-reperfusion injuries.Isoprostanes have been demonstrated to be a reliable biomarker for the evaluation of oxidative stress in vivo. Therefore, accurately monitoring and avoiding the occurrence of oxidative stress during surgery is an important clinical issue. Isoprostanes are a series of prostaglandin-like compounds produced by non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid.The aims of this study are(1)to develop an accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the detection of urinary isoprostane isomers in samples collected from patients receiving a cardiac surgery (2)to investigate the change of isoprostanes after cardiopulmonary bypass (3)to investigate the effect of different anesthetics on isoprostanes during surgery.</detailed_description>
