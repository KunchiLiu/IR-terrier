	<brief_summary>Patients with COPD who deteriorate to Respiratory Failure pose a challenge to the intensivist both in ventilating an obstructed patient and in weaning from mechanical ventilation. Currently there are no accepted extubation criteria in COPD patients that could predict successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. In this study we will attempt to correlate spirometric data to eventual weaning from mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>COPD patients who deteriorate to Respiratory Failure will be recruited. Sedation will be interrupted daily, and each day once the patient is awake and cooperative, spirometry will be performed. FEV1 and FVC will be recorded and later correlated to eventual rate of successful extubation.</detailed_description>
