	<brief_summary>There is a move to "scarless surgery" and this achieved by doing laparoscopic abdominal surgery though a single small umbilical incision. A technique for laparoscopic appendectomy done through a single incision utilizing conventional instruments has been developed. The operative risk of the single incision approach is no different that the standard three incision laparoscopic appendectomy. The goal is to study the operative time, length of hospital stay, and complications from this operation.</brief_summary>
