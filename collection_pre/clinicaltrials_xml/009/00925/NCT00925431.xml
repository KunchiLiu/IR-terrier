	<brief_summary>Research has shown that weight problems are very common in fibromyalgia. Research also suggests that overweight and obesity may contribute to worsening of fibromyalgia symptoms and biochemical vulnerability associated with fibromyalgia. Effective weight management may be important in not only improving general health but also better management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Research has indicated that nutrition and coping education is important aspects of successful weight management. In this study, the investigators are evaluating the effect of nutrition and coping education on weight and symptom management of fibromyalgia among overweight and obese patients.</brief_summary>
