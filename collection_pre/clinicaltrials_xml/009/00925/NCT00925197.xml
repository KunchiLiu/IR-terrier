	<brief_title>Patient International Normalised Ratio (INR) Self-Testing Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first French, prospective, randomised, single centre study, comparing patient self-testing (PST) of international normalised ratio (INR), with conventional laboratory monitoring. Aims of the study are to prove correlation between laboratory and PST measurements, estimation of INR variability within a target therapeutic zone and frequency of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events after mechanical heart valve replacement. Patients (206) were postoperatively, randomly, consecutively included (2004 - 2008): 103 patients in each group, with a one year follow-up. Two INR control devices were selected: Coaguchek® (Roche) and INRATIO® (Hemosense).</detailed_description>
