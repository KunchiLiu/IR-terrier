	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of Oral AT1001 (Migalastat Hydrochloride) in Patients With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in 60 patients at approximately 40 sites worldwide. The study will consist of two stages and an open-label treatment extension phase: Stage 1 includes a screening period of up to 2 months followed by a 6-month treatment period which will involve 4 visits to the clinic. Patients will be randomized in equal proportions to receive either AT1001 or placebo. After completing the 6-month double-blind phase, all patients will enter Stage 2 of the study and receive AT1001 in an open-label manner. Stage 2 treatment will last for 6 months and will involve 4 visits to the clinic. Subjects who complete both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the study as scheduled may be offered the opportunity to participate in an open-label treatment extension phase with AT1001. The open-label treatment extension phase will last 12 months and will involve 2 visits to the clinic. A follow-up visit will be undertaken 1 month following completion or discontinuation from the open-label treatment extension. Subjects completing the 12 month open-label treatment extension and providing consent to enter a separate long term extension will not be required to complete this follow-up visit. Study assessments will include clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, kidney biopsy, kidney function testing, echocardiography, and patient reported outcomes.</detailed_description>
