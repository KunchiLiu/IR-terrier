	<brief_title>Patient Benefit From the New Modular Shoulder Prosthesis PROMOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective of the study: The primary objective is to quantify patient benefit after primary total shoulder arthroplasty with the modular PROMOS™ shoulder system in a multicenter cohort study (real world approach). Patient benefit will be quantified using objective and validated subjective measures of function, activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL). Secondary objectives: - Rate of implant related findings like radiological loosening of the glenoid and complications like intraoperative stem fissures - Prosthesis survival at common time points, e.g. 5 and 10 years</detailed_description>
