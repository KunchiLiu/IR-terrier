	<brief_summary>Subjects up to the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma requiring treatment are eligible. Minimal pretreatment (2 cycles of chemotherapy; local irradiation; surgery) is permitted. After enrollment, patients are to receive four cycles of RAD induction treatment: a combination of lenalidomide (Revlimid), adriamycin, and dexamethasone. If at least a minimal response is achieved to RAD, they will undergo chemomobilization (cyclophosphamide, etoposide) of peripheral blood stem cells and one uniform cycle of high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed by a first stem cell transplant. If any of the high-risk features (such as elevated beta 2-microglobulin, adverse cytogenetic factors, elevated LDH, Ig A isotype) were present at diagnosis, patients will be allocated to a consolidative allogeneic transplant following dose-reduced conditioning. If no appropriate donor is available, the patient does not consent or lacks of high-risk features a second autograft following high-dose melphalan will be delivered. All patients will proceed to lenalidomide maintenance (one year) following hematopoietic reconstitution.</brief_summary>
