	<brief_title>Dosimetry Study of I-131-CLR1404 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I-131-CLR1404 is a small-molecule, phospholipid ether analog that combines lipid-like properties with a cancer therapeutic beta-emitting radioisotope. Cellectar believes that this compound will benefit individuals with cancer due to its selective retention and accumulation in malignant cells versus nonmalignant cells. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that I-131-CLR1404 significantly slows malignant tumor growth in several mouse tumor models.</detailed_description>
