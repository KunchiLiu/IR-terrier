	<brief_summary>Approximately 1/3 of persons living with HIV infection are co-infected with tuberculosis (TB). Rifabutin, used in the treatment of TB, is an inducer of drug metabolism thus may decrease concentrations of lersivirine if co-administered. Lersivirine is a modest inducer of drug metabolism, thus lersivirine may decrease concentrations of rifabutin as well.</brief_summary>
