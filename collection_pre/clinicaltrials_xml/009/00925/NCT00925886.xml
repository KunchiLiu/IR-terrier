	<brief_title>Use of Toric Intraocular Lens to Neutralize Keratometric Astigmatism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Cataract are treated with phacoemulsification of the lens with an implantation of an intraocular lens. Besides cataract, almost 25% of these patients have some degree of Astigmatism; when it is higher than 1 diopter, it is possible to neutralize it with an implantation of a toric intraocular lens.</detailed_description>
