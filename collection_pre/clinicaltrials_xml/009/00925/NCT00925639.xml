	<brief_summary>Hypoestrogenism, common in menopause, is responsible for systemic and metabolic changes affecting women's wellness, favoring hot flashes, urogenital atrophy and bone mass loss. Hormone reposition therapy (HRT) with estrogen or estrogen associated to progesterone is administered to minimize these effects. Meanwhile, the beneficial effects of HRT are known, there is still concern about its adverse effects such as thromboembolic and cardiovascular effects, increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer. Thus, there is an increasing interest in the development of phytohormonal HRT. The aim of the investigators' study is to evaluate the effects of concentrated extract of soy on hypercoagulation markers in menopausal women.</brief_summary>
