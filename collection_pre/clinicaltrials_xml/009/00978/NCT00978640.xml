	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: during fasting and exercise will there be an activation of sirtuins (Sirt1). Primarily the investigators will investigate Sirt1 activity in muscle- and fat-biopsies after fasting for 36 hours and after 1 hour of ergometer-cycling at 50 Vo2max. In addition to this the investigators will investigate the effect of fasting and exercise on the velocity of carbamide synthesis, aminoacid rate of turnover and glucose rate of turnover.</brief_summary>
