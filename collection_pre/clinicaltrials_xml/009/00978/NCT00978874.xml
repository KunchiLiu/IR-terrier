	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F 18 EF5 PET/CT imaging, may help find oxygen in tumor cells. It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying fluorine F 18 EF5 PET/CT imaging to see how well it works in finding hypoxia in tumor cells of patients with locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorine F 18 EF5 PET/CT Imaging in Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent/Metastatic Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine if the presence and heterogeneity of hypoxia can be detected by fluorine F 18 EF5 binding in tumors during PET/CT imaging in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix. - To determine if fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake correlates with fluorine F 18 EF5 uptake. - To assess the relationship between fluorine F 18 EF5 uptake and disease-free and overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage (locally advanced vs recurrent or metastatic disease). Patients receive fluorine F 18 EF5 IV followed by PET/CT imaging from the base of skull to upper thigh at baseline and during radiotherapy or chemotherapy (i.e., at 3-4 weeks after the initiation of radiotherapy or after the 4th, 5th, or 6th course of chemotherapy). Patients also undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT imaging within 7 to 10 days of the second fluorine F 18 EF5 scan. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
