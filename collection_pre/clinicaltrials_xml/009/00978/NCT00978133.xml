	<brief_summary>2-octylcyanoacrylate (2-OCA) has been used extensively in clinical practice in trauma, plastic surgery, orthopaedic surgery, emergency medicine and paediatrics. Most studies on 2-OCA to date have focused on closure of short wounds, and only one has included closure of abdominal wounds in the context of general surgery. Here, the investigators will look at the results of closure of abdominal wounds in patients undergoing elective colectomies with 2-OCA, which is commercially available to us, versus closure with skin staples, which is the current standard technique of skin closure employed in the Department of Colorectal Surgery, Singapore General Hospital. The primary objective was to measure effectiveness of 2-OCA in 2 respects - the adequacy of wound healing and cosmesis, and the incidence of superficial wound infection.</brief_summary>
