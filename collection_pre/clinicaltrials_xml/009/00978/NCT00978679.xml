	<brief_title>Peripheral Optics in Myopia and Orthokeratology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apart from being effective in reducing low to moderate myopia, orthokeratology has been shown to have potential in retarding myopic progression. The central cornea is flattened and peripheral optics altered in orthokeratology and it has been suggested that orthokeratology slows myopic progression through the alteration of peripheral optics. The aim of the current study is to investigate the changes in peripheral refraction and aberration in children wearing orthokeratology (study group) and single-vision spectacles (control group).</detailed_description>
