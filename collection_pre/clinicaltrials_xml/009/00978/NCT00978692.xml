	<brief_title>Toric Orthokeratology - Slowing Eye Elongation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ortho-k has been shown to be effective in correcting low myopia but relatively ineffective for astigmatism, using spherical reverse geometry lens designs. Toric ortho-k lenses have been introduced in recent years but the efficacy for astigmatic reduction and for myopic control in children have not been confirmed. The mechanism of myopic reduction in ortho-k cannot be fully explained by changes to the anterior corneal curvatures. It is therefore possible that other corneal parameters such as posterior corneal curvature and corneal biomechanics may contribute to the mechanism. The current study aims at investigating the efficacy of toric ortho-k lenses for correcting myopic astigmatism and for retarding myopic progression in children compared to children wearing single-vision spectacles. Long term changes to other corneal parameters such as posterior cornea curvatures, topographical corneal thickness, corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor, with and without ortho-k lens wear will also be investigated.</detailed_description>
