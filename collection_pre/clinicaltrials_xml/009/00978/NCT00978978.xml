	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing the use of Propofol and traditional sedation (Midazolam and Fentanyl) for diagnostic and screening endoscopies in patients with liver diseases. The investigators' working hypothesis is that the use of propofol will be translated in a shorter recovery and discharge times with a higher patient satisfaction and a decrease in general complications in the context of patients with advanced liver disease.</brief_summary>
