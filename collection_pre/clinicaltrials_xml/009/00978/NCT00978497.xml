	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Antiviral Activity of ANA598 Administered in Combination With Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin for the Treatment of Genotype-1 Chronic HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of ANA598, administered orally at 200 mg BID or 400 mg BID for 12 weeks in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (SOC) will be compared to placebo + SOC. Treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 infection will be eligible for enrollment. Patients randomized to ANA598 will receive a loading dose of 800 mg q 12 hours administered on the first day of dosing. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 and week 12 will be randomized to receive either an additional 12 or 36 weeks of SOC alone. Ninety patients will be randomized into 2 cohorts. The forty-five patients in each cohort will be randomized as 30 active: 15 placebo.</detailed_description>
