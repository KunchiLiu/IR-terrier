	<criteria>This study enrolled participants with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+)chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had demonstrated hematologic resistance or intolerance to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) and had experienced clinical benefit (in Investigator's opinion) on protocol CA180002. Signed written informed consent Previous treatment with dasatinib on protocol CA180002 and receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator Completed a minimum of 3 months on protocol CA180002 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)performance status 0, 1, or 2 (See Appendix 1) Prior history of Ph+ chronic, accelerated, or blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL Women of childbearing potential(WOCBP)who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 12 weeks after the study WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Met the criteria as defined in protocol CA180002 for discontinuation of therapy which includes: Withdrawal of informed consent (subject's decision to withdraw for any reason) Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued treatment with dasatinib is not in the best interest of the subject Imprisonment or the compulsory detention for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness Medical History and Concurrent Diseases A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection which would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy; Uncontrolled angina within 3 months Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes) Prolonged corrected QT(QTc) interval on preentry electrocardiogram (&gt; 450 msec) Uncontrolled hypertension Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent; History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to CML, including: 1. Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) 2. Diagnosed acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired antifactor VIII antibodies) Physical and Laboratory Test Findings Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 mg/dl alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 2 times the institutional upper limits of normal Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal Prohibited Therapies and/or Medications Patients currently taking drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes including: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide erythromycins, clarithromycin chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine. Medications that inhibit platelet function and any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) or anticoagulants are prohibited unless a previous exception on CA180002 was granted by the medical monitor. Subjects taking anagrelide for thrombocytosis due to CML are eligible for this protocol</criteria>
