	<brief_title>Comparison of Glargine and Oral Antidiabetic Drugs (OADs) in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: OBJECTIVE—Type 2 diabetes is associated with defects in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Hyperglycemia may aggravate these defects, a feature known as glucose toxicity. Previous studies have shown that acute correction of hyperglycemia in subjects with long-standing type 2 diabetes gives only short-term improvement in glycemic control after discontinuation of insulin. The current study attempts to identify whether basal insulin glargine or metformin-based OADs for further management would have a long-term benefit in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after short-term intensive insulin therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (fasting blood glucose &gt;200 mg/dL or random blood glucose &gt;300 mg/dL) will be hospitalized and treated with intensive insulin injection for 10 to 14 days. HbA1c were measured before intensive insulin injection. After discharge, patients will be randomized to receive basal insulin injection or metformin-based OADs for further management. Patients will be followed in our clinics and adjust their medication according to their blood glucose levels. HbA1c were measured 6 months later.After the six-month intervention, these patients were continually followed up for another six months. Subjects received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after the intensive insulin therapy and at the end of the 6th and 12th month. EXPECTED RESULTS—We will expect that basal insulin glargine,compared with metformin-based OAD treatment,could more effectively maintain adequate glycemic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after short-term intensive insulin therapy.</detailed_description>
