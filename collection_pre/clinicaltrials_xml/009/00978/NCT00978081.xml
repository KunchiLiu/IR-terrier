	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy in treating patients with premalignant or early stage head and neck tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Premalignant or Early Stage Head and Neck Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the toxicities associated with aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy when administered continuously or in fractionated doses in patients with premalignant or early stage head and neck lesions. Secondary - To assess the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of photodynamic therapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral aminolevulinic acid and then undergo continuous photodynamic therapy 4-6 hours later. - Arm II: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid as in arm I and then undergo fractionated photodynamic therapy 4-6 hours later. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
