	<brief_summary>Primary: - To assess the effects of ascending repeated-doses of oral [p.o.] neramexane at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic steady-state doses on cardiac repolarisation (QT/QTc interval) in healthy male and female subjects. Secondary: - To assess the pharmacokinetics [PK] of neramexane and N-OH neramexane (if a validated method will be available for this metabolite) following repeated daily doses of 50 mg (steady state), 75 mg (steady state) and 87.5 mg (steady state). - To assess the safety and tolerability of neramexane 50 mg, 62.5 mg, 75 mg and 87.5 mg repeated-dose treatments when gradually up-titrated in healthy subjects. - To assess the concentration-QT relationship.</brief_summary>
