	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is evaluate the response, safety and tolerability in subjects receiving the investigational drugs, RAD001 and LBH589. Subjects in Part 1 will receive one drug for four cycles followed by 4 cycles of the second drug unless they achieve complete remission. Subjects in a complete remission may receive up to 6 cycles of study drug and will not receive the next study drug until there is evidence of disease progression. Subjects in Part 2 will receive both drugs together for at least 2 cycles and up to 13 if tolerated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epigenetic Modulation in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, non-randomized, un-blinded phase 2 efficacy trial using a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor for epigenetic targeted therapies. Subjects will receive RAD001 and LBH589 given in two to thirteen, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be assessed for disease status after 2 cycles and then after every 4 cycles. Subjects with progressive disease will stop after 2 cycles. Subjects with stable disease or better les may receive up to 13 cycles. LBH589 was given at 40mg when the study first opened and was changed to 20mg po shortly thereafter. LBH589 is taken on days M/W/F. RAD001 was given at 10mg po daily for Part 1. In Part 2, LBH589 is given at 15mg and RAD001 is given at 7.5mg. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years after completion of therapy or until progression of disease or death.</detailed_description>
