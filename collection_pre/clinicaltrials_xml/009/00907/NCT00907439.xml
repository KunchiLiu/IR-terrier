	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Inhaled Anesthetics on Diastolic Heart Function Using a Doppler-derived Efficiency Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diastolic heart dysfunction is a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity and is the cause of symptomatic heart failure in approximately one half of patients who are admitted to hospitals with heart failure symptoms. However, diastolic heart function remains difficult to measure objectively without cardiac catheterization. Diastolic heart dysfunction is also common among patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Despite the ubiquitous use of inhaled volatile drugs to maintain anesthesia in these patients, their effects upon diastolic heart function remain unclear.</detailed_description>
