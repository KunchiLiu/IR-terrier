	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if BhCG testing to determine the completion of medical abortion simplifies the medical abortion protocol. Investigators hypothesize that women randomized to ultrasonographic determination of completion of medical abortion will have MORE follow-up visits/interventions beyond standard protocol than those randomized to medical abortion follow-up with serum BhCG. The investigators also hope to explore satisfaction with BhCG based follow-up among women seeking medical abortion. Investigators hypothesize that the majority of women who choose to follow-up with serum BhCG will be satisfied with this method of medical abortion follow-up.</brief_summary>
