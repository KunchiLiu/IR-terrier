	<criteria>18 years of age or older at time of enrollment Presenting to the ED within 6 hours from onset of chest discomfort (pain, pressure, tightness, etc) consistent with a possible diagnosis of AMI or ACS and with an initial ECG nondiagnostic for injury (or injury equivalent resulting in emergent reperfusion therapy). (NOTE: Subjects who have chest discomfort that is episodic or stuttering in nature may be included if the ED presentation is within 6 hours of symptom onset.) Experiencing at least 30 minutes of chest pain or other anginal equivalent symptoms. (Note: Subjects who have symptoms of shorter duration due to pharmacologic intervention may be included.) Patient (or Legal Representative) unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent. Patient unwilling or unlikely to comply with study procedures, including protocolspecified blood sampling or telephone followup at 30 days and 6 months. Vulnerable populations as deemed inappropriate for study by site principal investigator. STelevation or other ECG criteria that result that is diagnostic for AMI and results in patient being sent for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) or being treated with thrombolytics6.
