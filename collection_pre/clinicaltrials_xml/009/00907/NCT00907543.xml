	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment. Quality of life questionnaires will be completed every 2 months up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus (&gt; 20 cm from the incisors) or gastroesophageal junction are included. No distant metastases (M0). Patients will be stratified by stage (clinical N0 versus clinical N1), and surgeon. Patients with tumours within 3 cm distal spread into gastric cardia as detected by esophagogastroscopy. Resectable mediastinal nodes are eligible. No prior chemotherapy for this malignancy. No prior radiotherapy that would overlap the field(s) treated in this study. Patients with other malignancies are eligible only if &gt; 5 years without evidence of disease or completely resected or treated nonmelanoma skin cancer. Age &gt; 18 years and able to tolerate trimodality therapy at the discretion of the treating thoracic surgeon, medical and radiation oncologists. Tumours must be resectable after assessment by the thoracic surgeon. Cancers of the cervical esophagus (&lt; 20 cm are excluded). Tumours that have &gt; 3 cm of spread into cardia of the stomach are considered gastric cancers and are ineligible. Patients with biopsy (by endoscopic ultrasound, laparoscopy, or laparotomy ) proven metastatic supraclavicular nodes are ineligible. Patients with biopsy proven metastatic celiac nodes are ineligible.</criteria>
