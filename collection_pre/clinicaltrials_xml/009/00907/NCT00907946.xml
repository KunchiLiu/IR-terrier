	<brief_summary>The investigators are trying to determine whether placement of a nephrostomy tube prior to definitive stone surgery and under ultrasonic or fluoroscopic guidance will reduce complications related to bleeding and infection compare to obtaining renal access at the time of surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Previously Placed Nephrostomy Tract (NT) Versus Single Stage Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We seek to identify whether the placement of a nephrostomy tract prior to surgery versus at the time of PCNL will: 1. decrease blood loss and related complications, and 2. decrease infection-related complications by providing the ability to an accurate collection of urine for culture and initiating appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to definitive stone management. In addition, we seek to determine whether renal puncture under fluoroscopic vs ultrasonic guidance is associated with less blood loss. Although retrospective studies have shown some benefit to placing the nephrostomy tube prior to surgery in terms of decreased blood loss, there are no well-designed, prospective studies comparing the two treatment approaches. We seek to determine which treatment approach is safer, more efficacious, and more cost-effective through a prospective, randomized trial.</detailed_description>
