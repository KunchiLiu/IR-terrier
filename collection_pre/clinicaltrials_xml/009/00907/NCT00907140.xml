	<brief_summary>Rationale: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), may help determine response to standard cancer therapy in patients with cervical cancer The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in cervical tumor heterogenity as measured by FDG-PET/CT imaging.</brief_summary>
