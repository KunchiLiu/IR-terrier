	<brief_summary>Objective: Evaluate the muscular strength in the ageing process and identify the changes between the abdominal muscles, upper and louver edges. Method: 48 individuals participated in this study, being divided into four groups according to the age: (G1) 11to 18 years old, (G2) 20 to 26 years old, (G3) 45 to 60 years old and (G4) 66 - 82 years old. The excluding criterion included people who work out more than three times a week, severe arthrosin, stroke, significant cognitive deficit , obesity, use of ortheses for louver members or any break, with or without metallic implant. The evaluation instruments used were: (1) Esfigmomanômetro (EM), (2) Trunk flexor in the supine position,, (3) Jamar Dinamômetro and (4) Preston Pinch Gauge Dinamômetro.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Forty-eight subjects participated voluntarily in this work and is divided into four groups of 12 participants with 6 men and 6 women: (G1) 11 to 18 years (G2) 20 to 26 years (G3) from 45 to 60 and (G4) 66 to 82 years, selected in dependency of Unifran and residences of the city of Franca, Sao Paulo - Brazil. To evaluate muscle strength, a BD sphygmomanometer was used to analyze the strength of flexors and extensors of the knee. The Jamar Dynamometer was used to assess the functional integrity of the upper and Preston Pinch Gauge Dynamometer for evaluation of gripper hands.</detailed_description>
