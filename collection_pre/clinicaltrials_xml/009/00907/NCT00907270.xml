	<brief_summary>Participants will be randomly assigned in one of two groups. Group A: oral supplementation with 4,000 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol). Group B: oral supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol). Both treatments will be consumed daily for 6 months. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, three and six months. Variables related to leptin resistance will be evaluated. The main hypothesis is that vitamin D will diminish leptin resistance in overweight and obese women. If the hypothesis is confirmed, women will show a reduction in the Resting energy expenditure: serum Leptin ratio (REE: Leptin ratio), as well as a reduction of hunger, body weight, body and abdominal fat and an increase in resting energy expenditure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subjects will get dietary advice and physical activity counseling. At the end of the study, participants with suboptimal vitamin D levels (&lt;80 nmol/L 25-OH-D) will receive treatment to normalize their vitamin D status. Variables related to leptin resistance like resting metabolic expenditure, hunger, body weight and human body fat will be assessed. Outcomes will include, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 &amp; TNF-α) and non-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10 &amp; TGF-β-1).</detailed_description>
