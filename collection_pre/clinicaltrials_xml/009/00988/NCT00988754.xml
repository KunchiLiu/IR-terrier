	<brief_title>School Based Health Promotion Program in Secondary Schools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current understanding of physical activity in childhood demonstrates the health benefits of regular exercise, such as improved cardiovascular fitness, skeletal health and prevention of overweight and obesity. The children obtained weekly health education lessons from their teachers to increase the physical activity in and outside of school and to improve health behavior (healthy food, no drugs) as well as the general well-being of children. Monthly training for teachers and regular training (2-3x/year) for the parents complete the intervention.</detailed_description>
