	<brief_summary>Subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis will be randomized to 320 mcg of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) using a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant or placebo as a nasal aerosol. The subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy for a period of 30 or 52 weeks. BDP HFA is a steroid which is currently FDA approved for the treatment of asthma. BDP-HFA should be safe and effective as a "dry" nasal aerosol which may be preferred by some patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects, 12 years of age or older as of the Screening Visit (SV) General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the study A history of PAR to a relevant perennial allergen for a minimum of two years immediately preceding the study Screening Visit (SV). The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required treatment (either continuous or intermittent) in the past, and in the investigator's judgment is expected to require treatment throughout the entire study A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a standard skin prick test. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the diluent control wheal for the skin prick test. Documentation of a positive result 12 months prior to Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable Other criteria apply History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent nasal biopsy, nasal trauma, including nasal piercing, or surgery and atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa (all within the last 60 days prior to Screening Visit [SV]) Participation in any investigational drug study within the 30 days preceding the Screening Visit (SV) or planned participation in another investigational drug study at any time during this study History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, or influenza within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit (SV) or development of a respiratory infection during the RunIn Period Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or routine use of Î²agonists and any controller drugs (e.g., theophylline, leukotriene antagonists). History of intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of inhaled short acting betaagonists prior to the Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable. Other criteria apply Randomization Criteria Subject continues to be in general good health, meeting the selection criteria Subject has a minimum subjectreported reflective TNSS of an average of 5 (out of a possible 12) on the last 7 days during the RunIn Period The subjectreported scores for rhinorrhea or nasal congestion must be an average of 2 or greater during the last 7 days of the RunIn Period Each subject must have adequately completed the electronic AR Assessment Diary (failure is defined as missing the diary entry on more than 2 calendar days during the last 7 days of the RunIn Period) Other criteria apply</criteria>
