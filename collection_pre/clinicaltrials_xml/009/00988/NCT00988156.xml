	<brief_title>Eslicarbazepine Acetate (BIA 2 093) as Therapy for Refractory Partial Seizures in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Partial epilepsy, the commonest form of epilepsy, is a difficult condition to treat with many patients continuing to have symptoms despite trying several medications. Lack of efficacy and adverse effects are commonly associated with current anti-epileptic drugs. This study will examine the efficacy in addition to safety and tolerability of a new anti-epileptic drug, Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093), as an adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures in children. The primary analysis variables are: - The responder rate (the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in standardised seizure frequency) - The relative reduction in standardised seizure frequency</detailed_description>
