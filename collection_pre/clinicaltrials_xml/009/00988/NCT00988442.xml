	<brief_title>Telephone Support to Improve Adherence to Anti-HIV Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is only successful in treating HIV when people take all the medications prescribed to them when and how they are instructed. However, a third or more of patients on ART are not able to adhere to their medication regimens. Therefore, making sure that these patients stay healthy involves making sure they are motivated and informed about the importance of adhering to their ART. Nurses can deliver interventions to motivate and inform patients through regularly scheduled phone calls. These calls allow nurses to check in between clinic visits, are convenient to patients, and are cost efficient. This study will test an enhanced telephone support intervention provided by nurses that aims to improve ART adherence and treatment outcomes. Participation in this study will last 48 weeks, with follow-up lasting 72 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either care as usual or the enhanced telephone support intervention plus care as usual. The telephone support intervention will involve phone calls made weekly for the first 8 weeks of the study and then every 2 weeks for the next 40 weeks. Nurses will make these calls at a time and place participants choose. During the calls, nurses will provide information, motivational enhancement, and problem-solving skills. Study assessments will take place at study entry and after 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks. Assessments will measure CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, adherence, and illness events. Adherence will be measured through questionnaires and an electronic pill cap.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Enrollment in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) treatment study that is an approved A5251 parent or coenrolling partner study Virologic failure on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), with an HIV1 genotype conducted on or soon after the failure, within 16 weeks prior to entry. HIV1 genotype results must be available at entry. History of prior nonadherence to ART during the past year documented either by patient selfreport or recorded in the patient's medical record Most recent HIV1 RNA value of at least 400 copies/mL, obtained within 90 days prior to study entry and measured using any FDAapproved test for quantifying HIV1 RNA Initiating a new ART regimen within 3 days after randomization with two or more new antiretroviral (ARV) medications to which the participant is expected to be susceptible based on HIV1 genotype, as specified in the parent or coenrolling partner study or determined by the site investigator. The regimen must be selected for the participant prior to the time of randomization for A5251. Ability to have CD4+ cell count and plasma HIV1 RNA assays as a component of the parent or coenrolling partner study or per other mechanism. Only HIV1 RNA at week 48 and confirmation of virologic failure will be collected by A5251, unless collected by the parent or coenrolling partner study per exact A5251 specifications. No regular access to a phone. Candidates without phones may elect to participate by calling the HIV nurse specialists using an 800 number, rather than being called by the HIV nurse specialist. Coenrollment in another adherence trial, unless approved by the A5251 study chair Current incarceration Any condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would compromise the candidate's ability to participate in the study</criteria>
