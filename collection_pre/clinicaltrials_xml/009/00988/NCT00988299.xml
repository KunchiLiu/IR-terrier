	<brief_summary>In older, normal-weight women (60-75 yrs, BMI=18-28 kg/m2), an acute bout of higher-intensity (60% of maximum effort) aerobic exercise, in comparison to an isocaloric bout of lower-intensity (45% of maximum effort) exercise (caloric expenditure of 3.5 kcal/kg body weight for both), will result in differential: 1. decline in non-exercise activity calorie expenditure in the subsequent 48 hours after exercise; 2. increase in resting metabolic rate 48 hours after exercise; 3. increase in serum free triiodo-L-thyronine (free T3) concentrations immediately following exercise; 4. decline from pre-exercise in plasma leptin and serum free T3 concentrations 48 hours after exercise.</brief_summary>
