	<brief_summary>Advanced stage lung cancer is generally treated with anti-cancer medication called chemotherapy. Most lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking. However, some lung cancers develop in people who never smoked or who only smoked for a short period of time. This type of lung cancer may respond to a medication called erlotinib (Tarceva). Erlotinib is an anticancer pill that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with advanced lung cancer. Unfortunately, erlotinib does not work for all patients or only works for a period of time. The doctors are trying to find ways to improve the effect of erlotinib by combining it with another anti-cancer medication. Ascenta Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a drug called AT-101 as a potential treatment for cancer. AT-101 is an investigational drug. That means that AT-101 is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for general use. The FDA does permit its use in studies like this one to determine whether it is safe and effective. This is the first study to examine the effects of AT-101 and erlotinib. It is hoped that by combining AT-101 with erlotinib, AT-101 may help erlotinib work better to shrink lung cancer. Studies that have been performed in the laboratory suggest that AT-101 in combination with erlotinib may be more effective at shrinking tumors than erlotinib alone.</brief_summary>
