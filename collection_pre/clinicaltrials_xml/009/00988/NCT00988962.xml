	<brief_summary>Chronic back pain patients are often dismissed from a pain center or a primary care practice when they are noncompliant with opioid therapy, instead of being offered treatments to reduce misuse and to improve compliance. Unfortunately, there are few treatment resources for such patients. This study seeks to remedy that problem, with the goal of reducing the rate of prescription opioid misuse among noncompliant patients through the use of novel tracking, education, and counseling interventions.</brief_summary>
