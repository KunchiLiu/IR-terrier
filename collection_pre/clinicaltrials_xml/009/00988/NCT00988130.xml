	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: High-intensity focused ultrasound focal ablation uses high-energy sound waves to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound focal ablation and to see how well it works in treating patients with progressive prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Focal Ablation in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the side effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation in men with non-metastatic progressive prostate cancer. - To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - To determine the success of index lesion ablation with HIFU at 6 months after treatment by demonstrating the absence of cancer in the treated or ablated area by transrectal ultrasound biopsy. - To evaluate the prostate-specific antigen kinetics after index lesion ablation in patients treated with this regimen. - To evaluate the proportion of men who require androgen blockade at 12 months of follow-up. OUTLINE: Patients undergo focal ablation with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation on day 1. Treatment may repeat at 6 months in patients with progressive disease. Blood samples and prostate biopsies are collected periodically for further analysis. Patients complete questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS-QoL, ICS, IIEF-5, and FACT-P) at baseline and periodically during study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed prostate cancer by transrectal or transperineal template prostate biopsies Stage ≤ T3bN0M0 Gleason grade ≤ 8 Serum PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL Bone scan or crosssectional imagingnegative for metastatic or nodal (outside prostate) disease No metastatic disease and/or nodal spread by CT scan or MRI Index lesion or other secondary lesions with a volume ≥ 0.5 cc by MRI No prostatic calcification and cysts (on transrectal ultrasound) that would interfere with effective delivery of therapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Able to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound Not allergic to latex Fit for major surgery as assessed by a consultant anaesthetist Able to have MRI scanning (i.e., none of the following conditions: severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac pacemaker, metallic implant, etc.) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior radiotherapy No androgen suppression and/or hormone treatment within the past 12 months No prior significant rectal surgery preventing insertion of transrectal highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) probe (decided on the type of surgery in individual cases) No prior transurethral resection of the prostate (or equivalent procedures) within the past 2 years No prior HIFU, cryosurgery, thermal, or microwave therapy to the prostate</criteria>
