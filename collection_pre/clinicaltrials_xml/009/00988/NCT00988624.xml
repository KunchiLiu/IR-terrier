	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate four different modified release formulation to estimate the amount of dimebon available to the body relative to the current dimebon formulation that is given three times a day. The results of this study will help inform and guide further formulation development efforts with the ultimate goal of reducing dose frequency to once-a-day or twice-a-day.</brief_summary>
