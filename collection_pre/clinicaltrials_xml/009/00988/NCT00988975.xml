	<brief_summary>Women with vaginal bulging who are undergoing laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy at Clarian Health are eligible to enroll in this study. Two different methods of correcting rectocele at the time of sacrocolpopexy will be compared for surgical outcome, surgical complications, and patient satisfaction with intercourse and bowel function. One of the surgical methods uses an additional graft material and one surgical method does not. It is hypothesized that the method which uses an additional graft material to strengthen the patient's tissues will have a better outcome.</brief_summary>
