	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the immunogenicity of the prototype Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) compared with the 2009-2010 Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) and the 2008-2009 TIV among children and adults. Primary Objective: To describe the immunogenicity of the prototype Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) compared with the 2009-2010 Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) and the 2008-2009 TIV among adults. Observational Objectives: - To describe the safety of the 2009-2010 TIV among subjects ≥6 months to &lt;5 years, 18-60 years, and ≥ 61 years of age, and to describe the safety of 2008-2009 TIV and prototype QIV Fluzone® vaccines among subjects 18-60 years and ≥ 61 years of age. - To describe the immunogenicity of the 2009-2010 TIV vaccine among subjects ≥6 months to &lt;5 years, 18-60 years, and ≥61 years of age, and to describe the immunogenicity of 2008-2009 TIV and prototype QIV vaccines among subjects 18-60 years and ≥61 years of age.</brief_summary>
