	<brief_title>Shaolin Dan Tian Breathing Fosters Relaxed and Attentive Mind</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroelectrophysiological studies on various types of meditative breathing revealed its association with either a relaxing (i.e., enhanced alpha asymmetry) or an attentive state (i.e., enhanced intra- and inter-hemispheric theta coherence). The present study aimed to utilize these well-known neuroelectrophysiological techniques to investigate the relatively less studied Shaolin Dan Tian Breathing (DTB) technique. This technique consists of two components -- Passive DTB and Active DTB, and is considered not only as a relaxation exercise but also a form of Qigong. Based upon some pilot neuroimaging data and clinical observation, it was hypothesized that after familiarizing with the method, practicing DTB can induce both relaxing and attentive states. Twenty-two adults received training on the DTB (experimental group) for one month. They were instructed to practice the technique daily, and at each practice, until they felt warm and/or relaxed. Twenty age-, gender- and education-matched adults receiving conventional progressive muscle relaxation training were recruited as control. All participation was voluntary. Quantitative EEG and bio-physiological data were collected at baseline and post training. Eyes-closed resting EEG data before and immediately after each type of breathing were obtained individually at two time points.</detailed_description>
