	<brief_title>The Effect of Whey Protein and Its Hydrolysate on Pre- and Post-Fixed Meal Glycemia and Insulin in Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, cross-over design study was conducted. Whey protein preloads (5-40 g) and hydrolysate whey protein (10 g) were provided in 300 ml water. At 30 min following consumption, subjects were fed a preset pizza meal (12 kcal/kg, experiment 2). Satiety, insulin and blood glucose were measured at baseline and selected intervals pre- and post-meal.</detailed_description>
