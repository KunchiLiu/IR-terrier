	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To estimate the overall response rate after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 given for 3 cycles, and followed by conventional radiotherapy in UCNT. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate: - The radiological response after chemotherapy and radiotherapy - The pathological response after chemotherapy by cavum biopsy To estimate: - The duration of overall response - The time to progression (T.T.P) To analyze: - The overall survival - The safety profile</brief_summary>
