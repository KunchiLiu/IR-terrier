	<brief_summary>This study seeks to provide point-of-care clinical diagnostic systems for the diagnosis of current disease status using saliva as a sample specimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Structure and Function of Salivary Proteins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall hypothesis of this study is that whole saliva and its components, due to its direct anatomic relation to the airways, provides a window on the composition and nature of the disease-specific response in the bronchial, sinus, and nasal airways. By examining proteins created in saliva, we hope to validate that saliva is an important diagnostic tool for for rapid analysis of respiratory status. We further propose that rapid salivary diagnostics will improve patient care in prevalent respiratory diseases with frequent health care utilization and high morbidity, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).</detailed_description>
