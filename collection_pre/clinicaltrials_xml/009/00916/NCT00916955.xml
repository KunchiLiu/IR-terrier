	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is the determination of how the deletion of DNA from chromosome 22 at the q11.2 band causes the phenotypes observed in velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS). In other words, the purpose remains genotype-to-phenotype matching. Current methods includes the use of whole genome chips and microarray analysis. Blood samples are collected for DNA from every patient who consents from the VCFS Center at Upstate Medical University. They are examined for phenotypic features consistent with our typical clinical evaluation. The information from these examinations will be entered anonymously into a database. Genomic information is then matched to clinical phenotype with appropriate statistical method applied.</brief_summary>
