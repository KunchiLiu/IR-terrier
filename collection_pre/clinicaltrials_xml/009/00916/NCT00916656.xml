	<brief_summary>This is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, open-label historically controlled Phase IIIb non-inferiority clinical trial on the efficacy and safety of Fibrinogen Concentrate (Human). It is estimated that 150-300 patients in the U.S. suffer from afibrinogenemia. Substitution with cryoprecipitate or alternative treatments have limited safety and efficacy. The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate the hemostatic efficacy of Fibrinogen Concentrate (Human) by adequately controlling acute bleeding (spontaneous or after trauma) in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia). Cryoprecipitate hemostatic efficacy data from a retrospective physician survey will be used as a historical control.</brief_summary>
