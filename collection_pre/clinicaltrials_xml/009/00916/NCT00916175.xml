	<brief_summary>High blood sugar and adiposity are part of Metabolic syndrome (about 24% of adults harbor it). The main approach, weight reduction, is often unattainable. Aloe Vera (barbadensis) (AV) and cnidoscolus chayamansa (McVaugh)(CC) are two vegetables that seem to have an effect on blood glucose and body weight. The study aims to determine if the intake of aloe gel and/or Chaya infusion can reduce high blood sugar in adult women with pre-diabetes (Metabolic Syndrome). Methods: A Factorial assay, double blind, cross-over-controlled with random assignment, to four treatments: AV and CC, AV and Placebo 1, Placebo 2 and CC, and Placebo 1 and Placebo 2, at the outpatient clinic of the university Hospital and a community clinic. Two treatment periods of 4 weeks intermediated by one week for wash-out.</brief_summary>
