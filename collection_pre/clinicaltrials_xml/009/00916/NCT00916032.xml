	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical study is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of 3000 IU Advate using one 3000 IU potency vial dissolved in 5 mL diluent with that of 3000 IU Advate using two vials of 1500 IU potency dissolved in 5 mL diluent each (administered in 10 mL diluent in total) in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII level &lt; 1%).</brief_summary>
