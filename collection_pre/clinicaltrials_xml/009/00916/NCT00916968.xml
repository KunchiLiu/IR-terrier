	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to compare functional outcome, radiographic results, range of motion, patients satisfaction, and fit of the femoral component in patients receiving either a standard posterior cruciate-retaining high-flexion (CR-flex) and gender-specific CR-flex total knee prostheses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Function and Fit of Standard and Gender-Specific CR High-Flex Total Knee Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design features of the gender-specific knee prostheses have been claimed to improve fit and function of total knee arthroplasty in women. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study was to compare functional outcome, radiographic results, range of motion, patients satisfaction, and fit of the femoral component in patients receiving either a standard posterior cruciate-retaining high-flexion (CR-flex) and gender-specific CR-flex total knee prostheses.</detailed_description>
