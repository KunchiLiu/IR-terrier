	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether waveforms of the intracardiac electrograms, acquired through an ICD, can be used: - to predict malignant ventricular arrhythmias, requiring appropriate ICD therapies, and - to predict progression of heart failure in patients with ICD.</brief_summary>
