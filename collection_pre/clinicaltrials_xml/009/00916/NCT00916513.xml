	<brief_summary>The present European survey seeks to assess quality of life and satisfaction with treatment in people with T2DM and to appreciate disease and treatment variables including hypoglycaemia and level of glycaemic control. It will also provide relevant information on other important aspects such as the level of correlation of objective measures such as HbA1c with health status, QoL and satisfaction with current treatment. Overall 5000 randomly selected patients will be invited to participate from a representative sample of clinical practices during a pre-specified period. The study will entail a single patient visit. Patients who agree to the study and give their informed consent will complete questionnaires which, combined with retrospective notes review &amp; an HbA1c test, will allow patient, disease and treatment variables to be collected. An HbA1c test is a finger prick test to measure glycosylated haemoglobin in the blood indicating the level of blood glucose over the last 8-12 weeks.</brief_summary>
