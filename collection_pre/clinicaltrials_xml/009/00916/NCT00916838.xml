	<brief_summary>125 children with Type 1 Diabetes mellitis (T1DM) between 4 and 16 were recruited and 62 healthy siblings also enrolled in the study. Children with T1DM and sibling controls ages 4 to 16 were assessed on memory and executive control skills at entry to the study (Test 1) and after two years of close monitoring for blood sugar events (Test 2). Diabetic children have their blood sugar tested directly before and after cognitive testing to ensure their blood sugar is within range during the testing. The 2-year follow-up period involves parents/child reporting any severe diabetic episode and periodically providing the results of the diabetic child's usual blood tests from their glucose monitoring device. Children 7 and older also underwent high resolution MRI scans.</brief_summary>
