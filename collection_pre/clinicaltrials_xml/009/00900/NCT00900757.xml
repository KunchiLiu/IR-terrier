	<brief_summary>1. Purpose and objective: 1. To determine the safety and tolerability of palonosetron in the prevention of radiation induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) in primary glioma patients receiving radiation (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ). 2. To determine the efficacy of palonosetron in primary glioma patients receiving six weeks of RT and concomitant TMZ 3. To evaluate the effect s of palonosetron on the quality of life of primary glioma patients receiving six weeks of RT and Concomitant TMZ. 2. Study activities and Population group: We will conduct a phase II single arm trial of Palonosetron (PALO) for the prevention of RINV in primary malignant glioma patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ). All eligible patients should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY of radiation and 75 mg/m2 of daily temozolomide for a total of six weeks of treatment. For each week of radiation patients will receive a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron 30 minutes before each week of radiation fraction. This schedule will be repeated for each week of radiation for a total of 6 weeks. Forty subjects with gliomas will participate. 3. Data analysis and risk/safety issues: The frequency of toxicity will be summarized by type and the most severe grade experienced. The complete response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with no emetic episode or use of rescue medication while receiving radiation and concomitant temozolomide, will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will conduct a phase II single arm trial of Palonosetron (PALO) for the prevention of RINV in primary malignant glioma patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ). All eligible patients should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY of radiation and 75 mg/m2 of daily temozolomide for a total of six weeks of treatment. For each week of radiation patients will receive a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron approximately 30 minutes before each week of radiation fraction. This schedule will be repeated for each week of radiation for a total of 6 weeks. After the start of radiation the type of rescue medication will be up to the investigator's discretion (however given the results of recent published phase II study by Navari et. al. we recommend using olanzapine for rescue medication). All patients will be given written informed consent.</detailed_description>
