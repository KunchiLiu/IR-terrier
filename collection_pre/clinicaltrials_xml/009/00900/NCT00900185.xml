	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer and from healthy participants in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood samples from patients with prostate cancer and from healthy participants to identify a polymorphism that may help in the study of prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Polymorphism in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the incidence of the D104N COL18A1 polymorphism in patients with prostate cancer. Secondary - Determine the incidence of this polymorphism in African-American patients with prostate cancer. OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. DNA is extracted from preexisting serum samples and polymerase chain reaction is performed to determine the genotype pattern. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients and 250 healthy participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
