	<brief_summary>Only few data are available on the influence of strenuous exercise on the content of circulating progenitor cells and especially the timeframe of their release. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of 4 hours of cycling on the time-dependent release of progenitor cells.</brief_summary>
