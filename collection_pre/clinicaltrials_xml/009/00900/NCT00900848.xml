	<brief_summary>Traumatic disruption of iliofemoral arterial segment is often associated with multiple injuries, massive hemorrhage, state of shock, and loss of blood supply to the ipsilateral lower extremity, as well as with high mortality. The investigators describe a bypass technique. It can provide adequate blood supply to the lower extremity of the injury side. Due to a minimum amount of additional blood loss, it is a low risk procedure for salvage of the extremity and even patient's life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Posterior Tibial Artery Bypass for Iliofemoral Artery Injury Associated With Massive Blood Loss and Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were selected on the basis of the following: (1) closed injuries to the lower abdomen and/or pelvis; (2) serious hemorrhagic shock; (3) loss of blood supply to the ipsilateral lower extremity; (4) high-risk emergency artery reconstruction. The instruments used to measure sensibility of the foot were the Semmes-Weinstein (SW) monofilament test 24 and the static two-point discrimination (2PD) test 25. The weight-bearing area of the first metatarsal head and the dorsum of the first metatarsal head were assessed. Active range of motion (ROM) of the hip, knee, and ankle joints was measured with a goniometer. The muscle strength was test using Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale. The cold intolerance of the leg was measured using the self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score (CISS) questionnaire 26. The maximum score is 100 and is grouped into 4 ranges (0-25, 26-50, 51-75, and 76-100) corresponding to mild, moderate, severe, and extreme severity, respectively.</detailed_description>
