	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of sputum and tissue in the laboratory from patients with dysplasia or cancer and from normal volunteers may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in patients with respiratory tract dysplasia or lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or aerodigestive tract cancer and in normal volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Patients With Respiratory Tract Dysplasia or Lung Cancer, Head and Neck Cancer, or Aerodigestive Tract Cancer and in Normal Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine intermediate biomarkers of premalignant respiratory epithelial lesions, such as genetic mutations or altered growth factor expression, in patients with dysplasia of the respiratory epithelium or lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or aerodigestive tract cancer. Secondary - Establish a tissue repository of normal and dysplastic respiratory epithelium from endobronchial forceps and brush biopsy tissue from these patients and from normal volunteers. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to presence of extensive and severe dysplasia of the respiratory epithelium (yes vs no). Participants undergo sputum cytology, white-light (with or without fluorescence) bronchoscopy, and endobronchial biopsies. Participants also undergo endobronchial brushings and bronchial secretion collection and possibly bronchoalveolar lavage. Collected samples are processed by hematoxylin, eosin, and immunohistochemical staining and analyzed for specific biomarkers. Unused samples are stored in the tissue bank. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Meets any of the following criteria: Diagnosis of extensive and severe dysplasia of the respiratory epithelium Recruited from the SPORE Tissue Procurement Screening Project or by private or academic physicians (for patients with moderate or severe dysplasia) Survived 1 or more aerodigestive system carcinoma for â‰¥ 1 year Completely resected stage I nonsmall cell cancer Undergoing any of the following procedures: Routine panendoscopy for patients with head and neck cancer Resection of a bronchogenic carcinoma Bronchoscopy for diagnosis or staging of suspected lung cancer Subsequent bronchoscopy for surveillance or monitoring of response to endobronchial treatment in patients with prior highgrade dysplasia or worse No dysplasia (normal volunteers) No asthma No lung disease No respiratory illness within the past 2 weeks Patients suspected of or at risk for neoplastic lung disease who are undergoing a bronchoscopy in which differential diagnostic considerations may include multiple other etiologies such as infection and other processes. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: No clinically apparent bleeding diathesis No known bleeding disorder No anginal No clinically active coronary artery disease No multifocal premature ventricular contractions No poorly controlled congestive heart failure No myocardial infarction within the past 6 weeks No cardiac dysrhythmia that is potentially life threatening Wellcontrolled atrial fibrillation or rare (&lt; 2/min) premature ventricular contractions allowed No ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid ventricular response No other serious medical condition that would preclude a patient from undergoing a bronchoscopy No acute bronchitis or pneumonia within the past 8 weeks except when clinically proven as a possible result of lung cancer No hypoxemia (i.e., &lt; 90% saturation with supplemental oxygen) before bronchoscopy PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
