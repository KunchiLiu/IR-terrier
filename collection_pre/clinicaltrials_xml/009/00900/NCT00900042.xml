	<brief_title>SWOG-9023, DNA Analysis of Tumor Tissue From Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine if cytogenetic abnormalities can predict clinical outcome, in terms of response to treatment and survival, in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma registered to the nephrectomy arm (arm I) of SWOG-8949. - Correlate cytogenetic abnormalities and DNA content analysis (DNA index and S-phase fraction) with clinical outcome. OUTLINE: This is a partially prospective, partially retrospective, multicenter, companion study. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens from patients enrolled in SWOG-8949 are evaluated by cytogenetic analysis (e.g., presence of trisomy and loss of Y chromosome) and flow cytometric analysis (e.g., presence of nondiploid cells and presence of abnormal proliferation index). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
