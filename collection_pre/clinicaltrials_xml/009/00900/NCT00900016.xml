	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is assessing fibroblast activity in patients with localized pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Fibroblast Activity in Patients With Localized Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the degree of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) enzymatic activity at the tumor site in patients with localized pancreatic cancer. Secondary - To explore correlations between tumor stromal FAP enzymatic activity and stromal α_2-antiplasmin levels. - To explore correlations between tumor FAP enzymatic activity and plasma dipeptidyl peptidase and plasma α_2-antiplasmin converting enzyme activity as potential surrogates. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fine-needle aspiration of tumor or suspected mass at baseline. Tumor samples are analyzed by IHC for fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression, immunocapture assay for ex vivo FAP enzymatic activity, and western analysis for FAP concentrations. Blood samples are collected weekly and analyzed for dipeptidyl peptidase activity by ELISA and α_2-antiplasmin converting enzyme.</detailed_description>
