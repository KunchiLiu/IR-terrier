	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tumor samples from patients with lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor Samples From Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the correlation between c-Met expression, mutation and amplification, with stage and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) of the lung. Secondary - To determine the correlation with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), DUB3 expression &amp; regulation, and ALK translocation, with respect to survival. - To determine the correlation with circulating c-Met and HGF in AC and evaluate prognostic implications of circulating markers in AC of lung. - To determine (when available) levels of circulating Met and HGF in serum before and after surgery. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Previously collected tissue samples from patients enrolled in CALGB 140202 are assessed for mutation analysis of c-Met, EGFR, and K-ras. DNA is examined by PCR, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis; gene amplification of c-Met is examined by real time quantitative PCR; met/HF protein in serum is examined by ELISA; and c-Met, EGFR, p53, c-CBL, DUB3 enzyme, and ALK, and epithelial mesenchymal transition examined by IHC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Registration to Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 140202 Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval at the institution where the laboratory work will be performed is required Informed consent: the CALGB does not require that a separate consent form be signed for this study The subject population to be studied in this protocol includes patients selected from CALGB 140202; all such patients have signed a written informed consent document meeting all federal, state, and institutional guidelines as part of entry into that trial All samples to be studied were obtained and stored as part of CALGB 140202; the material and data obtained from the patient's protocol record will be used to obtain appropriate clinical information; in no instance will the patient be contacted directly There should be no physical, psychological, social, or legal risks associated with this study; no invasive procedures are recommended or requested All appropriate and necessary procedures will be utilized to maintain confidentiality; all patients who have had samples submitted for analysis will have their CALGB study number used to identify specimens This study does not require direct patient contact and no specific risk or benefits to individuals involved in the trial are anticipated; it is likely, however, that the information gained will substantially help similar patients in the future</criteria>
