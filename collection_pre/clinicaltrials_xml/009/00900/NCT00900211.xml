	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue from patients with soft tissue sarcoma to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This laboratory is collecting tissue samples from patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the arms, hands, legs, or feet treated on clinical trial CRUK-VORTEX.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Sample Collection From Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Arms, Hands, Legs, or Feet Treated on Clinial Trial CRUK-VORTEX</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine early in the course of treatment which patients treated on clinical trial CRUK-VORTEX have an increased likelihood of distant metastases so as to highlight individuals who might benefit from early adjuvant systemic therapy. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Tumour and normal tissue samples will be taken at the time of surgery during treatment on clinical trial CRUK-VORTEXand preserved for future microarray analyses. Tissue microarrays will be produced from both tumor and normal tissues. Blood samples will be collected for future DNA analysis.</detailed_description>
