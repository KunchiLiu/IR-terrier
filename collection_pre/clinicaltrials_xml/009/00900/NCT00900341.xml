	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients with soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To develop a pilot program for the collection, archiving, and experimental analyses of soft tissue sarcomas (STS). - To obtain STS tumors from cancer patients undergoing tumor removal or core needle biopsies. - To evaluate cellular and molecular factors involved in STS oncogenesis by studying samples derived from human tumor specimens. - To develop an accompanying bioinformatics database of the demographics of STS patients from which tumor specimens are derived for experimental study. OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for gene and protein expression by cDNA microarray analysis, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, in vitro transformation assays, RNA interference, and Western blot or immunoprecipitation.</detailed_description>
