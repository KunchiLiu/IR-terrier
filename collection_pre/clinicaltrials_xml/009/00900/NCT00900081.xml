	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with or without cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at cyclooxygenase-2 expression in tissue samples from patients with a normal cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or early invasive cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression in Tissue Samples From Patients With a Normal Cervix, Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, or Early Invasive Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels in biopsy or surgical specimens from patients with normal cervical epithelium, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. - Correlate COX-2 levels with histological diagnosis and parameters of invasion (i.e., matrix metalloproteinase, microvessel count, and VEGF). OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed by immunohistochemistry for evaluation of cyclooxygenase-2 levels, microvessel count, and matrix metalloproteinase and VEGF expression. Medical data for study analysis is obtained by retrospective review of patient charts.</detailed_description>
