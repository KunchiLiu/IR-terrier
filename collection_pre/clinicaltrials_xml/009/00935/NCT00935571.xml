	<brief_title>Incidence of Postthoracotomy Pain Following General Anesthesia: A Comparison Between TIVA and Inhalation Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracotomy is one of the most painful surgical incisions. It has been shown that 5-80% of patients still suffer from thoracic pain 2-3 months after surgery and the international association for the study of pain (IASP) defines postthoracotomy pain syndrome (PTTS)as pain that recurs or persists at least 2 months after surgical procedure. Previous reports have shown that the incidence of PTTS varies according to preoperative pain, pain intensity, sex, and types of procedure. However, little is known about the effect of the type of anesthesia to postthoracotomy pain.</detailed_description>
