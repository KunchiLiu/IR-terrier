	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of flaxseed on atherogenic lipids, plasma inflammatory markers, and insulin sensitivity. We hypothesize that flaxseed omega-3 fatty acids will improve the lipid profile (decrease triglyceride, total and LDL-cholesterol and increase HDL-cholesterol). Flaxseed is the richest dietary source of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). Lignans are estrogens found in plant sources that behave similar to endogenous estrogens and have been associated with cardiovascular benefits due to their antioxidant activity. Therefore, we also hypothesize that flax-lignans will cause a significant decrease in LDL oxidation and in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1B, serum fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP-4), and serum amyloid attached to high density lipoprotein (HDL-SAA).</brief_summary>
