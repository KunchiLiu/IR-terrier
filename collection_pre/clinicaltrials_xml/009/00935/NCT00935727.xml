	<brief_summary>The study was developed to acquire images of normal, then abnormal, then unknown diagnosis for transplanted kidneys in order to determine whether the elastography imaging modality, a type of ultrasound imaging, can provide data useful for diagnosis of renal transplant abnormalities. The specific aims of this study are: 1. To define normal elastography imaging by correlation with clinical findings. 2. To define specific abnormal elastography images by correlation with clinical findings. 3. To determine whether elastography could be useful in early diagnosis of abnormalities of renal transplants, especially in early rejection.</brief_summary>
