	<brief_title>Guanfacine Treatment for Prefrontal Cognitive Dysfunction in Elderly Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary: - To determine whether low does of the Î±2A-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine can improve deficits in prefrontally-mediated working memory and executive control functions, in healthy elderly subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or guanfacine at one of two dose levels: 0.1 mg, or 0.5 mg daily at bedtime in double-blind fashion for twelve weeks. Secondary: - To determine whether guanfacine can favorably influence global status and quality of life (QOL) in healthy elderly subjects. - To determine whether low-dose guanfacine is safe and well-tolerated in healthy elderly subjects.</detailed_description>
