	<brief_summary>No randomized trials have tested the effectiveness of acupuncture as a supplement to rehabilitation after total knee replacement. Studies from related fields, however, have shown reduction of symptoms as a result of acupuncture treatment in patients with knee pain caused by severe osteoarthritis in the knee. Furthermore, studies have reported that the need of pain medication was lower when acupuncture treatment was performed immediately after knee surgery. The aim of this study is to test whether acupuncture can reduce pain and improve disability as a supplement to rehabilitation after total knee replacement. One hundred and seventy patients will be allocated by drawing lots to either a treatment group receiving exercise therapy and acupuncture or a group receiving exercise therapy alone. Treatment will start 3 weeks after surgery at the latest. Outcome of treatments will be measured at completion of treatment and at 3 months follow-up by pain- and disability questionnaires as well as the recording of walking capacity.</brief_summary>
