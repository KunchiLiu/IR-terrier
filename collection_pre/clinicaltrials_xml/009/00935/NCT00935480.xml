	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of adding Isentress®, with or without Celsentri®, to effective conventional antiretroviral therapy (comprising at least 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one boosted protease inhibitor), on residual HIV replication and blood cell and gut-associated lymphoid tissue reservoirs (reverse transcriptase inhibitors: RTIs, boosted protease inhibitors: PI/r). To evaluate the effect of therapy intensification by means of an integrase inhibitor with or without CCR5 inhibitor treatment on the lymphoid reservoir in patients chronically infected with HIV-1, successfully treated with "conventional triple therapy", measured by: - residual plasma replication between 0 and 50 copies/ml - intracellular HIV RNA levels in circulating lymphocytes (PBMC) and lymphocytes in gut-associated rectal lymphoid tissue (RL). - proviral HIV DNA levels in PBMC and RL.</brief_summary>
