	<brief_summary>Monocyte tissue factor (TF) was characterized in Class C heart failure (HF) vs. 25 age-matched volunteers. TF was 2.9 fold higher (p &lt; 0.001) in HF patients vs. controls. HF patients showed increased clinical events (RR=1.29, p=0.04) when comparing procoagulant activity above/below median. HF is associated with increased TF expression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Monocyte tissue factor (TF) was characterized in Class C heart failure (HF) vs. 25 age-matched volunteers. TF was 2.9 fold higher (p &lt; 0.001) in HF patients vs. controls. HF patients showed increased clinical events (RR=1.29, p=0.04) when comparing procoagulant activity above/below median. HF is associated with increased TF expression. Previous studies suggest that markers of coagulation are elevated in heart failure (HF). Tissue factor (TF) plays the cardinal role in initiating the coagulation cascade. This study determines TF expression in HF and its association with disease progression. Methods: Monocytes were obtained from 50 NYHA function class II-IV HF patients and 25 age-matched disease-free volunteers. TF protein, TF procoagulant activity, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were determined.</detailed_description>
