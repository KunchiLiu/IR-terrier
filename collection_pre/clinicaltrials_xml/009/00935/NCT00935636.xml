	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Efficacy of the GlideScope Cobalt Video Baton for Intubation on Children Weighing Less Than 10 Kilograms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates and infants requiring endotracheal intubation and in which the attending anesthesiologist decided to use the CGS-CVB will be included in this observational study. Data will be collected by one of the investigators or the research assistant/coordinator and recorded on a data sheet The data from these forms will be then entered by the investigator or research assistant/coordinator into a database maintained only for this study. The decision of using the GS-CVB is at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Consequently if consent would be required the anesthesiologist might feel compelled or biased to use the device against his will. This will also require that all possible patients's should be consented which will put a serious strain on the study personal.</detailed_description>
