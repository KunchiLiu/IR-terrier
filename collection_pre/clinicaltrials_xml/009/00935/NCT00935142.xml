	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the toxicity of the hypoxia PET-tracer [18F]-VM4-037 in cancer patients in two dose-steps: - Step 1 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 8 mCi (296 MBq) dose of [18F]VM4-037 via a bolus IV injection. - Step 2 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 12 mCi (444 MBq) dose of [18F]VM4-037 via a bolus IV injection</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological confirmed solid tumour, primary or secondary stage IV and/ or tumours with no curative treatment options WHO performance status 0 to 1 Normal white blood cell count and formula Normal platelet count No anaemia requiring blood transfusion or erythropoietin Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution; ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the institution) Calculated Creatinin clearance at least 60 ml/min No administration of Fluor18 in the previous 24 hours The patient is capable of complying with study procedures 18 years or older Only visible tumor sites in the upper abdomen (because the uptake of VM4037 in the liver, stomach and the kidneys would interfere with image quality of the tumor) Known hypersensitivity for sulfonamides Recent (&lt; 3 months) myocardial infarction Uncontrolled infectious disease Less than 18 years old Pregnancy No concurrent anticancer agents or radiotherapy allowed</criteria>
