	<brief_title>Complement Inhibition With Eculizumab for the Treatment of Non-Exudative Macular Degeneration (AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-arm, double-masked study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab for the treatment of patients with dry AMD. There are three stages in the study: the screening period, the treatment period, and the follow-up period.During the screening period patients will be evaluated for eligibility. Eligible patients will receive either eculizumab or placebo for 24 weeks. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled and divided equally between the drusen cohort and the GA cohort. A 2:1 randomization will result in 20 patients in each cohort receiving eculizumab while 10 patients receive placebo. The treatment period will begin two weeks after administration of the meningococcal vaccine. During the treatment period, patients will receive eculizumab or placebo over a period of approximately 26 weeks. Patient will treatment according to the following regimen: Induction Period: patient will receive eculizumab 600 mg or 900 mg via IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes once a week (7 ± 2 days) for 4 weeks followed by 900 mg eculizumab for the fifth dose 7 days later (7 ± 2 days). Maintenance Period: patient will receive eculizumab 900 mg or 1200 mg via IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes every 2 weeks (14 ± 2 days). After the final scheduled dose of eculizumab or Placebo at week 24, patients will return for follow-up exam 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the final dose.</detailed_description>
