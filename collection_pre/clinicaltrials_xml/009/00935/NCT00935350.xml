	<brief_summary>Reductions of postprandial glucose levels have been demonstrated previously with the addition of a novel viscous polysaccharide (NVP) to a glucose drink and standard white bread. This study explores whether these reductions are sustained when NVP is added to a range of commonly consumed foods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction of the Glycemic Index by a Novel Viscous Polysaccharide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, a commercial novel viscous polysaccharide (NVP)complex has been developed which is marketed in both the USA and Canada under the trade name PGX® (PolyGlycopleX) (InovoBiologic Inc, Calgary, AB, Canada). This complex consists of three viscous non starch polysaccharides which are processed using proprietary technology (EnviroSimplex®) to produce compressed granules which delays the onset of viscosity and increases palatability of the fiber when added to food. Previously, this fibre was shown to lower postprandial glucose levels in a dose responsive manner when mixed with a glucose drink and sprinkled onto a standard white bread demonstrating that the processing did not interfere with the effectiveness of the fiber. From this study the reduction in GI was calculated to be 7 units per gram of NVP when added to a solid food, however it is not known whether this relationship would be maintained when the NVP was added to a range of commonly eaten foods. This study therefore evaluates the effect of the addition or incorporation of NVP into a range of foods on postprandial glycemia and whether the reductions in glycemic index could be predicted using.</detailed_description>
