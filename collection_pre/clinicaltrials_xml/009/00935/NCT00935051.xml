	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal to 0.24 at study entry to predict wound healing at 12 weeks' follow up visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Matrix Metalloproteinase-1/Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1/TIMP-1) Ratio and Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This monocentric, prospective, non-randomized study assesses the amount of the main metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP9, MMP13) and their inhibitor TIMP-1 in wound fluid from diabetic foot ulcers. It aims at demonstrating whether a MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal to 0.24 at study entry can predict wound healing 12 weeks later. All patients will receive the same treatment according to our local protocol. The difference with standard care will be a sample of wound fluid at week 0 and week 4 and a numeric photograph for wound area measurement at week 0, week 4 and week 12. The main outcome measurement is the percent change of wound area between week 0 and week 12 Secondary objectives include the evaluation of a MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal to 0.4 and the search for confounding factors. A correlation between MMP-9, MMP-13 and wound healing will also be investigated.</detailed_description>
