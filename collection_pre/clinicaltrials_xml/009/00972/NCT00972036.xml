	<brief_summary>This study is being done with a new therapy called "Selective Internal Radiation Therapy" (known as SIRT). Radiation is an effective treatment for destroying tumors. It is widely used in cancer treatment. However, radiation can harm normal tissue. SIR-Spheres are tiny plastic beads. They contain a radioactive agent called Yttrium-90. These beads can be delivered through a small tube inserted into the blood vessel that goes directly to the tumor. The radiation goes directly to the tumor. This spares healthy parts of your liver.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic confirmation of colorectal cancer. Unequivocal imaging of hepatic metastases. Dominant Liver metastases. (Small amount extrahepatic disease allowed.) Unresectable liver metastases. Liver Metastases noneligible for, or progressed after ablation Failed prior HAC. ECOG performance status 0 1 WBC &gt; or = to 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; or = to 50 x 109/L Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Age &gt; or = to 18 years Female patients must either be postmenopausal, sterile (surgically or radiation or chemicallyinduced), or if sexually active, must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception. Male patients must be surgically sterile, or if sexually active, must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception. Life expectancy of at least 3 months without any active treatment. No chemotherapy regimen administration for at least 4 weeks prior to SIRT administration Evidence of severe cirrhosis (CHILDS B and C), portal hypertension with gastroesophageal varices and liver failure as determined by clinical, radiologic or laboratory assessment. Previous radiotherapy delivered to the liver. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Any of the following are contraindications to the use of Yttrium90 microspheres, and are therefore exclusion criteria: With a Tc99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) hepatic arterial perfusion scintigraphy that shows any disposition to the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be corrected by angiographic and embolization techniques. With more than 20% shunting of blood to the lungs as estimated in the Lung Scintigram performed after the intraarterial injection of Tc MAA. Radiation pneumonitis has been seen in patients receiving doses of Yttrium90 greater than 30 Gy in a single treatment. This corresponds to the shunt over 20% presence of vascular abnormalities, bleeding diathesis, making catheterization of the hepatic artery contraindication.</criteria>
