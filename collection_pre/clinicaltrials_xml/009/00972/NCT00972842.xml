	<brief_summary>A standard therapy is neither established in first-line patients nor in relapsed patients with PTCL, and there is still an unmet medical need to identify novel efficacious and safe therapy regimens. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a Lenalidomide plus Vorinostat and Dexamethasone combination therapy as an effective and safe therapeutic regimen, in the treatment of relapsed PTCL following failure of prior regimens.</brief_summary>
