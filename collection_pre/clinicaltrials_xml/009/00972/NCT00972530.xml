	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are frequently used to relieve symptoms of arthritis. Postinjection rest has been shown to improve the outcome of knee joint injections, but not for wrist injections. Consequently, different joints respond differently on postinjection regimens. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether better treatment results might be achieved of post-injection rest following intra-articular glucocorticoid treatment for elbow synovitis. METHODS: 90 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and elbow synovitis were treated with 20 mg intra-articular triamcinolone hexacetonide and randomised to either a 48 hour immobilisation in a triangular sling (n=46) or normal activity without restrictions (n=44). Primary endpoint was relapse of synovitis. In addition, pain, function according to a self assessment questionnaire (PREE) and range of movement were followed for six months.</brief_summary>
