Subjects to whom any of the following applies will be excluded from the study: Clinically significant illnesses within 4 weeks of the administration of study medication. Clinically significant surgery within 4 weeks prior to the administration of the study medication. Any clinically significant abnormality found during medical screening. Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, would prevent the subject from participating in the study. Abnormal laboratory tests judged clinically significant. Positive urine drug screen at screening. Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV at screening. ECG abnormalities (clinically significant) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or over 90; or heart rate less than 50 bpm) at screening. Subjects with BMI ≥30.0. History of significant alcohol abuse within six months of the screening visit or any indication of the regular use of more than two units of alcohol per day (1 Unit = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL of alcohol 40%).

Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in this study. History of allergic reactions to bicalutamide or other related drugs. Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples of inducers: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, rifampin/rifabutin; examples of inhibitors: antidepressants, cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole, MAO inhibitors, neuroleptics, verapamil, quinidine) within 30 days prior to the administration of the study medication. Use of an investigational drug or participation in an investigation study within 30 days prior to the administration of the study medication. Clinically significant history or presence of any clinically significant gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases), unresolved gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), liver or kidney disease, or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug. Any clinically significant history or presence of clinically significant neurological, endocrinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, immunologic, psychiatric or metabolic disease. Use of prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration of study medication or overthecounter products (including natural food supplements, vitamins, garlic as a supplement) within 7 days prior to administration of study medication, except for topical products without systemic absorption. Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that could, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, contraindicate the subjects participation in this study.
