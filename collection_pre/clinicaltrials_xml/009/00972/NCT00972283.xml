	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this clinical trial is to compare NN1250 (insulin degludec (IDeg)) with insulin glargine (IGlar) plus insulin aspart (IAsp) with/without metformin and with/without pioglitazone in subjects with type 2 diabetes (main period) followed by investigating the long-term safety in terms of comparing NN1250 with insulin glargine plus insulin aspart with or without metformin and with or without pioglitazone in subjects with type 2 diabetes. All oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) treatment will be discontinued, if applicable, when trial participant enters the trial (NN1250-3582) with the exception of metformin and pioglitazone. Subjects who consent to participate in the extension trial (NN1250-3667) will continue to receive the treatment to which they were randomly allocated in the 52 week trial NN1250-3582. The main period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as NN1250-3582 while the extension period is registered as NN1250-3667.</brief_summary>
