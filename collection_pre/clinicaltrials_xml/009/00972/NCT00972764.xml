	<detailed_description>Laryngomalacia is the most common congenital malformation of the larynx and it is a self-limited disorder. It is the most common cause of stridor in newborns and infants. It results from an abnormal prolapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration. Despite its widespread prevalence, the etiology of laryngomalacia is unclear. Most infants will squeaky but otherwise well. Although affected patients do not exhibit much in the way of other physical symptoms, the unusual voice is worrisome to their parents.</detailed_description>
