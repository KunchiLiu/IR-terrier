	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for breast imaging in the diagnostic setting by providing a compelling body of evidence incorporating both non-contrast and contrast enhanced CBCT in the study protocol. The goal is to accumulate a body of evidence to provide data to incorporate CBCT into the diagnostic work-up of breast lesions.</brief_summary>
