	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may slow the growth of tumor cells and be an effective treatment for women with breast cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well DHEA works in treating women undergoing surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DHEA in Treating Women Undergoing Surgery for Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To identify the effect of the adrenal steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), on tumor proliferation in women with estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, HER2/neu-negative, and androgen receptor (AR)-positive stage I-III adenocarcinoma of the breast. Secondary - To study the effect of DHEA on expression of AR in these patients. - To assess the effect of DHEA on changes in serum estrogen and androgen hormone levels (e.g., estrone, estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, DHEA, and DHEA-sulfate) in these patients. - To assess the toxicity of DHEA in these patients. - To follow the clinical course of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) twice daily on days -14 to 0. Patients then undergo surgery on day 1. Tissue samples are collected at baseline and at the time of surgery for biomarker analysis (androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2/neu, Ki-67, and p53) by IHC. Blood samples are collected at baseline and after completion of treatment with DHEA for analysis of serum hormone (e.g., estrone, estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, DHEA, and DHEA-sulfate) and cytokine levels. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1 week and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
