	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary intervention with blueberry and grape juice extracts in elderly men with subjective memory problems would raise performance on neuropsychological memory tests and change biomarker of muscle damage and whole blood gene expression profiles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Bilberry (European Blueberries) and Grape Polyphenols on Cognition and Blood Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of studies have shown that increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetable extracts high in antioxidants (e.g., blueberries, strawberries and spinach) can retard and even reverse age-related decline in brain function and in cognitive and motor performance in rats. This is the first placebo-controlled human study to evaluate the effect of dietary intake of fruit polyphenols on neuropsychological test scores and whole blood gene regulation Sixty-two non-demented, non-depressed men (age 67-77 years) with subjective memory decline, were randomly assigned to a blueberry/grape juice- and placebo-group in a 9 week double blind intervention study. Pre- and post treatment assessment were measured with a computerised neuropsychological test battery (CANTAB), including tests for motor speed, visual reaction time, and spatial memory. Dietary habits were registered before intervention and several clinical biomarkers were measured in plasma/serum before and after the intervention. Pre- and post intervention-samples for measurement of gene regulation were also collected</detailed_description>
