	<brief_summary>The proposed study will compare for the first time the quality of 24-hour IOP control with Brimonidine/Timolol fixed combination (BTFC) versus Dorzolamide/Timolol fixed combination (DTFC) after a run-in period of 2 months with timolol. This crossover comparison may determine the real efficacy of the two fixed combinations and the design of the proposed study may explain for the first time why the 24-hour IOP reduction provided by BTFC is less than might be anticipated.</brief_summary>
