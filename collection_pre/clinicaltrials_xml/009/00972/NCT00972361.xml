	<brief_summary>Routine analysis of coagulation profile is recommended before adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy or ventilation tubes insertion in children. A proportion of those children reveal borderline abnormal values of Partial Prothrombin Time (aPTT) or Prothrombin Time (PT) and then they are referred to a consultant hematologist for further evaluation and recommendations before surgery. The purpose of this study is to summarize the causes of referrals in a cohort of 200 children and to assess the further laboratory analysis preformed and the results obtained.</brief_summary>
