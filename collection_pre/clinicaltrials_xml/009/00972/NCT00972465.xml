	<brief_summary>Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the safety, and efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Nimotuzumab to Treat Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan will be administered to the patient until disease progression or development of toxicity preclude further treatment.Irinotecan will be administered once every 14 days,the dosage is 180mg/m2; Nimotuzumab treatment be divided 3 levels:200mg/w,400mg/w,600mg/w,weekly.The patients'blood test and liver and renal function tests will be monitored weekly, a physical exam and reassessment of the tumor will be performed and every 6 weeks,when the total result is the CR or PR, the result of the 6th and the 12th week should be compared.</detailed_description>
