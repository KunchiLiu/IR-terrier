	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective study is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of standard and high-flexion posterior stabilized (PS) rotating-platform mobile-bearing (RP-MB) total knee arthroplasty. The investigators hypothesize that total knee arthroplasty performed with a high-flexion PS RP-MB design would improve range of motion, and that this would be reflected by a better clinical outcome and greater patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes After Standard and High-Flexion Posterior Stabilized Rotating-Platform Mobile-Bearing Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A high-flexion, PS RP-MB prosthesis was designed to improve range of motion after total knee arthroplasty without compromising the theoretical advantages of the standard PS RP-MB system. To date, no study has prospectively compared the clinical and radiographic results of standard and high-flexion PS RP-MB designs.</detailed_description>
