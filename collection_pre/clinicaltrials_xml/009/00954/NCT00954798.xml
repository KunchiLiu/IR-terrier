	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate data on immunogenicity and safety of the monovalent H1N1 vaccine in support of the development and registration. Primary objectives: - To describe the immune response to study vaccine 21 days after each vaccination. - To describe the antibody persistence 8 months after the first vaccine administration using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) method in a randomized subset of adult subjects who received two injections. - To describe the immune response against the A/H1N1 strain using HAI method 21 days after a vaccination with the 2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere (NH) seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) administered 13 months after the first vaccination in a subset subjects who received the A/H1N1 influenza vaccine and in subjects naïve to the swine origin A/H1N1 strain. - To describe the safety profiles of study vaccines in all participants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will receive two injections of their randomized vaccine on Day 0 and Day 21, respectively. A subset of the participants will receive a third vaccine injection (2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere [NH] seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine [TIV]) approximately 13 months after the first vaccination; additionally, a subset of participants' naïve to the swine-origin A/H1N1 strain will also receive one vaccine injection of the 2010-2011 NH seasonal TIV.</detailed_description>
