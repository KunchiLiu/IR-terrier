	<brief_title>Fatigue in Dystonia (a Single Session, Questionnaire-based Study of Fatigue in Dystonia)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue in patients with dystonia. There are many factors which may impact fatigue but perhaps the most important of these is sleep. It is therefore critical that we collect data on sleep habits and sleepiness to help interpret our data on fatigue. We will be using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess daytime somnolence and the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale to assess the presence or absence of common sleep disorders affecting patients with movement disorders along with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and the Fatigue Severity Scale.</detailed_description>
