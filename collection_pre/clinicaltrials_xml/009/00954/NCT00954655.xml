	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor samples in patients undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors on clinical trial ACOSOG-Z9001.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor Samples in Patients Undergoing Treatment for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors on Clinical Trial ACOSOG-Z9001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To examine polymorphisms in selected genes involved in the detoxifying/metabolizing and DNA repair pathways in relation to specific mutations and types of mutation in the c-kit gene in tumor tissue from patients with gastrointestinal tumors (GIST) undergoing treatment on clinical trial ACOSOG-Z9001. Secondary - To examine approximately 758 polymorphisms among candidate genes involved in detoxification/metabolism, cell cycle control, and DNA damage/repair in relation to specific mutations and types of mutation in the c-kit gene in tumor tissue from GIST patients for hypothesis generation. (exploratory) - To conduct an exploratory analysis of the polymorphism distribution in these patients. (exploratory) - To examine the association between the above polymorphisms and major toxicity (Grade 3/4) of adjuvant imatinib mesylate. (exploratory) OUTLINE: Tumor samples are used for polymorphism and mutation analysis.</detailed_description>
