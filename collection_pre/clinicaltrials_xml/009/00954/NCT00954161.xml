	<brief_title>Bystander Helping Behaviour for Myocardial Infarction Following First Aid Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A systematic review on the effects of first aid training concluded that training must also include ways to overcome obstacles to bystander intervention. This could lead to better help and higher helping rates in medical emergencies. The objective of this paper is to measure the effect of an innovative training programme on the help seeking behaviour and helping rates of bystanders in medical emergencies. We chose to test the helping behaviour for acute myocardial infarction because it is an important cause of mortality and invalidity. While the victim is urgently in need of help, delay in seeking professional help is an important problem.</detailed_description>
