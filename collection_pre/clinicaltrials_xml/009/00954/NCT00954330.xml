	<brief_summary>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment in acute lateral ligament injury of ankle. The more detailed aims were to assess the function, physical activity level, re-injuries, objective stability and radiographic changes seen by magnetic resonance imaging in patients randomized to surgery or to functional treatment after a mean of 14 years follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria included positive stress radiographs (in all cases) and arthrography 15 (5 cases) proven fibulotalar anterior (FTA) and fibulocalcanear (FC) ligament injury. The positive findings for a lateral ligament injury included a clinically unstable ankle and a radiological talar tilt &gt;6 degrees or ADS &gt;5 mm compared with the uninjured opposite ankle. The exclusion criteria for the study were diabetes, inflammatory arthritis, previous severe trauma, preexisting instability of joints. In addition, patients were excluded from our study if they had previously undergone surgery of the ankle region.</criteria>
