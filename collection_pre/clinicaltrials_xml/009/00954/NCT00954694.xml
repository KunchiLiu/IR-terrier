	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if participation in a fifteen week introductory exercise regimen using the NuStep by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes will affect exercise adherence and lifestyle adjustment. This study will examine if using the NuStep encourages participants to seek other modes and facilitates interest in exercise. Age, gender, weight, height, waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, and A1C will be recorded pre, mid-point, and post-test. During each NuStep exercise session heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose level, oxygen saturation, METs, and the Borg rate of perceived exertion will be monitored. Associations between NuStep use and exercise adherence are investigated through the following hypothesis and null hypothesis. There is an association between using the NuStep as an introductory exercise regimen by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and exercise adherence. The null hypothesis states there is no association between using the NuStep as an introductory exercise regimen by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and exercise adherence. The primary endpoint of the study is the qualitative measurement, by use of a questionnaire, of attitude and interest toward exercise in participants by assessing if they choose to seek and perform other modes of exercise. Secondary endpoints are the quantitative measurement of the change in weight, waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, and A1C levels.</brief_summary>
