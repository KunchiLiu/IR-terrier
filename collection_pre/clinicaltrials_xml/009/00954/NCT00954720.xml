	<brief_summary>Recent retrospective studies have suggested that iron overload is a clinically important problem in patients undergoing ablative stem cell transplantation. However, these studies relied on serum ferritin as a surrogate of iron overload, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn from such analyses. Therefore, the investigators are conducting a prospective study to more rigorously examine the prevalence, mechanisms, and consequences of iron overload in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 years. Histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Planned allogeneic stem cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimen (regardless of stem cell source or donor HLA match) Patients will be eligible even if they have had prior stem cell transplantation (autologous or allogeneic) Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD), cardiac electrodes, pacing wires, internal electrodes, cochlear, otologic or other ear implants, metallic fragments or foreign body, metallic prosthesis. Patients with surgical staples should not be imaged until 7 days postop unless approved by a radiologist; Severe claustrophobia Note: a history of allergic reaction to gadolinium is not a contraindication to enrollment, as contrast will not be used.
