	<criteria>clinical existence of a PLA (phlegmon), validated by a senior ENT, usually (but not necessarily) following a request by an emergency. The visible appearance to the merits throat must justify puncture. Cases will be included whether or not they had consulted for a "sore throat" in the 10 days preceding the date of diagnosis Neoplastic disease of the throat, scalable Hematologic with tonsillar localization History of tonsillectomy</criteria>
