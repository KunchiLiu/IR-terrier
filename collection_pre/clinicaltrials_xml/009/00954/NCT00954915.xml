	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether teplizumab is safe when administered subcutaneously (by needle under the skin) in subjects with psoriasis. The study will also evaluate how long teplizumab stays in the blood and how long it takes for it to leave the body, what is the highest dose that can safely be given, and whether it improves psoriasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of the Monoclonal Antibody Teplizumab (MGA031) in Subjects With Moderate or More Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test the hypotheses that therapeutic modulation of T-cell function by teplizumab is well tolerated in subjects with moderate or more severe psoriasis, and that this treatment ameliorates the immunopathology of psoriasis. This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of subcutaneous (SC) administration for 6 days. Once the SC maximum tolerated dose is identified, this dose will be administered to a cohort of subject by intravenous for comparison of PK and PD.</detailed_description>
