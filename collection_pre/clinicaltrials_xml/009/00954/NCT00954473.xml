	<brief_summary>This research trial studies blood samples from patients with osteosarcoma. Studying the genes found in samples of blood from patients with osteosarcoma may help doctors identify biomarkers related to the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Blood Samples From Patients With Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Conduct a large-scale candidate gene association study in osteosarcoma (OS) using cases from the national Children's Oncology Group (COG) OS biology study (P9851 and successor study AOST06B1). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OS. II. Fine-map genomic regions associated with OS to identify putative functional loci. III. Conduct whole-exome sequencing of germline OS deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples. IV. Investigate the functional implications of promising genetic variants associated with OS. OUTLINE: Blood samples undergo polymorphism analysis of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes to examine genetic variation, gene-gene interactions, and the population structure.</detailed_description>
