	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the intake of kiwi fruits will reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to intake of apples. The investigators hypothesize that the increased intake lutein or other components in the kiwi fruit will enhance nitric oxide bioavailability and lead to vascular relaxation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Kiwi on Blood Pressure, Endothelial Function, Antioxidant Capacity and Gene Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An interesting finding in the Oslo Antioxidant Study was that intake of 3 kiwi fruits reduced blood pressure in a clinical significant manner compared to controls. The mechanism for the blood pressure reducing effect of kiwi or the responsible components are not elucidated. However, plasma lutein levels and antioxidant capacity measured by the ferric reducing antioxidant power was increased in the kiwi group. Moreover, gene expression was also altered by the increased intake of kiwi.</detailed_description>
