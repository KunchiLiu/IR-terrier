	<brief_summary>In the proposed study, the investigators will explore three specific aims. First, the investigators will examine cross-sectionally the association of obesity on sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sympathetic/ parasympathetic nerve fiber balance. In addition, the investigators will determine the relationship of the ANS and osteocalcin. Osteocalcin will be measured before and after a mixed meal tolerance test. In the second specific aim, the investigators will prospectively follow-up these individuals (n=30) following bariatric surgery. The effect of weight loss on measures of the ANS and osteocalcin will be examined 6 months following surgery with participants serving as their own control, pre- and post-surgical intervention. Thirdly, the investigators will address whether the effect of weight loss on the ANS and osteocalcin differ between those who had a history of diabetes at baseline versus those with no history of diabetes.</brief_summary>
