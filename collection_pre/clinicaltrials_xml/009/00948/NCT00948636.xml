	<brief_summary>The study tests the hypothesis that related hematopoietic stem cell donors are at a higher risk for acute medical and psychological toxicity associated with the donation process compared to adult unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donors. The study will also assess the hypothesis that young (&lt;18 years) and older (&gt;60 years) related donors are at increased risk for toxicity associated with donation compared to younger adult donors by describing the adverse events reported in these populations. An ancillary study of the psychological impact of donation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) will enroll related donors and compare them to an age-matched normative cohort.</brief_summary>
