	<brief_summary>The current proposal, will elucidate the role of oxidant stress (OS) on arterial function as measured by flow mediated vasodilation. In addition, the investigators will address the hypothesis, that a pro-oxidant might have different degrees of effects on different biological targets, by performing quantitative assessment of the effects of OS on lipids, proteins and DNA.</brief_summary>
