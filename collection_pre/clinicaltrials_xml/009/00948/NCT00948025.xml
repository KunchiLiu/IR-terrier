	<brief_title>A Comparative Post-marketing Study of Commercially Available Peripheral Nerve Gap Repair Options</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Require primary or secondary nerve injury repair with Hollow Nerve Conduit or AVANCE™ in at least 1 digital nerve; Undergo End to End nerve to nerve graft coaptation on both the proximal and distal portion of the nerve gap in the AVANCE™ group or nerve entubulation in the Hollow Nerve Conduit group; Be willing to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation schedule over a 12 Month duration; and Sign and date an IRBapproved written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, including screening procedures. Nerve gaps of &lt; 5 mm or &gt; 20 mm; Estimated distance of regeneration of &gt;125 mm (distance from injury site to sensory target) Nerve crush or avulsion injuries; Incomplete nerve transections; Injury requiring replantation of target digit; Contralateral digital injuries corresponding to the target digit; Nerve injuries in the affected limb proximal to the crease of the wrist; End to side nerve repair; Injuries with significant vascular damage which may impair adequate perfusion of the target limb; Subjects who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other know treatment which affects the growth of neural and/or vascular system; Use of bovine collagen based hollow nerve conduit in a subject with known or suspected bovine sensitivity; Subjects age ≤18 years or ≥70 years; History neuropathy, diabetic or any other known neuropathy; Secondary nerve repair &gt;12 weeks post initial injury; Currently enrolled in another investigational study; Expected use of medications during the study that are known to cause peripheral neuropathy; History or Reynaud's or other disorder known to compromise circulation or sensation in the upper extremity; and Any subject who at the discretion of the Investigator is not suitable for inclusion in the study.</criteria>
