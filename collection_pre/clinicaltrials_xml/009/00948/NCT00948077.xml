The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, and follow the instructions and protocolstated restrictions. 9. Only subjects who have provided signed and dated written informed consent will be included. 1. Previously treated for MDRTB, XDRTB or likely to require surgical procedure for management of TB 2.
