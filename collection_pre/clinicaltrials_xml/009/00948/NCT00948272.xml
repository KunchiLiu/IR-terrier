	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate data in human on immunogenicity and safety of Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine (VRVg) in support of the vaccine registration. Primary Objective: - To demonstrate that VRVg is at least as immunogenic as the reference vaccine, Verorab, in terms of seroconversion rate at Day 42 of the primary vaccination series. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the clinical safety of VRVg after each vaccination when administered in a pre-exposure vaccination schedule with a booster at 12 months after the first vaccination in all subjects. - To describe the immune response induced by VRVg 21 days after two vaccinations in a subset of randomized subjects and 14 days after the last vaccination of the primary vaccination series.</brief_summary>
