	<brief_title>Variations of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are recruiting a clinical sample of patients who meet diagnostic criteria (per DSM-5) for the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder. Participants are randomly assigned to the two active intervention conditions; no placebo or sham treatments will be employed. Assessments take place at baseline, pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3- and 12-months follow-up; participants also complete a brief weekly assessment of functioning. Treatment is administered individually by trained graduate students in clinical psychology, directly trained and supervised by the PI and Co-PI. Participants receive 12 weekly 1-hour long sessions. The study design is a 2 (treatment condition) by 5 (assessment occasion) mixed factorial design.</detailed_description>
