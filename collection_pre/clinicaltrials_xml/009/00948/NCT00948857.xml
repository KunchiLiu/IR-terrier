	<brief_summary>The experimental focus of this project is on the interaction of DHEA treatment on pregnancy in women with open tubes, fertile male partners and evidence of premature ovarian failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) Treatment and Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment: - New patients presenting for Donor egg cycles - Possible print, magazine or Radio advertisement Experimental plan: 1. Informed consent 2. Baseline studies - Antral follicle counts - Serum FSH, LH, E2, Prog, DHEA, DHEAS, testosterone, AMH, Fragile X 3. Randomization - Group A: DHEA (25 mg three times per day) - Group B: Placebo 4. Monitoring during treatment - All participants will have: - USG for follicle measurement - Repeat serum, FSH, E2, DHEA, DHEAS, testosterone, AMH monthly during treatment. - Physical examination - Completion of study questionnaire regarding possible androgen effects of treatment 5. Analysis plan: - Primary Outcome - Pregnancy - Pregnancy rates will be compared using logistic regression with age and pre-treatment AMH as covariates. - Secondary Outcomes - Endocrine Factors - Androgen side effects - Primary analysis. We will perform a factorial ANOVA for the two pretreatment factors DHEA and Placebo. Baseline AMH and age as main covariates - Secondary analysis. - Examine rate of change of estradiol and other endocrine response over the four cycles of treatment - Compare antral follicle counts across cycles between groups - Compare possible androgen related effects - Power considerations: - Power assumptions: alpha 0.05; 80% power Spontaneous Pregnancy rate for POF is less than 1% per 3 months Intervention will improve pregnancy rate to 10% per 3 months. Patients will be treated for 3 cycles. Require 100 patients to complete treatment in each group. Allow for 20% dropout will need 120 patients randomized to each group - Randomization: Randomization will be by permuted blocks in order to maintain an even distribution among the groups (because of the small numbers of participants) - Human subjects issues - Potential risks associated with DHEA use - Potential risk of delay of treatment for 3 months and possible natural continued loss of fertility - Informed consent issues</detailed_description>
