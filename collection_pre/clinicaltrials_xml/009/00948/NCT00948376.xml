	<brief_title>Natural History of Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy (DTJ)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (ATD, MIM 208500) belongs to the short rib polydactyly group and is characterized by short ribs often responsible for an early death due to respiratory distress, trident acetabular roof and short long bones. In the course of the disease, renal, liver and eye complications may occur. However, their frequencies are unknown. ATD is transmitted with an autosomal mode of inheritance and up till now only one gene has been identified, namely IFT80, which accounts only for a small part of ATD. The aim of our project is to prospectively analyze at a clinical and molecular level a series of 50 ATD patients and 20 fetuses to further define the natural history of the disorder and to contribute to the identification of its molecular basis.</detailed_description>
