	<brief_summary>The durg vorinostat (Zolinza) is a type of drug called an histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. It inhibits a group of enzymes called histone deacetylases. These enzymes help cancer cells survive. By inhibiting these enzymes, vorinostat helps kill cancer cells. In this research study vorinostat will be given along with radiation therapy and the drug 5-FU. This is the first research study in which vorinostat will be given along with radiation therapy and 5-FU. The purpose of this research study is to find the highest dose of vorinostat that can be given safely along with radiation therapy and 5-FU. The investigators will also begin to get information about whether vorinostat combined with radiation and 5-FU may help to treat pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat in Combination With Radiation Therapy and Infusional Fluorouracil (5-FU) in Patients With Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since we are looking for the highest dose of vorinostat that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive the same dose. The dose will depend upon the number of participants enrolled on the study and how well they have tolerated their doses. - 5-FU will be given intravenously over 24 hours 7 days per week during each week of radiation therapy. In order for participants to be able to receive the 5-FU as an outpatient, they will need to have central line catheter placed. - Radiation therapy will be given once per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. - Vorinostat is taken orally. - Participants will be seen once per week during the 6 weeks that they are receiving 5-FU, radiation therapy and vorinostat.</detailed_description>

Low molecular weight heparin should be substituted when appropriate Patients who have received upper abdominal radiation therapy which fields would overlap with that determined necessary to treat the primary tumor. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant or breastfeeding women Individuals with history of a different malignancy are ineligible unless they are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk of recurrence of that malignancy.
