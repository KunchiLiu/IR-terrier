	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that a 3 month course of vitamin D supplementation to treat 25(OH)D deficiency in stone formers with high levels of 24-hour urinary calcium will not increase urinary calcium excretion by greater than 10%.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin D on Urinary Calcium Excretion in Kidney Stone Formers With High Urinary Calcium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to conduct a clinic-based interventional study of 30 patients followed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with history of nephrolithiasis, urinary calcium excretion between 200 and 400 mg/day, and 25-vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum level ≤ 25ng/ml). The intervention is oral ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week for 8 weeks [1], and each participant will serve as his own control. The outcome is the change in urinary calcium excretion. The planned study duration is 3 months. We will have greater than 95% power to detect a 10% increase in 24-hour urinary calcium</detailed_description>
