	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the ability of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRh) agonist to prevent the rise of progesterone during controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) after the administration of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) on the first day of menses.</brief_summary>
