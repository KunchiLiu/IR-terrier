	<brief_summary>About 1500 solid organs transplants are performed each year in the Paris agglomeration. Cancer risk in the transplanted is about three times higher than in a population of the same age without any organ transplant. Thus cancer is an important problem for organ transplant. These cancers can be related to many factors : - Post-transplant cancers are due in part to the non specific immunosuppression, which leads to oncogenic viruses replication, and then produces virus inducted cancers (as lymphoma due to EBV virus). - Post-transplant cancers can also be due to the carcinogenic factors of the immunosuppressive drugs (as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, which can cause the appearance of metastases). However, a new type of immunosuppressive drugs (mTOR inhibitors) appear to have anti-cancer properties. - Post-transplant cancers which are not virus-inducted can be relied to genetic factors of the transplanted patient and/or the transplant donor. There are 4 axes in this study : - Axis 1 : Epidemiological, clinical and biological study of the incident cancers in transplanted patients. - Axis 2 : Qualitative and quantitative immunological study of lymphocyte cells by the transplanted patient (determine their characteristics when a cancer appears). - Axis 3 : Pathological and genetic study of the post-transplant cancer cells (see if the cancer is caused by the donor or the recipient). Creation of a biobank. - Axis 4 : Pharmacogenetic study of the immunosuppressive drugs (determine the impact of patient genetic variability on tolerance and efficiency of the immunosuppressive drugs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cancers After Solid Organs Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational and comparative study (2 control patients are recruited for each 1 case patient). A case patient is a patient who has developed a cancer after his/her transplant. A control patient is a patient who has not developed a cancer after his/her transplant. These 2 groups will be matched according to specific inclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
