	<brief_summary>Perioperative airway resistance and lung function are evaluated perioperatively in patients, who undergo surgical procedures in different postures and with or without gas insufflation into the peritoneal cavity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Posture and Gas Insufflation on Perioperative Lung Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung function, upper and lower airway resistance measurements are performed in patients in prone horizontal or head tilted down (40Â°) position. Half of the patients with head down position will have surgery in laparoscopic technique (including gas insufflation to achieve a pneumoperitoneum). Measurements are performed on the day prior to surgery, on the morning of surgery, 30 - 45 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after extubation.</detailed_description>
