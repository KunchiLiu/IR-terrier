	<brief_title>PK-directed Dose Adjustment of IV Busulfan Conditioning Regimen for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluation of progression-free survival, transplant related mortality, overall survival, and overall response rate, in subjects with NHL and HL receiving an IV busulfan-based conditioning regimen with PK-guided IV busulfan dosing, followed by autologous HSCT as well as comparison to those receiving carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) conditioning regimen (and its variants) obtained from registry data in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Assessment of the safety profile of a BuCyE conditioning regimen with PK-directed dosing of IV busulfan will also be completed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with NHL to be included: Any subject with NHL that had relapsed or progressed following initial therapy with an anthracyclinebased chemotherapy regimen and has achieved a subsequent partial remission (PR) or a complete remission (CR) following a salvage chemotherapy regimen. Any subject with NHL that was initially refractory to an anthracyclinebased chemotherapy regimen but who has achieved a PR or CR following a salvage chemotherapy regimen. Any subject with an initial International Prognostic Index (IPI) score 45 who achieved a PR or any CR following an anthracyclinebased chemotherapy regimen except subjects with Mantle cell, T cell and Natural Killer (NK) cell pathologies. Subjects with Mantle cell, T cell and NK cell lymphoma may be enrolled if they have PR or CR after initial therapy. Any subject that has relapsed or progressed following previous autologous HSCT. Subjects with HL to be included: Any subject with HL that had relapsed or progressed following initial therapy with an multidrug chemotherapy regimen and has achieved a subsequent PR or a CR following a salvage chemotherapy regimen. Any subject with HL that is initially refractory to a multidrug chemotherapy regimen but who has achieved a PR or CR following a salvage chemotherapy regimen. Any subject that has relapsed or progressed following previous autologous HSCT. Any subject with chemoresistant disease by demonstration of less than PR to most recent chemotherapy, and any subject with prior treatment history of autologous HSCT or highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue for any medical reason will be excluded. Excluded will also be subjects with existing or active central nervous system lymphoma or human immunodeficiency virus related lymphoma, unacceptable organ function, or uncontrolled infections.</criteria>
