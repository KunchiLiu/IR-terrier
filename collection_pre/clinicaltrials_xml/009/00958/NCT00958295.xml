	<brief_summary>Acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis is common in general practice. Cystitis is at the second raw of antibiotic treatment indications. It has been now recommended not to perform any urine culture for more than 20 years; hence, the bacterial epidemiology of acute uncomplicated cystitis is surprisingly relatively unknown. The available bacteriological data mainly describe the epidemiology of complicated urinary tract infections or upper urinary tract infections, but the causative bacteria and the resistance rates might differ from those of uncomplicated cystitis. As an example, it is unknown to what extent Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the causative agent of uncomplicated cystitis. Moreover, the urine dipstick test have been evaluated in laboratories. But their interpretation in current practice might not be so easy: in particular, the nitrite detection depends on the bacterial concentration. The nitrite detection, produced in enterobacteriaceae related infections might have therapeutical consequences: trom√©tamol-fosfomycine is almost constantly active on enterobacteriaceae, but ineffective on staphylococci. Knowing the increasing prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacteriaceae, the use of fosfomycin in nitrite positive uncomplicated cystitis might preserve the susceptibility of fluoroquinolones during pyelonephritis. This study will describe: - the bacterial epidemiology of acute uncomplicated cystitis in general practice, - the correlation in between urine dipstick and urine culture in general practice, - the prediction of enterobacterial infection by the nitrite detection, AND - the antibiotics prescribed by the practitioners for uncomplicated acute cystitis.</brief_summary>
