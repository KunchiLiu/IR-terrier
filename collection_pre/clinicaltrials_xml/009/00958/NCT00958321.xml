	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography and computed tomography, may help learn the extent of disease and allow doctors to plan 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of positron emission tomography and computed tomography and to see how well it works in planning treatment for patients undergoing 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. This is a clinical study, as the patient will be treated using the PET-CT-GTV: - The pilot study is investigating the technological feasibility - The Phase II study will be a 2-stage Phase II study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot Study- Primary Objectives: - Prospective evaluation of the technical feasibility of integrating PET-CT fusion in St Luke's Hospital - Rate of PET-CT Scan based treatment delivery Pilot Study- Secondary Objectives: -Comparison of GTV, PTV and OAR DVHs between conventional 3-DCRT plan and PET-CT based 3-DCRT plan. Phase II Study- Primary Objective: -The safety of PET-CT scan based radiotherapy, with regard to loco-regional disease control. Phase II Study- Secondary Objectives: -Comparison of GTV, PTV and OAR DVHs between conventional 3-DCRT plan and PET-CT based 3-DCRT plan.</detailed_description>
