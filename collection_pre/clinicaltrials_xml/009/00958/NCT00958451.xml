	<brief_summary>This is an open label, single center, randomized, active comparator controlled study, comparing the effects of vitamin D replacement using oral ergocalciferol versus paricalcitol on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. The purpose of this study is to determine which of these two approaches is more successful.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll chronic kidney disease patients, stage 3 and 4, who have low serum vitamin D levels as defined by K DOQI Guidelines. Patients will be randomized to receive oral daily ergocalciferol or paricalcitol. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled, 40 in the cholecalciferol group and 40 in the paricalcitol group. Outcomes will be assessed as proportion of patients achieving pre-defined changes from baseline and as absolute changes from baseline values. Baseline values will be determined from averaging two consecutive measurements of the variables of interest prior to randomization.</detailed_description>
