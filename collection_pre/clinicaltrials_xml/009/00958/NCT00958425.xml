	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of hyaluronic acid gel injections compared to saline injections in improving scar quality in patients undergoing breast reduction surgery. Hyaluronic acid has been implicated in scarless fetal healing, and the investigators therefore hypothesize that injections of hyaluronic acid gel into breast reduction incisions will improve their appearance compared to injections of saline.</brief_summary>
