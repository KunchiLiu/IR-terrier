Have received MS therapy other than Rebif® within twelve weeks prior to Screening or at any time during the trial (e.g., other disease modifying drugs, Rebif® New Formulation, combination therapy, immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive agents, including but not limited to any interferon, glatiramer acetate (Copolymer I), cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, linomide, azathioprine, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, laquinimod, cladribine, total lymphoid irradiation, antilymphocyte monoclonal antibody treatment (e.g. natalizumab, alemtuzumab/Campath, anti CD4), Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), cytokines or anticytokine therapy) and telbivudine 3. Have inadequate liver function, defined by a alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5x ULN, or total bilirubin &gt; 2.5x ULN 4. Have inadequate bone marrow reserve, defined as a total white blood cell count &lt; 3.0x 109/L, platelet count &lt; 75x109/L, haemoglobin &lt; 100g/L 5.
