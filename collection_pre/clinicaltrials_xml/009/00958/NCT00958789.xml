	<brief_summary>This study will be a prospective, non-randomized evaluation of the change between preoperative and postoperative outcomes for those receiving the Triathlon® TS Total Knee System for a revision knee operation. The mean total Knee Society Score (for pain, motion and function) change is not 10% worse than, or is superior to, the expected change according to published revision total knee replacement data, for cases implanted with the Triathlon® TS Total Knee System as compared from preoperative to 2 years postoperative.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient has signed an IRB approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form. Patient is a male or nonpregnant female age 18 years or older at time of study device implantation. Patient is a candidate for revision of all femoral and tibial components of a total knee replacement. Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation. Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected knee joint at time of study device implantation. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device. Patient is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a metabolic disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days). Patient has a failed unicondylar knee prosthesis. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials. Patient is a prisoner.</criteria>
