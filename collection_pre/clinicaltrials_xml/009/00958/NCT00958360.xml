	<brief_summary>This study will determine if the interdisciplinary team low vision rehabilitation program is more effective than basic low vision care provided by an optometrist working alone in improving visual reading ability in veterans with macular diseases and best corrected visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/200.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Vision Intervention Trial II (LOVIT II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Key Questions: The purpose of our proposed single-masked multicenter randomized controlled trial is to determine if the Interdisciplinary Team approach to low vision service delivery is more effective than the Basic Low Vision Service in improving visual reading ability for 330 veterans with macular diseases and best corrected visual acuity of 20/50-20/200. Effectiveness will be measured with the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VA LV VFQ-48), a valid and reliable questionnaire that is administered by telephone to capture changes in patients' self-report of their difficulty reading and performing other daily living activities affected by visual impairment before and after rehabilitation. The primary outcome measure is the comparison of changes in patients' visual reading ability on the VA LV VFQ-48 after they receive low vision care from the Interdisciplinary Team or Basic Low Vision Care program. The secondary outcome measures are comparisons of changes in other VA LV VFQ-48 visual ability scores (overall, mobility, visual information processing, visual motor skills). Hypothesis: The improvement in visual reading ability measured with the VA LV VFQ-48 will be larger for patients who received low vision services from the Interdisciplinary Team than for patients who received the Basic Low Vision Service. Specific Aims:(1) Compare the mean changes in patients' visual reading ability (estimated from patients' difficulty ratings of reading items on the VA LV VFQ-48 before and after low vision service delivery) in the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision Care Programs.(2) Compare the mean changes in visual ability [patients' difficulty ratings of other items on the VA LV VFQ-48 (mobility, visual information processing, visual motor skills) before and after low vision service delivery] in the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision Care programs.(3). Identify the characteristics of patients who benefit from the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision Service. (4). Conduct an economic evaluation to compare the costs and cost effectiveness of the Interdisciplinary Team and Basic Low Vision Service.</detailed_description>
