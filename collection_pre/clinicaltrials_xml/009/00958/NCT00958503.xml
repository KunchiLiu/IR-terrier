	<brief_title>Effect of Thiamphenicol on EAAT2 and Other Biomarkers From Nasal Biopsied Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thiamphenicol has been proposed to increase the levels of the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in the nervous tissue. This study evaluated the ability of two weeks of treatment with thiamphenicol to increase EAAT2 in a nasal biopsy as a surrogate of brain nervous tissue.</detailed_description>
