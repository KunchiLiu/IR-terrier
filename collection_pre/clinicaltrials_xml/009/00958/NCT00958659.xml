	<brief_summary>This research trial studies specimens from young patients with neuroblastoma. Studying the genes expressed in specimens from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Specimens From Young Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Establish a robust messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression classifier for improved outcome prediction in children with neuroblastoma by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify mRNA levels from genes that have been shown in at least 2 independent studies to have predictive power. II. Identify microRNA (miRNA) patterns that have prognostic significance in neuroblastoma (NB) as accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in miRNA expression play a critical role in tumorigenesis and can be used in prognostic evaluation. III. To perform an integrated analysis of the established microRNA classifier with our mRNA signature to determine whether it results in even better classification of NB tumors. OUTLINE: Previously collected samples are analyzed for 59 prognostic genes by real-time quantitative PCR-based gene expression profiling.</detailed_description>
