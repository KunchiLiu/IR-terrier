	<brief_summary>The study is designed to produce early safety and performance data in a small group of patients requiring repair of a peripheral vascular endarterectomy (incision into an artery feeding the limbs which requires a patch to repair the incision after removal of an atherosclerotic plaque that was stopping usual blood flow to the limbs). Data is being collected to show the procedure is safe and allows for normal blood flow to be resumed. Data will be used to facilitate CE Mark submission.</brief_summary>
