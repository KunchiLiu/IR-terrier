	<brief_title>Vorinostat in Patients With Primary Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the objective response rate to treatment with dose-adjusted Vorinostat schedule in subjects with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who did not receive prior systematic therapy or have been treated with single agent targretin (bexarotene). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of dose-adjusted Vorinostat schedule when administered to patients with primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who did not receive prior systematic therapy or have been treated with single agent targretin. II. To determine the time to objective response in subjects with CTCL treated with dose-adjusted schedule of Vorinostat as primary therapy. III To determine the duration of objective response in subjects with CTCL. IV. To determine the time to loss of objective response. V. To determine the objective response rate of extracutaneous manifestations of CTCL (lymph node enlargement, Sezary cells in peripheral blood). VI. To compare the efficacy, toxicity and tolerability of dose-adjusted schedule to currently recommended flat dose of Vorinostat in subjects with CTCL. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms according to age (&lt; 65 vs &gt;= 65 years old). COHORT I (&gt;= 65 years old): Patients receive 200 mg vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. COHORT II (&lt; 65 years old): Patients receive 400 mg vorinostat PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.</detailed_description>

1.5 X ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN; creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard Serum total bilirubin =&lt;

3.0 X ULN Proven or suspected extracutaneous visceral CTCL involvement (M1) (CTCL stage IVB) Presence of lymphadenopathy is permitted ECOG performance status &gt; 2 Concomitant use of any anticancer therapy or immune modifier Concomitant use of any investigational agent or device Concomitant therapy with any other antiCTCL therapy, or radiation therapy (topical corticosteroids or low dose oral corticosteroids [=&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent] will not be excluded, but if used, the dose and schedule must be stable during the two weeks immediately prior to study entry) Use of any previous systemic therapy (except single agent targretin), total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy or extracorporeal photopheresis Evidence of clinically significant (uncontrolled) hypo or hyperthyroidism Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus as evidenced by hemoglobin (Hgb)A1c &gt; 6.5 mg/dl Recent (in the past 6 months) medically significant cardiac event (i.e. myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery) Presence of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class IV) or angina (NYHA class IV) or presence of a medically significant arrhythmia Congenital long QT syndrome Corrected QT interval &gt; 480 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) Presence of uncontrolled hypertension manifested by systolic blood pressure &gt;= 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;= 100 mmHg Documented current active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV) Presence of uncontrolled bacterial or viral infection (subject may be receiving chronic antimicrobial therapy) History of culturedocumented bacteremia in the previous 2 weeks Concurrent therapy with any histone deacetylase (HDAC)like compound; patients treated with valproic acid for epilepsy may enroll after a 30 day washout period Recent change (in the past 2 weeks) in the doses or regimens of medication used for any chronic nononcologic conditions for reasons of worsening of chronic illness (change in doses of chronic medications associated with improvement in a chronic illness are not exclusion criteria) Presence of any acute or chronic nononcologic disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, is medically uncontrolled History of a prior malignancy with the exception of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; nonmelanoma skin cancer; adequately treated localized prostate carcinoma with prostate specific antigen (PSA) &lt; 1.0; or who has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease for five years, and/or who is deemed at low risk for recurrence (&lt; 30% probability) by his/her treating physician Patient with a "currently active" second malignancy, other than nonmelanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, should not be enrolled Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might prevent the subject from complying with all required study procedures Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test within 28 days prior to registration, and must use an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for a period of at least 3 months after the study Females of childbearing potential and sexually active males, if indicated, must be willing and able to use two methods of contraception that are adequate to prevent or minimize risk of pregnancy for the duration of the study; one of which must be a barrier method Patient has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion (a patient who is clinically stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible) Patient has had allogeneic transplant Patient has a history of a gastrointestinal surgery or other procedures that might, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the absorption or swallowing of the study drugs</criteria>
