	<brief_summary>Research suggests dietary fiber may play a role in weight management, and fiber consumption is inversely associated with body weight, body fat, and BMI in cross-sectional studies. These effects may be mediated by increased satiety, reduced food intake, or changes in blood levels of glucose, insulin, and gut hormones. The purpose of this study is to determine the satiety, glycemic, hormonal, and gastrointestinal responses of novel fiber supplements.</brief_summary>
