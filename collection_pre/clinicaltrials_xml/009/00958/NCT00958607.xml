	<brief_summary>About 50% of stroke survivors have limitations in their activities of daily living on return to the community. Family caregivers provide invaluable support to these individuals during their recovery and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, there is no standard clinical practice to prepare caregivers for this role and, as a result, many experience stress and poor health that can compromise stroke survivor recovery and threaten the sustainability of the care needed to thrive in their home. To address this gap, the investigators have developed the Timing it Right Stroke Family Support Program that aims to meet the evolving needs of caregivers. The objective of this multi-province randomized controlled trial is to determine if this program delivered across the stroke care continuum improves caregivers' sense of being supported and emotional well-being. Ultimately this program could be used by stroke care programs from across Canada.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Stroke Family Caregiver Support Across the Care Continuum by Improving the Timing of Intervention Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this multi-province randomized controlled trial will be to determine if the TIR Stroke Family Support Program delivered across the care continuum contributes to positive caregiver outcomes. Since this program targets family caregiver support, the primary outcomes of the intervention will be caregivers' perception of being supported in their care-giving role and improvements in caregiver mental health outcomes (e.g., less depression and more psychological well-being). To determine the impact of the intervention on caregiver outcomes, we will compare two modes of intervention delivery with standard care: 1) repeated contact in person and by telephone with a stroke support person and 2) a self-directed program by the caregiver. We will perform a multi-site, mixed methods RCT. Caregivers of patients who are receiving acute care for their first stroke will be recruited within the first week of hospital admission. Members of the stroke team from the participating hospitals' stroke units will identify potential participants and ask their permission to be approached by each site's research assistant. The research assistant will fully explain the study, answer questions, obtain consent, administer the baseline questionnaires, and then contact the project coordinator who will then randomize participants to one of three groups: A) TIR Stroke Family Support Program delivered by a stroke support person, B) caregiver self-directed TIR Stroke Family Support Program, and C) usual care that includes provision of the Heart and Stroke educational resource "Let's Talk about Stroke". The research assistants will give caregivers a copy of "Let's Talk about Stroke" (if they have not yet received a copy) and introduce them to the stroke support person who will deliver the full intervention and instruct the family in the use of the self-directed arm of the intervention. A second part-time research assistant blinded to group assignment will complete routine follow-up assessments with participants at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke. A subset of 36 participants (6 from each site) will also participate in a qualitative interview after completion of their 12-month follow-up assessment. The goals of this multi-site randomized controlled trial are to: 1. Assess whether the intervention improves caregivers outcomes (via quantitative analysis) 2. Assess how the intervention improves caregiver outcomes (via qualitative analysis) 3. Assess how the intervention is delivered (via stroke support person journals)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must speak and read English and be the primary family caregiver of a person who is receiving care for their first hospitalization for an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and whose anticipated ultimate destination after discharge is a private residence or apartment building. Stroke survivors must exhibit at least minimal disability (i.e., are referred to at least one rehabilitation health care professional during acute care). They may be admitted to short or longduration inpatient (maximum duration of 6 months) or outpatient rehabilitation or return directly home. Caregivers of terminally ill stroke survivors or of survivors discharged to complex continuing care, longterm care or assisted retirement residences.</criteria>
