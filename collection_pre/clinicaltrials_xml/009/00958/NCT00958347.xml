	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to obtain up to 25 year post-operative data on the Omnifit Hydroxylapatite (HA) Hip System in support of the hypothesis that it is a satisfactory system for reducing implant loosening, permitting tissue bonding onto the hydroxylapatite surfaces of the implant and providing a safe, efficient, and well-functioning hip in a wide spectrum of clinical circumstances.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omnifit Hydroxylapatite (HA) Hip Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>For use as a universal hip replacement: Acute femoral neck fracture. Nonunion of femoral head and neck fractures. Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or posttraumatic arthritis of the hip with minimal acetabular involvement or distortion. Salvage of failed total hip arthroplasty. For use as a total hip replacement: Severely disabled joints resulting from painful osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or posttraumatic arthritis. Revision of previous unsuccessful femoral head replacement, cup arthroplasty, or other procedure. Active infection in or near the hip joint. Pathological bone conditions which would significantly compromise the ability to carry physiologic stress levels and for which bone grafting would be inappropriate (i.e. severe osteoporosis, Paget's Disease, renal osteodystrophy, etc.). Neuromuscular disorders in which the potentially adverse effects on prosthesis function are not outweighed by the benefits to be gained by the patient from usage of the implant. Mental disorders which would compromise essential patient postoperative care. Skeletal immaturity. Extreme obesity. Significant probability that patient could not return for required followup evaluations.</criteria>
