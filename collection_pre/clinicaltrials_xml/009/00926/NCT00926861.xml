	<brief_summary>Choroidal neovascularisation in age related macular degeneration is one of the major causes of legal blindness in the western world existing in two major occurences, the dry and the wet form.The etiology of age related macular degeneration is yet unknown. Genetic factors, oxidative stress, Ischaemia, and aging of the retinal pigment epithelium are discussed as etiologic factors. The risk of rapid vision loss is much higher in wet AMD, a dry form may transform to a wet form. From a prior study the investigators know that the posterior hyaloid is significantly more frequent attached in wet AMD. This study is conducted to examine whether the attached posterior hyaloid is a risk factor to develop wet AMD in dry AMD cases.</brief_summary>
