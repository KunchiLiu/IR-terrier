	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that the fixed-dose combination of T80/HCTZ25 is superior as first line therapy in reducing seated trough cuff Systolic Blood Pressure(SBP) compared to the monotherapy of T80 in patients with grade 2 or grade 3 hypertension (SBP&gt;=160 mmHg and Diastolic Blood Pressure(DBP)&gt;=100 mmHg).</brief_summary>

Renal dysfunction as defined by the following laboratory parameters: Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (or &gt;265 umol/L) and/or known creatinine clearance of &lt;30 ml/min and/or clinical markers of severe renal impairment. 6. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, postrenal transplant patients or patients with only one kidney 7. Clinically relevant hypokalemia or hyperkalemia (i.e., &lt;3.5 mmol/L or &gt;5.5 mmol/L, may be rechecked for suspected error in result) 8. Uncorrected sodium or volume depletion 9. Primary aldosteronism. 10. Hereditary fructose intolerance 11. Biliary obstructive disorders (e.g., cholestasis) or hepatic insufficiency 12. Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association functional class Congestive Heart Failure IIIIV (Refer to Appendix 10.3) 13. Contraindication to a placebo runin period (e.g., stroke within the past 6 months, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, unstable angina or coronary artery bypass graft within the past 3 months prior to start of run in period) 14. Clinically significant ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or other clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the Investigator 15. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe obstructive coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aortic or mitral valve 16. Patients whose diabetes has not been stable and controlled for at least the past 3 months as defined by an Glycosylated Hemoglobin &gt;=10% 17. Patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensinII receptor antagonists 18. History of drug or alcohol dependency within 6 months prior to signing the informed consent form 19. Concomitant administration of any medications known to affect blood pressure, except medications allowed by the protocol 20. Any investigational drug therapy within 1 month of signing the informed consent 21. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the trial drugs (telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, or placebo) 22. History of noncompliance or inability to comply with prescribed medications or protocol procedures (less than 80% or more than 120%, especially during runin) 23. Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of the trial medication</criteria>
