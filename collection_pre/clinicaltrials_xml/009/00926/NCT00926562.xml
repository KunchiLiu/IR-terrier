	<detailed_description>In the diagnosis and treatment of coronary heart disease, patients should undergo cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In those procedures, the investigators should use the contrast media, and it may cause kidney toxicity especially in the patients with chronic renal insufficiency.</detailed_description>
