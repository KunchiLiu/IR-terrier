	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to explore whether the extinction of cue-reactivity following a cue-exposure based intervention in volunteers with an alcohol dependence is facilitated by drugs that increase NMDA-receptor function. It is hypothesised that targeted treatment with D-Cycloserine prior to each extinction training session enhances the effects on cue-reactivity. Further, a significant correlation between the reduction of cue-reactivity and both reduced craving and relapse probability is expected.</brief_summary>
