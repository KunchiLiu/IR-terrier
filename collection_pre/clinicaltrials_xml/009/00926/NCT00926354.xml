	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy Induced Thrombocytopenia is a common side-effect of bone marrow suppression as a result of a chemotherapy treatment. AS101 is a tellurium based small compound with immunomodulating characteristics which attributed to the direct inhibition of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. AS101 was previously shown to induce a significant reduction in thrombocytopenia that accompany cancer therapy with no major toxicity . This phase II randomized open study will evaluate the efficacy of AS101 for the treatment of chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia in patients with various solid tumors.</brief_summary>

Performance Status (PS) of 02 Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL Adequate liver function: Serum (total) bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN. AST, ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN in patients without liver metastases, ≤ 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastases. Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL (Only for patients who will receive AS101). INR ≤ 1.5 and PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN (Only for patients who will receive AS101). Patients unable to provide fully informed consent. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. The patient is participating in another trial of an investigational drug or has done so within 28 days prior to the pretreatment visit. The patient has congestive heart failureNew York Heart Association (CHFNYHA) grade II or higher, and/or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months, or any cardiac disorder which in the opinion of the Investigator would put the patient at risk. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within the last 5 years. The patient has any other clinically significant medical condition, psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality which would, in the judgment of the Investigator, interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the trial.</criteria>
