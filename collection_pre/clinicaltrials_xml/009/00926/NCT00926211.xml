	<brief_title>Computer-Assisted Versus Manual Hair Harvest Comparative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major technical step in hair transplantation is harvesting of the hair follicles. There are two accepted techniques for obtaining the hair grafts that are transplanted during the procedure. The first is donor strip harvest and stereomicroscopic dissection of the follicular unit grafts. The second is dissection and extraction of the follicular unit graft directly from the patient's scalp referred to as Follicular Unit Extraction or "FUE". Potential benefits of the FUE technique may be less scalp scarring in the Donor Area, less patient discomfort and faster wound healing. Although the FUE approach to harvest has highly desirable attributes, it is technically difficult to perform, labor intensive, tedious and requires an excessive amount of time to harvest follicular units. These procedural factors have prevented the FUE approach from gaining wider adoption. Restoration Robotics, Inc. has developed the Restoration Robotics ARTAS™ Computer-Assisted Harvesting System to assist physicians in the harvest of hair follicles during hair transplantation procedures. The System mimics the manual FUE approach to harvesting follicular units and has the potential to solve the technical challenges inherent in the manual FUE technique. The ARTAS™ System is capable of identifying and harvesting hair follicles directly from the patient's scalp through a semi-automated process. The goal of the ARTAS™ System is to harvest the hair follicles while maintaining their critical anatomic structures intact.</detailed_description>
