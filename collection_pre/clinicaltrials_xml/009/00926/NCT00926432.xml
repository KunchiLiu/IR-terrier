	<brief_title>Postural Balance of the Adult</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical routine, 3D analysis of postural balance is only made using clinical examination. When dealing with specific pathologies, in particular spine disorders, a better understanding of the balance could help better treat and prevent late complications. This prospective study aims at describing the pathologies of the musculoskeletal system using 3D reconstruction of the spine, the pelvis and the inferior limbs with regard to gravity line by patients suffering from postural trouble and defining new parameters to assess postural balance</detailed_description>
