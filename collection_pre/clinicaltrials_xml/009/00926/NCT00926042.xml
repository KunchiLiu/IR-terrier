	<brief_title>Genotype and Phenotype Registry: Enrollment of Normal Control Subjects for Current and Future Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The registry is a collection of volunteers willing to participate as control subjects in research studies. Control subjects are people who do not have a specific disease; therefore they can serve a critical role as a comparison with people who have the disease or other characteristic being studied. Once registered, participants will be notified about studies they may be able to participate in as a control. Participation requires: 1. signing a consent form 2. answering a short health survey 3. providing a DNA sample via a mouthwash kit The registry allows scientists to select study participants based on whether or not they have a specific genetic change that may be relevant to a disease under investigation. Having the ability to access controls when needed is an extremely valuable resource that will speed up scientific discoveries.</detailed_description>
