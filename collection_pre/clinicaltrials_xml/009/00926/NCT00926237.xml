	<brief_summary>One out of every five people experiences tinnitus (a ringing, buzzing, or roaring sound in the ear) ranging from mild to severe impairment. To date, there are no effective therapies available that have been shown to decrease tinnitus loudness. The purpose of this study is to develop a new treatment option for tinnitus using a technique called Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), which will hopefully prove to be an effective means of alleviating or reducing the symptoms of tinnitus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research is being conducted at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). Up to 60 subjects, including males and females ages 19-89 years old and of all races, and with tinnitus severe enough to seek medical attention, will be enrolled in this study. All participants will be evaluated or medically reviewed by the study physician, Dr. Dornhoffer of the Hearing and Balance Clinic at UAMS, including a modified physical examination and hearing tests, prior to beginning therapy with rTMS in order to rule out any medically treatable causes of tinnitus. An MRI scan of the head may or may not be required, depending upon the results of this evaluation, in order to rule out specific middle ear pathologies. This study will require participation in at least three weeks (4 weekdays per week) of rTMS sessions, including two active weeks and a sham (or placebo) week. There will be a three week washout period following each treatment week. At the completion of the three treatment weeks, subjects who have noticed an improvement in their tinnitus will have the option of participating in a maintenance rTMS program providing up to 8 additional weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
