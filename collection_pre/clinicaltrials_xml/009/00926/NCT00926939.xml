	<detailed_description>Smokers are randomly assigned to one of two groups: an Abstinence Contingent (AC) group and a Submission Contingent (SC) group. The AC group receives vouchers for abstaining from smoking (measured by a carbon monoxide monitor and confirmed through video-submission), and the SC group receives vouchers for submitting videos of their carbon monoxide breath tests. Both groups take videos of their CO-monitoring on a secure website designed for the study, as well as receive standard care counseling and education related to smoking cessation. The main intervention lasts four weeks, and a three-week maintenance phase will follow. Assessments will be conducted at intake, week four (end of the main treatment phase), and at three and six months after the intervention period is completed</detailed_description>
