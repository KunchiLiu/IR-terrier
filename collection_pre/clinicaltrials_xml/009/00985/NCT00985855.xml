	<brief_summary>Phase II, randomised, controlled, non comparative study with 2 parallel groups: - Arm A: patients will receive induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and docetaxel) followed by a concomitant radio-chemotherapy including 2 cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine associated with a weekly cetuximab infusion during the radiotherapy. - Arm B: patients will receive induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and docetaxel) followed by a concomitant radio-chemothérapy including 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide associated with a weekly cetuximab infusion during the radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
