	<brief_title>Study for Short Term Weight Loss in Candidates for Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with obesity are at significantly greater risk of developing significant co-morbid complications, and are associated with an increased risk in all-cause mortality. The GI Endobarrier Liner represents a viable alternative to other short-term weight loss methods. It is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, which may allow patients to recover faster with less morbidity and mortality. This study is investigating the safety and efficacy of the GI Endobarrier Liner in patients who are candidates for bariatric surgery.</detailed_description>
