	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different formulations of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A when administered alone or in combination with the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK1024850A vaccine) as a 2-dose primary vaccination course followed by a booster dose in healthy children aged 12-23 months at the time of first vaccination. Considering that febrile reactions are frequently observed following pneumococcal vaccination, usually co-administered with other routine paediatric vaccines, the primary study objective will focus on evaluating the increase in grade 3 fever (i.e. rectal temperature &gt;40.0°C).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol Male or female between, and including, 12 and 23 months of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parents/LAR(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the study period starting from 30 days before each dose and ending 30 days after each dose of vaccine(s). Previous vaccination against S. pneumoniae since birth. History of any hypersensitivity reaction following any previous vaccination. Eczema and any history of allergy Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required), including human immunodeficiency virus infection. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or any chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 37.5°C on oral or axillary setting, or &gt;= 38.0°C on rectal setting. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/ or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned use during the study period. Child in care.</criteria>
