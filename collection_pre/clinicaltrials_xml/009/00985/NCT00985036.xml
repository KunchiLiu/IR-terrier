	<brief_summary>Objectives: This study is looking at the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) circulating in the blood stream of patients diagnosed with either a meningioma or a glioma. The questions that will be addressed include: 1. Can VEGF level alert us to tumor progression or recurrence before MRI changes occur? 2. Is the VEGF level an indicator of the response to treatment? 3. Does the VEGF level correlate with tumor histology and behavior? 4. Is there a relationship between VEGF level and outcome?</brief_summary>
