	<brief_title>A Study of JNJ-26866138 (Bortezomib) in Untreated Multiple Myeloma Patients Who Are Not Candidates for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (both physician and participant know the intervention), non-randomized (participants are not assigned by chance), multi-center study in untreated multiple myeloma participants who were not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This study consists of two parts: Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I, a total of 18 participants will be enrolled ie, 6 patients per dose level (0.7, 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m2) to determine the recommended dose of bortezomib. In Phase II, additional 83 participants will be enrolled. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory test, specifically hematological toxicities.</detailed_description>
