	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to explore the potential value and practicality of an innovative depression intervention for young people. More specifically, the objectives of this project are: 1. to pilot the Internet-based Spirituality Program with depressed young people (age 13-24) in Calgary by: 1. obtaining preliminary estimates on the impact of the program on the primary outcome of depression severity, and secondary outcomes of spiritual well-being and self-concept. 2. obtaining preliminary estimates on response rates and remission rates to guide sample size estimations for a full size randomized trial. 3. evaluating if the suggested research methodology is feasible with respect to recruitment rate, patient burden and clinical implementation to guide design of a full size randomized trial. 2. to gather feedback from depressed young people, their families and referral sources in the community (schools, family physicians, mental health outpatient services) on the perceived value of the program and on ways to eventually make it available as a community resource for others dealing with depression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression in adolescents and young adults is a prevalent illness in Canada and presents a high burden for those affected and their families. In Canada, depressive disorders are on the rise and their onset is occurring earlier in life. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that spiritual wellness may play a role in depression management and recovery. Considering the limitations of available treatments for depression and the significant burden of the disease there is a need for new treatment options that are safe, effective, affordable and acceptable to young people. Our previous research gives strong support to the idea of using a spiritually based intervention for depression. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on using spirituality as a self-study intervention in the management of depression in young adults. Over the last two years our team has created a spirituality-based intervention program for adolescent depression. The program could present an innovative and low cost treatment option for young patients with major depression.</detailed_description>
