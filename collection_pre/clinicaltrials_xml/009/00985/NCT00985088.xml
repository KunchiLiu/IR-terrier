Medical history of physicianconfirmed infection with an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)vlike virus Previous vaccination at any time with an H1N1vlike virus vaccine or a medical history of physicianconfirmed infection with an H1N1vlike virus. Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, even if stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Presence of a temperature &gt;= 38.0ºC (&gt;=100.4ºF), or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination. Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment, or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrollment. Topical, intraarticularly injected, or inhaled glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or imiquimod are allowed. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of 24 hours prior to vaccination, are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., lowdose acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of GuillainBarré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine With the exception of seasonal influenza vaccination, administration of any vaccine(s) within 30 days before study vaccination on Day 0. Seasonal influenza vaccine may be administered up to 14 days prior to study vaccination on Day 0. Planned administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between Day 0 and the Day 42 phlebotomy, including seasonal influenza vaccine or a monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine other than the study vaccines. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/product, or planned use during the study period. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines; a history of anaphylactictype reaction to any constituent of influenza vaccines; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine. Known pregnancy or a positive urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin test result prior to the first vaccination. Lactating or nursing women.</criteria>
