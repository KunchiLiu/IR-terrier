	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that genetic variants will alter gene expression in response to ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass. To test this, the investigators will be taking small pieces of heart tissue from patients undergoing heart surgery before and after this period of ischemia. This will be compared to blood gene expression in blood cells and analyzed with the patients' genetic profile. This might allow us to assess the amount of inflammation that occurs when patients are on the heart-lung machine as well as examine the effects genes have on this critical time period.</brief_summary>
