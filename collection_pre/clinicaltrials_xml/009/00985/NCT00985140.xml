	<brief_summary>To examine the efficacy and safety of total skin electron beam therapy to a dose of 12 Gray (TSEBT 12 Gy) in patients who have mycosis fungoides (MF) staged as IB to IIIA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSEBT 12 Gy) in Stage IB-IIIA Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total skin electron beam therapy will be administered in the Department of Radiation Oncology according to the Stanford six-field technique. Patients will receive a planned total skin dose of 12 Gy fractionated at 2 Gy/cycle (each cycle requiring 2 days of treatment) 4 days each week, for 3 weeks. Supplements will routinely be applied to the perineum and soles as well as any other "shadowed" sites involved by disease, such as the inframammary regions (1-2 Gy fractions to a total dose of 12 Gy). Discrete tumors may receive additional "boost" treatment not to exceed 12 Gy. During the course of TSEBT patients will be evaluated weekly in the Department of Radiation Oncology for determination of adverse events and toxicity grading according the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 3.0. A baseline evaluation will occur on the first day of TSEBT at which time the following procedures will be performed: (This visit may be waived if TSEBT is initiated within one week of the screening visit AND there is no clinical evidence of disease progression). After the completion of TSEBT, patients will be followed every 4 weeks until 24 weeks , and then every 8 weeks for a total of 12 months or until there is disease progression, relapse, or the initiation of a new anti-cancer therapy. Patients who withdraw during the treatment period due to intolerance to radiotherapy will be followed weekly until toxicities have reverted to Grade â‰¤ 2 or has stabilized in the opinion of the Investigator, at which point a final visit will be scheduled. A final visit should be attempted for all patients who are lost to follow-up.</detailed_description>
