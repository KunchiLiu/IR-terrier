	<brief_title>Surveying The Outcomes Of Lubiprostone (The STOOL Study) in Nursing Home Residents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, observational, open-label, non-placebo, controlled study to measure the effects of Lubiprostone on CIC in nursing home residents. All clinical sites will follow a common protocol using standardizes definitions in which eligible patients will be asked to participate in the proposed study. During the course of the study, various selected parameters will be measured and compared to establish the clinical efficacy of Lubiprostone in the treatment of CIC. The study sample (N=105) will be comprised of nursing home residents with a confirmed diagnosis of CIC. A power analysis generated a sample size of 97 residents. To protect the validity of the test, 8 residents were added to the final study sample to allow for losses to followup. Therefore, a final sample size of 105 residents was identified for the study. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited for participation in the study. 3 sites in Central Florida with multiple Nursing Homes per site will be recruited to participate in the proposed study.</detailed_description>
