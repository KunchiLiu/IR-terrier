	<brief_title>Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Hemoglobin A1c in Patients With Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D is typically understood to support musculoskeletal health when administered concomitantly with calcium. A number of recent studies suggest, however, that this important nutrient may play a significant role in many pathophysiological processes, including diabetes mellitus. With the prevalence of diabetes mellitus ever increasing, novel mechanisms for controlling blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c are being sought to help prevent the costly and debilitating complications of this chronic disease.</detailed_description>
