	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an asynchronous online model of teledermatology can achieve similar clinical outcomes as compared to conventional in-office care for the management of atopic dermatitis. The investigators also aim to determine the effects of this online care model on patient quality of life as well as patient and physician satisfaction. The investigators' hypotheses include the following: 1. Compared to in-person visits, the online care model will result in similar clinical improvement in atopic dermatitis disease severity. 2. Compared to in-person visits, the online care model will result in similar improvements in quality of life. 3. Providers and subjects in the online group will achieve a similar level of overall satisfaction as those in the in-person group.</brief_summary>
