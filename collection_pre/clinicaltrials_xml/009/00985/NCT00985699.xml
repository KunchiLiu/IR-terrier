	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at genes in tissue samples from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine if toxicity following treatment for lymphoma varies according to genetic polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes (i.e., SOD2, CAT, GPX1, GSTM1, and GSTP1). - To assess whether these genetic polymorphisms are associated with progression-free survival and/or overall survival in these patients treated for lymphoma. OUTLINE: Previously collected samples are used for biomarker analysis.</detailed_description>
