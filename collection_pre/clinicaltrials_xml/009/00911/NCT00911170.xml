	<brief_summary>This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study evaluating the efficacy of pegfilgrastim to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with newly diagnosed, locally-advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line treatment with bevacizumab and either 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin (FOLFOX) or 5-fluorouracil, Irinotecan, Leucovorin (FOLFIRI). This study will also investigate the effect of adding pegfilgrastim to bevacizumab and either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI by evaluating overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate in each arm at regular intervals over a maximum of 60 months follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diseaserelated: Histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum Locallyadvanced or metastatic disease by radiographic evaluation Measurable disease Has not previously received chemotherapy for locallyadvanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Patient may have received adjuvant therapy for primary colorectal cancer provided that at least 6 months have elapsed from the time the adjuvant therapy was concluded and recurrent/metastatic disease was documented. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 02 Demographic: Age of 18 years or over Laboratory: Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count at least 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal or Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 5.0 x upper limit of normal if attributable to liver metastasis An inrange international normalized ratio (INR) (inrange is usually defined as between 2 and 3) for patients on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or stable dose of low molecular weight heparin Has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries high risk of bleeding (eg, tumor involving major vessels or known varices). If a suspicion of bleeding diathesis exists, a bleeding time should be performed Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal General: Written informed consent obtained Afebrile on day 1 of cycle 1 Must be able and willing to comply with study and/or followup procedures DiseaseRelated: Known brain metastases History of another primary malignancy less than/equal to 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer Prior major surgical procedure less than 28 days prior to day 1 of cycle 1 chemotherapy dosing; anticipated need for major surgical procedure during the 4 cycle treatment period of the study Fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to day 1 of cycle 1 chemotherapy dosing Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture, or history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to day 1 of cycle 1 Uncontrolled high blood pressure, history of labile hypertension, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, unstable angina within the past 3 months, myocardial infarction or history of stroke within the past 12 months, unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication, or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease History of clinically significant bleeding within 6 months prior to randomization History of arterial or venous thromboembolism within 6 months prior to randomization History of other disease including uncontrolled diabetes, serious active or uncontrolled infection, metabolic dysfunction; physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of the prescribed therapy or that might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications Laboratory: Proteinuria &gt; 1+, or total quantitative protein &gt; 500 mg protein/day as determined by 24hr urine collection Medications: Prior radiotherapy unless treatment was limited to the target lesion and only 1 measurable lesion was treated. Progression of the irradiated lesion must be demonstrated. Patients may not have received prior radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone marrow. Radiation must have concluded ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Prior radiosensitizing chemoradiation will be allowed as long as it was concluded ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Radiotherapy to nontarget lesions for pain control will be allowed Prior bevacizumab use or other agents targeting VEGF Concurrent use of other biological agents Use of systemic antiinfectives for active infection, during the 3 calendar days before starting study chemotherapy and bevacizumab or planned during the study treatment period General: Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation (during the study treatment period) in an experimental therapeutics study other than this protocol Female participants who are pregnant or lactating or men and women of reproductive potential not willing to employ an effective method of birth control during treatment and for 20 weeks for women, and 30 weeks for men after discontinuing study treatment History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to bevacizumab, irinotecan, 5fluorouracil (5FU), oxaliplatin, or leucovorin, including known sensitivity to E. Coli derived products (eg, Filgrastim, HUMULIN insulin, Lasparaginase) Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency</criteria>
