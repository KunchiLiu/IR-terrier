	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation and CD4 Count in HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine the impact of vitamin D on immunological status in HIV-infected children as measured by CD4 count (CD4 percent). We will determine if vitamin D supplementation leads to a measurable change in CD4 count (CD4 percent) in HIV-infected children in the context of routine clinical care. Specific study questions are: 1. Does vitamin D supplementation lead to a change in CD4 percent (CD4 count) in HIV-infected children? 2. Do the serum levels of the active form of vitamin D [1, 25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D] correlate with CD4 percent (CD4 count) in HIV-infected children?</detailed_description>
