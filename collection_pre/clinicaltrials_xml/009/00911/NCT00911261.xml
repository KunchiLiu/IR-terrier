	<brief_title>Oxymorphone Extended Release in Patients With Cancer or Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and tolerability of oxymorphone ER in the treatment of cancer or neuropathic pain. Opioid-naïve subjects are gradually titrated from oxymorphone ER 5 mg, every 12 hours (q12h). All other subjects are titrated to a stable dose (defined as pain scores ≥ 4 on BPI Question 5 on 3 of 5 consecutive days while receiving the same total daily dose of study medication including rescue) with tolerable side effects. Subjects could potentially receive therapy for up to 12 months after the first dose of study medication.</detailed_description>
