	<brief_title>Study of the Xience V Everolimus-eluting Stent in Saphenous Vein Graft Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantation of bare metal coronary stents (BMS) is currently the preferred percutaneous treatment for aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft (SVG) lesions, but is associated with high risk for in-stent restenosis. Although drug-eluting stents (DES) appear promising, there are limited and conflicting data on their efficacy and safety in SVGs. Our group recently completed and reported the results of the SOS (Stenting Of Saphenous vein grafts) trial that compared a paclitaxel-eluting stent with a similar BMS. There is currently no data on the use of the second generation DES in these challenging lesions. The SOS-Xience V study will examine the effects of the Xience V everolimus-eluting stent in SVG lesions. The specific aim of SOS-Xience V is to examine the 12-month incidence of binary angiographic in-stent restenosis (defined as a stenosis of &gt; 50% of the minimum lumen diameter of the target segment) after implantation of the Xience V stent in SVG lesions. The Xience V stent will be implanted in 40 consecutive patients who need stenting of a SVG lesion. Patients will undergo repeat follow-up angiography and intravascular ultrasonography at 12 months and will be followed clinically for 12 months to determine: 1. the incidence of binary angiographic in-stent restenosis, as assessed by 12 month follow-up quantitative coronary angiography (primary study endpoint), and 2. intra-stent intimal hyperplasia volume accumulation at 12 months, as measured by intravascular ultrasonography, and (b) 12-month incidence of ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, and target vessel failure (composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization) (secondary study endpoints), and (c) percent stent strut coverage by optical coherence tomography</detailed_description>
