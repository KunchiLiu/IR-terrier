	<brief_summary>Identifying a simple dietary recommendation for weight loss and metabolic health may demonstrate potential for a simple public health message to impact coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention and metabolic syndrome. In a randomized clinical trial, the investigators propose to compare the efficacy of two intervention approaches to dietary change for CHD prevention among persons with metabolic syndrome. The two approaches are 1) the AHA Dietary Guidelines; and 2) a simple dietary change condition that focuses on increasing fiber. The investigators hypothesize that a message promoting high fiber intake may be the simple message that has potential to produce broad impact.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Simple Dietary Message to Improve Dietary Quality for Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will recruit 240 overweight and obese adults from a primary care setting who meet diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. The efficacy of the two dietary change interventions will be compared in a randomized controlled trial, with 120 patients per group. The two approaches are 1) the American Heart Association (AHA) Dietary Guidelines; and 2) a simple dietary change condition that focuses on increasing fiber. Patients in both conditions will receive intensive dietary instruction for 3 months, followed by a 9 month maintenance phase. Both conditions will receive dietary instructions via individual and group sessions led by registered dietitians. Assessments, including diet, anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids, insulin, inflammatory markers, medication use, depression, quality of life, and physical activity will be conducted at baseline and at 6-, and 12-months after randomization. A 3-month post-intensive intervention assessment will measure short-term changes in body weight, diet, and metabolic syndrome indicators.</detailed_description>
