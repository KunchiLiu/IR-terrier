	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study to Determine Time to Steady-state</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serum testosterone levels will be obtained in hypogonadal (serum testosterone &lt;300 ng/dL) males receiving testosterone undecanoate capsules administered twice daily. Serum samples will be obtained consecutively in the morning on several days during one month of open-label treatment to confirm the time at which steady-state is reached.</detailed_description>
