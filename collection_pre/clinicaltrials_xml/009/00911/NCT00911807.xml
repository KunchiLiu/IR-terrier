	<brief_summary>The study was performed to compare the safety and efficacy of Cerebrolysin (10 mililiters [ml]), Aricept (10 miligrams [mg]), and a combination of both treatments on cognitive performance and global function in patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It should also be assessed if the treatments have a positive effect on activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Oral treatment with Aricept or Placebo was given once daily throughout the study. Intravenous treatment with Cerebrolysin or Placebo was given once daily for 5 days per week during week 1 to 4 and during week 13 to 16 of the study. During the study patients had six visits at the hospital for evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study to Test Safety and Efficacy of Neurotrophic and Cholinergic Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endogenous neurotrophic factors, also called neurotrophins, are signaling molecules in various cellular pathways and allow proper neuronal function, survival and regeneration. Sufficient supply is therefore regarded as a pre-requisite for neuronal maintenance but sudden or chronic pathological changes result in an imbalance of this regulatory system. Cerebrolysin is a peptide preparation acting in a similar way like endogenous neurotrophic factors. Due to its pleiotropic effects - neuroprotection, neuronal survival, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis -, Cerebrolysin is regarded as potential therapeutic tool in complex diseases like stroke or dementia. In contrast to naturally occurring neurotrophic factors, neuropeptides of Cerebrolysin enter the brain parenchyma by crossing the blood-brain barrier after peripheral (intravenous [IV]) administration. Another treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease targets the cholinergic system to increase cortical acetylcholine. One of these drugs is the anticholinesterase donepezil (Aricept). However, anticholinesterases seem to provide only symptomatic benefit for a limited period and not to influence the progression of the disease. In view of the different mechanisms of action and clinical profile of Cerebrolysin and Aricept, a combination therapy of both may provide synergistic treatment effects. The combination of a treatment targeting the neurotrophic axis (Cerebrolysin) with a treatment to improve cholinergic neurotransmission (Aricept) can arguably be expected to provide additional benefits to AD patients.</detailed_description>
