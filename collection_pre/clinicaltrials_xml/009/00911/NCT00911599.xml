	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate that blood ion levels (cobalt and chromium) are lower at one year in patients who receive a metal on polyethylene total hip as compared to CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip with BFH® technology. Secondary aims include the gathering of clinical data regarding survival and dislocation rates at two years post surgery, as well as the assessment of pain, physical function, radiographic and clinical outcome at the two year interval.</brief_summary>
