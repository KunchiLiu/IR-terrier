	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (as measured by the rate of recurrent symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism [VTE] (i.e., Pulmonary thromboembolism [PE] and Deep Vein Thrombosis [DVT])) and safety of GSK576428 as the initial treatment in subjects with acute symptomatic DVT in an open-label design.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of acute proximal DVT based on contrastenhanced Multi detectorrow CT (MDCT) (not more than 10 days after the onset of the symptoms of DVT) Age:20 years Gender: No restriction Hospitalization status: Subjects who are able to stay at the hospital at least during the initial treatment period Written informed consent from the subject him/herself or his/her legally acceptable representative. Written informed consent from the subject's legally acceptable representative must be obtained if the subject is incapable of giving consent Symptomatic PE Requirement for surgical thrombectomy, catheter intervention and thrombolytic therapy for the current DVT Subjects (for example, with freefloating thrombus in the femoral vein or ilium by MDCT at screening) for whom insertion of inferior vena cava filter is indicated or subjects in whom inferior vena cava filter is present Anticoagulant therapy for at least 24 hours to treat the current episode prior to entry into the study Active, clinically significant bleeding Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;10×10⁴/µL at screening) Concurrent conditions with bleeding risk (e.g., ulcer of the gastrointestinal tract, diverticulitis of the gastrointestinal tract, colitis, acute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension, or severe diabetes) or bleeding tendency Severe hepatic disorder Known hypersensitivity to heparin, lowmolecularweight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin Previous history of cerebral hemorrhage Brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery within 3 months prior to entry into this study Previous history of Heparininduced thrombocytopenia Patients for whom anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated or who cannot be taken off anticoagulant therapy due to coexistent condition (e.g. prosthetic heart valve implant) Severe renal disorder (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL [180 µmol/L] at screening) in a well hydrated subject QT interval prolonged (QT interval corrected by Bazett's formula [QTcB] ≥450 msec; for patients with bundle branch block QTcB ≥480 msec) at screening Documented hypersensitivity to contrast media Use of any contraindicated drug that cannot be combined with the injection of contrast medium [e.g., antihyperglycemics, such as biguanides (metformin hydrochloride, buformin hydrochloride)] Participation in any other therapeutic drug study or a clinical study within 6 months prior to entry into this study Previous participation in a study of GSK576428 [Fondaparinux Sodium; including the studies of Org31540/SR90107A (exproject code)] or previous exposure to the therapeutic dose of GSK576428 Drug or alcohol abuse Systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg Recent surgery within 3 days prior to entry into the study Life expectancy &lt;3 months Pregnant women, nursing mothers, women who may be pregnant, or women contemplating pregnancy during the study period Others whom the investigator or subinvestigator considers not eligible for the study</criteria>
