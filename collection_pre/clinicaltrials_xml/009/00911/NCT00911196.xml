	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive disease with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, new approaches to treat this type of cancer are needed with immunotherapy potentially being one of these. As a first step in the development of novel therapies, expression analysis of specific markers, including tumor antigens will be carried out, and the correlation of expression with disease variables and clinical outcome will be assessed. This will be done retrospectively using archived hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples.</brief_summary>
