	<brief_title>A Study of MM-111 in Patients With Advanced, Refractory Her2 Amplified, Heregulin Positive Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1: Patients with any solid tumor type may be enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MM-111.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced cancer that is: HER2 amplified (IHC 2+ or greater) based on archived tumor evaluation Heregulin positive based on a study required fresh biopsy sample performed at screening and confirmed by central laboratory Patients must have blocks of archived formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tumor tissue available for sectioning and immunohistochemical staining Patient's cancer must have recurred or progressed following standard therapy, have not responded to standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy exists. Patients must be &gt;= 18 years of age Patients or their legal representatives must be able to understand and sign an informed consent Patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable tumor(s) Patients should have ECOG Performance Score (PS) 0 or 1 Patients must have adequate bone marrow reserves as evidenced by: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/uL and Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/uL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Patients must have tumor tissue amenable to biopsy Patients must be willing to undergo biopsy prior to treatment to MM111 Patients for whom potentially curative antineoplastic therapy is available Patients who are pregnant or lactating Patients with an active infection or with an unexplained fever greater than 38.5 C during screening visits or on the first scheduled day of dosing. (At the discretion of the investigator, patients with tumor fever may be enrolled) Patients with untreated and/or symptomatic primary or metastatic CNS malignancies (patients with CNS metastases who have undergone surgery or radiotherapy, whose disease is stable, and who have been on a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to the first scheduled day of dosing will be eligible for the trial Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of MM111 or who have had hypersensitivity reactions to fully human monoclonal antibodies (patients with a history of hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, a humanized antibody, are not excluded) Patients with known HIV, hepatitis B or C (if patients have previously been treated for C and have undetectable viral loads, they can be considered eligible for the trial)</criteria>
