	<brief_title>Determining When Patients Hospitalized With Acute Heart Failure Can Be Safely Sent Home (The DECIDE Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A fundamental question faced by physicians treating acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is "When has treatment worked sufficiently for safe discharge, and who requires further treatment?" Patients with ADHF have a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines for emergency department (ED) and hospital disposition of patients with ADHF are based on limited empirical evidence. This creates clinical uncertainty regarding disposition leads to prolonged hospitalizations, higher costs and increased resource consumption. The specific aim of the study is to develop a prediction rule from readily available clinical data to help physicians identify ADHF patients eligible for safe and early discharge from the ED and hospital after treatment is initiated.</detailed_description>
