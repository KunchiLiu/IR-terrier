	<brief_summary>There is no clear standard of care for metastatic stomach or esophageal cancer in the United States. The purpose of this research study is to determine the differences between two regimens of chemotherapy; Arm A: PCA (Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab) and Arm B: TPCA (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab). Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Irinotecan are traditional chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body). Bevacizumab is believed to stop the formation of new blood vessels that carry nutrients to tumors. Both of the chemotherapy regimens (PCA and TPCA) have been studied in patients with esophageal and gastric cancer, and we are trying to determine if one regimen will keep your cancer from growing and improve how long you can live.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab (PCA) Versus Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab (TPCA) in Metastatic Esophageal and Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participants will be randomized into one of the two study groups: Arm A or Arm B. - For both Arm A and Arm B, the chemotherapy will be given in an outpatient setting, once a week for two weeks in a row, with a rest period for the third week. This three week period of time is called a cycle. - During week one Arm A (PCA) participants will receive bevacizumab, cisplatin, and irinotecan. Arm B (TPCA) participants will receive bevacizumab, docetaxel, cisplatin and irinotecan. - During week two, participants will return to the clinic to receive chemotherapy (both arms will receive the chemotherapy agents and not bevacizumab). Blood tests and vital signs will also be collected. - After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, participants will have CT scans done to see how their tumor is responding to the chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
