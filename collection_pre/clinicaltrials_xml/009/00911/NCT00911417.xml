	<brief_summary>The Jetstream System is a commercially available rotating, aspirating, expandable catheter designed to remove atherosclerotic plaque and blood clots in the lower limbs. The purpose of this study is to use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) during the interventional procedure to measure the amount of plaque and blood clots removed by the Jetstream System.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient is â‰¥ 18 years of age. The documented peripheral vascular disease is/are located in a superficial femoral, popliteal or tibial peroneal trunk arteries in the lower limb. The patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous intervention using the Jetstream G2 System in accordance with its labeled indications and instructions for use. The patient has been informed about the nature of the study and has provided informed consent. Patient has no distal runoff. Interventional treatment is intended for instent restenosis at the peripheral vascular site. Patient is pregnant or nursing a child. Intended interventional treatment includes planned laser, brachytherapy or atherectomy procedure other than the Jetstream G2 System. Patient has clinically significant abnormal ECG or blood test results or any other factor that would put the patient at increased risk if participating in the study.</criteria>
