	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Ultrasound energy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating up the tumor cells without affecting the surrounding tissue. Implant radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving ultrasound hyperthermia therapy after implant radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ultrasound hyperthermia therapy to see how well it works after implant radiation therapy in treating patients with Stage III/IV cancer of the cervix or prostate cancer with a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) after prior local therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of a Catheter-based Ultrasound Hyperthermia System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Approximately 2 hours after brachytherapy, patients undergo catheter-based ultrasound hyperthermia therapy over 60 minutes. Treatment with HDR brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy repeats within 1-3 weeks. Patients may then undergo 2 additional standard HDR brachytherapy sessions. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.</detailed_description>
