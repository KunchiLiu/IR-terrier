	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test safety and efficacy of different doses of thymosin alpha 1 (1.6 mg, 3.2 mg, and 6.4 mg) in combination with dacarbazine and with or without Interferon alpha in treating patients affected by stage IV melanoma. Primary end-point is Tumor Response evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary end-points are Overall Survival and Progression Free Survival. Ninety-five patients are allocated to each arm to test the hypothesis that P0 &lt;= 0.05 vs the alternative hypothesis that P1 &gt;= 0.15 (alpha = 5%, within-group statistical analysis beta = 95%).</brief_summary>
