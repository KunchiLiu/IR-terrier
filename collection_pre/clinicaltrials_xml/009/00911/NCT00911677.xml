	<brief_summary>Patients with the APOE-ε4 genotype are at increased risk of both vascular dementia and peripheral vascular disease. Patients undergoing major vascular surgery are at particularly high risk of delirium and other, more subtle, changes in cognitive function following surgery. The hypothesis of this trial is that the APOE-ε4 genotype is associated with both delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).</brief_summary>
