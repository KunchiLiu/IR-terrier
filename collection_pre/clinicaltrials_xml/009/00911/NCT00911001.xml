	<brief_summary>Patients that are on total knee/hip replacement initiate prophylaxis treatment on the hospital ground. Once they leave the hospital, as outpatients they continue with the treatment at least during two consecutive weeks. Patients will be instructed to follow treatment recommendations (either LMWH or oral treatment, at physician discretion) and to come back to the surgeon after that period. At that visit, the Treatment Satisfaction Questionaire with Medication (TSQM) test as well as the Moriski-Green Questionaire (measures compliance with medication) will be answer by the patient. TSQM is an self administered validated scale (validated also in spanish) that measures in a generic way the treatment satisfaction to a treatment. Morinski-Green test will be used to measure the compliance degree on medication.</brief_summary>
