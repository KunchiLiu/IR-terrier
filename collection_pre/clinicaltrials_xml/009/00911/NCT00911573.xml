	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of tigecycline versus clindamycin (including subjects treated with vancomycin) in pediatric subjects (aged 8 to 17 years) with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects 8 to 17 years old. Children with bone maturation less than 8 years old should be enrolled with caution due to potential risk of tooth discoloration. Have a diagnosis of a serious infection requiring hospitalization and administration of IV antibiotic therapy. complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) requiring significant surgical intervention or involving deeper soft tissue with the presence of at least one sign of systemic infection Subject with any concomitant illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and/or completion of the study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's response (e.g., life expectancy &lt; 30 days).</criteria>
