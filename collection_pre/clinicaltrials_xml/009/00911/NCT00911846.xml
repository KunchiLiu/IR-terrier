	<brief_summary>Main intention of this study is to find out whether there is a difference between the attitudes towards opioid- substitution of opioid dependent patients under substitution with methadone, buprenorphine or without substitution and their therapists</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Attitudes Towards Buprenorphine and Methadone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attitudes of patients and therapists can influence therapy success in both directions. Not much is known about patients' and their therapists' attitudes towards substitution medication. Our hypothesis is that the attitude towards buprenorphine is more positive than towards methadone even in patients taking methadone. Better knowledge about the influence of attitudes on treatment success could facilitate to adapt therapy to the patients' needs.</detailed_description>
