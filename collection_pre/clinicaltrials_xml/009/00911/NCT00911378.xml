	<brief_summary>This study is a comparison of two most commonly used modes of weaning and the outcomes in the two groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pressure Support Reduction Versus Spontaneous Breathing Trials in Weaning From Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ventilated for more than 24 hours are randomized into two groups - one group of patients undergo gradual reduction of pressure support and in the other, T tube trials are used for weaning. The outcomes are compared in the two groups.</detailed_description>
