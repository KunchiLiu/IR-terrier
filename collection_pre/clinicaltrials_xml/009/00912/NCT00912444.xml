	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in triple-negative or Her2 positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (TAC) or docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Treatment of Docetaxel, Anthracycline and Cyclophosphamide (TAC) Versus Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC) in Triple-Negative or Her2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women in China. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer has become a standard therapy. Results from neoadjuvant trials have shown that pathological complete response (pCR) is an independent predictor of outcome. Docetaxel was introduced into clinical practice in the early 1990s and has demonstrated good activity in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Both TC and TAC are effective regimens in the adjuvant setting. The most optimal regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment is however unknown. This is especially true in triple-negative or HER2 positive breast cancer. This study will evaluate the pCR rate of TAC and TC as neoadjuvant treatment for triple-negative or HER2 positive breast cancer.</detailed_description>
