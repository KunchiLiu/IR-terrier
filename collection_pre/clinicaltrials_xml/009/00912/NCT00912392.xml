	<brief_summary>Background: The effect of existing treatment modalities of extensive disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) is unsatisfactory. Progress of new strategies including more efficient therapy is wanted. Endostar® (Rh-endostatin Injection) may have anti-tumor activity by against vascular endothelial growth factor for initial treatment. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Endostar® combined with etoposide-carboplatin (EC) chemotherapy in patients with ED-SCLC seeking for more effective treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide-Carboplatin Alone or With Endostar for Extensive Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: In this randomized, open label, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, 120 patients are planned to be enrolled at random into 2 arms(1:1) from 10 centers between June 2009 and June 2011. The leader units are Shanghai Chest Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University. Main eligibility criteria are histological or cytological diagnosis of ED-SCLC, with an age of 18-75 years. All eligible patients receive etoposide-carboplatin (EC) alone or with endostar® for 4-6 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle). In arm1 patients receive endostar® 7.5mg/m2 on day 1 to day 14, etoposide 60 mg/m2 on day 1 to day 5 and carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1. In arm2 patients receive etoposide 60 mg/m2 on day 1 to day 5 and carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1. Primary endpoint: progress free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoint: progress free survival at 6 months, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), Response duration, time to progression(TTP) and quality of life (QOL).</detailed_description>
