	<brief_summary>This is a research study to determine if the concentration of local anesthetic through a catheter next to the nerves that go to the hip that is undergoing surgery, affects muscle strength and sense of touch experienced after surgery. This study is looking at the varying concentrations of local anesthetic placed through the catheter.</brief_summary>
