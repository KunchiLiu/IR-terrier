	<criteria>Subjects must: be existing soft contact lens wearers of the study control lenses require a distance visual correction in both eyes have a contact lens spherical distance requirement between 1.00 diopters (D) and 8.00D in both eyes have astigmatism less than or equal to 1.00D in both eyes be able to wear lenses available for this study be corrected to a visual acuity of 6/9 (20/30) or better in each eye have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease Subject are excluded for the following reasons: monovision corrected worn lenses extended wear in the last 3 months. require concurrent ocular medication grade 3 or 4 abnormalities grade 3 corneal staining in more than two regions anterior ocular surgery any other ocular surgery or injury within 8 weeks prior to study enrollment abnormal lachrymal secretions preexisting ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting corneal irregularities Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lens wear in past 12 weeks any systemic illness which would preclude contact lens wear diabetes infectious or immunosuppressive disease pregnancy or lactating, or planning pregnancy at time or enrollment participating in a concurrent clinical study or within last 60 days allergy to the standardized study care solution</criteria>
