	<brief_summary>Background: - Normal fetal growth is a critical component of a healthy pregnancy and the long-term health of the offspring. Pivotal to understanding the dynamics of human fetal growth and to defining normal and abnormal fetal growth is the development of standards for fetal growth. Objectives: - To establish a standard for normal fetal growth and size for gestational age in the U.S. population. - To create an individualized standard for fetal growth potential. - To improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation. Eligibility: - Healthy, low-risk pregnant women (both obese and nonobese) between the ages of 18 and 40 from each of the following four self-identified race/ethnicity backgrounds: African American, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic. Design: - Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy. - Each woman will receive six scheduled ultrasound exams, which will include the following tests: - Fetal biometry (biological statistics) at all visits. - Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies at selected gestational weeks. - Women will be asked to donate blood samples at enrollment and at follow-up visits at 16 22 weeks, 24 28 weeks, and 34 37 weeks of gestation. - After delivery, the newborn will be carefully measured to record birthweight, head circumference, and other body measurements. - Cord blood, plasma, and placenta samples will be collected from selected newborns. - Post-study evaluations: - Women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy will be asked to return for a follow-up visit 6 weeks after delivery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normal fetal growth is a critical component of a healthy pregnancy and the long-term health of the offspring. Pivotal to understanding the dynamics of human fetal growth and to defining normal and abnormal fetal growth is the development of standards for fetal anthropometric parameters measured longitudinally throughout gestation, which, in turn, can be used to develop interval velocity curves and customized for genetic and physiological factors. We propose to conduct a multi-center prospective observational study (1) to establish a standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age in the U.S. population; (2) to create an individualized standard for fetal growth potential; and (3) to improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation. This study will recruit 2,400 healthy, non-obese, low risk pregnant women from five clinical centers. Approximately 600 women will come from each of the following four self-identified racial ethnicity backgrounds: African American, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic. Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy. In addition, 600 obese women will also be recruited. Each woman will receive six scheduled ultrasound exams, which include fetal biometry at all visits and uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies at selected gestational weeks. After delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures will be carefully taken. Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts. The National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth will have important implications in clinical practice and research.</detailed_description>
