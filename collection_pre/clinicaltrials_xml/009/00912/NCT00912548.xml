	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare 5-year disease free survival rate (DFS rate) between the hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients who were added Goserelin to Tamoxifen for ovarian function suppression after neo-/adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy and the hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients who were treated with Tamoxifen.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To compare overall Survival(OS) between the patients added Goserelin(ZOLADEXTM) to Tamoxifen and the patients treated with Tamoxifen alone in premenopausal status - To compare 5-year disease free survival rate (DFS rate) between the patients who took tamoxifen only in postmenopause and the patients added Goserelin(ZOLADEXTM) to Tamoxifen for inducing ovarian function suppression in premenopause - To determine the tolerability and safety of Tamoxifen with or without concomitant Zoladex</detailed_description>
