	<brief_summary>The investigators' primary specific aims are to demonstrate that: 1. Pediatric patients with normal airways, undergoing elective surgical procedures, can be successfully intubated when deeply sedated, without the use of muscle relaxants using the Shikani Optical Stylet. 2. Shikani intubation of pediatric patients is equally effective in children that are deeply sedated or paralyzed as evidenced by a non-significant difference in: - Time to intubation (defined as no more than a 30 second time difference between the two groups); - Incidence of adverse events.</brief_summary>
