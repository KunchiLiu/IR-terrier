	<brief_summary>Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC0821 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study. It will be conducted using a two-stage design with the intention of determining the initial efficacy of Imprime PGG in combination with a monoclonal antibody (MAb; cetuximab) in the treatment of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). Both stages will be conducted in subjects with Stage IV CRC demonstrating the KRAS gene mutation. Subjects will dose until progression of disease or discontinuation from the study for other reasons; e.g., safety, non-compliance. Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled at three participating centers (17 into Stage 1 and 39 into Stage 2).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC0821 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study. It will be conducted using a two-stage design with the intention of determining the initial efficacy of Imprime PGG in combination with a monoclonal antibody (MAb; cetuximab) in the treatment of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). Both stages will be conducted in subjects with Stage IV CRC demonstrating the KRAS gene mutation. All subjects will receive Imprime PGG at 4 mg/kg and standard doses of cetuximab; Imprime PGG and cetuximab will be administered in 6-week cycles. Subjects will dose until progression of disease or discontinuation from the study for other reasons; e.g., safety, non-compliance. The initial cetuximab dose will be 400 mg/m2 on Cycle 1/Day1 and subsequent doses of cetuximab will be 250 mg/m2 weekly. Imprime PGG will be dosed weekly at 4 mg/kg. Tumor measurements and determination of tumor responses for this study will be performed according to RECIST. Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled at three participating centers (17 into Stage 1 and 39 into Stage 2). Final results will be determined from combined Stage 1 and Stage 2 data.</detailed_description>

Has adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine ≤ 2.5X the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference lab; 11. Has adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: 1. AST ≤ 3X ULN for the reference lab (≤ 5X ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases) 2. ALT ≤ 3X ULN for the reference lab (≤ 5X ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases) 3.

Has read, understood and signed the informed consent form (ICF) approved by the Independent Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC); and 13. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential or a fertile man, he/she must agree to use an effective form of contraception during the study and for 60 days following the last dose of study medication (an effective form of contraception is abstinence, a hormonal contraceptive, or a doublebarrier method). 1. Has a known hypersensitivity to cetuximab, murine proteins, or any component of cetuximab; 2. Has a known hypersensitivity to baker's yeast or has an active yeast infection; 3. Has had previous exposure to Betafectin® or Imprime PGG; 4. Has an active, uncontrolled infection; 5. Has known or suspected brain metastases; 6.

Has known HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, connective tissue disease, or other clinical diagnosis, ongoing or intercurrent illness that in the investigator's opinion should prevent participation; 8. If female, is pregnant or breastfeeding; 9. Is receiving concurrent standard and/or investigational anticancer therapy or has received such therapy within a period of 30 days prior to the first scheduled day of dosing (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no regulatoryauthorityapproved indication); or 10. Has previously received an organ or progenitor/stem cell transplant.</criteria>
