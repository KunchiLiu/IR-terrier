	<brief_summary>The incidence of PTSD post ICU varies from unit to unit, however a significant number of patients have been shown to develop this disorder. Many patients do not recall their stay in ICU properly and yet can clearly recall nightmares, hallucinations or paranoid delusions, which may be very frightening for the patient to recall at a later stage. As yet, no interventional studies have had an impact on the development of PTSD in this population of patients. However, a recent observational multi-centre study suggested that those patients receiving a diary of their time in ICU had lower levels of symptoms of PTSD than those who did not. These results need to be verified in the form of a randomized study.</brief_summary>
