	<brief_summary>Goal: To characterize the cellular events that occur in vivo after vaccination with an emulsion of GMCSF-in-adjuvant. Design: Open-label, single dose study in two stages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effects of Local Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) in Adjuvant Administration on Dendritic Cells in Skin of Melanoma Patients and in Sentinel Lymph Nodes: MEL38</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regimen: Each injection will be administered to patients with clinical stage I or II melanoma, who have had complete excision of a primary melanoma, but prior to wide excision with or without sentinel node biopsy as definitive surgical therapy. In Stage 1: Patients will be injected with a 1 ml emulsion containing GM-CSF in saline plus Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant, in skin adjacent to a melanoma biopsy scar. In Stage 2: Patients will be randomized to receive an injection of one of the following in skin adjacent to the melanoma biopsy scar: 1. 1 ml saline 2. GM-CSF in 1 ml saline 3. an emulsion of Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant and saline 4. an emulsion of GM-CSF in saline plus ml Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. All vaccines will be administered intradermally. After the injection, each patient will undergo wide excision of the melanoma site, with or without sentinel node biopsy, as clinically indicated.</detailed_description>

Patients with serious symptomatic active pulmonary disease, with pleural effusions, or with a history of pulmonary edema. Patients who have systemic autoimmune disease with visceral involvement. Patients with clinically apparent skin infection or other clinically evident inflammation involving the skin adjacent to the melanoma biopsy scar.</criteria>
