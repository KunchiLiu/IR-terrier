	<brief_summary>to evaluate whether bone marker can provide the valuable predictor of skeletal complications and whether regular assessing of NTX(N-telopeptide of type I collagen) and osteocalcin can be useful in advanced breast cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic acid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate the Relationship of Bone Remodeling Markers for Skeletal Complications in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid by measuring changes in bone turnover markers - the incidence of skeletal-related events - time to skeletal-related events - time to bone metastases progression - overall survival - the incidence of each adverse event including osteonecrosis</detailed_description>
