	<brief_title>A Trial of CM-AT in Children With Autism- Open Label Extension Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism is currently a significant cause of disability in the pediatric population. CM-AT is based upon the observation that many children with autism do not digest protein. CM-AT is a proprietary enzyme that is designed as a powder taken three times a day.
