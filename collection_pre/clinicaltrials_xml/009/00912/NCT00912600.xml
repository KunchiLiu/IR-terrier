	<brief_summary>Percentage of patients over 80 admitted in ICU varies greatly from one center to another. ICU admission criteria of older patients are scarcely described and benefit of ICU admission for those patients is uncertain. In this study, we prospectively studied old patients arriving to the emergency department of 15 French hospitals with conditions that potentially warrant ICU admission.The working hypothesis was that ICU admission was associated with a 20% decrease in six-month mortality.</brief_summary>
