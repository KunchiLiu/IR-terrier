	<brief_summary>Nearly all Parkinson's disease (PD) patients eventually develop abnormal and unwanted movements (dyskinesias; LID) caused by the gold standard treatment, Levodopa. The severity of these movements can range from subtle to extremely debilitating and may or may not interfere with normal activities such as putting on a coat or brushing ones teeth. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the validity and reliability of objectively measuring dyskinesia with a forceplate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of Forceplate Measured Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main outcome measure of this study are measurements taken every half hour during an inpatient study visit. These measurements include standing on a forceplate for 1 minute while performing a mental task such as reciting the alphabet backwards. During this forceplate stance, a rater will visually score your movements. All participants must be eligible for another Parkinson's disease study at Oregon Health and Science University.</detailed_description>
