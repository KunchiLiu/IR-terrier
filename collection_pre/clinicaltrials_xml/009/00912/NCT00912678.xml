	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation in the elderly is a challenge since patient's co-morbidity and the decreased injury threshold of older grafts may limit the benefits of transplantation in these patients. To compare favourable effects between low dose tacrolimus (LD-Tac) and mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) in this patient population the investigators conducted a one year prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. 90 kidney transplant recipients &gt; 65 years with cadaveric grafts (&gt; 65 years) from 5 centers were enrolled and received baseline immunosuppression with daclizumab induction (1 mg/kg) at day one and day 14, LD-Tac (trough level 5-8 Âµg/ml), MMF (1-2 g/d) and steroids. After three months, patients were centrally randomized either to MMF (1-2 g/d) and steroids (23 patients) or to LD-Tac and steroids. Follow-up visits were performed every 4 weeks up to one year. Protocol biopsies were performed after one year. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that the biopsy proven rejection rate in the MMF group is not significantly different compared to the LD-Tac group after one year. The investigators' secondary hypothesis is that graft function in the MMF group (reflected by the glomerular filtration rate and protocol biopsy result) is superior to the graft function in the LD-Tac group.</brief_summary>
