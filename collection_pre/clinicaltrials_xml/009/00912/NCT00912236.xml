	<brief_summary>This study will determine if the protective function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is impaired in obese patients and will help to enhance cardiovascular risk prediction. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) will be captured as a means of assessing early vascular changes associated with low HDL levels in obesity. A novel measurement for clinical correlation has also been introduced called carotid extra-medial thickness (cEMT) which will be compared to cIMT in this obese population.</brief_summary>
