	<brief_summary>Recently, Nanto et al. reported that cilostazol effectively prevented restenosis in a retrospective analysis of 121 femoropopliteal artery lesions in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) patients who had undergone PTA. In a prospective 3-year follow-up study in 127 patients with similar diseases, the patency rate was significantly higher in the cilostazol group than in the ticlopidine group. It was also found that cilostazol markedly inhibited restenosis during the first 1-year period following endovascular therapy when restenosis is most frequently observed. In addition, there have been sporadic reports that cilostazol was effective in preventing post-stenting restenosis in the coronary artery area. Based on these results, this multicenter study is going to be conducted to prospectively evaluate the usefulness of cilostazol in lower limb endovascular therapy.</brief_summary>
