	<brief_summary>Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) is a common medical emergency and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in addition to conventional medical treatment might be beneficial for patients with CPE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effect of adding continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to standard medical therapy (ST) on intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, partial arterial O2 tension (PaO2), intrapulmonary shunt, alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient, and cardiac output in patients admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) or cardiac care unit (CCU) with acute CPE with gas exchange abnormalities and to evaluate the impact of heart failure type on the outcome of different therapeutic schedules.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. CPE confirmed radiologically and/or clinically 2. Severe acute respiratory failure (partial arterial oxygen (PaO2)/Fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) less than 250) 3. Dyspnea of sudden onset with respiratory 4. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 180 mmHg 1. Immediate need for endotracheal intubation: Severe sensorial impairment Shock Ventricular arrhythmias, Lifethreatening hypoxia (SpO2 [oxygen saturation as indicated by pulse oximetry] less than 80% with oxygen) Acute myocardial infarction necessitating thrombolysis Cardiac or respiratory arrest 2. Severe chronic renal failure 3. Pneumothorax. 4. Contraindication of non invasive ventilation (NIV)</criteria>
