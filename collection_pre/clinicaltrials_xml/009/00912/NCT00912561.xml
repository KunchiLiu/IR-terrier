	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to study the improvement of cerebral hemodynamics in high risk stroke patients with impaired Cerebrovascular Reserve (CVR) due to high grade stenosis of the internal carotid (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) by Intense Aerobic Exercise (IAEx).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Intense Aerobic Exercise on the Cerebrovascular Reserve Capacity in Patients With Hemodynamically Relevant Intra- and Extracranial Stenoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective: Intense aerobic exercise (24/8 weeks) improves CVR &gt; 20% measured by Transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with hemodynamic relevant intra- or extracranial stenoses by enhanced cerebral arterio- and angiogenesis. Secondary objectives: Intense aerobic exercise (24/8 weeks) leads to: - an increase of Endothelial progenitor cell counts (EPCs) - qualitative and quantitative changes of endothelial markers and cytokines representing the inflammatory activity of atherosclerosis and neovascularisation - an improvement in cognitive performance and quality of life (QoL) - changes of the mean vessel size and of cerebral perfusion</detailed_description>
