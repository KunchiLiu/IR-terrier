	<brief_title>The Value of Traction in the Treatment of Cervical Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical traction is an intervention frequently recommended for the treatment of patients with neck pain. Systematic reviews have not endorsed the use of mechanical traction for patients with neck pain, however these reviews note the poor methodological quality of available research. Trials that have been performed have examined heterogeneous samples of patients with neck pain. It may be that cervical traction has not shown to be effective because only a specific subgroup may benefit from it. Most experts believe that traction is most beneficial for individuals with neck pain extending into the upper extremity who have signs of nerve root compression. Randomized clinical trials examining the effectiveness of traction for patients with these specific characteristics have not been performed. Preliminary studies support the hypothesis that there exists a specific subgroup of patients with neck pain likely to benefit from traction The current study will address 3 important questions: 1. Will the existence of a more specific subgroup of patients who benefit from traction along with a standard exercise program be validated in a second sample of patients? 2. Is cervical traction a critical component of the treatment necessary to maximize outcomes for patients in this subgroup? 3. Do two commonly used traction protocols differ in their effectiveness for patients in this subgroup? (Specifically, we study will compare supine mechanical traction to over-the-door traction.)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Primary complaint of neck pain with symptoms (pain and/or numbness) extending distal to the acromioclavicular joint or caudal to the superior border of the scapula (may be unilateral or bilateral). 2. Age between 1870 years old 3. Neck Disability Score score &gt;10 points 1. Red flags indicative of a serious or nonmusculoskeletal condition (i.e. tumor, fracture, metabolic diseases, RA, osteoporosis, prolonged history of steroid use, etc.) 2. Diagnosis of cervical spinal stenosis based on CT or MRI imaging 3. Evidence of cervical myelopathy or central nervous system involvement, (e.g., hyperreflexia, intrinsic muscle wasting of the hands, unsteadiness during gait, nystagmus, loss of visual acuity, impaired sensation of the face, altered taste, presence of pathologic reflexes (i.e. positive Hoffman's or Babinski reflex). 4. Prior surgery to the neck or thoracic spine 5. Inability to comply with treatment and followup schedule</criteria>
