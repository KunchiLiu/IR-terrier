	<brief_title>Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) With Conventional CPAP for Extubation in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There have been no published randomized trials comparing extubation failure rates of Bubble CPAP with conventional ventilator derived CPAP. Infants of gestation &lt;32 weeks and of birth weight less than 1500 grams considered by the treating team to be ready for the initial extubation within first week of life were screened for enrolment. All eligible neonates were randomly allocated to bubble CPAP or conventional CPAP.The purpose of this study is to compare whether infants on Bubble CPAP had more chances of successful extubation as compared to infants put on Conventional CPAP.</detailed_description>
