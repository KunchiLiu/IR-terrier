	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy (CT), such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with or without panitumumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying chemotherapy and radiation therapy to see how well they work when given with or without panitumumab in treating patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Panitumumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the mediastinal nodal clearance after completion of induction chemoradiotherapy with or without panitumumab in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Assess overall survival of these patients. - Evaluate patterns of first failure in these patients. - Determine the acute and late adverse events associated with these regimens. - Assess surgical morbidities in patients with resectable disease at reassessment. - Determine the correlation between pre- and post-treatment biomarkers (including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ras mutation status) and outcomes (mediastinal nodal clearance and overall survival). - Evaluate the prognostic value of plasma osteopontin and microRNA for overall survival. - Assess the ability of FDG-PET/CT scan re-staging to predict outcome. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive induction therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Beginning approximately 6-12 weeks later, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21. - Arm II: Patients receive induction therapy comprising panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo IMRT or 3D-CRT once daily on days 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Beginning approximately 6-12 weeks later, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21. - In both arms, patients with resectable disease and no disease progression may proceed to surgery (thoracotomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy) approximately 4-6 weeks after completion of induction therapy. After surgery, patients proceed to consolidation therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
