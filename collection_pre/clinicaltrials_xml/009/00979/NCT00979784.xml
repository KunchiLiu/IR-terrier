	<brief_title>Better Weight-Better Sleep (BWBS) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To explore the feasibility of integrating sleep management interventions with dietary and exercise interventions for obesity in a 12-week randomized trial. Methods: We randomized 49 overweight or obese adult patients either to a better weight (BW) cognitive behavioral intervention, or to a combination of the BW intervention and a better sleep intervention, better weight-better sleep (BWBS). Results: The BWBS group lost weight faster (P=.04), and coping self-efficacy accelerated (P=.01). Conclusions: These preliminary results merit replication in a larger primary care-based trial with a longer continuous intervention and followup period. Key words: obesity, sleep, weight loss, primary care, health behavior E Logue et al. Am J Health Behav. 2012;36(3):319-334 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.36.3.4</detailed_description>
