	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of biweekly docetaxel and bevacizumab in the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer by using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST criteria) and NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC-AE) version 3. In addition several biochemical makers are tested as possible predictive factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biweekly Avastin and Docetaxel as the First Line Treatment for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with histologically or cytologically proven measurable or nonmeasurable metastatic breast cancer are treated with a combination of biweekly docetaxel and bevacizumab as the first line treatment in multicenter phase II trial. The outcome measures would be PFS, Response rate (RECIST), duration of response, safety (NCI CTC-AE version 3) and survival. In addition several biochemical makers are tested as possible predictive factors. Treatment would be continued until PD, patient's refusal or treatment discontinuation due to side-effects or patients death. In responding patients bevacizumab would be continued either alone or in hormone receptor positive patients combined with hormone treatment until progression.</detailed_description>
