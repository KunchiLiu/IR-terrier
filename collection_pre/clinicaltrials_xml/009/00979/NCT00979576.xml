	<brief_summary>The objectives of this trial are to estimate the following in Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC of stage IIIB/IV or with recurrence after failure of first-line chemotherapy. Phase I part The objective of the phase I part is to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BIBF 1120 at a dose level up to twice daily 200 mg with standard dose of pemetrexed (500 mg/m^2) and to determine the Recommended Dose (RD) for the phase II part. Phase II, to investigate the efficacy and safety of BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed (500 mg/m^2) as compared to pemetrexed (500 mg/m^2) + placebo</brief_summary>
