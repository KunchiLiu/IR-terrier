	<brief_summary>This project's focus is twofoldâ€”to change the culture of an employment training program for adolescents and young adults (Youth Opportunities, or "YO") to more fully address the many mental health issues faced by its participants and to expand and improve the quantity and quality of mental health services for YO members. Four project components have been carefully selected to address the mental health issues of YO members: (1) Mental health education/training for YO staff and peer leaders, (2) Mental health education activities for YO members, (3) mental health screening on all newly enrolling YO members, and (4) comprehensive mental health services for YO members. These project components will be implemented at the HEBCAC YO Program (subsequently referred to as "Eastside" YO), with the Westside YO Program initially participating as a control site. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Adolescent Health, led by Dr. Darius Tandon of the Department of Pediatrics, will conduct the research examining the effectiveness of these mental health services and supports. There are four project objectives. First, the proposed activities will increase YO members' knowledge of mental health resources and decrease stigma associated with seeking mental health services. Second, the investigators will see an increase in YO members' receipt of needed mental health services. Third, the investigators will see improvement in YO members' mental health. Fourth, as a result of their improved mental health, YO members will more actively engage in YO program activities and achieve more key program milestones (e.g., GED completion). These objectives are sequential, with later objectives predicated on the achievement of earlier ones.</brief_summary>
