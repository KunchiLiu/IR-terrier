	<brief_summary>The investigators are performing a genetic study of patients with multiple hernias (at least 3 primary hernias) versus a healthy control group. This genetic information is compared with circulating and subcutaneously biomarkers such as matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP's). The hypothesis is that patients with multiple hernias have different expression of specific genes compared to the healthy control group.</brief_summary>
