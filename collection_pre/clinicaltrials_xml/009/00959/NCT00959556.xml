	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of blood from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood samples in patients with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
