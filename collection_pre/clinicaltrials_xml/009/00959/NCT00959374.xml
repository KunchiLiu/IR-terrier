	<brief_title>Evaluation of Dermal Closure With an Absorbable Barbed Suture as Compared to a Conventional Absorbable Suture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the greater common challenges of a surgical procedure is to effectively and efficiently close wounds across various levels of muscle, fat, fascia and/or skin. Surgical sutures continue to be the material of choice for wound closure. However, complications of sutures are those associated with tying knots to secure the suture. Examples of associated suture complications, although not comprehensive, include knot breakage and slippage, suture extrusion or spitting, infection, ischemia and scarring, reduced wound strength and inflammation and dehiscence. Both interrupted and continuous suture patterns require knots for suture line security when conventional suture constructs are used. Barbed sutures are designed to eliminate the need for tying knots during closure, thus ameliorating the detrimental aspects of knots.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject must be 18 years of age or older. Subject must be in good overall health. Subject must be scheduled for individual or combined abdominoplasty, reduction mammaplasty, or mastopexy, other than concentric mastopexy, crescent mastopexy, or mastopexy with implants. Subject must be willing to participate in the study, comply with study requirements, followup schedule, and give written informed consent. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Subject has active infectious collagen diseases (i.e. scleroderma) or any other condition that would interfere with wound healing. Subject has significant anatomic asymmetry that creates markedly different wound tension and/or geometry between the right and left side. Subject is allergic to the test suture made of glycolide and trimethylene carbonate or the control suture made of glycolide and epsiloncaprolactone. Subject has a BMI ≥ 40. Subject has diabetes requiring medication for glycemic control. Subject has a fever (temperature &gt; 38ºC), active skin infection or systemic infection at the time of surgery. Subject underwent chemotherapy or radiation within the last 6 months. Subject has a history of keloid or hypertrophic scar formation or other dermatologic conditions known to impair wound healing. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse within 6 months prior to screening. Subject has a history of immunosuppressive drug use, including steroids, within the last 6 months. Subject has had a documented breast imaging finding or physical breast exam finding requiring further evaluation prior to elective surgery. Subject has not had a mammogram within the last 12 months, for female patients ≥ 40 years of age scheduled for mastopexy or reduction mammaplasty. Subject is taking part in another clinical study which directly relates to this study. If, however, the subject is taking part in a nonrelated study, the investigator should contact the Study Manager for advice. The investigator determines that the subject should not be included in the study for reasons not already specified.</criteria>
