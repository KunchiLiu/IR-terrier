	<brief_title>The Registry Evaluating Functional Outcomes of Resynchronization Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will prospectively enroll all consecutive patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and ICD with biventricular pacemaker (CRT-D) implantation for heart failure from in-patient and out-patient setting. Primary objective: Compare the psychosocial function and quality of life of ICD patients to Patients receiving CRT-D therapy. Secondary outcome objectives: 1)Determine and compare the change in LVED (left ventricular end distolic) dimension and LVESV (left ventricular end systolic volume)from baseline to 9 month follow up in CRT and ICD patient.2)Determine and compare the change in NYHA (New York Heart Association) classification, KCCQ, optimisim and pessimism, degree of stress, and social support from baseline to 9 month follow up in CRT and ICD patients. Florida Patient Acceptance Survey and Florida Shock Anxiety Scale will be determined and compared at 3 monthe and 9 months.3)Determine and compare Clinical composite score(Packer M 2002)in patient groups where: Worsened-patient dies, improved, unchanged. Inclusion Criteria: Patient referred for device therapy (ICD or CRT-D) for chronic congestive heart failure who are willing and able to give informed consent and participate in follow-up calls. Duration of patient follow up will be 9 months. Statistical Mehtodology: Univariate, Multivariatae, Kaplan-Meier analysis</detailed_description>
