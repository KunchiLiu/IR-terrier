	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced solid tumors will receive investigational study drug ARRY-438162 (MEK162). This study has 3 parts. In the first part, patients with advanced solid tumors will receive increasing doses of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose of the study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 30 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1. (Active, not recruiting) In the second part of the study, patients with advanced or metastatic biliary cancer will receive the best dose of study drug determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 25 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2. (Active, not recruiting) In the third part of the study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) will receive the best dose of the study drug determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 25 patients with KRAS mutation (Active, not recruiting) and 15 patients with BRAF mutation (Active, not recruiting) from the US will be enrolled in Part 3.</brief_summary>

Prior treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Treatment with prior chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies or other protein or peptide therapeutics within 21 days of the first dose of study drug. Treatment with a small molecule targeted agent or anticancer hormonal therapy within 14 days of the first dose of study drug. Treatment with prior radiotherapy within 28 days of initiating study drug (if the radiation portal covered â‰¤ 10% of the bone marrow reserve, the patient may be enrolled irrespective of the end date of radiotherapy). Major surgery within 4 weeks or minor surgery within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
