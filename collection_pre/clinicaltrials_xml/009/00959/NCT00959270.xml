	<brief_title>Pennington Center Longitudinal Study (PCLS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PCLS represents an effort to utilize the data collected over the last twenty years during the clinical research studies conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. A cohort will be developed and used for cross-sectional analyses, as well as followed prospectively for the development of a variety of health-related outcomes. Several data sources from the PBRC clinical database will be used to establish the PCLS database, including screening, archive and study-specific data. The only protocol specific to the PCLS study is the collection of blood sample for risk factor determination and storage in the PBRC archive bank, only to be invoked in cases where studies do not include a blood draw as part of their protocol.</detailed_description>
