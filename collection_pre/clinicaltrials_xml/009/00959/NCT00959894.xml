	<brief_summary>The main study is a single arm, open-label, prospective study to assess antiretroviral activity and tolerability of etravirine (TMC-125) 400 mg once daily, given with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine, in treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected men and women. There are also a genital secretions pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study and a metabolic sub-study. The purpose of the genital secretions PK sub-study is to gain information about drug levels and HIV-1 RNA in genital secretions when subjects are taking etravirine. The purpose of the metabolic sub-study is to learn about the effects of etravirine on body composition, as well as lipid and glucose levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Once Daily Etravirine in Treatment-Naive Adults With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants: There will be approximately 80 HIV-1-infected men and women aged 18 years or older who have taken less than or equal to 10 days of prior antiretroviral therapy and have never taken etravirine, dapivirine (TMC120), or rilpivirine (TMC 278) in the main study. There will be approximately 40 subjects who enroll in the main study that will be in the metabolic sub-study and approximately 20 subjects (10 pre-menopausal women and 10 men) who enroll in the main study that will be in the genital secretions PK sub-study. Procedures (methods): For the main study subjects will take etravirine 400 mg once daily orally with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) one tablet once daily. For the genital secretions PK sub-study, genital secretion samples will be self-collected throughout the study except for the week 4 study visit where women will have the cervicovaginal sample at time 0 and at 24 hours collected by study staff. For the metabolic sub-study, waist measurements and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be performed at entry, week 24, and week 96, and 2-3 teaspoons of blood to check lipids, insulin, and glucose will be taken at entry and weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection as documented by any licensed ELISA test and confirmed by Western Blot or other confirmatory test at any time prior to study entry. Acceptable alternative confirmatory tests are plasma HIV1 RNA, HIV1 culture, HIV1 antigen, or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA. Alternatively, if an HIVantibody test result is not available, two HIV1 RNA values &gt;2000 copies/mL, drawn at least 24 hours apart, performed by any laboratory that has clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA) certification, or its equivalent, may be used to document infection. Age 18 years or older. Able to provide informed consent. In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study medication and procedures. Plasma HIV1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL as measured by any FDAapproved test for quantifying HIV1 RNA within 90 days prior to study entry. Less than or equal to 10 days of cumulative exposure to antiretroviral therapy. For all women of reproductive potential, a negative urine or serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test performed within 48 hours prior to study entry. All study volunteers, both male and female, must agree not to participate in a conception process (i.e., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) while receiving study medications and for 6 weeks after stopping study medications. If participating in sexual activity that could lead to conception, study volunteers must agree to use at least one method of reliable contraception which must be a barrier method (i.e., a condom without spermicide, a diaphragm, or cervical cap) throughout the study and for 6 weeks thereafter. NOTE: Acceptable documentation of lack of reproductive potential for a woman is selfreported history of being postmenopausal for at least 24 months, or having had surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or of male partner's azoospermia. Acceptable documentation for a man is selfreported history of azoospermia. Hemoglobin ≥ 7.5 g/dL within 45 days prior to study entry. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mm³ within 45 days prior to study entry. Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm³ within 45 days prior to study entry. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3X upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin ≤ 2.5 ULN within 45 days prior to study entry. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 59 as calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation within 45 days prior to study entry. Prior receipt of etravirine, dapivirine, or rilpivirine (Edurant), or Complera. Evidence of any of the resistanceassociated mutations listed below on genotype testing performed within 90 days of study entry. Any pending resistance testing ordered prior to study entry must be available for review by the investigator prior to enrollment. Major resistance mutations include: 1. Any of the following nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations: V90I, A98G, L100I, K101E/H/P/Q, K103H/S/T, V106A/I/M, V108I, E138A/G/K/Q, V179D/E/F/G/I/T, Y181C/I/V, Y188C/H/L, V189I, G190A/C/E/Q/S, H221Y, P225H, F227C/L, M230I/L, P236L, K238N/T, K103N. 2. Any of the following NRTI mutations: M184V/I, K70E/R, K65R, M41L, 69 insert, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E, L74V. Pregnancy Breastfeeding Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would be likely to interfere with ability to take the study medications appropriately and comply with the study protocol. Use of any systemic antineoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment, systemic corticosteroids, investigational vaccines, interleukins, interferons, growth factors, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 30 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Routine standard of care, including hepatitis B, influenza, pneumococcus, and tetanus vaccines are permitted. Current active illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until the individual completes therapy or, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically stable on therapy for at least 7 days prior to study entry. Life expectancy of less than 6 months. Acute viral hepatitis. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to components of the study drugs or their formulations. Use of any medications that are prohibited during the study period (see Section 8.1 of the protocol Prohibited Medications). Refusal by an individual who is taking antidepressant medications to allow the investigator or Primary HIV Care provider to communicate with his/her psychiatrist/Mental Health clinician regarding the initiation of study medications in those cases where coadministration of study drugs may alter antidepressant drug levels.</criteria>
