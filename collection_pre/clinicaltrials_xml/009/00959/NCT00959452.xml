	<brief_summary>Research has shown that cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in treating hypochondria. However, no studies have examined the long term effect. The investigators have followed 56 patients treated for hypochondria between 1997 and 2001 and the investigators are now doing a 10 year follow-up (Part I). In another part of the study (Part II) the investigators compare the effect of 16 sessions vs. 5 sessions, with a follow-up period of at least 2 years. The investigators hypothesis is that the initial 1 year improvement will be sustained and that 5 sessions will yield the same results as 16 sessions.</brief_summary>
