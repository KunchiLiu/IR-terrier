	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at urine samples from women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Urine Samples From Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Enrolled on Clinical Trial UNMC-08105</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To learn the effects of selected agents (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) on the profile of estrogen metabolites, glutathione conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts in urine from women with breast cancer. OUTLINE: Previously collected urine samples are analyzed for 40 estrogen metabolites, conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Patient information (e.g., race, body mass index, age at menarche, menopausal status, age at menopause if applicable, smoking history, alcohol consumption) is collected through medical record review.</detailed_description>
