	<brief_summary>This is a research study in 2 parts assessing the following parameters of the combination of the study drug called bosutinib, and a drug called capecitabine: the safety, how well the subject's body handles the study drug, and preliminary anti-tumor activity as treatment for different types of cancers in part 1, and breast cancer only in part 2. In part 1, subjects will receive bosutinib and capecitabine daily at different dose levels of each drug in order to determine the highest tolerated dose of the combination study treatment. In part 2, subjects will receive bosutinib and capecitabine at this highest tolerated dose to see how well the study treatment works to treat breast cancer. In addition, genetic research testing (research analyses involving genes and gene products) will be performed on biological samples from subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Bosutinib With Capecitabine In Solid Tumors And Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was prematurely discontinued following Part 1 evaluation, when the sponsor concluded that further translational biomarker analyses were needed to better define the breast tumor biomarkers that predict sensitivity to Src family kinase inhibitors. Thus the Sponsor made a determination to stop the study after Part 1 as communicated to investigators on 02Dec2010 . No subjects were enrolled into Part 2 of this study. The study was not terminated due to safety reasons.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part 1: Ages eligible for study: 18 years or older. Male and female. Confirmed pathologic diagnosis of advanced breast cancer or pancreatic cancer or colorectal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma or glioblastoma not curable with available therapies, for whom bosutinib plus capecitabine is a reasonable treatment option. Part 2: Ages eligible for study: 18 years or older. Female. Confirmed pathologic diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, or locoregional recurrent breast cancer that is not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. Documented ER+ and/or PgR+/erbB2 or ER/PgR/erbB2 tumor based upon recently analyzed biopsy. Part 1: Prior bosutinib, or any other prior Src inhibitor. Prior chemotherapy with capecitabine or 5FU for the treatment of metastatic disease is allowed unless patient stopped therapy for toxicity. Part 2: Prior bosutinib, or any other prior Src inhibitor prior chemotherapy with capecitabine or 5FU for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy with capecitabine or 5FU for adjuvant chemotherapy within the past 12 months. erbB2+ breast cancer.</criteria>
