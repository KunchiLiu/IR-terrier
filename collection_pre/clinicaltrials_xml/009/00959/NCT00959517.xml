	<brief_title>Trial of Artesunate Combination Therapy in Pakistan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study of the efficacy of chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone and in combination with primaquine or artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Arms: 1. CQ 2. CQ+primaquine 3. CQ+ artesunate 4. SP 5. SP+primaquine 6. SP+artesunate Patients were allocated to treatment groups using a pseudo-randomised table split by age and sex. Primary outcomes: - Clinical and parasitological cure/treatment failure by day 28. Secondary outcomes: - time to resolution of fever - time to clearance of trophozoites - time to clearance of gametocytes - gametocyte carriage on or after day 7 after treatment All clinical assessments and slide readings were carried out by staff blind to treatment arm. Slides were double read.</detailed_description>
