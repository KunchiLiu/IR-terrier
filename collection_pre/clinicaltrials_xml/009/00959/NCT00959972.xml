	<brief_title>Varenicline Versus Transdermal Nicotine Patch for Smoking Cessation in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quitting smoking is the single most effective intervention or treatment to reduce death rates in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who smoke. At the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (Ottawa, Canada), an institutional program is in place to ensure that staff consistently identify and document tobacco use status and treatment is offered to every smoker admitted to the Institute. Currently, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the principal medication used in the program. Recently, a new medication, varenicline, was approved for smoking cessation in Canada. Varenicline appears be the most effective medication for cessation currently available. To date, most published studies of varenicline have been funded by the manufacturer and there are no published studies reporting how well it works in smokers hospitalized with heart disease. This study involves sixty current smokers hospitalized at the UOHI for CHD. Consenting smokers will be randomly assigned to receive varenicline for 12 weeks or transdermal NRT for 12 weeks. Participants will also complete a two-page questionnaire inquiring about smoking history and previous attempts to quit, level of nicotine dependence, symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and self-efficacy with respect to quitting smoking. All participants will receive identical in-hospital counseling, self-help materials and follow-up support. The nurse specialists will also contact the participants by phone 3, 14, 30 and 50 days post-hospital discharge to check the patient's smoking status, assess the risk of relapse, and identify any adverse events that have occurred. The study will follow up with participants at 12 and 26 weeks post randomization asking about their smoking status (biochemically confirmed with a carbon monoxide monitor), adherence to prescribed medication, self-efficacy with respect to quitting smoking, nicotine withdrawal and smoking cessation resources used post-discharge.</detailed_description>
