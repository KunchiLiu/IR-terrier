	<brief_summary>Over the last 30 years, induction chemotherapy (IC) has become important for the management of patients with locally advanced HNSCC (LAHNSCC), particularly since the introduction of taxanes. The results reported in the TAX 323 and TAX 324 trials indicate that the TPF regimen (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) improves overall survival comparing with the PF regimen (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil), and the TPF regimen is globally the most accepted induction regimen for the treatment of LAHNSCC. However, the TPF regimen has been associated with high toxicity rates, and patients frequently decline cisplatin during concurrent radiotherapy and require the use of infusion pumps and a central venous catheter. Extensive efforts are ongoing to identify alternative schemes that are less toxic than the TPF regimen but are as effective for LAHNSCC and safely allow the use of definitive concurrent treatment based on cisplatin and radiotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the safety, feasibility and response rates of concurrent therapy (cisplatin and radiotherapy) after three cycles of an IC regimen based on the combination of cisplatin plus paclitaxel without 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (thereby avoiding infusion pumps and a central venous catheter) in LAHNSCC patients with a high tumor burden. The patients were stratified by tumor subsite (oropharynx and hypopharynx/larynx) and by tumor resectable status (resectable or irresectable advanced squamous cell).</detailed_description>
