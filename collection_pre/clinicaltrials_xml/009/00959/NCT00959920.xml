	<brief_summary>Urinary catheterization is a common practice during labor following placement of an epidural for pain control, as this form of anesthesia is known to inhibit normal bladder emptying. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinicians in selection of an indwelling catheter versus intermittent straight catheterization during the course of labor. The goal of this study is to compare two clinically-relevant bladder drainage techniques. This is a randomized controlled trial with a single primary outcome of time to delivery. The results will inform clinical decisions about method of catheterization during labor.</brief_summary>
