	<brief_summary>The randomized comparison of two strategies in coronary revascularization: bypass surgery without the use of a heart lung machine and coronary stenting procedure. The comparison comprised the occurrence of cardiac adverse events after the procedure. In addition, costs, cognitive outcomes and angiography were assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Comparison of Stenting Versus Off-pump Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass surgery with use of the heart lung machine (on-pump surgery), is associated with the risk of peri-operative complications such as death, stroke, myocardial infarction, neurocognitive decline, and extended hospitalization. Bypass surgery on the beating heart without the use of the heart lung machine (off-pump surgery) has been reintroduced in clinical practice in order to reduce these complications. The Octopus cardiac wall stabilizer, developed at the UMC Utrecht, facilitates the safe construction of the grafts during the off-pump procedure. The expected advantages of off-pump surgery e.g. less-invasiveness, complete arterial revascularization, faster recovery and lower costs were the basis for the Octostent trial. We hypothesized that the off-pump surgical technique might offer an alternative for angioplasty with bare-metal stent-implantation. The current study was designed as a randomized controlled multicenter trial comparing two strategies.</detailed_description>
