	<brief_summary>Part 1 of this trial will assess the safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous (SC) golimumab administered by autoinjector once monthly, when combined with different disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) regimens used in daily rheumatology practice. Subsequently, Part 2 will study if a strategy of intravenous (IV) golimumab to induce remission followed by SC golimumab to retain remission is superior to continuing a SC regimen.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants who had a good or moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response but not achieve remission at the end of Part 1 were invited to participate in Part 2 and were randomized to either intravenous golimumab (IV GLM) + subcutaneous golimumab (SC GLM) or SC GLM alone.</detailed_description>

Active disease despite DMARD treatment Subject must be taking at least one of the allowed DMARDs, and must be able to continue with it during the trial. Eligibility for anti tumor necrosis factor (TNF) use according to the following criteria: Participant must have failed conventional treatment according to the investigator's opinion OR local guidelines. Local guidelines regarding safety screening of anti TNF candidates (ie, tuberculosis [TB] screening and other safety screening such as vaccination, if applicable) must be met. Chest Xray and either a PPD skin test or QuantiFERONÂ®TB Gold test are also required. Anamnesis and physical examination must make the participant eligible for anti TNF use and trial participation according to the investigator's judgment. For Part 2: Participant must have completed Part 1 of this trial. Participant must have: good or moderate response to SC golimumab at the end of Month 6 compared to Baseline, AND. no DAS28 ESR remission. Both the investigator and the subject must agree to switch the participant's treatment to IV administration as may be required in Part 2 of this trial. The investigator must judge that no safety events (eg, serious adverse events [SAEs], serious infections, marked injectionsite reactions or intolerance to drug) have occurred that could reoccur or aggravate with increased drug exposure. History of biologic drug use for RA. Evidence of active TB. or latent TB that is untreated. Moderate to severe heart failure Certain inflammatory rheumatic disease other than RA or certain systemic inflammatory condition Allergy to latex</criteria>
