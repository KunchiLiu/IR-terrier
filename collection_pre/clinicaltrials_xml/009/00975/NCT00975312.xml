	<brief_summary>Background - Lentigines are usually the first sign of photoaging and may produce a significant impact on patients' quality of life. - There is no a treatment of choice for this condition. - Solar lentigines and melasma share similar physiopathologic characteristics. - The triple combination (TC) cream (hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05%, and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%) has been effective and safe for the treatment of melasma and other hyperpigmented lesions. Hypothesis * The TC cream will be effective and safe for the treatment of solar lentigines on the back of the hands. Patients and methods - 22 patients with solar lentigines were selected and their right hand or left hand were selected at random to be treated with either TC cream or tretinoin 0.05% cream once daily for up 12 weeks. - Patients were instructed to apply both creams on the whole back of the hand and not only in the lentigines, and to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 50+, UVA-PF 28) daily in both hands. - Clinical assessments of Target Lesion Pigmentation, Physician's Global Assessment of Improvement and a Subject's Self-Assessment questionnaire were collected for data analysis at weeks 4, 8, and 12 after starting the treatment and 3 month post-treatment. - Statistical methods: The ordinally scaled efficacy measures underwent rank transformation and were analyzed by analysis of variance to test the null hypothesis of no differences among treatments. We performed Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests and the XLSTAT 2009 software was used.</brief_summary>
