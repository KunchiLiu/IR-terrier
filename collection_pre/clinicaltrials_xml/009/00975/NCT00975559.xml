	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure how different people respond to mental stress. The investigators will measure if there are differences in cardiovascular responses to mental stress among different groups of subjects. In one part of the study the investigators will compare the cardiovascular responses to mental stress between healthy women and healthy men. In another part of the study, the investigators will compare the cardiovascular responses to mental stress between women with apical ballooning syndrome and healthy post-menopausal women. The investigators hypothesize that healthy men will have an increased vascular response to and decreased endothelial function in response to to mental stress, compared to health women. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that women with apical ballooning syndrome will have an increased vascular response to and decreased endothelial function in response to mental stress.</brief_summary>
