	<brief_summary>- Type: Bioequivalence study in male healthy volunteers, therapeutical indication (erectile disfunction) not studied - Products, dosage, and route of administration: - Test 1: Yohimbin "Spiegel"® (Desma GmbH, Germany), tablet containing 5 mg yohimbine hydrochloride, oral administration - Reference: Yocon-Glenwood® (Glenwood GmbH, Germany), tablet containing 5 mg yohimbine hydrochloride, oral administration - Duration of treatment: 2 single-dose administrations of 5 mg yohimbine hydrochloride each under fasting conditions separated by a wash-out period of at least one week i.e. 6 treatment free days between all administrations</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Comparing Two Test Products With One Reference Product, All Containing 5 mg Yohimbine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study objectives Primary Objectives: - Characterisation of relative bioavailability of Test 1 in comparison to Reference after single dose administration under fasting conditions - Assessment of bioequivalence of Test 1 vs. Reference after single dose administration under fasting conditions, determined by use of area under the concentration time curve AUC0-tlast and maximal concentration Cmax obtained for yohimbine Secondary Objective: - Descriptive characterisation of safety and tolerability of the investigational products in the study population - Descriptive characterisation of blood pressure and pulse rate around Cmax of the investigational products in the study population Analytical methodology: Yohimbine in plasma samples will be analysed by use of a validated HPLC-MS/MS; intended LLOQ for yohimbine is 0.5 ng/ml</detailed_description>
