	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Existing daily soft lens wearer. Require a distance visual correction in both eyes. Have a contact lens spherical distance refraction between 1.00D and 6.00D. Have refractive astigmatism less than or equal to 1.00D in both eyes. Achieve 20/30 or better corrected distance acuity. Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. Requires presbyopic correction. Requires ocular medications. Grade 3 or 4 ocular abnormalities. Grade 3 corneal staining in more than one region. Has had refractive surgery. Any other injury or ocular surgery within 8 weeks prior to study enrollment. Has abnormal lacrimal secretions. Preexisting ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting. Has keratoconus or other corneal irregularity. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), Hybrid or Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) wear in the previous 8 weeks. Wears habitual contact lenses that are toric, multifocal or worn extended wear. Any systemic illness which would contraindicate lens wear or the medical treatment of would affect vision or successful lens wear. Diabetic. Infectious or immunosuppressive disease. History of chronic eye disease (e.g glaucoma or age related macular degeneration). Pregnancy, lactation or planning pregnancy at time of enrollment.
