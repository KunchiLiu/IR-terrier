	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of added protein+leucine or caffeine to 1.2 g/kg/h CHO on the rate of post-exercise muscle glycogen re-synthesis in healthy, recreational athletes. The investigators hypothesize that both interventions (the addition of caffeine or protein+leucine) will lead to higher glycogen re-synthesis compared to the ingestion of CHO only, and that the co-ingestion of protein and leucine will result in the highest muscle glycogen synthesis rates.</brief_summary>
