	<brief_summary>Livedo vasculitis is disease with recurrent courses of painful foot or ankle ulcerations, followed by healed white scars. The actual mechanism of its pathophysiology is not yet clear. It has been reported to be associated with some gene mutations, for example, factor V Leiden gene. This study is aimed to find the possible relation of these gene mutations in Taiwanese patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Livedo vasculitis is a chronic, recurrent painful ulcerations on the ankles and feet. This chronic disease is characterized by healed white, atrophic scars named atrophie blanche. The histopathological exam on the lesion site reveals fibrin deposition within the vessel walls. It has been reported to be related to factor V Leiden mutation (heterozygous) (22.2%), prothrombin G20210A gene mutation (8.3%), PAI promotor 4G/4G genotype and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation in about total 30% livedo vasculitis patients. This study is trying to find the correlation between Taiwanese patients and these four genes.</detailed_description>
