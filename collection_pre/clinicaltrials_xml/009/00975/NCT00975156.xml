	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at a new rehabilitation technique for individuals who have suffered a stroke and have difficulties walking. This study is designed to compare robot-assisted (Lokomat) rehabilitation therapy with standard physical therapy in order to improve walking post-stroke. This research project will be conducted as a pilot randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of Lokomat versus conventional physical therapy in improving the ambulation and gait of chronic stroke patients. The project will provide important pilot data that could indicate whether or not the effectiveness of Lokomat training is superior to that of standard physical therapy and if a definitive and larger clinical trial is warranted.</brief_summary>
