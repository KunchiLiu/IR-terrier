	<brief_summary>The closure of the alveolar cleft as part of cleft lip and palate deformities is a procedure that, to this date, still demands great efforts from plastic surgeons. The feasibility of periosteoplasty for reconstruction of the alveolar arcade as well as the use of electrical stimulation in order to increase osteoneogenesis have been proven in the past. The present study attempts to combine both procedures that have only been reported separately worldwide. The objective of this study is to increase the osteogenic capacity and hence, dental eruption.</brief_summary>
