	<brief_summary>This pilot study is designed to investigate differences in folate-related genes (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and their relationship to the species of folate present on red blood cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folate Gene Polymorphisms and Cellular Folate Speciation Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main questions to be addressed in this pilot study are: 1. what is the type of folate in red blood cells in individuals with different methylterahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotypes 2. what is the relationship between other folate metabolism-related gene single nucleotide polymorphisms and type (species) of folate found in red blood cells 3. what is the relationship between folate and other B vitamin status, genotype and folate species 4. is there a relationship between serum ferritin status and folate metabolism Whole blood will be taken from apparently healthy male and female volunteers, aged 18-65, which will be used to determine genotype for various folate metabolism-related genes. Furthermore, the type of folate present on the red blood cells will be assessed, and folate, vitamin B12, riboflavin and serum ferritin status determined.</detailed_description>
