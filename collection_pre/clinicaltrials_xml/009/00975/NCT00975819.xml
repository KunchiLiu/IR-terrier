	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Sirolimus in Complicated Vascular Anomalies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with vascular anomalies (VA) have a spectrum of diseases that can be broadly classified into vascular tumors and malformations. Complicated vascular anomalies can cause disfigurement, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the severity of potential complications, we lack uniform guidelines for the treatment and response to treatment of children and young adults with these diseases. There are pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in vascular growth and organization, and suggest a therapeutic target for patients with complicated vascular anomalies. The overall goal of this trial is to objectively determine the effectiveness and safety of the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin* in the treatment of children and young adults diagnosed with complicated vascular anomalies. We propose a Phase 2 trial with the diagnostic, therapeutic and response criteria experimentally determined in this study used as a framework for future Phase 3 clinical trials.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion will be strictly limited to children and young adults with vascular anomalies with complications that require systemic therapy for control. Diagnosis: All patients must have one of the following vascular anomalies as determined by clinical, radiographic and histologic criteria (when possible): Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas with KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas without KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Tufted Angioma with KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Tufted Angioma without KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Capillary LymphaticoVenous Malformation (CLVM) Venous Lymphatic Malformation (VLM) Microcystic Lymphatic Malformation (MLM) Multifocal Lymphangiomatosis and Thrombocytopenia (MLT)/Cutaneovisceral Angiomatosis and Thrombocytopenia (CAT) Capillary Lymphatic Arterial Venous Malformations (CLAVM) PTEN Overgrowth syndrome with vascular anomaly Lymphangiectasia Syndromes If archived tissue is available, histological diagnosis will be confirmed by the pathology lab at the enrolling site. Complications: Patients must have vascular anomalies that have potential to cause significant morbidity. In addition to the above diagnosis, one or more of the following criteria needs to be met: Coagulopathy Chronic pain Recurrent cellulitis (&gt;3 episodes/year) Ulceration Visceral and/or bone involvement Cardiac dysfunction Age: Patients must be 0 31 years of age at the time of study entry. Enrollment includes patients of both genders and all ethnic groups. Organ function requirements: Adequate liver function defined as: Total bilirubin (sum of conjugated and unconjugated) ≤1.5 x ULN for age, and SGPT (ALT) &lt;5 x ULN for age, and Serum albumin &gt; or = 2 g/dL. Fasting LDL and cholesterol: Fasting LDL cholesterol of &lt;160 mg/dL Patients taking a cholesterol lowering agent must be on a single medication and on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks Adequate Bone Marrow Function defined as: Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; or = 1000/microL Hemoglobin &gt; or = 8.0 gm/dL (may receive RBC transfusions) Platelet count &gt; or = 50,000/microL (transfusion independent defined as not receiving a platelet transfusion within a 7 day period prior to enrollment) Note: There is NO platelet requirement for patients with KasabachMerritt Phenomenon Adequate Renal Function Defined as: • A serum creatinine based on age as follows: ≤ 5 years of age maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) of 0.8 6 &lt; age ≤ 10 years of age maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) of 1.0 11 &lt; age ≤ 15 years of age maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) of 1.2 &gt; 15 years of age maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL) of 1.5 AND cystatin C equal to or less than the upper limit of normal for the patient. If cystatin C does not initially meet this criterion, it may be repeated or a more sensitive screening by nuclear GFR must be ≥ 70 ml/min. • Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPC) &lt; 0.3 g/l Performance Status: Karnofsky &gt; or = 50 (&gt;10 years of age) and Lansky &gt; or = 50 for patients &lt; or = 10 years of age Prior therapy requirements: 1. Patients who have undergone surgical resection or interventional radiology procedures for disease control are eligible if they meet all inclusion criteria after surgery/procedure 2. Surgery: At least 2 weeks since undergoing any major surgery 3. Steroids: Patients with endocrine deficiencies are allowed to receive physiologic or stress doses of steroids if necessary. Other patients, such as vascular tumor patients, need to be on a weaning dose of steroids (steroid use defined as intravenous or oral steroids required for more than one day). 4. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 4 weeks of entry onto this study. 5. Hematopoietic GFs: At least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a GF that supports platelet, red or white cell number or function. 6.

For agents that have known AEs occurring beyond 14 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which AEs are known to occur. These patients must be discussed with the Study Chair on a casebycase basis. 7. Patients diagnosed with Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas or Tufted Angiomas will not require a washout period prior to enrollment, but will be required to discontinue the use of prohibited concomitant medications upon enrollment in the study following the guidelines of the protocol. 8.
