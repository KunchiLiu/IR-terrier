	<brief_title>Study Using WST11 in Patients With Non-Resectable or Inoperable Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, prospective, multicentre, phase IIa study, evaluating a new therapeutic agent in the management of patients suffering from inoperable or non resectable biliary carcinoma. The patients will receive the dose of WST11 according to order of inclusion. The first 3 patients will receive 2.5 mg/kg. In the absence of toxicity, the following 9 patients will receive the dose of 5 mg/kg. The patient is to receive anesthesia. WST11-mediated therapy will consist of the combination of single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2.5mg/kg or 5mg/kg, using 753nm laser light at a fixed power of (150mW/cm) and light energy (200 J/cm) delivered through a diffusing fiber. The fiber is introduced in a transparent standard ERCP catheter and positioned under radioscopy in front of the lesion.</detailed_description>
