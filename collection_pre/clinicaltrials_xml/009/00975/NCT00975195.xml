	<brief_summary>This is a randomised study to be conducted in patients with severe to very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to establish whether there is a need for these patients to be continuously treated with an inhaled corticosteroid on top of two potent long-acting bronchodilators. The study also aims to identify the type of patients who are likely to benefit from inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy.</brief_summary>
