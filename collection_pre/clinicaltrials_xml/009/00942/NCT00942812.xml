	<brief_summary>Diarrhoeal diseases are still the major paediatric health concern worldwide, contributing for 2.5 million annual deaths in children. Although the treatment of diarrhoeal illness as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines brings about a considerable decline in the burden of the disease but there is still a lot to be done for this issue. Zinc supplementation along with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) has emerged as a potent approach to treat diarrhoea. It is believed that the children having zinc deficiency are at high risk of developing infectious diseases which eventually lead to a high burden of mortality. In order to prevent and effectively manage diarrheal episodes, it is important that water purification tablets, zinc and oral rehydration salt is always available in each household. Though, these products are easily available in the market separately, but are rarely available together in any household. If these products are made available in a single packet, it is likely to be an effective strategy in combating diarrheal diseases in the community.</brief_summary>
