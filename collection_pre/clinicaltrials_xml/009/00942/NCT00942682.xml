	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out more about the combination of RAD001 and sorafenib such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Combination With RAD001 in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have neuroendocrine tumors, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose the participant will be given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study. - Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. Participants will take RAD001 orally once a day in the morning. Participants will take sorafenib orally twice daily. - Initially participants will come to the clinic every other week. At these visits bloodwork will be taken to monitor the participants health. Every 2 months of treatment, participants will have a CT scan or MRI done to see how the medication is working. - Participants will remain on this research study as long as they continue to benefit from the study medications.</detailed_description>
