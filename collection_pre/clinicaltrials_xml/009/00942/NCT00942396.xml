	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Diagnostic Accuracy of Nuance Full-Field Digital Mammography to Screen-Film Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: 1) To establish the non-inferiority of the diagnostic accuracy of the Planmed Sophie Nuance Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) X-ray System compared to screen-film mammography (SFM) in the detection of breast cancer; and 2) To demonstrate in a comparative side-by-side feature analysis that interpretations based on the Planmed Sophie Nuance FFDM X-ray System are diagnostically non-inferior to SFM in the detection of breast cancer.</detailed_description>
