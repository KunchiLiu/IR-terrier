	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin in treating patients with urinary tract cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin are more effective when given with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with urinary tract cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride and Cisplatin With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma treated with bevacizumab, gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and cisplatin will have increased overall survival when compared to patients treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and placebo. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the progression-free survival of these two regimens in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma. II. To compare the proportion of patients who experience an objective response on each regimen. III. To compare the grade 3 and greater toxicities in patients treated on the two regimens. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, cisplatin IV, and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive placebo IV over 30-90 minutes every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin as in arm I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 7 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented metastatic or unresectable transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma of the urinary tract (renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, prostate, or urethra), with metastatic or locally advanced disease (T4b, N2, N3, or M1); patients must not be candidates for potentially curative surgery or radiotherapy For patients that have had surgical resection prior to study enrollment, residual or unresected disease (measurable and/or unmeasurable) must be evident on postsurgical scans Prior treatment for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) Patients may not have received combination systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease For the purposes of this study, radiosensitizing single agent chemotherapy is not considered prior systemic therapy Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is permissible provided the interval from end of therapy to diagnosis of metastatic disease is at least 1 year &gt;= 4 weeks since any prior radiation (including palliative) or major surgery and fully recovered &gt;= 7 days since any minor surgery such as port placement &gt;= 4 weeks since any intravesical therapy No prior treatment with bevacizumab or other angiogenesis inhibitors No known history of brain metastases; brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]/computed tomography [CT]) is not required No current congestive heart failure; New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III or IV Patients with history of hypertension must be well controlled (&lt; 150/90) on a regimen of antihypertensive therapy Patients on fulldose anticoagulants must be on a stable dose of warfarin and have an inrange international normalized ratio (INR) (usually between 2 and 3) or be on a stable dose of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin; patients receiving antiplatelet agents are also eligible; in addition, patients who are on daily prophylactic aspirin or anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation are eligible No significant history of bleeding events or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation Patients with a history of a significant bleeding episode (e.g. hemoptysis, upper or lower GI bleeding, grade 3 or 4 gross hematuria unable to be controlled by transurethral resection of the bladder tumor) within 6 months of registration are not eligible Patients with a history of GI perforation within 12 months of registration are not eligible Patients with a history of peritoneal carcinomatosis are not eligible No arterial thrombotic events within 6 months of registration, including transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), peripheral arterial thrombus, unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or medical intervention in the past 6 months, or myocardial infarction (MI);
