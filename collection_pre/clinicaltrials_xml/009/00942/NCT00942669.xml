	<detailed_description>A prospective, single center two phase study to evaluate the validity and the predictability of the SleepStrip OTCTM in screening for SAS, as compared to the reference method, an in-lab, full night, attended Polysomnographic (PSG) Study. The study will consist of two phases: I: Optimization Phase:will be performed at the Clinic; 20 participants will be enrolled. Each participant will be connected simultaneously to the SleepStrip OTC(TM) and to the standard lab sensors and recorder. This phase is intended to allow SLP to optimize the analysis parameters for optimal performance and will be considered as a pilot phase. II: Equivalence phase: At least 180 participants will be enrolled. All participants will receive the SleepStrip OTC(TM) for a night test at home, before or after undergoing an independent PSG test at the Sleep lab. Out of 180 participants, at least 26 participants will receive two SleepStrip OTC(TM) devices for two consecutive night tests at home. The remaining participants will receive one SleepStrip OTC(TM) for one night test.</detailed_description>
