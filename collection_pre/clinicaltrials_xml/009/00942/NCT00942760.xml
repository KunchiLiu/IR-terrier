	<brief_summary>Brain imaging tests are routinely used to detect the presence of a brain tumor or to evaluate the response to treatment. Sometimes the images obtained are not specific and the only way to establish a diagnosis is by obtaining a tissue sample. The hypotheses of the study is to determine if multimodal MR technique will provide tissue signatures that differentiate between tumor progression and treatment related necrosis in high grade glioma patients.</brief_summary>
