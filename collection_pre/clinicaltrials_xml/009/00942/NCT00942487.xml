	<brief_title>Effects of Nebivolol on Subclinical Left Ventricular dySfunction: A Comparative Study Against Metoprolol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES 1. PRIMARY: - Longitudinal myocardial velocities at rest (assessed by tissue Doppler echocardiography) - Systolic functional reserve (calculated as the absolute and relative increase of the myocardial systolic velocities at peak stress from rest) - Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, NT-pro BNP) after a 6-months period of treatment with nebivolol versus metoprolol. An improvement of more than 20% of the myocardial resting velocities of systolic functional reserve is considered to be clinically relevant. The working hypothesis is that the improvement of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction after 6 months of treatment is going to be greater in patients who receive nebivolol than in those who receive metoprolol. 2. SECONDARY: - Global systolic function (ejection fraction) - Radial myocardial velocities - Right ventricular function - Global diastolic function - Left ventricular mass index</detailed_description>
