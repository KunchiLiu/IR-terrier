	<mesh_term>Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have Type 2 Diabetes and confirmed by fasting Cpeptide levels greater than or equal to 0.8 ng/ml), with duration of more than 3 months. Body mass index between 25 and 40 kg/m2. Stable on diet and exercise alone, with or without metformin monotherapy (stable regimen or dose for at least 8 weeks). Drugna√Øve or previous antidiabetic pharmacotherapy use is allowed (for the latter, patient must have stopped taking pharmacotherapy greater than 12 weeks prior to screening and only if deemed appropriate by the investigator). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are permitted for the treatment of hypertension or proteinuria. Glycated hemoglobin level between 7% and 10%. Baseline Highsensitivity Creactive protein greater than or equal to 2mg/L Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year postmenopause) must test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment based on a pregnancy test. Furthermore, sexually active female and male participants must agree to use 2 reliable methods of birth control during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. Reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and are willing to follow study procedures. Current use of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy (except metformin, under conditions specified in Inclusion Criteria above). Current treatment with antiinflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (100mg per day or less of aspirin allowed). Within 60 days of the initial dose of the study drug, have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication. Presence of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 or isletcell autoantibody2. Evidence of tuberculosis as documented by a specific assay, medical history, and chest xray. A specific assay, e.g., tuberculin testing, will be conducted unless it is medically inappropriate. Exceptions include patients with a history of a positive specific assay for TB who have been treated with isonicotinyl hydrazine (documented) for at least 6 months, or patients with a previous diagnosis of TB who have been appropriately treated and can provide documentation. Symptomatic herpes zoster within 3 months of randomization. Show evidence of hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen. Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus and/or positive test of antibodies to HIV. Received live or attenuated vaccine(s) within the previous 3 months prior to randomization or will receive within 3 months from the end of study. Screening serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL. Serum Asparate aminotransferase or Alanine aminotransaminase concentration greater than 2x the upper limit of normal. Known allergies to LY2189102 or excipients. Previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating LY2189102. Have donated blood of greater than 500 mL within the preceding 30 days and intend to donate within 3 months from the end of study. Have had other recent or ongoing signs of infection (e.g. fever, current treatment with antibiotics). Experienced a serious bacterial infection within 6 months of randomization. Have a serious medical illness including but not limited to any cardiovascular, hepatic, respiratory, hematological, endocrine, or neurological disease, or any clinically significant laboratory abnormality. Have had lymphoma, leukemia, or any nonbreast malignancy within the past 5 years except for basal cell or squamous epithelial carcinomas of the skin that have been resected with no evidence of metastatic disease. Have had a previous reaction to other biologics that, in the opinion of the investigator, puts patient at serious risk.</criteria>
