	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress has been implicated in playing a pathogenic role in many disease processes, especially in age-related disorders. It has been hypothesized that antioxidative agents such as vitamins and minerals, which are capable of scavenging free radicals, may reduce oxidative stress and may, in turn, be beneficial for patients with age-related disorders. Based on this hypothesis, several different combinations of vitamins have been introduced, all targeting at reducing oxidative stress. However, the in-vivo determination of the antioxidative properties of a certain drug or vitamin combination are hard to determine. In the current study, the researchers propose to investigate the effect of VITAMAC®, a combination of vitamins and minerals, in a systemic in-vivo inflammation model. In the present study, the infusion of LPS, which is a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria and a major mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock, will be used as a standardized experimental model of systemic inflammation in humans. Given that inflammation is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and widespread endothelial dysfunction, the LPS model is well suitable for determination of the antioxidative effects of VITAMAC®. As a main outcome parameter, the vascular reactivity of retinal vessels to systemic hyperoxia (induced by breathing 100% oxygen) will be tested in presence or absence of the antioxidant combination.</brief_summary>
