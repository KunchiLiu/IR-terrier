	<brief_title>Kidney Function After Pneumoperitoneum and Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) reduces surgical trauma and hospital stay but requires effective and safe postoperative analgesia. This prospective and double blind study aimed to study the effects of tramadol analgesia associated to dipyrone or ketorolac in the kidney function of patients submitted to LC, using creatinine (Cr), cystatin C, and enzymuria evaluations. Methods: In the pre- and postoperative (PO) periods, estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFR), obtained from two formulas dependants of blood Cr and one from blood cystatin C values, and tubular enzymuria - alkaline phosphatase (AP), γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) - were determined in patients who underwent LC and analgesia with tramadol and dipyrone (G1, n=63) or tramadol and ketorolac (G2, n=63). In the recovery room (RR), pain and need of rescue analgesia with morphine were evaluated.</detailed_description>
