	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Measuring how well the lungs work in patients with cancer may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying lung function testing in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Function Testing in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To obtain the distribution of DLCO, FVC, and FEV_1 by pulmonary function testing (PFT) in patients with heavily pretreated locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors referred to the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) Phase I Clinical Trials Program. - To estimate the mean DLCO to within 4 units (% of predicted) of the true mean with 95% confidence. Secondary - To estimate the percentage of patients who meet the defined eligibility criteria (including PFT levels, especially DLCO) from the entire population enrolled in the KCI Phase I Clinical Trials Program. OUTLINE: Patients undergo pulmonary function testing comprising spirometry test, lung volumes, and DLCO measurement utilizing the single-breath breath-holding technique. Patients then proceed to treatment on a phase I clinical trial.</detailed_description>
