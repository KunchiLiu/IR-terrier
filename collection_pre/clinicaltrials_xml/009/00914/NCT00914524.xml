	<brief_summary>The treatment period was 16 weeks, the initial dose, 5 mg, was unforcedly titrated to 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg after confirming tolerance at weeks 4, 8 and 12. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the change in the urinary protein/creatinine ratio from baseline to the end of treatment. The secondary endpoint was creatinine clearance (Ccr).</brief_summary>
