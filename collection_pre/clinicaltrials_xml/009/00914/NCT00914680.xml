	<brief_summary>This treatment pilot study will investigate clinical efficacy and adverse effects of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) in patients currently experiencing a unipolar or bipolar depressive episode. The investigators will perform add-on tests to assess clinical and cognitive response to treatment. It is hypothesized that MST will have an antidepressant efficacy with a beneficial neurocognitive adverse effect profile.</brief_summary>
