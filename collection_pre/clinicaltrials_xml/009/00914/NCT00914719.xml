	<brief_summary>Adolescents are at great risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (CDC, 2000a; DiLorenzo &amp; Whaley, 1999). Though the CDC (2000b) reports that overall AIDS incidence is on the decline, there has been no comparable decline in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among young people aged 13-19, and young people of color are particularly at risk. Compared to the general adolescent population, adolescents involved with the criminal justice system are younger at first intercourse, have a greater number of sex partners, and lower rates of condom use, resulting in higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STDs (e.g., St. Lawrence et al., 1999). Alcohol use is commonly cited as a reason for lack of condom use among high-risk adolescents such as those involved in the criminal justice system (e.g., Morris et al., 1998) and recent data from our research suggests that it is heavy alcohol use in concert with sexual activity that is most strongly related to lack of condom use (Bryan, Rocheleau, &amp; Robbins, 2002a). The goal of this research is to design, implement, evaluation, and disseminate a successful HIV/STD risk reduction intervention that is theory-based, empirically targeted to adolescents, and articulated to a criminal justice setting. The study compares a sexual risk reduction intervention with a group motivational interviewing alcohol component to a standard sexual risk reduction intervention and a no treatment control condition. The investigators hope to show that: 1) A three-hour one-time intervention has the capacity to reduce sexual risk behavior up to one year post-release among high risk adolescents in detention, 2) A combined sexual and alcohol risk reduction intervention will result in larger decreases in sexual risk behavior than a sexual risk reduction alone, 3) The interventions will exert their effects through changes in mediators derived from a theoretically-based model of condom use intentions and behaviors, and 4) A sexual risk reduction intervention including an alcohol component will be especially effective for those adolescents with higher levels of existing alcohol problems. Finally, given proven efficacy, the intervention curricula and materials will be disseminated for use in adolescent detention facilities throughout the state.</brief_summary>
