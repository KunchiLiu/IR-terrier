	<brief_summary>In a randomized clinical trial, the researchers want to investigate if the positive short-term outcomes (first 1-2 years), achieved with specialized assertive intervention programme (OPUS), can be maintained for five years if the specialized treatment is sustained over the first five years in comparison to only two years of specialized treatment followed by three years of standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended Specialized Assertive Intervention for First Episode Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Danish OPUS I trial succeeded in randomizing 547 patients with first-episode psychosis to a two-year specialized intensive treatment program (OPUS) or standard treatment. The results clearly favored OPUS treatment, and psychotic and negative symptoms, substance abuse, adherence to treatment, use of anti-psychotic medication, user satisfaction, and use of bed days were better in OPUS compared to standard treatment. However, the five-year follow-up, three years after patients from OPUS were transferred to standard treatment, showed that the positive clinical effects were not sustained, when the intensive treatment was terminated, except from OPUS-patients being less likely to stay in institutions than patients who received standard care. Objective: The aim in OPUS II trial is to compare the effect of five-years versus two-years specialized assertive intervention program (OPUS-treatment) for first episode psychosis on clinical symptoms, substance abuse, institutionalization, and labor market affiliation. Hypothesis: It is possible to maintain the positive results of the intensive two-year intervention in another three years for those who keep receiving the specialized assertive intervention program. Design: Open label randomized clinical trial. Setting: Psychiatric Center Bispebjerg and Center for Psychiatric Research Aarhus, Denmark.Participants: 400 patients with first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorder received treatment in one of the six OPUS - teams for 1½ years. Intervention: Another 3½ years OPUS-treatment versus ½ year OPUS-treatment and thereafter referral to standard treatment. The extended OPUS treatment consist modified assertive case management, rational pharmacotherapy, family psycho-educational intervention, group interventions to aid with recovery, social skills training, cognitive behavior therapy when indicated, and crisis intervention. OPUS-treatment is tailored to meet the individual patient's needs.</detailed_description>
