	<brief_summary>About 80% of the worldwide population is positive on HSV antibodies. In the United States the lifetime prevalence of recurrent herpes labialis is estimated at 20% to 40%, with approximately 100 million episodes occurring in the country every year. In Switzerland about 70% of the adult population is positive on HSV-1 and about 20% is positive on HSV-2. The Herpes simplex virus has a lipid bilayer (virus-envelope), which causes the sensitiveness, to any kind of detergents. Within this bilayer cholesterol molecules are integrated and play a crucial role in virus entry into host cells. In vitro experiments have clearly shown that the depletion of cholesterol in HSV-envelope with 2- HPßCD has inhibited the ability of the virus to infect host cells. The aim of this clinical trial is to reduce the number of Herpes labialis relapse and to provide patients with recurrent Herpes labialis a real benefit, concerning the simple mechanism of action and the negligible side effects. Patients having problems in swallowing the antiviral pills of standard treatment, will find with 2- HPßCD a drug, that just has to be applied on the lips, which increases patient's quality of life tremendously. - Trial with medicinal product</brief_summary>
