	<brief_summary>It has been suggested that cardiovascular risk factors either independently or in cluster (metabolic syndrome) increase the risk of both type 2 diabetes (DM2) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Consumption of citrus fruits is linked to reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hesperidin is a flavanone abundant in citrus fruit with putative vasodilator actions in vitro. While molecular mechanisms of vascular actions of hesperidin begin to be explored, no data on in vivo vascular effect of this flavanone has been ever acquired.</brief_summary>
