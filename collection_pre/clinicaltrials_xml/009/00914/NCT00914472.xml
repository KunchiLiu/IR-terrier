	<brief_summary>Investigate, through a randomized, open, parallel and comparative, non-inferiority of heparin sodium produced by laboratory Hipolabor compared to heparin manufactured by APP in patients on hemodialysis due to renal failure, through the control of hemostasis, verified by formation of clot (fibrin) in the hemodialysis system and pharmacodynamic parameters (TTPA and Anti-Xa) during the use of heparin</brief_summary>
