	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a treatment that can cure acute leukemia and myelodysplasia. After giving the patient chemotherapy and total body irradiation to stop the growth of cancer and remove the patient's diseased bone marrow, healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient to replace the patient's bone marrow and make red and white blood cells and platelets. Unfortunately HSCT is often complicated by 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD) in which the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells and cause tissue damage and severe symptoms. Removing a subset of the donor T cells, called 'naive T cells', before transplant may reduce the frequency and intensity of GVHD. PURPOSE: This phase II trial will determine whether the removal of the naive T cells from donor cells can decrease the rate and severity of graft-vs-host disease while preserving specific immunity against infections in patients with acute leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Estimate the probability of grades II-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients with acute leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes treated with CD45RA+ T-cell-depleted allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and compare this to relevant historical experience. - Estimate the probability of graft failure in these patients. Secondary - Evaluate immune reconstitution and pathogen-specific T-cell reconstitution in these patients. - Estimate the probability of transplant-related mortality by day 100 in these patients. - Estimate the probability of relapse in these patients. - Estimate the probability and severity of chronic GVHD in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily for 4 days (Days -10 to -7) Patients also receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours for 2 days (Days -6 and -5) and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes for 5 days (Days -6 to -2.) - Transplantation: Patients receive a CD34+ enriched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) product followed by a CD45RA+ T-cell-depleted allogeneic PBSC product on day 0. - Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients will receive Tacrolimus as per cohort 1. If the rate of grade II-IV acute GVHD in the first 35 patients is significantly reduced (compared to historical controls), subsequent patients are enrolled in cohort 2. - Cohort 1: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 50, followed by a standard taper in the absence of grade II-IV acute GVHD. - Cohort 2: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 30, followed by a rapid taper in the absence of grade II-IV acute GVHD. Patients are followed actively for at least 1 year post transplant.</detailed_description>
