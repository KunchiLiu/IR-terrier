	<brief_summary>Patients presenting with ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) in the emergency department will be screened for clinical eligibility and asked to sign informed consent to the study. A total of 40 patients will be randomized. 20 of them will receive a Trapidil eluting stent (Intrepide™ stent), 20 will receive a Paclitaxel eluting stent (Taxus™ stent). After 90 days the patients who were treated with the INTREPIDE stent in the first lesion will be treated with the Taxus stent in the second lesion. After 90 days the patients who were treated with the Taxus stent in the first lesion will be treated with the INTREPIDE stent in the second lesion. Coronary angiography will be performed through the femoral (groin) or radial (wrist) artery with the use of standard techniques. The doctor will determine if the patient is qualified for enrolment at the end of the diagnostic coronary angiogram</brief_summary>
