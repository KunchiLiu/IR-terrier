	<brief_summary>This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Newly Diagnosed Neuroblastoma or Ganglioneuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To prospectively analyze the factors that are currently used for risk-group assignment (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog [MYCN] copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH], deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] content by flow cytometry, and tumor histology using the International Neuroblastoma Pathologic Classification System) in neuroblastoma tumors at the time of diagnosis. II. To maintain a reference bank containing clinically and genetically characterized frozen tumor tissue, tumor DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA), histology slides and paraffin blocks, neuroblastoma-derived cell lines, patient serum and paired normal DNA obtained at the time of diagnosis, at the time of second-look surgery and at the time of relapse for future research studies. III. To prospectively analyze 1p, 11q, 14q and 17q allelic status, MYCN copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and the expression pattern of neurotrophin-related genes in diagnostic neuroblastoma tumors, and assay for the presence of rare tumor cells in biological specimens by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR; these biological variables will be analyzed for independent clinical significance compared to MYCN amplification, International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage, age, ploidy, and histologic variables in predicting either response to treatment or outcome. IV. To build a database of the known biologic prognostic factors for patients on therapeutic studies. V. To serve as a Registry for neuroblastoma patients whose tumors demonstrate clinical and genetic features defined as "Low Risk" for treatment failure in the absence of adjuvant therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To prospectively analyze the concordance between detection of MYCN amplification in tumor samples and quantitative detection of MYCN DNA in serum, and to analyze the prognostic significance of MYCN amplification as detected in serum samples. II. To build a database that includes information regarding the presentation and natural history of neuroblastoma-associated health problems including but not limited to opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (OMA) and/or spinal cord compression. OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of blood, tissue, and bone marrow samples for analysis via RT-PCR, quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, and FISH. After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All newly diagnosed patients with suspected neuroblastoma, suspected ganglioneuroblastoma, or suspected ganglioneuroma/maturing subtype seen at Children's Oncology Group (COG) institutions are eligible for this study There will be no penalty under any circumstances for enrollment of a patient whose definitive institutional diagnosis, or central review diagnosis, is found to be a tumor other than neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma/ maturing subtype Patients may not have received chemotherapy prior to enrollment on ANBL00B1 and procurement of studyrelated tissues with the following exception: Patients that in the opinion of the treating physician are too ill to undergo pretreatment tissue biopsy and require EMERGENT chemotherapy may be enrolled on ANBL00B1; documentation of the emergent nature of therapy initiation is required It is required that a good faith effort (documented by specimen tracking) be made to submit a neuroblastoma sample (tumor, metastasis, and/or tumorinvolved bone marrow) of sufficient quality for MYCN analysis in the Neuroblastoma Reference Laboratory in order for any newly diagnosed patient to be enrolled on ANBL00B1; this should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy Exceptions In rare cases, patients may be deemed too ill to undergo pretreatment tissue biopsy and require EMERGENT therapy; the following eligibility guidelines apply to these cases: For presumed INSS stage 4S patients: Efforts to submit tumor tissue (e.g., primary tumor, skin nodule, or metastatic site) within 96 hours of EMERGENT therapy initiation should be made; however, if the child is deemed too unstable for such a procedure they may still be enrolled as long as pretreatment peripheral blood and serum have been submitted For all other INSS stages: tumor tissue should be obtained as soon as possible within 96 hours of EMERGENT therapy initiation; patients without tumor tissues submitted within this timeframe are not eligible for enrollment Note: it may not be possible to obtain all necessary tumor biomarkers for therapy stratification in such cases; if a patient enrolled on ANBL00B1 undergoes an additional diagnostic procedure within 96 hours of initiating therapy, additional tumor specimens may be submitted to obtain biomarkers used for risk classification; the decision to perform such procedures, and/or submit these specimens, is to be made by the managing clinicians and should reflect the clinical need to know the status of such biomarkers Patients enrolled on ANBL1232 in Group A (either A1 or A2) will not have a tumor biopsy or resection upfront; tumor tissue submission is therefore not required for these patients to enroll on ANBL00B1; a peripheral blood and serum sample is the only specimen required to be submitted for this group of patients; should they undergo a biopsy or resection at a later date tumor can be submitted for biomarker testing at this time All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met Patients with relapsed neuroblastoma who were not enrolled on ANBL00B1 at original diagnosis are NOT eligible; samples should be submitted as part of the ABTR04B1 protocol</criteria>
