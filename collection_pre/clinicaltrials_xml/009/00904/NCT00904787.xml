	<criteria>Patients must have relapsed/refractory hematological malignancy for which no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission. Patients with poorrisk myelodysplasia (MDS) [i.e., IPSS ≥ 1.5] or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are also candidates for this protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute non lymphocytic leukemia (AML) by WHO classification, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) are also eligible. Patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or myeloma may also participate. Age ≥18 years. Adequate performance status Interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents, or at least 5 halflives for noncytotoxic agents and adequate recovery from prior toxicities. If the patient had a transplant, at least 6 months must have passed before initiation of treatment on this protocol and stable graft versus host disease (no change in severity) for 4 weeks preceding study entry (if applicable). Persistent clinically significant chronic toxicities from prior therapy must have resolved to baseline or NCI CTCAE Grade &lt; 1 Adequate laboratory results within 10 days of ENMD2076 administration (unless the abnormality is considered attributable to leukemia) Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Clinical evidence of bowel obstruction, active uncontrolled malabsorption syndromes or a history of total gastrectomy. Impaired cardiac function including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, uncontrolled hypertension, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure. Blood pressure must be &lt; 150/90 at the time of enrollment. Receiving any other treatment for their disease QTc prolongation defined as ≥ 470 ms.</criteria>
