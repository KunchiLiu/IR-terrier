	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is determine that Dapagliflozin has no effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) of warfarin when dapagliflozin is coadministered with warfarin. Also, that Dapagliflozin has no effect on the PK of digoxin when dapagliflozin is coadministered with digoxin.</brief_summary>
