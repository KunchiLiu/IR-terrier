	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that genes that play a role in menstrual migraine can be identified using a well characterised migraine population and a comprehensive genome-wide association scan approach. The aim of the study is to identify genes, genetic regions, and the effect of hormones on expression profiles in women with menstrual migraine compared to a control population with no personal or first-degree family history of migraine. In this case control study, saliva samples will be taken from 300 cases and 300 controls for DNA analysis. Blood samples from 30 cases and 30 controls will be taken during the follicular phase as well as the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.</brief_summary>
