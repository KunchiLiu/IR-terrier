	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm, phase II trial to characterize the clinical outcome of standard of care, cetuximab concurrent with radiation, in a special population (head and neck cancer patients who cannot tolerate concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to advanced age, poor performance status or concurrent illness), and to determine if biomarker response to a loading dose of cetuximab is predictive of that outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Radiation (RT) Concurrent With Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1: Determine changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling and novel phosphoproteins following a loading dose of cetuximab in patients who are poor candidates for chemoradiation (age =70 years or with significant co-morbidities) and are therefore treated with cetuximab with radiation. Primary Objective 2: Characterize clinical outcomes, including local recurrence, progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients, and correlate these clinical outcomes with the changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling, and novel phosphoproteins. Primary Objective 3: Describe the toxicity, in particular mucositis/dysphagia, of this regimen. Secondary Objective 1: Conduct normal mucosa EGFR assessment for comparison with tumor sample. Secondary Objective 2: Correlate HPV presence and titer with p53 status and clinical outcome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have pathologicallyconfirmed, previously untreated, clinically accessible (without general anesthesia) locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, or nonresectable head and neck squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Patients will be limited to: ≥ 70 years of age, OR with comorbidities that preclude treatment with standard platinumbased chemotherapy, as determined by the treating physician, OR KPS ≤ 80, OR Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 cc/min Laboratory criteria: WBC &gt; 3500/ul Granulocyte &gt; 1500/ul Platelet count &gt; 100,000/ul Total Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 X ULN Patients must give documented informed consent to participate in this study. Prior head and neck malignancy, or history of other prior nonhead and neck malignancy within the past 3 years (excluding skin cancer and early stage treated prostate cancer). Prior head and neck radiation or chemotherapy. Documented evidence of distant metastases. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Any medical or psychiatric illness, which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this treatment. Patients with psychiatric/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements are not eligible. Patients with prior antiepidermal growthfactor receptor antibody therapy (antibody or small molecule). Patients residing in prison.</criteria>
