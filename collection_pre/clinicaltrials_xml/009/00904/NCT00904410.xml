	<brief_summary>18F-FDG PET, a whole-body imaging technology based on glucose metabolism, can effectively detect subclinical and clinical therapeutic responses at stages that are earlier than those detected by conventional approaches. We propose to conduct a prospective study to evaluate early therapeutic response using 18F-FDG PET before and after the 1st cycle of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. Variation of 18F-FDG PET uptake is compared to clinical and echographical tumor response evaluated after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The purpose is to estimate the capacity of 18F-FDG PET to differentiate responder and non-responder patients.</brief_summary>
