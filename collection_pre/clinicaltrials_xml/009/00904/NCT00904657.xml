	<brief_summary>The study is conducted: - to investigate the influence of sunitinib (study drug) on the plasma biomarkers VEGF-A, VEGF-C, soluble VEGFR-2, and soluble VEGFR-3 (vessel endothelial growth factors) and on the blood pressure; - to generate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for sunitinib using biomarkers.</brief_summary>
