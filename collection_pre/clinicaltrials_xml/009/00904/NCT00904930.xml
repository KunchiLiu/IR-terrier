	<brief_summary>Background/Aims: The Periotest® method represents a technique for objective tooth mobility assessment. The aims of this study were: 1. receiving information about normal Periotest® values in vertical and horizontal dimension on periodontally healthy teeth for individuals aged 20-35, 2. investigating the reliability of the Periotest® method in terms of intra-serial and inter-serial reproducibility before splinting and with an applied dental trauma splint, 3. evaluating the splint effect of two different wire-composite splints in vivo. Materials and Methods: On periodontally healthy dental students (n=33; mean age 24.7 years) Periotest® values were measured on reproducible measuring points, in vertical and horizontal dimension and before splinting and after splint insertion. Three readings were taken per serial to observe the intra-serial reproducibility, and for testing inter-serial reproducibility three serials were measured (Friedman-test; P ≤ 0.001). Two different wire-composite-splints (1 = Dentaflex 0.45 mm, 2 = Strengtheners 0.8x1.8) were inserted, the Periotest® values were measured and the splint effects were calculated and compared (Whitney-Mann-U-test; P ≤ 0.001).</brief_summary>
