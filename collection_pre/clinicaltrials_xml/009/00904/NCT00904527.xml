	<detailed_description>This randomized, multicenter study compares 2 parallel groups of patients with migraine : - I: patients are treated with relaxation + medical treatment (beta-bloquant or Oxetorone)+ patients' education - II: patients are treated only with medical treatment + patients' education. Visit 1 : 1 month before randomization for patient's selection and baseline data Visit 2 (J0): inclusion (randomization) During the first 2 months patients from group I benefit from relaxation consultations. Visit 3 (2 months after randomization)and visit 4 (4 months after randomization) : evaluation of the efficacy of the two treatment strategies. Primary endpoint : - number of days with migraine per month from J0 to visit 4. Secondary endpoints : - monthly drug consumption - percentage of patients who respond (50 % frequency reduction) - quality of life (SF 36) Each day, patients note in a notebook if a migraine appears and its intensity.</detailed_description>
