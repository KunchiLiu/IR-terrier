	<brief_summary>Background: - Solid organ transplantation provides life-saving treatment for end-stage organ disease but is associated with an increased cancer risk because of the need for long-term immunosuppression - End-stage renal disease (ESRD), the most common type of end-stage organ disease leading to transplant, is itself linked to increased risk for some cancers - The role of immunosuppression and other factors causing cancer in this setting are not fully understood. Objectives: - To characterize cancer risk in transplant recipients and identify risk factors. - To characterize risk for transmission of cancer from organ donors to recipients. - To describe cancer risk in ESRD. Eligibility: Patients are not required for this study. Data are gathered from existing databases of ESRD patients, organ transplant patients and cancer registries. Design: - Databases of 1) U.S. transplant recipients, donors and wait list candidates and 2) U.S. ESRD patients will be linked to multiple U.S. cancer registries to identify cancers in transplant recipients and ESRD patients. - The spectrum of cancer risk in transplant recipients and ESRD patients will be evaluated in detail. - The cancer risk in transplant recipients will be examined in relation to whether the donors had cancer. - The proposed cancer risk factors (e.g., underlying medical condition, infection with cancer-causing viruses, immunosuppressive medications) documented in transplant and ESRD files will be studied for association with increased risk of particular types of cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Risk in Organ Transplant Recipients and End-Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Solid organ transplantation provides life-saving treatment for end-stage organ disease but is associated with substantially elevated cancer risk, largely due to the need to maintain long-term immunosuppression. Despite previous research, important research questions remain concerning the role of immunosuppression and other factors in causing cancer in the setting. The investigators propose linking a database of U.S. transplant recipients (458,834 transplants, 1987-June 2010), donors, and wait list candidates, and to multiple U.S. cancer registries. This linkage will allow identification of incident cancers in transplant recipients. Using these data, investigators will conduct a detailed evaluation of the spectrum of cancer risk in transplant recipients. Additionally, the investigators will examine cancer risk in transplant recipients in relation to whether donors themselves had cancer, to study possible donor-to-recipient transmission of cancer. The investigators will also study whether proposed cancer risk factors (e.g., underlying medical condition, infection with oncogenic viruses, immunosuppressive medications), documented in transplant files, are associated with increased risk of particular types of cancer.</detailed_description>
