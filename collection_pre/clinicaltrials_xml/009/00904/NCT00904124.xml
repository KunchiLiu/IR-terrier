	<brief_summary>It has been suggested that dietary fibers can affect food intake and satiation. Satiation, or meal termination, can be induced by sensory properties and energy density of fiber-rich food products, but also by the chemical/physical/rheological behavior of the fibers in the stomach and/or intestine. It is not clear which properties are the key regulators of satiation by fiber sources. There are many types of dietary fiber, which have diverse sensory and chemical properties, thus these might have different effects on satiation.</brief_summary>
