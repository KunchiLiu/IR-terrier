	<brief_title>A Pre-Market Study of the American Medical Systems (AMS) Transobturator Male Sling System for the Treatment of Male Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center study conducted under a common implant and follow-up protocol. The study will collect pre-operative urologic testing, medical history and subject quality of life (Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire). Intra-operative procedural data will be collected. Pad weight and incontinence severity rating (using the ICIQ survey) will be used to characterize continence status. Post-operative complications, urologic testing, and subject quality of life will be collected at six weeks and three, six, 12, and 24 months.</detailed_description>
