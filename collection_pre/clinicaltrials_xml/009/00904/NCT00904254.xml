	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to proof the concept of EP 1645 as a diagnostic tool for carotid artery atherosclerosis and plaque instability and to assess the safety and tolerability of this diagnostic agent, a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab') conjugated with the diagnostic radionuclide 99mTc. Safety and tolerability will be determined by adverse events (AEs) observed and reported upon administration of the product and the absorbed dose of radiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Anti-CD4 mAb-Fragment for Imaging of Local Inflammation in Patients With Carotid Artery Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the evaluation of atherosclerosis in carotid arteries up to now sonographic measurements of plaque burden are used. This method has advantages for investigation of carotid arteries since this region is easy accessible for this investigation. However, it does not allow evaluation of the vessels which are remote from the body surface, as, for instance, coronary arteries. A method for non-invasive reliable evaluation of such arteries is needed. Also the distinction between vulnerable and stable plaque has a great clinical relevance. A quantifiable method for the determination of the effects of new therapeutic approaches would be highly appreciated. It is expected, that the new antibody fragment with its radioactive linkage will allow displaying an image of the activity distribution of the disease. Due to the fact that only patients with atherosclerotic changes in carotid arteries allow comparing the activity and the clinical signs of disease, this proof of concept study (phase II study) will be performed in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.</detailed_description>
