	<brief_summary>Type I supracondylar fractures are elbow fractures that occur in children aged 3-10 years. Many different treatment options exist to treat this type of fracture. The purpose of this study is to compare three different treatment modalities with regards to pain experienced during treatment, the amount of pain medication needed during treatment, and any short-term complications. We hypothesize that above elbow casting and long-arm splinting will result in less pain and have fewer complications than taping the elbow in flexion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study either by the attending physician in the Emergency Department at BC Children's hospital or by one of the study investigators. They will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: above elbow cast, long arm splint, or tape. After being treated, patients will be required to fill in a daily pain diary describing their level of pain and how much analgesia they are requiring. They will also be followed by regular phone calls to track any complications of treatment (e.g. loosening or shifting of cast/ splint/ tape, any skin breakdown, etc.). Patients will be seen for follow-up at three weeks post-injury in the Orthopedics Clinic at BCCH to have radiographs repeated, finish their treatment, and hand in their pain diaries.</detailed_description>
