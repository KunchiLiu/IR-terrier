	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of varenicline treatment on cue induced craving to smoking using brain imaging. The investigators hypothesize that participants will report reduced urges to smoke and will have less activation in parts of the brain associated with craving.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Varenicline on Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Activation on Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with varenicline reduces overall subjective cigarette craving and smoking reward in nicotine-dependent smokers. This preliminary study will explore the impact of varenicline treatment on smoking cue-induced craving and associated regional brain activation using BOLD fMRI. Twenty healthy smokers (10 males, 10 females) will undergo two BOLD fMRI scans with the presentation of smoking-related and neutral cues at baseline and after five weeks of treatment with open-label varenicline. The investigators hypothesize that participants will report reduced urges to smoke on the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief and have less activation of the brain areas associated with craving during the fMRI after 5 weeks of varenicline and smoking cessation counseling compared to the baseline scan.</detailed_description>

Meets DSMIV criteria for current axis I disorders of major depression, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress syndrome, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, or any other psychotic disorder or organic mental disorder. 7. Current suicidal ideation with plan or homicidal ideation. 8. Need for maintenance or acute treatment with any psychoactive medication including antiseizure medications which could potentially interfere with fMRI. 9.
