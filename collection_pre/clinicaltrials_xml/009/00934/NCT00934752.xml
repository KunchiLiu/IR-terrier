	<brief_summary>The study will enroll patients with angiographically significant coronary de novo lesions. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 and treated with a Lutonix catheter either before or after bare-metal stenting (BMS). The purpose is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the Lutonix Catheter for treatment of de novo coronary artery stenosis using two distinct treatment strategies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or nonpregnant/nonbreast feeding Female ≥ 18 years of age. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (within 7 days of the procedure); Documented stable angina pectoris Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCSC) 14, unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia (Braunwald III) or documented silent ischemia; Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 25%; Patient is an acceptable candidate for PTCA, stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); Patient is willing to provide informed consent and comply with followup visits and testing schedule; Target lesion is a de novo lesion in a native coronary artery vessel; Initial stenosis is ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% by visual estimate or quantitative coronary angiography (QCA); Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD) is ≥ 2.5 and ≤ 3.25 prior to predilation; Target lesion is ≤18mm in length and can be treated in its entirety by no more than 1 single Lutonix Catheter balloon and 1 single BMS; Guidewire is able to cross lesion and be placed in distal vessel prior to enrollment; Enrollment permitted after successful treatment of 1 nonstudy lesion in a single other nonstudy vessel (not in the same vascular territory as the study lesion). Successful treatment is defined as ≤ 30% residual stenosis with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Grade III flow and not evidence of dissection. History of stroke within past 6 months; History of myocardial infarction (MI) or thrombolysis within 72 hours of randomization; Prior vascular brachytherapy; Uncontrollable allergies to procedure medications, materials or contrast; Angiographic evidence of thrombus or dissection within the target vessel; Intervention of another coronary lesion ≤ 60 days before index procedure day or planned following index procedure; Target lesion is planned to be treated with something other than PTCA and stent (i.e., cuttingballoon, atherectomy, vascular brachytherapy (VBT), etc.); Target lesion is in the Left Main and has excessive calcification or tortuosity or involves bifurcation disease of vessel ≥ 2.5mm; Known sensitivity or has received paclitaxel or other antimitogenic agent within 12 months prior to target vessel treatment; Patient has any previous intervention (PTCA, stent, etc.) of the target coronary vessel; Any medical condition, in the investigators opinion, that should preclude the patient from the study or patient has a life expectancy less than 24 months; Known creatine kinaseMB (CKMB) &gt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or positive Troponin; Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl; Leukocyte &lt; 3500/mL; Platelet &lt; 100,000 mL or &gt; 750,000 mL; Currently taking or must resume warfarin; Patient is contraindicated for antiplatelet therapy or it will need to be withdrawn for a planned procedure; The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study.</criteria>
