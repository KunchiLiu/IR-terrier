	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for the detection of breast lesions in genetically high-risk women due to its high sensitivity. As non-cancerous conditions including normal changes due to a woman's menstrual cycle may have the appearance of cancer on MR images, a biopsy (generally performed under ultrasound-guidance) of the suspicious mass is required for definitive diagnosis. However, only a limited percentage of MRI-visible lesions are also visible on ultrasound (US). Even if found, it is often unclear whether the lesion identified on US corresponds to the MRI-detected lesion in question. The investigators have developed a visualization tool to assist the visualization of MRI-detected lesions in US-guided procedures (e.g., biopsy). This tool provides a simultaneous display of the previously acquired MRI data alongside real-time US images. The investigators propose a pilot study to assess the usefulness of this tool in identifying MRI-detected lesions using real-time US-guidance.</brief_summary>
