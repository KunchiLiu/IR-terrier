	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the sustainability of a two-year intervention aimed at improving body mass index (BMI) and metabolic and vascular health in obese youth. The study will compare lifestyle changes with diet and exercise alone with changes in lifestyle in combination with metformin medication. An initial intensive exercise program will also be compared with a standard exercise program. Hypothesis: Metformin therapy in combination with intensive lifestyle intervention in obese children and adolescents will be associated with reduced rate of weight gain, improved BMI, body composition, physical activity, physical fitness, insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profiles, adipocytokines and vascular function.</brief_summary>
