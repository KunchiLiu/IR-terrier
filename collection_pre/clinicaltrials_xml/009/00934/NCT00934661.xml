	<brief_summary>At Wake Forest University, the investigators have been using Extended Release Epidural Morphine (EREM), since late 2004, as part of multimodal analgesia in patients having gynecologic surgeries and hip arthroplasties. Hypothesis: In patients undergoing a Birmingham total hip arthroplasty (BHA), low dose EREM in conjunction with lumbar plexus block (LPB) will be better than lumbar plexus block alone in increasing proportion of patients who meet discharge criteria within 24 hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Extended-release Epidural and Lumbar Plexus Block Compared to Lumbar Plexus Block for Total Hip Resurfacing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extended release epidural morphine (EREM, DepoDurÂ®: Endo Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford PA) has been studied and increasingly utilized as a method to allow for the improved post-operative analgesia of epidural analgesia without infusions. At Wake Forest University, the investigators have been using EREM, since late 2004, as part of multimodal analgesia in patients having gynecologic surgeries and hip arthroplasties. The investigators initially decreased our dosages from those recommended (15 mg for lower extremity surgery and 10-15 mg for abdominal surgery), because side effects (nausea, vomiting and hypotension) were felt to be limiting to recovery. The investigators now use 4-7.5 mg in most patients, with 7.5 mg being the exception and have achieved better results. For hip arthroplasties, the investigators currently use 4-5 mg and have performed two retrospective chart reviews on this use; both suggesting that this approach is efficacious. However, these doses have not been studied in a prospective, randomized, double blind trial. The investigators would like to evaluate the efficacy of this dose of EREM used as part of a multimodal regimen. The investigators will compare EREM 4 mg with lumbar plexus block versus lumbar plexus block alone, (providing the rest of our multimodal approach for both patients).</detailed_description>
