	<brief_title>Testing an Internet-Based Intervention for Preventing Eating Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 2% to 4% of college-aged women suffer from eating disorders (EDs), and many more are at risk of developing them. A previous Internet-based intervention called Student Bodies (SB), which focused on body image concerns, was effective in reducing risk factors for EDs among college-aged women. However, the original SB program did not account for certain other risk factors, such as depression and compensatory behaviors like self-induced vomiting, over-exercising, or use of diuretics. Image and Mood (IaM) is an enhanced version of the SB program and takes into account depressive symptoms and the use of compensatory behaviors. This study will examine whether IaM will reduce ED risk factors in a large population of college women who are at high risk of developing EDs. Participation in this study will last 10 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the IaM program or be placed on a wait list. The IaM program, which will be delivered through the Internet, will provide information about nutrition, exercise, body image, and coping skillsâ€”including examples and exercises. It will also include an online message board monitored by a study psychologist. Each week the IaM participants will monitor their behavior, keep a journal about their experiences, and answer self-report questionnaires. Assessments of eating disorder symptoms; weight and shape concerns; depressive symptoms; and incidence of substance abuse, anxiety, or depressive disorders will be completed post-treatment and at 1- and 1.5-month follow-ups. Those assigned to the wait list will complete these assessments and then receive the IaM program after the last follow-up.</detailed_description>
