	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if participation in physical therapy in conjunction with a selective nerve root block in the lumbar spine is more effective than just receiving the injection alone for patients with low back and leg pain from a disk herniation (sciatica).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of Physical Therapy as an Adjunct to a Lumbar Therapeutic Selective Nerve Root Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent reviews report moderate to strong evidence for short-term relief but limited evidence for long-term improvement. Anecdotal reports and case studies suggest good outcomes with various physical therapy interventions however well-designed research studies examining treatments in combination are lacking. The management of lumbar radicular pain often includes the combination of physical therapy and therapeutic selective nerve root blocks with the rationale that reducing inflammation and pain will permit greater participation in physical therapy. The effectiveness of this combination of treatment has not been studied and is the purpose of this pilot study.</detailed_description>
