	<brief_summary>Purpose: The involvement of Natural Killer cells (NK) in the efficiency of the treatment in lymphoma and the beginning of new therapies based on function and activation of NK, justify an improvement of knowledge about the status of the population of NK (number, function, genic expression) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural Killer Cells Function in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method: prospective, monocentric, descriptive study Primary objective: Evaluation of the expression and function of receptors activator of NK cell (KIRs) in patients with CLL at stage A with therapeutic abstention, or stage B or C which require a treatment. Secondary objectives: Measure of the evolution of cytotoxic function of NK cells and theirs biomarkers of activation when the patient receives an immunochemotherapy with Rituximab/ Fludarabine/ Cyclophosphamide (RCF). Verification, by analysis, of functions and biomarkers of the adaptive and innate immunity</detailed_description>
