	<brief_title>Study of a Topical Formulation for the Treatment and Prevention of Raynaud's Phenomenon Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raynaud's Phenomenon is a sometimes debilitating condition in which blood flow to the fingers or toes is compromised when a patient is exposed to cold or stress. Current therapies for Raynaud's are suboptimal because they are associated with significant side effects. In this study, patient responses to cold temperature exposures in a climate-controlled room after application of the study medication are measured.</detailed_description>
