	<brief_summary>This multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, non-placebo-controlled, Phase I study will define the safety profile and tumor response profile of the multi-kinase inhibitor BAY73-4506 as oral treatment in combination with the chemotherapy regimen mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic CRC. It will also determine the impact of the combined administration on the concentration of drugs over time (pharmacokinetics) of BAY73-4506, oxaliplatin, 5 FU, and irinotecan. This study will be conducted at approximately 5 - 8 study centers in Germany. Up to 60 patients will be enrolled into this study to ensute that at least 12 - 15 patients for each combination regimen can be evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics. For this reason a minimum of 20 patients will receive mFOLFOX6 in combination with BAY73-4506 and at least 20 patients will receive FOLFIRI in combination with BAY73-4506.</brief_summary>
