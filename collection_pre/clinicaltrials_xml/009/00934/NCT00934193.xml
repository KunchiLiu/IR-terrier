	<brief_title>Does Peri-Operative Gabapentin Reduce Chronic Post-Thoracotomy Pain?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective double blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the peri-operative use of gabapentin in the prevention or modulation of post-thoracotomy hyperalgesia. Treatment will consist of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin or placebo given preoperatively the night before surgery, based on a computer generated randomized assignment. The treatment group will continue to be medicated with gabapentin 300 mg twice daily for one month following surgery. Those not included in the treatment arm of the study will continue to take a placebo for the same duration. Follow-up will consist of a postoperative visit at approximately 48 hours and a one month clinical visit.</detailed_description>
