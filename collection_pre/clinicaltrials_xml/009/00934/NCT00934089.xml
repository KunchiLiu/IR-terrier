	<brief_summary>This study will characterize the effect of PF-04217329, alone and in combination with latanoprost, on circadian intraocular pressure and blood pressure in glaucoma patients. Blood samples will be collected to measure the amount of active metabolite of PF-04217329 in the plasma following dosing.</brief_summary>
