	<brief_summary>Rotational deformity or malunion causes the most significant functional deficit in these common fractures. The evaluation of the rotation may be performed with the metacarpophalangeal joints flexed although postoperative swelling may not enable this examination with flexion of the fingers. Furthermore, it has been shown that swelling may cause rotation of the digit itself. The investigators propose that the swelling may cause a mistake in the estimation of rotation, during surgery and early follow up period. This is of special importance when open reduction and rigid fixation is performed. Methods: Prospective analysis of XX isolated metacarpal fractures treated, in YY patients was performed. End-on view of the finger-nail was taken with a digital camera on the day of OR, at 2 weeks and at 1 year. The photos were taken on a standard apparatus and from a distance of XX cm and evaluated using ZZ software in comparison with photos taken of the other hand, according to the involved digit. Range of motion, type of fracture and type of fixation were compared.</brief_summary>
