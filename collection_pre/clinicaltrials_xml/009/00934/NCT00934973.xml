	<brief_summary>Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10-22% of the United Kingdom (UK) population, with National Health Service (NHS) costs over £200 million a year. Abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habit affect quality of life, social functioning and time off work. Current general practitioner (GP) treatment relies on a positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug therapies, but many suffer ongoing symptoms. A recent Cochrane review highlighted the lack of research evidence for IBS drugs. Neither GPs, nor patients have good evidence to inform prescribing decisions. However, IBS drugs are widely used: NHS costs 2005 of nearly £10 million for mebeverine and over £8 million for fiber-based bulking agents. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and self-management can be helpful, but poor availability in the NHS restricts its use. Development of web-based CBT could increase access without increased costs. Aims: 1. To pilot an randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of the commonly prescribed medications in UK general practice for IBS: mebeverine (anti-spasmodic) and methylcellulose (bulking-agent) and of the patient CBT based self-management website. 2. To assess the level of support needed for patients using the patient CBT based self-management website for IBS (i.e., initial 30 minute telephone support session with a nurse and email support or not). Plan of Investigation: 135 patients aged 16-60 years with IBS symptoms fulfilling the Rome III criteria, recruited via GP practices, will be randomised to: mebeverine, methylcellulose or placebo for 6 weeks and to the CBT based website with a nurse telephone session and email support, website with minimal support, or no website, thus creating 9 groups. Outcomes: Irritable bowel symptom severity scale and IBS-QOL will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. An intention to treat analysis will be undertaken by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for a factorial trial. Potential Impact: Development of a web-based self-management CBT program for IBS developed in partnership with patients has the potential to benefit large numbers of patients with low cost to the NHS. CBT has been shown to be of benefit for IBS but it's availability is limited due to the high cost and therapist time required for face-to-face CBT. A website can be accessed at a time and place convenient to the patient and the CBT program undertaken at a pace determined by patient needs. The website could be used as a long term support for self-management. Determining the effectiveness of commonly used drug treatments will help patients and doctors in making informed treatment decisions regarding the drug management of IBS symptoms, enabling better targeting of treatment to those who may benefit.</brief_summary>
