	<brief_title>Study of the Efficacy of Percutaneous Implantation of Autologous Myoblasts in Patients With Old Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischaemic heart disease is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity. In particular, myocardial infarction (MI) is of special significance, as the heart muscle cannot regenerate so a region's necrosis leads to the formation of a fibrous scar. In the last few years, new treatments have been developed for the acute phase of myocardial infarction.We have managed to slow down disease progression with these new treatments, but it continues to the development of end stage heart failure. This study tries to determine the benefit of cell cardiomyoplasty with autologous myoblasts in patients with old MI.</detailed_description>
