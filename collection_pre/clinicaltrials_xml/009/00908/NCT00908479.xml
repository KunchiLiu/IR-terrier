	<brief_summary>This study would focus on a new method of adding extra leg homework exercises to the usual therapy delivered in the hospital. We propose to design an exercise program for the affected leg that would be given to the client as homework and done in the client's hospital room or ward. The program would be designed and monitored by a therapist that works in the hospital.</brief_summary>
