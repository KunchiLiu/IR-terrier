	<brief_title>Topical Estriol for Vaginal Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is evidence from human studies that estrogen can give rise to health-promoting changes in the vaginal environment in addition to affecting the thickness of the vaginal epithelium. The purpose of the proposed study is to take the first steps in testing the effects of local estrogen treatment on vaginal health parameters in humans. We have chosen an estriol product because, in comparison with estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) is generally considered to be a weak estrogen. The duration of estriol's interaction with the estrogen receptor is quick and exhibits rapid metabolic clearance. We have chosen a topical route of administration because it appears to result in fewer systemic effects than oral administration, while allowing us to concentrate treatment locally in the areas we wish to affect. Our primary goal is to test whether or not topically applied estrogen results in significant thickening and maturation of the vaginal epithelium. Our secondary goal is to measure the treatment's effects on other parameters of the vagina, such as Lactobacillus colonization and vaginal pH. If estrogen cream does indeed affect the vaginal environment in pre-menopausal women as it does in post-menopausal women, further study would be indicated to determine whether estrogen cream in the vagina decreases risk of infection in pre-menopausal women.</detailed_description>
