	<brief_summary>Research studies have shown a strong association between cancer and blood clots in the veins (also known as deep vein thrombosis). These blood clots can flow to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) which in severe cases may be life threatening. The purpose of this research study is to see if enoxaparin is effective in preventing blood clots in the veins in participants who have cancer of the pancreas, colorectal, non-small cell lung, ovary, or gastric and also have high levels of tissue factor bearing microparticles in their blood (TFMP). TFMP are small particles that are generated from different types of blood cells in the body. In people who have cancer, TFMP are thought to be generated from cancer cells and may represent a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. Enoxaparin has been used to prevent formation of blood clots in patients after abdominal or orthopedic surgery and in patients who suffer from a severe medical illness. Based on these studies, we are investigating to see if it prevents thrombosis in people with certain types of cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participants will be randomized into one of the following study groups. Participants who have high levels of TFMP in their blood will be in one of the two arms indicated. - Arm A (High TFMP): Enoxaparin given subcutaneously (into the skin) daily for 2 months, and lower extremity ultrasound performed at 2 months. - Arm B (High TFMP): Observation, lower extremity ultrasound performed at 2 months. - Arm C (Low TFMP): Observation, lower extremity ultrasound performed at 2 months. - At 2 months, participants will have a physical examination and will be asked questions about their general health and specific questions about any problems they might be having. They will also have a lower extremity ultrasound and blood tests performed at 2 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative therapies do not exist. Eligible malignancies include: Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (locally advanced or metastatic) Colorectal (stage IV) Nonsmall cell lung (unresectable stage III or IV) Relapsed ovarian or stage IV Surgically unresectable or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma First or second line therapy (within 4 weeks of initiating therapy). Minimum age 18 years Life expectancy of greater than 6 months ECOG Performance Status 0, 1, or 2 (Karnofsky 60% or greater). Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as outlined in the protocol. Participants may not be receiving any other study agents. Known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and higher potential for intracranial hemorrhage. Prior history of documented venous thromboembolic event or pulmonary embolism within the last 5 years years (excluding central line associated events whereby patients completed anticoagulation &gt; 3 months previously) Active bleeding or high risk for bleeding (e.g. known acute gastrointestinal ulcer) Any history of significant hemorrhage (requiring hospitalization or transfusion) outside of a surgical setting within the last 5 years History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to enoxaparin or heparin. History of heparininduced thrombocytopenia Presence of coagulopathy (PT or PTT&gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal) Familial bleeding diathesis Known diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation Currently receiving anticoagulant therapy Current use of aspirin (&gt;81mg daily), Clopidogrel (Plavix), cilostazol (Pletal), aspirindipyridamole (Aggrenox), or regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents more than twice weekly. Maximum dose of ibuprofen is 400mg no more than twice per week. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.</criteria>
