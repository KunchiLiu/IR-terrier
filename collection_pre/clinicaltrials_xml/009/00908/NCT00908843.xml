	<brief_title>Prevention of Contrast Induced Nephropathy (NIC) by Intravenous Versus Oral Rehydration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To compare the efficacy of oral versus intravenous hydration in the prevention of the contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in inpatients with different renal function and equal type and volume of contrast. Methods: The clinical trial will include 324 patients with GFR higher or equal to 30 ml/min who will receive intravenous contrast (Iohexol: 300 mg of l/ml; approximate volume: 120 ml at 2-5ml/second) in the following 12-24 hours. Patients with inclusion criteria, and having previously signed a consent form, will be randomised into 3 groups (intravenous hydration, oral and no hydration). Intravenous hydration will be carried out with bicarbonate 1/6M one hour before the test (3ml/Kg/h) and oral hydration with Casen solution in will be carried out 4 hours before (75 ml/10 kg) the intravenous contrast administration. In relation to the hydrated, it should be pointed out that, the same procedure would have been carried out without the study. The follow-up of renal function will be carried out after measuring creatinine and cystatin C in blood and GFR pre- and 24 hour after the test. It will also determine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (N-GAL), IL-8 and F2-Isoprostanes levels in urine and superoxide dismutase activity in erythrocytes, pre- and in different post- test times. Also, in vitro, the effect of contrast on NADPH-oxidase activity of PBLs isolated from 30 control patients will also be studied (10 patients by each group).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hospitalized patients aged less than 18 years provision for the performance of IV contrast (120150 ml) within 1224 h. Nephropathy patients with stage 45 according to the classification of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) of the U.S. National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (NKFKDOQI). The GFR is estimated by the formula Modification Diet Renal Diseases Study (MDRD). Patients undergoing: cardiac catheterization or other proceeding in contrast with the previous week, colonoscopy in 48 hours or have received prior nephrotoxic (aminoglycosides and / or certain chemotherapeutic agents) 2448 hours before the test or in hours.</criteria>
