	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the as efficacy of rituximab as induction therapy in membranous lupus nephritis. Safety and tolerability will additionally be assessed. Subjects will receive open-label 2 courses of rituximab at baseline and at 6 months. They will be followed monthly for 18 months to assess response and durability of response. The hypothesis: B cell depletion will be an effective safe and well tolerated treatment for membranous lupus nephritis (Class V).</brief_summary>
