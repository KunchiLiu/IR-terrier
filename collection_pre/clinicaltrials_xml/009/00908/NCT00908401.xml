	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Breastmilk has a more powerful analgesic effect than oral sucrose to avoid procedural pain in preterm neonates. The objective is to test this hypothesis in a randomized, controlled study using a standardized and validated pain scale (DAN). The sample size is 21 preterm infants in each two groups. The main end point is a reduction of the risk to have a DAN superior to 1 from 80% with oral sucrose to 40% with breastmilk.</brief_summary>
