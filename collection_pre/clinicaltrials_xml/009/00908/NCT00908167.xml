	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I study that determines a tolerable combination of sorafenib, when given sequentially with cytarabine and clofarabine and determines the feasibility of administering this drug combination in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), infantile leukemia (both either AML and/or ALL). AML with prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, and biphenotypic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Combination With Cytarabine and Clofarabine in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research is performed in patients with age of ≥ 0 months old and &lt; 31 years old. In course 1, sorafenib will be given orally (PO) on days 1 to 7. Pharmacokinetic studies on days 1 and 7 and pharmacodynamic assessment on day 8 will be performed. Inter-patient dose escalation or de-escalation of clofarabine and sorafenib will be performed based on tolerability and toxicity. On days 8 to 12, clofarabine and cytarabine will be administered intravenously (IV) without concurrent twice daily sorafenib. Sorafenib will then be given on days 15 to 28 (14 days). Cytarabine and clofarabine may be given before day 8 when the treating physician feels it is necessary after consulting with the primary investigator based on the participant's clinical condition (e.g. disease progression). Intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (age-adjusted doses) with leucovorin rescue (24 and 30 hours after IT therapy) can be given on day 8. Participants with central nervous system (CNS) disease can receive IT therapy weekly until the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses). Triple intrathecal therapy with methotrexate, hydrocortisone and cytarabine is allowed other than day 8 therapy. Response evaluation will be performed on day 22 (or 15 days after initiation of cytarabine and clofarabine) in the first course. One course of therapy will be for 28 days unless disease progression is seen. Participants may receive subsequent courses (up to 5 courses) if there is no disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sorafenib is given on days 1 to 7 and 15 to 28 in subsequent courses, and cytarabine with or without clofarabine will be administered starting on days 8 to 12 (clofarabine can be removed after course 2).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), infantile leukemia (either AML or ALL), AML with prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, or biphenotypic leukemia. Patients with treatmentrelated AML (tAML) will be eligible, provided they meet all other eligibility criteria. Current disease status must be one for which there is no known curative therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life. Patients must meet one of the following criteria: 1. First or greater relapse, 2. Refractory to 1 or more courses of induction or reinduction chemotherapy, or 3. First or greater relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Age: participants must be &lt; 31 years of age at the time of study entry. St. Jude participants will include the following: Participants currently on therapy at St. Jude, or within 3 years of completing therapy at St. Jude must be ≤ 24 years of age. Other participants must be ≤ 21 years of age. Performance status: Karnofsky &gt;50% for ≥ 16 years of age; Lansky &gt;50% for children &lt;16 years of age. Organ Function Requirements: 1. Hepatic: Serum direct bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dl. Alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) ≤4 x ULN 2. Cardiovascular: • Shortening fraction of greater than or equal to 25% by echocardiogram 3. Pulmonary: • Pulse oximetry ≥93% at room air 4. Renal: • Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR greater than or equal to 70 mL/min/1.73m2 or serum creatinine based on age 5. Pancreas: Amylase and lipase ≤ 2 × upper limits of normal Participant or legal guardian, in the opinion of the investigator, is capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the study, and able to provide valid informed consent. A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. Participants who have relapsed while on sorafenib therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined below: Patients &lt; 18 years old: Diastolic Blood Pressure Within The Upper Limit Of Normal Defined as: A diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; the 95th percentile for age and gender despite optimal medical management. Patients ≥ 18 years old Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management. . Use of concomitant chemotherapy, investigational agents, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy other than as specified in the protocol.
