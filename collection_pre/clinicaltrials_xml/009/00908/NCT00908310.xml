	<brief_summary>This will be an international, multi-center, post-marketing surveillance study in patients with moderate renal insufficiency who are administered gadodiamide, Omniscan, during a MRI. Omniscan will be administered intravenously at the medical discretion of the prescribing physician.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject has been referred for a clinically indicated MRI examination with a gadoliniumbased contrast agent. The subject has known or suspected chronic kidney disease with an eGFR greater than or equal to 30mL and &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as measured within 30 days prior to the planned index OMNISCAN administration. The subject agrees to be contacted for followup for 24 months. Patients with known or suspected NSF based on biopsy confirmation or the onset of signs and symptoms of NSF lasting at least 7 days as follows: 1. skin swelling, hardening and tightening; reddened or darkened patches; burning or itching; 2. eyes yellow raised spots on whites of eyes; or 3. bones and muscle stiffness in joints; difficulty in moving or straightening of arms, hands, legs or feet; bone pain especially in hips and ribs or muscle weakness. Patients allergic to any GBCA. Patients with chronic renal disease with a GFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as measured within 30 days prior to the planned OMNISCAN administration. Patients with acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepatorenal syndrome or in the peri operative liver transplantation period.</criteria>
