	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients who have undergone surgery for localized kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Localized Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify consistent patterns of VEGF expression, E-cadherin regulation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activity, and carbonic anhydrase 9 activity as predictive factors in the development of aggressive tumor behavior in tumor tissue samples from patients with localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma. OUTLINE: Previously collected tumor tissue samples are examined by immunohistochemistry for levels of expression of five different factors related to aggressive tumor behavior (i.e., VEGF expression, E-cadherin regulation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activity, and carbonic anhydrase 9 activity). Samples are compared to positive tissue controls (i.e., VEGF- tonsil; E- cadherin-normal breast or endometrium; MMP2- placenta) and a negative control (i.e., isotype matched normal serum) to identify consistent patterns of expression/activity of these factors. Levels of expression are quantified as 5-level scores (0 to 4 scale) and differences between any two areas of a tumor are analyzed.</detailed_description>
