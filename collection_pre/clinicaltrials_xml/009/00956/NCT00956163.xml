	<brief_summary>This phase 0 trial studies whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in finding bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan and whole body MRI, may help find and diagnose bone metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Body Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Scan and Whole Body MRI in Finding Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference standard. II. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference standard. OUTLINE: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan, fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan, and whole-body MRI for the detection of bone metastases. Patients with discordant imaging results (negative bone scan and positive PET/CT scan and/or MRI) undergo additional imaging at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.</detailed_description>
