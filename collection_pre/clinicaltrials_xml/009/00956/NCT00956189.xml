	<brief_summary>The investigators developed an easy identification model to identify metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who received treatment of clozapine, olanzapine, or risperidone. The accuracy of the investigators' models showed well. In the study, the investigators aim to (1) to examine whether the developed identification models can be generalized to patients taking other antipsychotics or patients with other diagnoses; (2) to develop an easy risk score and validate it; (3) to switch antipsychotics to amisulpride or aripiprazole for those with metabolic syndrome, and compare the changes of metabolic parameters including adiponectin, and analyze their association with genetic variants, demography, and clinical variables; (4) to establish models using artificial neural network and statistic method to predict metabolic response after a switch to amisulpride or aripiprazole; (5) to investigate the effect of antipsychotics on adiponectin gene expression and secretion during the differentiation process of 3T3L1 adipocytes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stage I for identification of metabolic syndrome: A diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, mood disorders, or anxiety disorders based on DSMIVTR criteria. Age at least 20 years old. The current antipsychotic drugs have been used for at least 3 months before evaluation. Psychiatrically stable with Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale (CGIS) not greater than 5 Severe uncontrolled medical illnesses, including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and metabolic diseases (eg. cancer, poorcontrol hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and other metabolic diseases). Organic mental or neurological disorder, substance abuse or dependence (alcohol, amphetamine, heroin). Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Patients from Yuli Veterans Hospital, who attended our previous study of identification model. Stage II for switch response: The same as Stage I criteria. Fulfill the metabolic syndrome criteria. The same as Stage I criteria except the 4th item. Treated with depot form of antipsychotics.</criteria>
