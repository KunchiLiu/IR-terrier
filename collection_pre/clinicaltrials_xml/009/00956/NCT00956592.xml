	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate the utility of a video assisted device for intubation (placement of a breathing tube) during surgery. This study specifically aims to compare a video assisted intubation with the CMAC laryngoscope to conventional devices in the setting of intubations predicted to be difficult.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be specifically screened for predictors by history and physical exam of potential airway difficulty. The role of video laryngoscopy in airways predicted to be difficult is poorly defined. This study aims to recognize if video laryngoscopy is more useful than conventional laryngoscopy as a first attempt for those with anticipated difficulty.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patients presenting for elective surgery who are fasted and who have one of the following difficult airway predictors: mallampati classification 3 mallampati classification 4 Reduced mouth opening (&lt;3cm) reduced cervical motion history of previous difficult intubation or multiple laryngoscopy attempts Patients less than 18 years old, patients who are not fasted (&gt;6 hrs. NPO) Patients who have contraindications to the administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs Patients who have a documented history of intubation on first attempt with CL grade 1 laryngeal view Patients who are deemed to difficult and dangerous to anesthetize without first securing an airway.</criteria>
