	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To demonstrate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination irbesartan/amlodipine 150/5 mg is superior to that of amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) as measured by home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) after 5 weeks of treatment (W5) Secondary Objective: - To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination irbesartan/amlodipine 150/5 mg with that of amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy after 5 weeks of treatment (W5) - To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of the fixed combination therapy irbesartan/amlodipine 150/10 mg with that of amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy at the end of treatment (W10) - To examine in each treatment group the change from week 5 to week 10 in SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) assessed by HBPM and by office blood pressure measurement (OBPM) - To determine the incidence and severity of adverse events</brief_summary>
