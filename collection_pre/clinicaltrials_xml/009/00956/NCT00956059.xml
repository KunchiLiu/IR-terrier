	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effect of Low-dose Prednisone Combined With MMF and FK506 in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) is characterized by heavy proteinuria and nephritic syndrome in clinic. The major pathological change is scarring of the glomerulus that is focal and segmental. The incidence of FSGS is increasing in recent years, but no unified protocol for FSGS treatment has been provided. Corticosteroid is the primary drug for FSGS treatment in clinic. However, corticosteroid treatment has a low response rate as 20% in clinic but some severe side-effects. The side-effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment urged researchers to find more reliable and secure methods for FSGS treatment. The new immunosuppressants shed light on FSGS treatment recently. The usage of immunosuppressants to FSGS treatment is in the preliminary stage and accounts for a few problems. The main problems include the uncertainty of curative effects, the lack of large-scale clinical trial, the side-effects of long-term application, and the high recurrence rate after withdraw. FSGS is immune-induced damage, which includes abnormality of many steps in humoral immunity and cellular immunity. According to it, we designed to inhibit the immune response at multi-targets with Prednisone Combined With MMF and FK506. Thus the dosage of these drugs can be decreased to a secure level for long-term treatment while the side-effects can be controlled well. Prednisone Combined With MMF and FK506 then can be used to FSGS treatment with effectiveness and security.</detailed_description>
