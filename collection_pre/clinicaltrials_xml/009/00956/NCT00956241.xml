	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to compare the functional and surgical results of the J-pouch with those of the side-to-end anastomosis and their impact on quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>J-pouch Versus Side-to-end Coloanal Anastomosis After Preoperative Radiotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invalidating anorectal dysfunctions are common after restorative rectal surgery. Improvement of functional results by the technically more demanding J-pouch has been demonstrated in comparison with the straight coloanal anastomosis. In the present multicenter randomized trial we assessed whether the J-pouch is also superior to the side-to-end coloanal anastomosis.</detailed_description>
