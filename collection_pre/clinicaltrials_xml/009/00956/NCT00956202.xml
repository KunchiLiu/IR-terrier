	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate data on immunogenicity and safety of the monovalent H1N1 vaccine in support of the development and registration. Primary objectives: - To describe the immune response to vaccines 21 days after each vaccination in all participants. - To describe the antibody persistence eight months after the first vaccine administration using HAI method, in a subset of participants who received two injections. - To describe the immune response against the A/H1N1 strain using HAI method 21 days after a vaccination with the 2010-2011 NH seasonal TIV administered approximately 13 months after the first vaccination in the subset of participants who received two injections. - To describe the safety profile of each vaccine in all participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Inactivated Swine-Origin A/H1N1 Influenza Vaccines in Healthy European Subjects Aged 3 to 17 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive two injections of their randomized vaccine on Day 0 and Day 21, respectively. A subset of children and adolescents participants eligible for the antibody persistence evaluation were sampled 8 months after the first vaccination, they will also be proposed to receive the 2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere (NH) seasonal Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) 13 months after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity response will be evaluated before vaccination and 21 days after vaccination with TIV, respectively.</detailed_description>
