	<brief_title>Remote Management of Diabetic Patients Via Data Transmission by Accu-Chek 360 Software</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a non-inferiority study between two groups: a control group, which will receive 5 routine office visits in one year; and a study group which will receive 3 routine office visits in the same time, and have two visits conducted by computer interaction, using the Accuchek 360 software. All will be capable of independent care of their diabetes. All patients will be 19-65 years of age. The end-points will include similar changes in hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, lipid fractions, and similar levels of patient satisfaction with care. There will be 50 patients in each group, matched for age and sex distribution, educational level, computer literacy, and type of diabetes.</detailed_description>
