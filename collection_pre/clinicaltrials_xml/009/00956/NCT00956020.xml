	<brief_summary>Autologous platelet rich fibrin matrix will release growth factors which could increase the production of dermal proteins or affect the vascularity and status of neighboring tissues. This study is designed to evaluate the histologic and biochemical effect of injection of platelet rich fibrin matrix into the skin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Mechanism of Action of Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix (PRFM) in Producing Skin Volume Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be treated with platelet rich fibrin matrix into the skin of the inner aspect of the upper arm. Injected areas will be monitored clinically and will also undergo biopsies between 30 minutes and 12 weeks after treatment. Specimen of treated areas will undergo histologic and biochemical analysis and comparison to standard laboratory control specimen of untreated skin.</detailed_description>
