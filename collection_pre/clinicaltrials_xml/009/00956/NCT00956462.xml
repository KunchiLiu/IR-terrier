	<brief_title>Steroids Versus Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Following Glaucoma Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a chronic disease of the eye which results in gradual loss of nerve fibres, resulting in visual loss. The mainstay of treatment is reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), which has been shown to preserve vision, and glaucoma surgery aims to achieve this. One type of surgery involves insertion of a glaucoma drainage device (GDD). Following surgery steroid eye drops are commonly used in order to reduce the inflammation that occurs as a result of the surgery. However, a common side effect of steroid eye drops is a rise in eye pressure. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) eye drops do not have this side effect and are used as an alternative to steroids following other types of eye surgery. Use of NSAID drops following GDD surgery may result in improved eye pressure. This study aims to evaluate the eye pressure response to NSAID eye drops following GDD surgery.</detailed_description>
