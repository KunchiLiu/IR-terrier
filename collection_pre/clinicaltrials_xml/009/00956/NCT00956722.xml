	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory trial of Bovine Colostrum powder to decrease translocation of gut-derived microbial products and immune activation in HCV infection. The study is designed as a single-arm, open-label, before-and after exploratory trial of 10 weeks of Bovine Colostrum Powder (BCP) to reduce translocation of intestinal microbial products and immune activation in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The study population will include HCV-infected (genotype 1) men and women, ≥ 18 years of age, not receiving anti-viral therapy at the time of enrollment and for at least the previous 3 months. Having failed previous anti-viral therapy (non responders), HCV recurrence after 72 weeks of therapy, developed side effects which mandated stopping anti viral therapy, or not considered eligible for initiation of such treatment, with a plasma HCV RNA level ≥ 1000 I.U.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Chronic HCV infection (genotype 1), as documented by a positive anti HCV titer, and confirmed by positive HCV RNA. Non responder to previous antiviral therapy, HCV recurrence after 72 weeks of therapy, previous antiviral therapy stopped due to side effects, or not a candidate for treatment with interferon + ribavirin. No antiviral therapy for at least 3 months. HCV RNA ≥1,000 IU obtained within 30 days prior to study entry. Not currently listed for liver transplantation Female study subjects of reproductive potential (defined as girls who have reached menarche or women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before initiating the protocolspecified medication(s) unless otherwise specified by product labeling. All study subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study volunteer must agree that two reliable methods of contraception will be used simultaneously while receiving the protocolspecified medication and for 1 month after stopping the medication. NOTE: Hormonalbased methods alone are not sufficient. At least two of the following methods MUST be used appropriately unless documentation of menopause, sterilization, or azoospermia is present: Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. Condoms are recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV transmission; Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; IUD; Hormonalbased contraception. Study subjects who are not of reproductive potential (girls who have not reached menarche or women who have been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives. Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff is required by one of the following: Physician report/letter; Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a laboratory report of azoospermia is required to document successful vasectomy); Discharge summary; Laboratory report of azoospermia; FSH measurement elevated into the menopausal range as established by the reporting laboratory. Men and women age &gt; 18 years. Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to provide informed consent. Pregnancy or BreastFeeding Continuous use of the following medications for more than 3 days within 30 days of study entry: Immunosuppressives; Immune modulators; Systemic glucocorticoids; Antineoplastic agents; Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days prior to entry.</criteria>
