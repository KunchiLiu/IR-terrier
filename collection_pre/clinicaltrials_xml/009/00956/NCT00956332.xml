	<brief_title>Safety Study of MultiGeneAngio in Patients With Chronic Critical Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 16 million patients worldwide (1 in 20 people over the age of 50) suffer from peripheral arterial disease(PAD). PAD is characterized by narrowing or occlusion of vessels supplying blood to the lower limbs, most often due to atherosclerosis. Symptoms of PAD include claudication that may progress to critical limb ischemia manifested by rest pain, tissue loss and gangrene, which eventually may necessitate amputation. MultiGeneAngio is a cell therapy-based product developed for treatment of patients with chronic critical limb ischemia due to narrow or blocked leg arteries. MultiGeneAngio is composed of endothelial and smooth muscle cells that are isolated from a short vein segment harvested from the patient's arm. After isolation the cells are expanded, characterized, and gene modified by transfer of angiogenic genes. MultiGeneAngio is a clear cell suspension injected intra-arterially at the site of blockage using a standard diagnostic catheter, in order to create and expand new collateral arteries, and thereby improve blood flow to an ischemic limb. Comprehensive pre-clinical studies, as well as clinical experience with PAD patients suffering from claudication showed that production and administration of MultiGeneAngio was feasible and safe, as no apparent drug-related adverse events have been observed. Moreover, follow-up data of peak walking times imply a beneficial trend of this efficacy end-point. Additional follow-up data will continue to be collected to help evaluate the safety and efficacy of MultiGeneAngio.</detailed_description>
