	<brief_summary>Cancer pain is common in advanced cancer patients. Opioids are the mainstay of treatment in cancer pain. Responsiveness to and tolerability of opioids is, amongst others, determined by small variations in human DNA. Using blood samples from clinically well-defined cancer pain patients, the investigators are going to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that are known to be involved in responsiveness to opioids and sensitivity to pain.</brief_summary>
