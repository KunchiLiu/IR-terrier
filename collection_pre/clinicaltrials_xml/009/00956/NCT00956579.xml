	<brief_summary>Among the most commonly reported symptoms of autism is heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Children and adults with autism spectrum disorders often react with aversion to various sounds (e.g., by covering their ears and screaming) especially at an early age. The investigators believe that this is because autism spectrum disorders affect how sensory input is experienced. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate sensory processing abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders, or, in other words, to evaluate how and why children and adults with autism spectrum disorders experience external sensory information (vision, audition, touch) differently than healthy children and adults. Because some of the same abnormalities are also reported in children and adults with developmental language disorders such as language delay or dyslexia, the investigators are also interested in how that population experiences external sensory information.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To study how sensory information is processed by the brain, we primarily use an instrument called MEG (MagnetoEncephaloGraphy), which measures the magnetic brainwaves emitted by our brains. The device does not have any output (i.e., there is no magnetic field); it only measures the waves produced in the brain. We measure those waves as the participants in the study listen to, view, or otherwise experience simple, non painful, stimuli. For instance, participants may listen to words while sitting in the MEG room, and watching a movie with the sound turned off. We then combine this information with pictures of the brain from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging - when available), to get an idea about both the anatomy and the function of the brain, so that we can study how the brains of populations with autism spectrum disorders or language disorders may be different from those of healthy populations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All of the following criteria must be met by all participants: The participant or the participant's legal guardian is able to understand and is willing to comply with the requirements of the study The participant meets the age requirements (645 years old) The participant or legal guardian has signed an Informed Consent Form specific to this study, and is able to understand the consent form. The participant must have English as their first language. The participant must have a nonverbal IQ &gt; 80 For the ASD/language disorder group only: Autism Spectrum Disorder: Participants must meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder on BOTH the ADIR and the ADOS. Language Disorder: Participants will evidence expressive and receptive language disorders as indicated by a combination of standard scores 1.3 Standard Deviations below the mean for their age on at least 3 of the 4 Core Subtests of the CELFIV, and on at least one of the following: Test for the Reception of Grammar, Expressive Vocabulary Test, or the Peabody Preschool Vocabulary Test will be included. The following exclusion criteria apply to both control and autism groups: Any volunteer for whom informed consent cannot be obtained Volunteers diagnosed with a mental condition such as depression, anxiety, aggression, hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder (with or without hyperactivity). Volunteers with metal braces, extensive dental work involving metals, implanted electromagnetically activated medical equipment (cardiac pacemakers, neurostimulators, functioning infusion pumps), all of which would interfere with the MEG signal, will be excluded from the MEG portion of the study Volunteers with any medically diagnosed sensory loss Volunteers with a known genetic disorder (e.g. Tourette's syndrome, etc), or other medical condition affecting the brain, such as progressive encephalopathy as well as those who are on high doses of multiple antiseizure medications and have frequent, uncontrolled seizures Asphyxia at birth or any other time, premature birth (Greater than 37 weeks gestation) For the control group only Volunteers who score below the autism spectrum cutoff (in the normal range)on the ADOS and SCQ Volunteers on any sort of neuropsychopharmacological treatment (including antidepressants, stimulants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines). For the autism group only Children or adults not meeting criteria for autism spectrum disorder Volunteers with comorbid disorders such as tuberous sclerosis or fragile X.</criteria>
