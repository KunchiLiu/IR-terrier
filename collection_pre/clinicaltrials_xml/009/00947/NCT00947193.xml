	<brief_summary>Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are inherited bleeding disorders caused by mutations in the gene for factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively. These proteins are essential for blood clotting. The lack of FVIII/FIX can produce bleeding episodes that cause damage of the bone, muscles, joints, and tissues. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of the disease in approximately 10-30% of patients with hemophilia and results in severe manifestations. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally delivered, investigational drug that acts to overcome the effects of the premature stop codon, potentially enabling the production of functional FVIII/FIX. This study is a Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ataluren in patients with HA or HB due to a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether ataluren can safely increase FVIII/FIX activity levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ataluren (PTC124®) in Hemophilia A and B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients with hemophilia A or hemophilia B due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with an investigational drug called ataluren (PTC124). Evaluation procedures to determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within 14 days prior to the start of treatment. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will then participate in a 28-day treatment period. Within the 28-day period, ataluren (PTC124) treatment will be taken 3 times per day with meals for 14 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg (morning), 10 mg/kg (midday) and 20 mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of approximately 14 days without treatment. During the study, ataluren (PTC124) efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated periodically with measurement of FVIII/FIX activity and inhibitor levels, other blood tests, and urinalysis.</detailed_description>
