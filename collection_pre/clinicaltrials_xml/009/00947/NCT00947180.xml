	<brief_summary>This study has been completed. The following is a brief description of the aims, methods, and results of the study: Previous small studies suggest that chronic proctalgia (chronic recurring pain in the anal canal or rectum), which is also called levator ani syndrome, can be treated with biofeedback to teach relaxation of pelvic floor muscles, or electrogalvanic stimulation (electrical stimulation to relax muscles), or massage of pelvic floor muscles. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of these three treatments, to determine how they work physiologically, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit. Methods: Subjects had to meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic proctalgia and to report pain at least once a week. They had to also be free of medical or psychiatric disorders that could explain their chronic proctalgia. Patients qualified to enter the study were separated into two groups based on whether they reported tenderness when the examining physician pressed on the levator ani muscles of the pelvic floor. All 157 patients who were enrolled received 9 sessions of psychological counseling plus biofeedback or electrogalvanic stimulation or massage. The results of treatment were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the end of treatment.</brief_summary>
