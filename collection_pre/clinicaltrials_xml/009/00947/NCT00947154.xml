	<brief_summary>No medication has been reliably shown to benefit those suffering from trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling). The current study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of the medication aripiprazole for treatment of trichotillomania (TTM). Patients will take a gradually increased dose of the medication in an open-label study to see whether it relieves hair-pulling urges, decreases hair pulling behavior and is well tolerated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Aripiprazole in Trichotillomania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is an 8-week, open-label trial of aripiprazole. The study would enroll 10 patients diagnosed with TTM meeting DSM-IV criteria. Subjects would start at a dose of 5 mg, which can be reduced to 2 mg if initial dose is not tolerated. Dose will be increased by 5 mg every two weeks (or as tolerated, with a minimum increase of 2 mg) until a maximum target dose of 15 mg is reached at the beginning of week 5. Dosing would not be increased if a patient showed clinical improvement at a lower dose (defined as a 30% reduction in Massachusetts General Hairpulling Scale) or was intolerant of a further dose increase. Dose may not be increased after week 5; at any point it may be decreased because of intolerability. Modified dosing of aripiprazole will not automatically happen if a patient is taking fluoxetine or paroxetine, but awareness that increased aripiprazole levels are associated with P450 2D inhibition (and consequent tolerability of a given dose) may factor into clinical decisions to increase, maintain or decrease aripiprazole dosage. Effectiveness: The primary measure of drug effect would be a change from baseline to endpoint in the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGHHS) as well as the actual-pulling subscale (items 4,5,6; MGHHS-AP). Secondary measures would include the Clinical Global Impressions_Improvement scale (CGI-I), 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). Assessments: Primary efficacy measures will be assessed at baseline and at the end of weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8, or early termination. Week 2 and 6 follow-ups may occur over the telephone. Safety and tolerability will be assessed at each two-week interval. Secondary end-points will be assessed at baseline and weeks 4 and 8, or early termination. Type and Number of Experimental Subjects and Controls: This study would enroll 10 patients at Stanford in a single-site study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described separately. Children will not be included in this proposed study, because the Investigator does not have clinical competency in child psychiatry and childhood Trichotillomania may be a different disorder than the condition seen in adults.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible patients: Must be outpatients between the ages of 18 and 65 at the start of study May be male or female Have DSMIV trichotillomania of at least 6 months duration Allowed psychotropic medications are limited to: SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine) and mirtazapine, as long as the dosage has not changed for 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. Other allowed medications include nonhypnotic sleeping agents, specifically trazodone, diphenhydramine, hydoxyzine and ramelteon. If a patient is taking nonallowed psychotropic medications, he/she must be titrated off by the prescribing physician and be off of the medication for at least 2 weeks prior to trial enrollment. We will not exclude patients meeting DSMIV criteria for: body dysmorphic disorder; major depression; dysthymia; GAD, social phobia, panic disorder. We will exclude patients suffering from: organic mental disorders; psychotic mental disorders including delusional disorder, somatic type; mental retardation or developmental disabilities; substance or alcohol abuse; depressive disorders with current suicidal risk; factitious disorders; dissociative disorders; obsessive compulsive disorder; personality disorders sufficiently severe to interfere with cooperation with the study; bipolar I or II disorder. Patients taking psychotropic agents other than those specifically listed in item d above. If a patient is taking nonallowed psychotropic medications, he/she must be titrated off such medications by the prescribing physician and be off of the medication for 2 weeks prior to trial enrollment. Pregnant or nursing women. Patients with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to aripiprazole.</criteria>
