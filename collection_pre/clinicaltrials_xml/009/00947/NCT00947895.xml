	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare intramuscular (IM) ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone) and intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) for the treatment of an MS (Multiple Sclerosis) relapse (exacerbation) after sub-response to an initial 3 day course of IV methylprednisolone.</brief_summary>
