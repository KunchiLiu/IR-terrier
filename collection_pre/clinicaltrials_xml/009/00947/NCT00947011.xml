	<brief_summary>This research is being done to evaluate the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone) on insulin release and to examine whether there is extra insulin release when GLP-1 is not allowed to be rapidly inactivated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition on Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present proposal is to 1) examine the role of DPP-4 inhibition on insulin release during a hyperglycemic clamp while GLP-1 is being infused and, 2) further elucidate the role of the metabolite of GLP-1, that is GLP-1 9-36 amide (GLP-1m). During stable and very reproducible elevated plasma glucose levels the effect of increased active incretin levels with DPP-4 inhibitors should result in increased plasma insulin levels. Therefore the aim of this protocol is to document whether plasma insulin levels are increased following GLP-1 infusion in the presence or absence of DPP-4 inhibitors. Additionally, we have shown that some improvement in glucose homeostasis during GLP-1 administration is due in part to the metabolite of GLP-1, i.e. GLP-1 (9-36) amide (GLP-1m). Therefore, we will also test the role of the latter by infusing GLP-1m when the volunteers are being treated with DPP-4 inhibitors.</detailed_description>
