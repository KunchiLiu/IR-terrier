	<brief_summary>Early connections has two broad goals: - to identify risk indices for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 6 to 24 month old infants who have an older sibling with ASD or infants who have an older neurotypical sibling. - to assess whether it is possible to alter risk processes through early intervention with high-risk infants, thereby reducing social-communication delays or the severity of autism symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Connections, Early Detection and Intervention in Infants at Risk for Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers at the University of Washington want to learn more about the benefits of early monitoring and intervention for younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The information gained in this study may improve methods of early detection and intervention for infants who may be at risk for developing autism and lead to better outcome for these young children and their families. Participants include families with a child who has been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder or typical development and a younger sibling 12 months old or younger. The study protocol includes: (1) comprehensive infant evaluations at the University of Washington Autism Center at 6-months, 12-months, 18-months and 24-months of age. (2) Developmental screening for the older sibling. (3) Questionnaires and phone interviews for parents. (4) Random assignment to an assessment and monitoring intervention group or a University of Washington intervention group. All families will receive advice regarding appropriate intervention services. Families who are assigned to the UW intervention will take part in a parent delivered intervention.</detailed_description>
