	<brief_summary>This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Herceptin in combination with Avastin and sequential Xeloda in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after early relapse on adjuvant Herceptin therapy. Patients will receive Herceptin at a loading dose of 8mg/kg iv followed by 6mg/kg iv every three weeks, and Avastin 15mg/kg every 3 weeks. At first sign of disease progression Xeloda 1000mg/m2 bid po will be added on days 1-14 of each cycle, or docetaxel (100mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks) if Xeloda is not indicated for a patient. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease-progression on second line treatment and target sample size is &lt;100.</brief_summary>
