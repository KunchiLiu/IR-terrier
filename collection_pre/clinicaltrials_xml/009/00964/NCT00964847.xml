	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 24 weeks of either a blood pressure education and walking program versus a yoga exercise program versus the combined intervention of blood pressure education and yoga on reducing mild to moderate high blood pressure in pre-hypertension and stage 1 hypertension subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Modification and Blood Pressure Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of 24 weeks of a structured yoga exercise program (YP) versus a blood pressure education and walking program (BPEP) versus the combined intervention on reducing mild to moderate high blood pressure in adults with pre-hypertension or stage 1 hypertension. This will be done through a single center trial using a parallel design. All potential subjects will be screened first by telephone and then by 2 outpatient visits at the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Eligible subjects will then make 3 visits to the CTRC where they will be admitted overnight to have non-invasive 24-hour recordings of BP, as well as have periodic blood, urine and saliva collections. The entire study duration is 28 weeks (24 weeks post-randomization) and includes a total of 7 evaluation visits (including 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging visits) and a termination visit. Subjects will be randomized to YP, BPEP or the combined intervention of YP and BPEP.</detailed_description>
