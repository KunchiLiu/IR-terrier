	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to assess the effects of GSK1014802 and a positive control, lidocaine, on tests of peripheral nerve excitability. This will be a double blind, placebo controlled, 4-period cross over study. Approximately 20 subjects will be randomised to one of two doses of a GSK1014802, lidocaine and placebo with at least 2 weeks between sessions. A follow-up will occur 7-15 days after the last dose. During treatment session 3 on the 6th October 2009, one subject had a pattern of AEs of severe intensity, suggestive of brain stem toxicity / encephalopathy during the lidocaine/saline infusion period. Although recognised in the literature when lidocaine was used in patients for treatment of pain, these AEs were unusual in studies in healthy subjects. The study was suspended to allow re-evaluation of the risk:benefit balance of lidocaine/saline infusion in healthy subjects in this study. It was decided that continuation of the use of lidocaine (positive control) would risk the safety of subjects. Continuation without the positive control was not possible as it would compromise the scientific integrity of the design.</brief_summary>

History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. Subjects with a history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening.

The subject has a history of chronic pain before screening. The subject has used any topical steroid in the previous 30 days if, in the opinion of the investigator this is likely to interfere with study assessments. The subject has used any topical capsaicin preparations on the forearms in the previous 30 days.
