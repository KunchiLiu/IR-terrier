	<brief_summary>Effective treatment of pain after hip fractures is very important but difficult. It is often an old patient who has many adverse effects with the use of morphine. This is a randomized pilot study where the investigators want to compare Norspan plaster to Oxycontin tablets to patients with particular kind of hip fractures. The investigators will evaluate mobilization, pain, use of rescue medicine, adverse effects and length of stay. No clinical study about the effect of Norspan as acute painkiller has never been done before. Can the investigators get the patients mobilized earlier with less adverse effects?</brief_summary>
