	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Efavirenz may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well efavirenz works as second-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efavirenz as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy of efavirenz as second-line monotherapy, in terms of non-morphological progression at 2 months, in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Secondary - Evaluate non-morphological progression in these patients at 4 months. - Evaluate non-biological progression in these patients at 2 and 4 months. - Evaluate the quality of life of these patients at 2 and 4 months. - Evaluate the overall, progression-free, and event-free survival of these patients. - Evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of efavirenz in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral efavirenz once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the QLQ-C30 at baseline and at 2 and 4 months. After completion of study therapy patients are followed up every 2 months.</detailed_description>
