	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of multisite left ventricular (LV) biventricular (BiV) pacing on LV hemodynamics in CRT patients. It is hypothesized that the effect of simultaneous BiV pacing utilizing multisite LV pacing on LV hemodynamics will be superior to conventional BiV pacing.</brief_summary>
