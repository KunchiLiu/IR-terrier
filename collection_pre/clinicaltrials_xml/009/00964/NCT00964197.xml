	<brief_summary>FemmeJock is a pelvic floor support system developed by pelvic floor physiotherapists for patients with pelvic organ prolapse in order to ameliorate symptoms of pelvic floor pressure and discomfort. The device is a girdle to be worn on the outside of underwear. The device is machine washable and there are no documented risks with wearing it. This product is currently being used by pelvic floor physiotherapists and has been subjectively reported by individual accounts as being successful in improving pelvic floor symptoms. The efficacy of this product has not been previously studied in women with pelvic organ prolapse. The investigators are proposing a pilot study with the following specific aims: 1. to assess patient satisfaction and continuation of use of the FemmeJock support system after 3 months of treatment. 2. to describe, if any, the reasons for discontinuation associated with the use of this product, and 3. to assess whether women experience improvement of pelvic floor symptoms after using this product.</brief_summary>
