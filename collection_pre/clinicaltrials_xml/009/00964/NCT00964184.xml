	<brief_summary>This is a phase IV study of 3.5 years duration to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic correlates of diabetes (non-Type 1 in young non-obese Asian Indians in North India and pilot case control study to evaluate the efficacy of sitagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) in a sub-group of the study population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A phase IV on T2DM with BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 and age 14-40 years. Primary Objectives: - To investigate phenotype (body composition, anthropometry, pancreatic imaging and endocrine function, insulin resistance, autoantibodies, and other biochemical variables) and genetic (known mutations and polymorphisms) correlates in young (age 14-40 years) diabetic patients (non-type 1). Secondary Objectives: - To study anthropometric and body fat distribution including truncal fat, subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat in non-obese young patients with diabetes (non-type 1). - To study whether insulin secretion, insulin resistance or a combination of both is/are the predominant defect(s) in non-obese young diabetics (non-type 1). - To study the prevalence of autoimmunity and/or specific genetic abnormalities in this subgroup of diabetics. - To estimate approximate prevalence of diagnostic subcategories based on the sample of population, and profile of complications in each category. - To propose rational use of specialized investigations (e.g. GAD65, HNF-1α mutations etc) while investigating a newly diagnosed young diabetic. - To determine the rational therapeutic option and prognosis in this sub-population of diabetics based on anthropometric, biochemical, and etiological profiles. - Sample size: 205 patients to be enrolled and 120 patients to be enrolled for sub group study</detailed_description>
