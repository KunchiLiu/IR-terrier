	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography, may help find and diagnose cancer. It is not yet known whether standard diagnostic procedures are more effective when given with or without fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography in finding cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography given together with standard diagnostic procedures to see how well it works compared with standard diagnostic procedures alone in finding cancer in patients with a blood clot in a vein.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Diagnostic Procedures With or Without Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Positron Emission Tomography in Finding Cancer in Patients With a Blood Clot in a Vein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Demonstrate the efficacy, in terms of increased numbers of cancer diagnoses, of PET-CT with 18-FDG in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. Secondary - Assess the risk of cancer detected at 1 year. - Assess whether PET allows earlier detection of cancer. - Evaluate survival. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. All patients undergo standard (clinical and biological) diagnostic tests for cancer. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 diagnostic arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo diagnostic fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET in addition to standard methods. - Arm II: Patients only undergo standard diagnostic methods. Patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>
