	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving paclitaxel together with cisplatin as first-line therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel and Cisplatin as First-Line Treatment for Patients With Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel and cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy in patients with stage IC-IV ovarian epithelial cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV and cisplatin IV once every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
