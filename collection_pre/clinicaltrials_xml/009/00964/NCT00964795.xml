	<brief_title>Open-label Extension Study of Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI; EYLEA速; BAY86-5321) in Neovascular ("Wet") Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose evaluated in this study, Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI; EYLEA速; BAY86-5321) 2mg, will be the higher of the 2 dose strengths evaluated in parent study VGFT-OD-0605 (NCT00509795) and is the dose level administered in study VGFT-OD-0702 (NCT00527423), a long-term open-label extension study. For these reasons, this dose has been selected for this extension study. Participants will be seen in the clinic for quarterly visits starting with day 1 to assess safety. Study drug will be administered on an as-needed basis at the discretion of the investigator with a minimum allowed interval of every 4 weeks and a maximum allowed interval of every 12 weeks. This study will assess the frequency that re-treatment is needed and the effect of continued Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI; EYLEA速; BAY86-5321) treatment on BCVA.</detailed_description>
