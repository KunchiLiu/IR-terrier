	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate analytical methods such as ELISA and OPKA that measure the activity of vaccine-induced pneumococcal antibodies. After validation of ELISA and OPKA, pneumococcal antibodies were measured by ELISA and OPKA in paired samples before and after immunization (pneumococcal PS vaccine) in children, adults and elderly.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the immune response to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in the elderly, samples from children, young adults and elderly were obtained before and one month after vaccination. The quantitative and qualitative response to the vaccine were measured by the ELISA and opsonophagocytic killing assay for eight vaccine type serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) and one vaccine-related serotype (6A).</detailed_description>
