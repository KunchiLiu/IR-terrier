	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis is one of the most frequent skin diseases. The disease is often worst during winter months when the skin is drier. Mild to moderate cases of atopic dermatitis are often controlled by a moisturizer alone. The use of moisturizers has been shown to have beneficial effects on atopic dermatitis. It can break the dry skin cycle by hydrating the upper layer of the skin which may prevent the recurrence of the disease and can reduce the use of cream or ointment medications such as corticosteroids. Formulation 609580 20 was developed to keep the moisturizing efficacy of formulation 609209 but to improve its tolerance and cosmetic acceptability (easier to apply, nicer texture, etc.). The new formulation contains the same quantity of shea butter and glycerin but in a different excipient (inactive substance) than the commercial product. In addition, vitamin B3 was added to see if it could help in reducing itching. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of two study products in children with atopic dermatitis. One of the study products (formulation 609580 20) is not commercially available (outside of clinical trials such as this one). The other study product (formulation 609209) has been approved in Canada and is currently available commercially under the trade name Lipikar Baume. For this study the child will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: - Group 1: 50 children will receive formulation 609209, the commercial formula for 42 days and will receive formulation 609580 20, the new formula, for 14 days. - Group 2: 50 children will receive formulation 609580 20, the new formula, for 42 days and will receive formulation 609209, the commercial formula, for 14 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerance and Efficacy of Formulation 609580 20 Versus Formulation 609209 in Children With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized clinical trial performed at five (5) centers (Montreal, Laval, Quebec City, (Quebec); Markham, London (Ontario), Canada). One hundred (100) patients are enrolled in the study. Subjects and parent(s) or guardian are asked to present to the clinic for five (5) visits (Screening, D0, D7, D42, D56). Formulation 609580 20 or 609209 is applied twice a day (morning and evening) to the whole body for a total of 42 days and then there is a crossover between the two formulations. Efficacy is evaluated at D0, D7 and D42 measured by SCORAD (scoring atopic dermatitis). Tolerance is evaluated by the investigator at D7, D42 and D56. Global efficacy is measured by parents and investigator at D7 and D42. Medical photographs (optional) of lesions are taken with patients consent at D0 and D42. A crossover between the two products occurs at day 42 so that cosmetic acceptability can be compared at D42 and D56. Skin examinations are performed at all visits. A quality of life questionnaire is filled out by the parent(s) at D0 and D42.</detailed_description>
