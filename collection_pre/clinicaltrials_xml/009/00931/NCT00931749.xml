	<brief_title>Effects of Ultrasound Therapy on Cartilage Healing in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) negatively influences the healthy aging process of the population. Until today, there are no interventions that have proved effective for enhancing the cartilage regeneration of these patients. The use of Low Intensity Ultrasound (LIUS) therapy has demonstrated promising effects on cartilage regeneration in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 24 sessions of LIUS on the cartilage volume and thickness of patients with grades 1 and 2 (medial joint space narrowing OARSI atlas 2007) knee osteoarthritis (OA).</detailed_description>
