	<brief_summary>Lactic acid bacteria produce a mixture of higher menaquinones, including menaquinone-9 (MK-9) and menaquinone-10 (MK-10). Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is normally present in chloroplasts in green vegetables. A new dairy product is developed containing both vitamin K1 and K2-vitamins. However, the extent to which the various forms of vitamin K are absorbed from such a mixture is not known. In this study the absorption profile of phylloquinone and menaquinones from this new dairy product containing several K-vitamins is investigated. This study describes a dietary intervention experiment for one single cocktail containing several K-vitamins as part of a dairy product.</brief_summary>
