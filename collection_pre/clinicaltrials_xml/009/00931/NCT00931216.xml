	<brief_title>Integration of HIV Care and Treatment Into Antenatal Care in Migori District, Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a prospective cluster randomized design. Twelve clinics similar in size, population, and services in Migori district, Kenya that provide ANC have been randomly assigned to receive "integrated ANC, PMTCT &amp; HIV services" (intervention arm) or "non-integrated services" (control arm). At the intervention clinics, pregnant women will receive ANC, PMTCT and HIV care and treatment (including HAART if required) at the same clinic visit from the ANC provider. At the control clinics, women will receive antenatal care and PMTCT services with referral to the HIV care and treatment department located in the same facility. The control sites more closely resemble the current approach followed for care and treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women in Kenya. The content of ANC, PMTCT, and HIV care will be the same in the two study arms and will follow current Kenyan national guidelines. The only difference between the two arms will be the provider/location of HIV care and treatment. Outcomes will be compared for HIV-positive pregnant women who attend intervention versus control facilities. In addition we will conduct qualitative research with health care providers at the study health facilities in order to learn provider perspectives on the two service models and to explore the effects of integration on provider job satisfaction (including work load).</detailed_description>
