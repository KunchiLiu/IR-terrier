	<brief_summary>DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract) Abnormalities of eye movement control and spatial cognition are well-established deficits in schizophrenia. However, the regional disturbances in brain function causing these deficits are not yet known. This application proposes a series of integrated behavioral studies designed to identify causes of deficits in schizophrenia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria for this study are (1) able and willing to give written informed consent; (2) no contraindications to MRI (cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear implants, IUD, shrapnel, history of metal fragments in eyes, neurostimulators or other metal devices, weight of 250lbs or more, claustrophobia) and (3) medically stable. Sedation will not be used for MRI studies because cooperation is essential. Any subject is excluded from the imaging studies if they have any contraindications to MRI such as cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear implants, pregnancy in the later stages (because of body size and limited comfort for MRI studies), IUD, shrapnel, history of metal fragments in eyes, neurostimulators, weight of 250 lbs. or more, or claustrophobia. Individuals with mental retardation, neurologic disease or significant medical illness that might effect neuronal or vascular physiology will not be recruited.</criteria>
