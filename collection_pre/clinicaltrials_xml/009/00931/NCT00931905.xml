	<brief_summary>Saturnism, or lead poisoning, is defined by clinical symptoms (affecting primarily the nervous, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, renal and reproductive systems) compatible with exposure, in the short or long term, to lead or to its compounds, and can manifest as acute or chronic symptoms, pursuant to the intensity and duration of the signs and symptoms. Measuring serum concentration is the primary method for diagnosing and accompanying exposed workers. Presently, elevated lead counts are reversed by using drugs whose effectiveness is contested on various fronts. Experimental studies shows the efficacy of homeopathic preparations in controlling blood lead levels in laboratory animals, creating the need for controlled studies that evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these preparations in humans.The objective of this study was evaluate the effectiveness of the homeopathic preparation Plumbum metallicum in reducing the blood lead level of workers exposed to this metal.</brief_summary>
