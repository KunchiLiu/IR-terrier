	<brief_summary>This is a single arm phase II trial with combined celecoxib, tegafur-uracil, folinate and preoperative radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The primary end point is pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The secondary endpoints are toxicities of combined celecoxib and chemoradiation, negative resection margin rate, clinical tumor response by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sphincter preservation rate, disease-free survival and overall survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Celecoxib With Preoperative Chemo- Radiation for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to determine the pathological complete response (pCR) of combining preoperative tegafur-uracil, folinate, radiation and celecoxib for locally advanced rectal cancer. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine: 1. Toxicity profile of combining celecoxib, tegafur-uracil, folinate and preoperative radiation for locally advanced rectal cancer. 2. Negative resection margins (circumferential resection margin) rate. 3. Downstaging rate. 4. Sphincter preservation rate 5. Locoregional and distant failure rate. 6. Overall survival</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with resectable or potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum. 2. Clinical stage by Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) of pelvis, ultrasonography of liver and Chest X ray: AJCC T2 N12M0 or T34 N02M0 (patients who require diverting loop colostomy are eligible). Nuclear medicine study (whole body bone scan or PET scan) can be performed if clinically indicated. 3.

Biopsy proven adenocarcinoma, superior margin of the tumor below the L5S1 spine junction. 6. WBC &gt; 3.5 x109/L, neutrophil count &gt; 1.5x109/L, platelet count &gt; 100x109/L, serum bilirubin &lt; 1.25xULN (upper limit of normal), AST/ALT &lt; 3x ULN, serum creatinine &lt; 1.25xULN. 7. Informed consent signed. 1. Distant metastasis, Prior pelvic irradiation, Inflammatory bowel disease, Medical conditions which preclude radical therapy. 2. History of malignancy within five years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer, CIN cervix). 3. Pregnancy. 4. Hypersensitivity to celecoxib, NSAID, sulfonamides or 5FU. 5. Cardiovascular disease like congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease, or myocardiac infarction. 6. History of peptic ulcer disease or NSAIDrelated gastrointestinal bleeding 7. Use of aspirin, other NSAID or celecoxib in the two weeks prior to study entry. 8. Patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulating medicine.</criteria>
