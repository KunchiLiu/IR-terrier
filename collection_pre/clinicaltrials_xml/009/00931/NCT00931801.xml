	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase IV pilot study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and satisfaction of a nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)sparing regimen for participants fully suppressed on an atazanavir/ritonavir based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)regimen plus emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada). Several pharmacologic factors support this concept including the favorable drug interaction between atazanavir and raltegravir. Participants will be randomized to either continue on their current regimen or one of two study arms (atazanavir 300mg plus ritonavir 100mg daily plus raltegravir 400mg twice daily or atazanavir 300mg twice daily plus raltegravir 400mg twice daily). Participants will be followed for 48 weeks for safety, tolerability, and satisfaction. After baseline, the participants will have six clinic visits for evaluation and labs.</brief_summary>
