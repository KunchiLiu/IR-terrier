The pts received a failing course of remedial Mitoxantrone involving x 2 and j ARAC 1g / m 2 x / d x 4 days The pts in CR then received 2 courses of consolidation with, according to initial randomization either DNR 80 mg / m² IDA 12 mg / sqm x 1 d (1st treatment) or 2 d (2nd treatment) and ARAC 1 gsm 2/jx x 4 days The pts in CR were then randomized persistent IL2 (5 million IU / m² x 5 d / month in SC for 12 months) or no treatment.</detailed_description>
