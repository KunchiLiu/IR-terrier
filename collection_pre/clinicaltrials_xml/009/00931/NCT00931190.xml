	<brief_summary>The objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) by loop electrosurgical excision procedure using persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) as outcome, and to perform a long-term follow-up on the ability of HPV testing, as compared to cytology, to predict recurrence of high-grade CIN.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Human Papillomavirus Persistence for Determination of Treatment Efficacy Among Women With Cervical Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA analysis and cytological analysis were obtained from women with abnormal smears referred to Umeå university hospital, Sweden, for treatment with conization. These women were scheduled for HPV DNA testing and Pap smears before and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after treatment. The HPV DNA testing was performed with a PCR-based genotyping method.</detailed_description>
