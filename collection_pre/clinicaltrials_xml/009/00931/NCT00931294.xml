	<brief_title>Saliva Testosterone Increases in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Patients Beginning Choir Singing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project aimed to study the health effects of regular choir singing for persons who are in a psychosomatic condition (Irritable Bowel syndrome - IBS). A group of IBS patients were randomized to choir singing or an information group were followed during one year with biological and psychosocial assessments. The choir group participated in various relaxation, breathing and vocal exercises with the choir leader, and received the material "To live with IBS" for home studies. At the same time a comparison group with IBS patients meet in groups, studying and discussing on the same materials under the direction of a group leader. Both groups meet once per week.</detailed_description>
