	<brief_summary>Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESr) are the main mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. They occur without any deglutition in patients but also in healthy volunteers. They are induced by meal. The gold standard to detect tLESr is esophageal manometry using perfused Dentsleeve probe. Esophageal high resolution manometry with solid state sensors was developed in the 90s. The examination is easier and more accurate than perfused manometry. The aim of this study is to validate in healthy volunteers the use of high resolution manometry (Sierra Scientific Instruments, California CA) to detect tLESr.</brief_summary>
