	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase 2 study of RCHOP with or without VELCADE in adult patients with previously untreated non-(Germinal B-Cell-like) GCB Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). The study will determine whether the addition of VELCADE to RCHOP improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with non-GCB DLBCL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Effectiveness of RCHOP With or Without VELCADE in Previously Untreated Non-Germinal Center B-Cell-like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug tested in this study is called bortezomib (VELCADE速). VELCADE速 was tested in people who have Non-Germinal Center B-Cell-like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. This study looked at the efficacy of RCHOP [rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone] with or without VELCADE速. The study enrolled 206 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of the two open label treatment groups: - RCHOP - Vc-RCHOP [bortezomib (VELCADE速), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone] Participants received treatment for up to six, 21-day cycles. This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 48 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were followed for progression free survival and overall survival until patient withdrawal, death, or 2 years after the last participant was enrolled.</detailed_description>
