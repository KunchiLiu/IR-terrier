	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, parallel, randomized, blinded study. The study has two groups, where in one study group the subjects receive treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating) with the DTS-G2 System in both axilla ("treatment group"). The other study group receives a sham treatment in both axilla where the subjects will have the same procedure performed but no energy from the device will be applied ("sham group"). Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (treatment group: sham group). Subjects enrolled in the study will be blinded regarding which study group they are in. The study hypothesis is that subjects that receive the treatment will have a reduction in underarm sweating compared to those in the sham group, as measured by a quality of life questionnaire. All subjects will undergo follow up assessments at 14 days, 30 days, 3 months and 6 months post final treatment session. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will also have follow-up visits at 9 months and 12 months post final treatment session.</brief_summary>
