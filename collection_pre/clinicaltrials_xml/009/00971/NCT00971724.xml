	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To identify a biomarker or biomarker-set for the adverse metabolic effects of various doses of prednisolone treatment. Secondary objectives: - To describe the PK of prednisolone and PD of a series of biomarkers. - To identify biomarkers that reflect side effects of prednisolone. - To elucidate part of the mechanisms by which prednisolone induces metabolic changes.</brief_summary>
