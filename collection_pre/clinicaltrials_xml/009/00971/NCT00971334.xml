	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect samples for the purpose of developing a prenatal aneuploid test using circulating cell free fetal (ccff) nucleic acid from blood samples from pregnant women who have a high-risk pregnancy undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and/or genetic amniocentesis. The results of the ccff aneuploid test will be compared to the chromosomal analysis obtained via CVS or amniocentesis.</brief_summary>
