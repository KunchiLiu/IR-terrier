	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to assess the antitumor activity of cetuximab when given in combination with cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in Japanese subjects.</brief_summary>
