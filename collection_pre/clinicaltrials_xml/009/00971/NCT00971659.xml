	<brief_summary>This study investigated a 4-week adjunctive therapy of either a GLP-1 analog (exenatide), or a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin), given to a basal insulin analog (insulin glargine), and their effect on blood glucose control, versus insulin glargine alone as active comparator in type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Therapy of Exenatide or Sitagliptin to Insulin Glargine in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to the different mechanisms of action of the long-acting insulin analog insulin glargine and both a GLP-1 analog (exenatide) and a DPP-4-inhibitor (sitagliptin), it could be a promising approach to combine insulin glargine with either exenatide or sitagliptin for optimum control of fasting and postprandial blood glucose values. Thus, in the present study the influence of either exenatide or sitagliptin as a 4-week adjunctive therapy to a basal insulin (insulin glargine) was investigated versus insulin glargine alone as active comparator in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Preexisting metformin was continued, sulfonylureas, if any, were stopped. In particular, the effects on postprandial blood glucose excursion following ingestion of a standard breakfast, assessed after 4 weeks of treatment, the effects on mean daily blood glucose, on self-measured 7-point profiles, the percentage of subjects reaching ADA treatment goals (HbA1c &lt; 7.0%) at the end of treatment, on fasting lipid profile, on HOMA index, weight, hypoglycemic episodes and general safety were assessed. The study consisted of a screening visit, a 4-8 week (depending on pre-treatment) run-in period, a 4-week treatment period, and a follow-up visit. There were weekly visits at the site and twice weekly telephone contacts.</detailed_description>
