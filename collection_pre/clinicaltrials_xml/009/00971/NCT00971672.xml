	<brief_summary>The frequency of iron deficiency anemia was extensively studied in infants on the first year of life. There is not enough information about the frequency of iron deficiency during the second and third years of life. In a previous study performed in Israel and published in Pediatrics 2006 the incidence of anemia does not decrease towards age 18 months. Then there is reasonable to study the iron deficiency frequency beyond this age.</brief_summary>
