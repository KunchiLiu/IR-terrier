	<brief_summary>Lenalidomide is a immunomodulatory drug derived from thalidomide, without neurotoxicity. Lenalidomide blocks the increased secretion of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The association with dexamethasone increased Lenalidomide response rate. More recently the efficacy of Lenalidomide has been reported in a patient with POEMS (POEMS:polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome with improvement of clinical condition and reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) level.</brief_summary>
