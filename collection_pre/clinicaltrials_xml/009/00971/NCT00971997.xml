	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level below 6.5%, when lispro mix 50/50 is introduced in a stepwise manner from every day (QD) administration to type 2 diabetic patients who have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Insulin Lispro Mix in Type 2 Diabetic Asian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, post-marketing clinical study. The target population of the study is type 2 diabetic patients who have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control on OADs. The study consists of 4 periods: Lead-in Period (2 to 4 weeks), Study Period I (16 weeks), Study Period II (16 weeks), and Study Period III (16 weeks). The regimen of lispro mix 50/50 injection will be changed every 16 weeks based on the HbA1c level. During Study Period I, all the subjects will be given a once daily (QD) injection of lispro mix 50/50. During Study Period II, the regimen of lispro mix 50/50 injection will be changed to twice daily (BID) if the HbA1c level at Week 16 is 6.5% or above, and QD injection will be continued if the value is below 6.5%. During Study Period III, if the HbA1c level at Week 32 is 6.5% or above, the subjects on BID treatment during the previous period (Study Period II) will receive three times daily (TID) injections of insulin.</detailed_description>
