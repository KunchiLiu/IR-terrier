	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Determine the Effectiveness of Antimicrobial Healthcare Worker's (HCW) Hands and Clothing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goals of the pilot study: - Compare CFU counts on antimicrobial vs standard scrubs in a clinical setting - Assess CFU counts on the hands of HCWs wearing antimicrobial vs non-antimicrobial scrubs - Assess HCW hand hygiene compliance during the study protocol - Correlate device associated infection rates during protocol to historical controls - Assess feasibility of applying protocol to a longer,12-24 month, prospective crossover-trial to definitively study and assess the impact of antimicrobial scrubs on HCW apparel and hand colonization, control of multi-drug resistance organisms, hand hygiene compliance, and device associated hospital acquired infection rates. II. Design Cross-over trial in an ICU or Hospital Ward III. Outcome Measures 1. CFU count on participants 1. Hands 2. Scrubs 3. Antimicrobial scrubs vs standard scrubs 2. Hand Hygiene Compliance 3. Device associated nosocomial infections rates</detailed_description>
