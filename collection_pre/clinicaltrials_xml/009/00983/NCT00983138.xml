	<criteria>Previously untreated Tlineage or precursor Blineage ALL or biphenotypic leukaemia according to EGIL criteria. Morphological verification of the diagnosis, confirmed with cyto¬chemistry and immunophenotyping. Age &lt; 1 year at diagnosis. Written informed consent of the parents or other legally authorised guardian of the patient. Treatment according to protocol INTERFANT 06 Mature Blineage ALL, defined by the immunophenotypical presence of surface immunoglobulins or t(8;14) and breakpoint as in BALL. The presence of the t(9;22)(q34;q11) or bcrabl fusion in the leukaemic cells. Systemic use of corticosteroids less than 4 weeks before diagnosis. Patients who received corticosteroids by aerosol are eligible. Known allergy to any ASNase preparation. Preexisting known coagulopathy (e.g. haemophilia). Preexisting pancreatitis. Liver insufficiency (bilirubin &gt; 50 µmol/L; SGOT/SGPT &gt; 10 x the upper limit of normal).</criteria>
