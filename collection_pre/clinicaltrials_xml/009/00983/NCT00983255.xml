	<detailed_description>SAD/Part A. - All subjects in the Pilot Cohort will receive a single infusion of 50 mg TR-701 FA for injection in 250 cc of saline over 180 minutes. - Subjects in Cohort 1 will be randomized to receive a single infusion of placebo or 100 mg of TR-701 FA for injection in 250 or 500 cc of saline over 60 or 120 minutes. - Subjects in Cohort 2 will be randomized to receive a single infusion of placebo or 200 mg of TR-701 FA for injection in 250 or 500 cc of saline over 60 or 120 minutes. - Subjects in Cohort 3 will be randomized to receive a single infusion of placebo or 400 mg of TR-701 FA for injection in 250 or 500 cc of saline over 60 or 120 minutes. MAD/Part B - Subjects in Cohort 4 will be randomized to receive once daily infusions of placebo or 200 mg of TR-701 FA for injection in 250 cc of saline over 60 minutes for 7 days. - Subjects in Cohort 5 will be randomized to receive once daily infusions of placebo or 300 mg of TR-701 FA for injection in 250 cc of saline over 60 minutes for 7 days. BA/Part C - Subjects in Cohort 6 will receive a single 60 minute infusion of 200 mg TR-701 FA for injection in 250 cc of saline and a singe oral dose of 200 mg TR-701 FA tablet in an open-label crossover design. Venous Tolerability/Part D - Subjects in Cohort 8 will receive once daily 60 minute infusions of 200 mg TR-701 FA for injection in 250 cc of saline for 3 days and once daily placebo infusions for 3 daysin a blinded crossover design.</detailed_description>
