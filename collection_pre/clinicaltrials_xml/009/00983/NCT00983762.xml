	<brief_summary>A functional outcomes comparison study of three surgical techniques using minimally invasive surgery mini-incision (MIS) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), standard para-patellar TKA and the unicompartmental knee arthroplasty performed over a 2+ year post-op period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Functional Outcomes of Three Surgical Approaches in Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to compare post-operative knee function of persons who have undergone one of three types of knee arthroplasty for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. A variety of functional performance tests will be assessed and compared using a group of evaluations including: functional activity performance tests and questionnaires; leg strength; knee range of motion; and forces at the knee during a series of activities (walking, bending, stepping etc.) via a motion analysis system. The study will compare the three surgical subject groups and one group of healthy, non-surgical subjects for a total of 100 subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>TKA subjects: 1. Patients requiring primary knee arthroplasty; 2. Knee osteoarthritis; 3. Subject has sufficient quantity or quality of bone support; 4. Subject has no previous or active infection in the affected joint or systemic infection; 5. Subject judged to be available for followup through at least 1 year postoperative; 6. All subjects in arthroplasty groups will be between 5070 years of age Healthy subjects: 1. Healthy subjects will have no complaints of knee pain or history of knee surgery or known arthritic knee changes. 2. All subjects will have no history of prior lower extremity arthroplasty surgeries or systemic disease which could confound outcome measures. 3. All healthy persons will be 4070 years. 1. Insufficient quantity or quality of bone support resulting from conditions such as cancer, femoral osteotomy, significant osteoporosis or metabolic disorders of calcified tissues; 2. Unable to return for follow up xrays and clinical evaluation; 3. Unable to comprehending study protocol for any reason; 4. Systemic inflammatory joint disease (rheumatoid arthritis), previous infection or those requiring revision knee surgery; 5. Subject has an immunological disorder: immunosuppressive treatment characterized by markedly inhibited ability to respond to antigenic stimuli. Examples of such conditions include Subjects who are on immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroid hormones in large amounts, cytotoxic drugs, antilymphocytic serum or irradiation in large doses), Subjects receiving therapy to prevent homograft rejection, Subjects who have a documented history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or autoimmune diseases; 6. Subject has a neurologic condition that would influence the results of biomechanical analysis of whole body movement.</criteria>
