	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that increasing non intentional leaks could increase work of breathing and could lead to patient/non-invasive ventilation (NIV) asynchrony. The main objective is to compare ventilatory pattern (work of breathing, flow, pressure) under NIV with and without non-intentional leaks in 10 awakened healthy subjects and 10 awakened and asleep obese hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) patients. Methods: While the subjects will be under NIV, several levels of leaks will be simulated in a random order with an automatically opening valve. Breathing pattern (work of breathing,flow, pressure, thorax and abdominal movements) will be recorded by Polygraphy. Healthy subjects will be recorded only during awakened state. OHS patients will be recorded both during awake and sleep sates. Analysis: A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will compare work of breathing according to the different levels of leaks.</brief_summary>
