	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is study how well stereotactic radiation therapy works in treating patients with brain metastases</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the neurological death rate following the initiation of conformal stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with 1-3 brain metastases. Secondary - To determine the overall survival rate at 6 months. - To determine the progression-free survival rate or brain metastases recurrence rate at 6 months. - To determine the time to neurological death, time to systemic death, and Karnofsky decay time. - To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with conformal stereotactic radiotherapy. OUTLINE: Patients undergo conformal stereotactic radiotherapy over 5 days to an area including 3 mm around the metastases or the surgical cavity. Patients may receive additional radiotherapy if symptomatic metastases emerge at different sites. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
