Unstable or inadequately treated medical illness (e.g. congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, hypertension, hypotension) as judged by the investigator, based on the results from the physical exam, ECG, haematology, chemistry and urine screenings Participation in another drug trial within 4 weeks prior enrolment into this study A patient with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) fulfilling one of the following criteria: Unstable DM defined as enrolment glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;8.5%. Admitted to hospital for treatment of DM or DM related illness in past 12 weeks.
