	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving acetylsalicylic acid together with eflornithine works in treating patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of acetylsalicylic acid and eflornithine may prevent colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acetylsalicylic Acid and Eflornithine in Treating Patients at High Risk for Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. The proportion of subjects with an adenoma recurrence at the 1-year follow-up colonoscopy exam. This adenoma recurrence rate for difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (eflornithine) + aspirin will be compared to double placebo to see if there is improvement in the adenoma recurrence rate in this patient population. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the relative tolerability and safety of the treatment regimens administered for 12 months. II. To determine the effect of the study drugs (aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] + DFMO) and placebo with respect to proliferation (Ki67 labeling index), apoptosis (caspase-3 expression assay), and drug effect markers (COX-1, -2, polyamines, PGE2) from adenomas, aberrant crypt focus (ACF) and normal-appearing mucosa using pre- and 12-month post-intervention tissue biopsy samples. III. To estimate the percentage change in rectal ACF number, as determined by magnifying colonoscopy in subjects treated for 12 months with placebo or study drugs (aspirin +DFMO) by comparing % change in drug versus placebo arms. IV. To characterize ACF based on three criteria (ACF size [crypt number &lt; 50 or &gt;= 50], crypt morphology characteristics, and histology) of ACF and to correlate such characteristics with the intervention (vs placebo). Also, to evaluate the natural history of ACF over 1-year on placebo. V. To correlate the 12-month measurements of ACF size (# crypts/ACF), number, morphology, and histopathology with the adenoma recurrence data at 12 and 36 months; correlate the 12-month % (and actual) change in ACF size and number with the 12- and 36-month adenoma recurrence rate; and correlate the adenoma recurrence data at 1 year with the adenoma recurrence data at 3 years. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the effects of the study agents on a focused panel of tissue biomarkers in pre- and post-intervention biopsy samples from recurrent adenomas, rectal ACF, and adjacent normal-appearing mucosa among subjects enrolled in the phase II clinical trial. II. To determine if cleaved capase-3 expression can improve the detection of apoptotic cells by recognizing cellular commitment to apoptosis prior to late nuclear morphologic features and correlate with apoptotic regulatory proteins, histology, and treatment response. III. To determine the effects of aspirin on its biochemical targets COX-1, -2, and prostaglandin E2, and polyamine levels in subjects receiving DFMO. IV. To examine COX-2-dependent genes (i.e., Bcl-2 and DR5) in adenomas and ACF that have been shown to regulate the intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways in vitro and in vivo. V. To perform expression profiling of adenomas or ACF and to relate such date to ACF histology, size/morphology, modulation by chemopreventive agents, and subsequent adenoma recurrence rates. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) once daily and eflornithine PO twice daily on days 1-28. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO three times daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6, 12, and 36 months.</detailed_description>
