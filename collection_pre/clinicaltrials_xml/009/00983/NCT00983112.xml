	<brief_summary>Knee prothesis surgery is responsible of a risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage. To prevent thrombosis, patients have systematic anticoagulation after surgery which are responsible of hemorrhage. A local glue which improve local coagulation and have no impact of thrombosis can be a solution to limit hemorrhage. The purpose of this trial is to study the impact of a biological glue administration on the bleeding loss at five days after a total knee prosthesis surgery operation.</brief_summary>
