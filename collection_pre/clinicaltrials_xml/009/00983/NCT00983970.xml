	<brief_summary>Exercise is an important component in the treatment of of child obesity and associated medical conditions. However, one of the strongest predictors of non-compliance from exercise programs in obese youth is lack of enjoyment, thus creating a more pleasurable environment, by using TV or video games as incentives, may be an effective way of increasing exercise in obese youth. The purpose of this study was to compare interactive video game stationary cycling (GameBike ®) with cycling to music on aerobic fitness, body composition, cardiovascular disease risk markers, and exercise behaviour as measured by attendance, energy expenditure, duration, intensity and distance pedaled in obese adolescents. Twenty six obese adolescents had an equal chance of being assigned to either interactive video game cycling (n=13) or cycling to music serving as controls (n=13). The 10-week program consisted of twice weekly sessions lasting a maximum of 60 minutes per session.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Interactive Video Game Cycling on Obese Adolescent Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Energy expenditure through exercise is important for weight loss and reduction of medical morbidity associated with adolescent obesity. However, attrition from aerobic exercise programs is high in obese children as they do not tolerate it or enjoy it. Capitalizing on technology to use TV or video games as incentives to exercise may improve adherence to exercise and associated health benefits in obese adolescents. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of interactive video game stationary cycling (GameBike ®) with cycling to music on aerobic fitness, body composition, cardiovascular disease risk markers, and exercise behaviour as measured by attendance, energy expenditure, duration, intensity and distance pedaled in obese adolescents. Method: Twenty six obese adolescents were stratified by gender and randomized to a either interactive video game cycling (n=13) or cycling to music serving as controls (n=13). The 10-week program consisted of twice weekly sessions lasting a maximum of 60 minutes per session.</detailed_description>
