	<brief_summary>The investigators' long-term goal is to identify, and then provide general practitioners with evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic interventions for unexplained chronic fatigue (UCF). The investigators' central hypothesis guiding this application is that some complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners have developed management approaches that are more helpful to patients with UCF than usual care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Alternative Treatments of Unexplained Chronic Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An objective is to identify certain types of clinicians (or individual physicians) who appear to have identified effective treatments for patients with UCF, or to find that clinicians who report themselves to be effective are not. Study subjects will be UCF patients new to the practice of one of four groups of participating clinicians: 1) a control group of MDs in practice-based research networks, 2) MDs trained in CAM, 3) naturopathic doctors (non MDs trained in special naturopathic schools), and 4) MDs who specialize in chronic fatigue. Our rationale for this comparison is that its successful completion will potentially guide future searches for effective medical strategies for the treatment of UCF that may have been developed outside the mainstream medical community. It may also provide necessary information for follow-up studies that will help to identify specific effective treatments. This information includes which clinicians provide the best treatments (as evidenced by having patients with the best results), what are the characteristics of patients who respond to a particular treatment, how the data collection procedures might need to be refined and what sample sizes are necessary.</detailed_description>
