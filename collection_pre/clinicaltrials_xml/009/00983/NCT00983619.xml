Evaluable/measurable disease NonCLL Bcell malignancies (Arms A, C, and D): Histologically confirmed Bcell NHL (FL or DLBCL), transformed indolent lymphoma, and MCL: Measurable disease defined as ≥ 1 lesion ≥ 20 mm in one dimension or ≥15 mm in 2 dimensions as measured by conventional or highresolution (spiral) computed tomography (CT). For Arms C and D: disease evaluable by the International Working Group criteria (Cheson et al, 2007) Baseline PET or PET/CT scans must show positive lesions compatible with CTdefined anatomical tumor sites (only applicable for FL, DLBCL, MCL, transformed indolent lymphoma, and FL transforming to DLBCL) CLL (Arms A and B): Confirmed Bcell CLL/SLL with a characteristic immunophenotype by flow cytometry, and symptomatic disease requiring treatment CT scans showing involvement of ≥ 1clearly demarcated lesions measuring ≥ 1.5 cm 6. Prior therapy Arm A: Histologically confirmed Bcell NHL (FL or DLBCL): Relapsed from or refractory to ≥ 1 prior regimen containing rituximab, either alone or in combination, and not be a candidate for hematopoietic SCT or BM transplant Bcell CLL: Relapsed from or refractory to ≥ 2 prior lines of treatment, ≥ 1 of which must have contained rituximab Arm B: Relapsed from or refractory to ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens with ≥ 1 regimen containing rituximab Arm C: Relapsed from or refractory to ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens with ≥ 1 regimen containing rituximab or failed 1 prior rituximabcontaining regimen and unable to tolerate additional multiagent chemotherapy Arm D: Refractory to ≥ 1 regimen containing any antiCD20based therapy, including salvage regimens and maintenance rituximab. Refractory subjects are defined as any subject with less than a PR to any prior antiCD20based therapies or progressed within 6 months after completing therapy with any antiCD20based regimens, including maintenance rituximab. These subjects must not be eligible for hematopoietic SCT or BM transplant 7. Prior radiation therapy is allowed provided exposure does not exceed an area of 25% of marrow space and occurred ≥ 6 weeks prior to the first dose of MEDI551 (Arm A only) 8. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 9. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks 10. Adequate hematologic function Arm A (except for CLL subjects with significant BM involvement by biopsy) must meet the following criteria: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, (≥ 8 g/dL for subjects who are transfusion dependent) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 Arms B, C, and D must meet the following criteria: Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 In the event of significant BM involvement, the above hematologic criteria will not be required for enrollment eligibility 11. Adequate organ function defined as follows: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except for subjects with documented Gilbert's disease, ≤ 2.5 × ULN; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min as determined by the CockcroftGault equation 12. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective contraception from screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for at least 180 days after the last dose of investigational product. Depending on the investigational product received, this period may be longer. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or those who are postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause or folliclestimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone levels consistent with a menopausal state) A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Acceptable methods of contraception are described in Table 4.2.11. Sustained abstinence is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception 13. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (Table 4.2.11) from at least Day 1 through 90 days after the last dose of investigational product 14. Negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) test (for women of childbearing potential only) 15. Females or female partners not of childbearing potential must have been surgically sterilized or postmenopausal (as defined above in inclusion criterion #12).

Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for treatment of cancer 3. History of allergy or reaction to any component of the MEDI551 formulation 4. Receipt of any chemotherapy or small molecule targeted therapy (such as imatinib or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and including any experimental therapies) or radiation therapy within 28 days or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of MEDI551 5. Receipt of any biological or immunologicalbased therapies (including experimental therapies) for leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma (including, but not limited to, MAb therapy such as rituximab, or cancer vaccine therapies) within 28 days or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of MEDI551 6. Previous therapy directed against CD19, such as MAbs or MAb conjugates 7. Live or attenuated vaccines (other than experimental cancer vaccine therapy) within 28 days prior to receiving the first dose of MEDI551 8. Evidence of significant active infection requiring antimicrobial, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral therapy or for which other supportive care is given 9. Autologous SCT within 12 weeks prior to study entry (Arms A and D only) 10. Prior allogeneic SCT or organ transplant (Arms A and D only) 11. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive serology or AIDS 12. Active hepatitis B as defined by seropositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis B core antibody. Subjects with hepatitis C antibody will be eligible provided that they do not have elevated liver transaminases 13. Ongoing ≥ Grade 2 toxicities from previous cancer therapies unless specifically allowed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. Use of immunosuppressive medication other than steroids within 28 days before the first dose of MEDI551 14. Use of systemic steroids within 7 days before the first dose of MEDI551 (inhaled and topical corticosteroids are permitted). Subjects may take replacement doses of steroids (defined as ≤ 30 mg/day hydrocortisone or the equivalent) if on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of MEDI551. This does not include required steroid prophylaxis prior to the first infusion of MEDI551 15. Documented current central nervous system involvement by leukemia or lymphoma 16. Pregnancy or lactation 17. Previous medical history, or evidence, of an intercurrent illness that at the discretion of the principal investigator may compromise the safety of the subject in the study 18. Clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG). The corrected QT interval (QTc, Fridericia) must be &lt; 470 milliseconds for men and &lt; 490 milliseconds for women (Must be confirmed by at least 2 additional 12lead ECGs at least 2 minutes apart such that average manually overread QTcF based on 3 ECGs exceeds stated thresholds) 19. Any physical, social, or psychiatric condition that would prevent effective cooperation or participation in the study 20. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless in a followup period or it is an observational study 21.
