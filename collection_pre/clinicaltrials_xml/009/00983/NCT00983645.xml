	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Prograf and Neoral Use in Kidney Transplant Recipients of Hispanic Ethnicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to include Hispanics who have undergone a renal transplant to determine the specific outcome after renal transplantation, assuming that ethnic groups require different immunosuppressant regimens. Trough levels in transplant recipients determine the dosing requirements for Tacrolimus and Cyclosproine. It has been recently found, however, that testing cyclosporine levels in the blood 2 hours after taking cyclosporine is more effective in dosing cyclosprine for renal transplant patients than trough levels. The specific study aims include comparing the cyclosporine monitoring in patients with trough and C2 levels, and adjusting immunosuppression based on C2 levels.</detailed_description>
