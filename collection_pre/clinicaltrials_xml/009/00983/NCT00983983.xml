	<brief_title>High Fat/High Calorie Trial in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss is a common and severe symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), caused both from inadequate calorie intake and an increased metabolic rate. People with ALS are generally instructed to increase their calorie intake; however, the ideal amount and type of calories has not been studied. Several studies in an animal model of motor neuron disease have shown that a high fat/high calorie diet can increase survival by as much as 38%. Mice on a high fat diet also live longer than mice fed diets consisting of high protein or high sugar. We are therefore conducting a phase II safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy trial in ALS of high fat versus high calorie versus normal diet. The normal diet will be calculated based on the number of calories needed to replace each participant's measured daily calorie requirement.</detailed_description>
