	<detailed_description>Previous studies in the dialysis population have found a reduction in local and system central venous catheter related infections with the application of topical antibiotics to the insertion point. One such study found a mortality benefit with Polysporin Triple Therapy ointment. We intend to determine if this preparation can reduce overall line infection rates in the ICU environment through its application at the time of line insertion and twice more the following week.</detailed_description>
