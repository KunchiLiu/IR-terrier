	<brief_title>The Effects Nutrition Status and Body Composition On Peritoneal Dialysis Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wasting and malnutrition are common and serious complications in patients on peritoneal dialysis and are strongly associated with adverse outcomes. Techniques for assessing nutrition have limitations and, due to metabolic effects and confounding effects of altered hydration and other body composition abnormalities, these limitations are greater in the context of renal failure. Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a promising method for the objective assessment and monitoring of body composition. Body composition techniques subdivide the body into compartments on the basis of differing physical properties. The different compartments reflect hydration, nutrition/wasting, body fat, and bone mineral content, which are all of great importance in patients on peritoneal dialysis. We will conduct a prospective long-term follow up of PD patients' outcome correlates with nutritional status and body compositions. The patients will receive BIA every three months, and other routine clinical data such as dialysis adequacy, peritoneal equilibration test and monthly biochemical data are collected to analyze. An additional blood sample 8 ml and 5 ml dialysate of overnight, 0 hour, 2 hour and 4 hour will be collected during annual PET for other inflammatory cytokines and nutritional markers such as adiponectin, leptin, ghrelin, prealbumin and transferrin. The follow up period will be as long as possible and the last recruited into this study is in the Aug 2014. These data will be used for the morbidity and mortality analysis to see if body compositions will be more useful and timely than the other nutritional parameters.</detailed_description>
