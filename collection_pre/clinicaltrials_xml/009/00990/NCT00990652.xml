	<brief_summary>Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving bortezomib together with temozolomide after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib before surgery followed by giving bortezomib together with temozolomide after surgery works in treating patients with recurrent malignant glioma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, and 8. Patients then undergo surgical resection of the tumor on day 8 or 9. Beginning approximately 14 days after surgery, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7 and 14-21 and bortezomib IV on days 7 and 21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker analysis, gene methylation studies, and pharmacokinetic studies. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
