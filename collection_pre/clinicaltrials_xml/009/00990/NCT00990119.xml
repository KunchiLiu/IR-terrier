	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to see if the Vapotherm High Flow Therapy (HFT) device is effective to provide breathing support to patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD. The investigators believe that patients using HFT will not require as much use of therapies that provide pressure through a face mask, and are already recognized by FDA as support therapies for respiratory insufficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Therapy (HFT) to Treat Respiratory Insufficiency in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate that Vapotherm High Flow Therapy (HFT) via nasal cannula provides respiratory support to patients with COPD as a primary diagnosis, who present with respiratory insufficiency in the Emergency Department. We intend to demonstrate that Vapotherm HFT via nasal cannula will result in at least equivalent patient outcomes as the current standard of care, while eliminating the need for other non-invasive respiratory support devices cleared for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency. The current standard of care will include the use of other devices cleared by the FDA as respiratory assist devices for the treatment of adult respiratory insufficiency.</detailed_description>
