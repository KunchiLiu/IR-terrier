	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of PNU-100480 given for 14 or 28 days. Killing activity against the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) will also be measured. The effect of adding an additional tuberculosis (TB) agent (given for 2 days) in addition to PNU-100480 will be evaluated. Linezolid open label to determine activity in whole blood assay (WBA).</brief_summary>
