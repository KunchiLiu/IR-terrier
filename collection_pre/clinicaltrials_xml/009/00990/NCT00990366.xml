	<brief_summary>Biliary obstruction can be relieved by biliary stent. Ascending infection of biliary passage (cholangitis) causes hospitalization and obstruction of stents. Reflux of intestinal fluids through a stent is thought to be one of the causes of cholangitis. Stents with antireflux valves are designed to reduce the reflux from the bowel. The purpose of the study is to investigate prospectively whether it is possible to reduce the amount of infection and thus obstruction of biliary stent by using a stent with an antireflux valve compared to a normal stent without an antireflux valve.</brief_summary>
