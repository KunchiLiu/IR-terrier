	<brief_summary>The purpose of the FIT-O study was to estimate the prevalence of having a caregiver (paid and/or informal) among hospitalized cardiac patients by demographic factors such as patient age and race/ethnicity, and to link caregiver status to clinical outcomes following hospitalization. A secondary aim was to collect anonymous family tree data to provide an estimate of the number of first degree family members, their basic demographics, and the distance at which they live from the medical center.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Family Cardiac Caregiver Investigation to Evaluate Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been established that cardiac caregivers are a vehicle by which health information can be transmitted, and that caregivers themselves may be at increased CVD risk. Our research evaluated the potential pool and demographic profile of cardiac caregivers as well as the role(s) they play in improving quality of patient care and to enhance adherence to secondary prevention guidelines post discharge. This research also provided important information about targeting educational efforts to specific caregivers to enhance the clinical outcomes of hospitalized coronary patients. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of caregiving in hospitalized cardiac patients by demographic factors such as patient age and race/ethnicity, and to link caregiving to clinical outcomes in cardiac patients. A secondary aim was to collect family tree data which would allow us to estimate the number of first degree family members, their basic demographics, and the distance at which they live from the medical center in order to determine the feasibility and scope of a targeted preventive intervention. The significance of this research is that it addressed specific challenges outlined in the recent NHLBI strategic plan to develop and evaluate programs to improve patient, provider, and health care system behavior and performance to enhance quality of care and health outcomes, especially in populations that experience a disproportionate disease burden. Unique information was obtained about caregivers as a potential intervention to improve preventive care and health outcomes of patients and families that suffer disproportionate CVD burden. Improved adherence to evidence-based preventive therapies could have a substantial public health benefit.</detailed_description>
