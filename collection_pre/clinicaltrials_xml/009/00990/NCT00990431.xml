	<brief_summary>Ablative fractional lasers were introduced for treating facial rhytides in an attempt to achieve results comparable to traditional ablative resurfacing but with fewer side effects. However, there is conflicting evidence on how well this goal has generally been achieved as well as on the comparative value of fractional CO2 and Er:YAG lasers. The present study compares these modalities in a randomized controlled blinded split-face study design: 28 patients were enrolled and completed the entire study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single treatment on each side of the peri-orbital region, one with a fractional CO2 and one with a fractional Er:YAG laser. The evaluation included Fitzpatrick wrinkle score, profilometric measurement of wrinkle depth (both before and 3 months after treatment) as well as assessment of side effects and patient satisfaction (1, 3, 6 days and 3 months after treatment).</brief_summary>
