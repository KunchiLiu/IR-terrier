	<brief_summary>The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in functional dyspepsia remains controversial. Several randomized controlled trials in western countries have shown no significant advantage over placebo. But some recent studies in Asian population were different compared to the result of studies in the Western population. At the present time, it seems to be difficult to conclude the efficacy of the H.pylori eradication therapy in patients with H. pylori-infected functional dyspepsia. The investigators hypothesize that eradication of Helicobacter pylori has a sustained global symptom improvement in patients with H. pylori infected functional dyspepsia.</brief_summary>
