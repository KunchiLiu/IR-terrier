	<brief_summary>Background and Objective: It has been reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from periodontal patients have a different profile of cytokine release when compared to the ones of healthy patients. Cigarette smoking is a recognized risk factor for periodontitis and is known to affect the systemic and local immune responses. Thus, the aim of the present study was to obtain preliminary data about the interaction of periodontal condition and smoking in the secretion of some cytokines by PBMC. Material and Methods: PBMC samples were isolated from 19 donors, divided into generalized chronic periodontitis (P; n=10) and periodontal health (H; n=9) groups. In addition, the smokers and non-smokers of each group were separately evaluated: SP- smokers with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (n=5); SH- periodontally healthy smokers (n=5); NSP- non-smokers with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (n=5) and NSH- periodontally healthy non-smokers (n=4). Cells were incubated for 24-48 hours in 500 µL wells containing RPMI 1640 and stimulated with 1.0 ng/mL of E. coli LPS. Supernatants were used to quantify the amounts of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 released using ELISA kits.</brief_summary>
