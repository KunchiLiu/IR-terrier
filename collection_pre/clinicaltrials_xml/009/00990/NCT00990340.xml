	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain psychological response and user preference information on the use of the T jet® device versus the traditional subcutaneous injection administration of Tev Tropin®. This study will compare subject-reported injection anxiety immediately before the administration of each dose of Tev-Tropin® between a needle-syringe injection method and a needle-free injection method (T-jet®)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean subject-reported injection anxiety between the two injection methods as recorded on a 5-point FIS immediately before administration. A higher score denoted greater anxiety. The injection anxiety score was to be reported by the subject from a row of five faces with values ranging from 5 (the face with the most negative affect) to 1 (the face with the most positive affect).</detailed_description>
