	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the infusion of partially matched, allogeneic, CMV specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) for patients with GBM that have failed primary therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Using Allogenic-Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Specific Cells for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor specimens of consenting patients will be tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of IE-1 and/or pp65. Subjects whose tumors test positive for either or both CMV antigens will be consented for the treatment phase which will include a regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide daily for two days, cyclophosphamide only for a third day, followed by one day of rest prior to the day of CTL infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>FOR SCREENING Patients must have a histopathologic diagnosis of GBM. Patients from 5 to 65 years of age with GBM. FOR TREATMENT GBM has progressed following primary therapy. Tumor is CMV pp65 or IE1 positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subjects must have pulse oximetry &gt; or = 94 % on no supplemental oxygen. Creatinine clearance must be &gt; 50 cc/min as estimated by patient's serum creatinine, weight, and age. Bilirubin must be &lt; 2.0 mg/dl and SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2.5 X normal. ECOG performance status must be &lt; or = 2, and for patients &lt;16 years of age, Lansky performance status must be &gt; or = 70%. Pregnant females Subjects who are moribund or who because of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic or neurologic dysfunction are not expected to survive one month following the T cell infusion</criteria>
