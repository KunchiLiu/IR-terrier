	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, tumor tissue, and skin in the laboratory from patients with melanoma receiving hydroxychloroquine may help doctors understand the effect of hydroxychloroquine on biomarkers. PURPOSE: This early phase I trial is studying hydroxychloroquine in patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine in Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on the modulation of markers of autophagy, as measured by p62, Beclin1, LC3, and GRp170 expression, in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsy samples, skin samples, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from patients with stage III or IV melanoma undergoing palliative or curative surgery. Secondary - To determine whether the steady-state plasma concentration of HCQ correlates with observed trends in induced markers of autophagy. - To determine the potential mechanisms of antitumor effect of HCQ, as measured by a reduction in tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67 and mitotic rate) or an increase in apoptosis (activated caspase-3 and TUNEL assays) in melanoma specimens. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery. Blood, tumor tissue, and skin samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and correlative laboratory studies. Expression of p62, Beclin1, LC3, and GRp170 (autophagy markers) is analyzed.</detailed_description>
