	<brief_summary>This study will explore safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells transplantation (MSCT) to treat patients with diagnosis of systemic sclerosis(SSc) who have been resistant to multiple standard treatments. The underlying hypothesis is that the SSc condition is caused by an abnormal immune homeostasis that can be restored by MSCT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To test a new approach using allogeneic derived mesenchymal stem cell based therapy (MSCT) to treat refractory SSc - To determine the disease-free survival in SSc patients treated with MSCT - To assess adverse events of allogeneic MSC transplantation - To assess the association of remission for organ function, clinical score and SSc serology levels at baseline with disease-free survival</detailed_description>
