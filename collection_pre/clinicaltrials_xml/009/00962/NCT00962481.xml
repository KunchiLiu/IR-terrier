	<criteria>Able to produce sputum with normal sputum neutrophil levels at screening (&lt; 65% of nonepithelial cells). Ozone responsive, defined as ≥ 20% relative increase in sputum neutrophils cell count after 3 h ozone challenge. At screening FEV1 at least 80% of predicted. Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will be measured during screening for all subjects. Smokers will be defined as any subject who reports of a recent tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL. Significant illness within two weeks prior to dosing (e.g., infection). Recent (within the last three years) and/or recurrent history of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treated or not treated).</criteria>
