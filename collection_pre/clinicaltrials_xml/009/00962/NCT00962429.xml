	<brief_title>Lipoic Acid to Treat Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive disease leading to paralysis. CIDP is an immune-mediated disorder resulting from a synergistic interaction of T cell-mediated and B cell-mediated immune responses directed against peripheral nerve antigens. These immune mediated responses in turn increase the production of reactive oxygen intermediate and cause oxidative damage of the peripheral nerve system. Although corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) reduce impairment caused by CIDP at least temporarily and can be used as a first-line treatments, they are not ideal for long-term treatment because of serious side effects and cost. Alpha lipoic acid (LA) is an antioxidant that also possesses anti-immune activity. It is effective in treating diabetic neuropathy. It is also promising in treating patients with multiple sclerosis.</detailed_description>
