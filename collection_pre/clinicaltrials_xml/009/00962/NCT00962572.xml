The records of 50 patients treated under the aggressive management plan will be matched with the records of 50 previous patients and attempts made to assess the improvement, if any, found. Statistical analysis will compare the outcomes of the study group and the matched control group for initial completion of planned therapy as per prescription, weight loss during therapy, intercurrent illness, and intercurrent hospitalizations. Long term analysis will compare the study group's outcomes (compared to expected outcomes) compared to the matched control group.</detailed_description>
