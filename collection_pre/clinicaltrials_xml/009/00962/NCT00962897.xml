	<brief_summary>A retrospective review with four year followup on patients that had previously been enrolled in a study to evaluate blockages in the lower legs. The study looked at patients that had undergone a bypass of the leg from the groin to the knee area with an incision in each area using general anesthesia. These patients were compared to others who had undergone treatment with balloon dilatation and stents in the arteries in the thighs with only numbing medicine. The study was completed two years ago and was initially designed to look at outcomes at 24 months. Now the investigators are trying to go back and look at outcomes of these patients' treatment at 4 years by simply reviewing their records.</brief_summary>
