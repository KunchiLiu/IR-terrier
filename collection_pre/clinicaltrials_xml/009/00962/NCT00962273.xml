	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an interactive, computerized learning resource designed to increase resilience in hospital-based health care workers preparing for an influenza pandemic. The effects of the learning resource will be compared to a non-interactive learning resource condition and a control condition. It is hypothesized that (a) online pandemic-related education reduces absenteeism and interpersonal problems for healthcare workers (HCWs), and improves their pandemic self-efficacy in the short and long-term, and (b) an interactive format for online education is necessary for its benefits.</brief_summary>
