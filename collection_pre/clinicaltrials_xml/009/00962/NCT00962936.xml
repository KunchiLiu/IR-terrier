	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate whether an investigational monoclonal antibody, CT-011, is safe to give and if it helps patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Monoclonal antibodies are a type of drug that is typically given by infusion into a vein (intravenously). Results of this trial will help doctors obtain additional information with regard to the safety and efficacy of CT-011 as a potential treatment for HCV.</brief_summary>
