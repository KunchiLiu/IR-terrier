	<brief_title>RestorationÂ® Modular Revision Hip System Post Market Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two-piece modular revision stem components are intended to be used for primary or revision total hip arthroplasty, as well as in the presence of severe proximal bone loss. This study evaluates the System in revision cases only. The stems are intended to be used with Stryker Orthopaedics femoral heads, unipolar and bipolar components, and acetabular components. These femoral stems are designed to be press fit into the proximal femur. In addition to demonstrating survivorship at 5 years, this study will seek to gain information on four secondary objectives: radiographic stability, Harris Hip Scores, SF-36 general well-being assessment, and safety profile.</detailed_description>
