	<brief_summary>Cerebral vasospasm is a devastating complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage after cerebral aneurysm rupture leading to cerebral ischemia and potentially cerebral infarction. The current gold standard diagnostic imaging study for cerebral vasospasm is catheter cerebral angiography, an invasive diagnostic procedure carrying a complication rate of 1-2% per procedure. Computed tomographic perfusion imaging (CTP) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) are noninvasive diagnostic imaging studies frequently utilized in the evaluation of embolic and thrombotic cerebral infarct. The investigators hypothesize that CTP and CTA may be utilized as screening tools for cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage requiring treatment and provide prognostic information.</brief_summary>
