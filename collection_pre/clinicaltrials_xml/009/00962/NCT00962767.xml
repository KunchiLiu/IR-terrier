	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with untreated newly diagnosed and genetically proven APL (leukemic cells at diagnosis with the t(15;17) and/or the PML/RARα rearrangement by RTPCR; the presence of additional cytogenetic lesions is not considered an exclusion criterion) with intermediate and high risk disease. 2. Male and female patients age &gt; 18 years and &lt; 61 years. Exclusion criteria: 1. Low risk patients (WBC &lt; 10 x 109/L and platelets &gt; 40 x 109/L). 2. Absence of PMLRAR α rearrangement in leukemic cells after successful RNA extraction and amplification of control gene. 3. Pretreated APL.</criteria>
