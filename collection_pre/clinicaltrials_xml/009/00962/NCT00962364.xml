	<brief_summary>This study will provide follow-up information and care of patients who have undergone autologous intracoronary bone marrow cell administration at our institution. Patients are monitored for their response to treatment, progression of heart failure and coronary artery disease, and potential later occurring effects of the administered bone marrow cells. Patients are eligible for this follow-up study if they have received their first intracoronary bone marrow cell administration for the treatment of cardiac disease at our institution from 2001 ongoing. Participants are generally seen in the clinic at 12 months and 5 years after cell administration, in the meantime regular yearly telephone contacts are performed until 10 years after cell transplantation. The detailed description contains the planned procedures that are performed during the clinical visits and, if necessary, at additional contacts.</brief_summary>
