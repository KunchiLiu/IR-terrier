	<brief_summary>Spirometry is a biomedical test to measure lung function in subject who (may) have a chronic respiratory condition. Performing the test requires a certain level of training and experience from the health care professional who conducts the test, and sufficient cooperation of the patient. Although the test is widely used in primary care in many countries, the quality of the test performance seems limited and needs improvement in order to avoid false-positive and false-negative test interpretations. In this study, the researchers investigated whether a combination of e-learning and bimonthly written performance feedback to family practice nurses and assistance regarding their spirometry tests improves the rate of adequate tests.</brief_summary>
