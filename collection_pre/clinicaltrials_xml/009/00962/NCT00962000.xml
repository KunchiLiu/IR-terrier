	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at how the dose of dialysis is affected by the rate at which dialysate flows through the dialyzer. The dose of dialysis (Kt/V) will be determined by measuring blood levels of urea at the beginning and end of dialysis at two different dialysate flow rates.</brief_summary>
