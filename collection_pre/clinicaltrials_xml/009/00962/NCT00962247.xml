	<brief_summary>The primary aim is to examine relative reinforcing value (RRV) of physical activity to sedentary behaviors as a predictor of substitution of physical activity for sedentary behaviors when sedentary behaviors are reduced. The investigators predict that there will be a significant positive relationship between RRV and substitution of physical activity for sedentary behavior when sedentary behavior is reduced. The investigators also predict that there will be a significant positive relationship between reduction in sedentary behaviors and energy intake and dietary fat.</brief_summary>
