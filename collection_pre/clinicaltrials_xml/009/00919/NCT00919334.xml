	<brief_title>Myopia Control With Simultaneous Vision Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that the natural process of emmetropization in human is regulated by the equilibrium between the opposite hyperopic and myopic defocus. A sharp focus of retinal image (foveal fixation) is fundamental for co-ordination of the equilibrium. The DISC lens is a custom-made multi-zone bifocal soft contact lens which is based on simultaneously provides clear vision and defocus at all viewing distances. It comprises of correcting zones for correcting distant prescription(correction of refractive error, and defocusing zones to incorporate constant myopic defocus for slowing down myopia progression.</detailed_description>
