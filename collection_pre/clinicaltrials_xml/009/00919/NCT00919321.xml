	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)have had very poor humoral responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). The vaccine in which pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens are conjugated to protein (PCV) have been immunogenic in CLL patients in our previous studies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the duration of these vaccine-induced antibodies and the function of memory cells by giving a one dose of PPV-vaccine after several years of PCV-vaccination.</brief_summary>
