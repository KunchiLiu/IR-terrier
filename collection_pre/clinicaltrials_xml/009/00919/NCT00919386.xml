	<brief_summary>To examine a patient's quality of life using three methods for measuring stent size: (a) direct measurement, (b) patient height, and (c) a standardized formula. The intent of the study is to show if there is a difference in a patient's quality of life, postoperative symptoms, pain medication and anticholinergic use by using one of these specific methods for stent size determination. No method is interventional in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ureteral Stent Size Measurement Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ureteral stent placement is common in Urologic practice and many studies have been done looking at factors to improve stent related symptoms, but few have used a validated questionnaire to assess these symptoms affect on quality of life.We plan to prospectively randomize patients to three separate techniques such as (a) direct measurement,(b) patient height, and (c) a standardized formula for the determination of stent size. Using a validated questionnaire, the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ), we will assess whether there is a difference in outcome measures such as patient quality of life, need for pain medications and anticholinergics, and in postoperative symptoms based on one of these techniques. The USSQ was developed by Joshi et al to assess the impact of health-related quality of life issues related to ureteral stents. Data from USSQ questionnaire will be collected 7-10 days post-operatively as well as 4 weeks post-op and then this will be aggregated for our outcome measures to determine which method of stent size give better outcomes.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patients presenting to Charleston Area Medical Center between the ages of 18 and 90 years old who will undergo cytoscopy or ureteroscopy with ureteral stent placement will be eligible for the study. Patients excluded from this study will be those who are less than 18 years of age, pregnant women, and patients who are septic on presentation, as well as patients who have had lower extremity amputations or are wheelchair bound.</criteria>
