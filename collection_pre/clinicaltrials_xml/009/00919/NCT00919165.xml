	<brief_title>Assessment of Cognitive Function in Patients Undergoing Carotid Artery Stent Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single Center, Case Controlled design using pre and post stent cognitive function testin. Patients will serve as self controls to observe the effect, if any, of carotid stent placement on cognitive function in asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid artery stenosis</detailed_description>
