	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the prevalence and severity of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) which in non-diabetics is termed advanced nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction as well as the overall sympathovagal balance (SB) in the CEFH population of diabetic patients versus non-diabetic patients undergoing elective vitreoretinal surgery.</brief_summary>
