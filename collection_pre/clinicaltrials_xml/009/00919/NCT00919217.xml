	<brief_title>Exploratory Study on the Timing of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluctuations in MS symptoms in women with RR-MS might be affected by a variety of factors. To determine which factors are important, we are asking subjects to fill out a diary and calendar on a daily basis for 90 days. After an initial instructional meeting over the phone, the materials are filled out at home and returned monthly via postage-paid envelopes provided by the study. Compensation ($10 gift card) is sent after each monthly diary is received. The diary includes a list of symptoms and a rank scale for the women to show subtle changes in MS symptoms. The calendar allows the subject to denote additional factors such as stress, hormonal cycles, illnesses or immunizations and changed or missed medications. We anticipate that statistical analysis will reveal which of these factors affect women with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.</detailed_description>
