	<brief_title>My Scrivener® - Measuring Effectiveness and Dose Response in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study builds on a large body of neurological research that uses robot-guided repetitive motion training to induce neuroplasticity and improvements in upper extremity motor skills in adults and children. This research study is looking at handwriting, a fine-motor task that is used daily. In our study, we want to see if 3-dimensional robotic-assisted repetitive motion training can be a safe and effective intervention for school-age children with fine motor deficits arising from several different impairment origins. Our research construct is: Legible handwriting = function of (tactile feedback, visual feedback, duration, and fine-motor control). Independent variables: - Tactile feedback is a continuous variable of force-feedback measured in pounds of force. - Duration is a continuous variable measured in seconds and number of repetitions. - Visual feedback is the letter scribed on the paper. Dependent variable: - Legible handwriting will be measured by scoring on the Test of Handwriting Skills and the Print Tool™ evaluation. - Fine motor deficit/control will be measured directly and objectively by quantifying the error between the desired scribing task and the actual scribing task. The robotic device is an affordable (&lt;$200) computer haptic (the Falcon(R)) that currently is approved by the FCC for home and office. It is *not* approved for medical use. This is an investigational, nonsignificant risk device.</detailed_description>
