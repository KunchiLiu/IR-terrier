	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect and store brain tissue samples and blood from children with brain cancer that will be tested in the laboratory. Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting and Storing Blood and Brain Tumor Tissue Samples From Children With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Collect brain tumor tissue and an accompanying blood sample from pediatric patients with brain tumors treated at Children's Oncology Group institutions. II. Provide a repository for long-term storage of specimens from these patients. III. Make these specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of pediatric brain tumors. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Brain tumor tissue and blood specimens are collected from patients and banked for future study.</detailed_description>
