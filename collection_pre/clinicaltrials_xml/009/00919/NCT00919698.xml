	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this trial is to assess the relationship between a daily awakening from sedation and the prevalence of delirium, and in doing so better characterize delirium in the ICU.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delirium in Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, observational, cross-over design study assessing the impact of daily awakening from sedation on delirium in the ICU. Enrolled patients will receive a daily baseline delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU tool before the awakening from sedation and an assessment during the awakening from sedation. Each patient will thus serve as their own controls for these interventions.</detailed_description>
