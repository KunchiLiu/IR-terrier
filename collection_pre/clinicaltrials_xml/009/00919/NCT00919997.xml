	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information about human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in HIV-positive men who have sex with men may help doctors learn more about the disease. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying HPV infection in HIV-positive Indian men who have sex with men.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Papilloma Virus Infection in HIV-Positive Indian Men Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Describe the prevalence of penile, anal, and oral human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in HIV-seropositive Indian men who have sex with men. - Determine the spectrum of HPV types at these anatomic sites in these patients. - Determine the distribution of strain variants of HPV 16, 18, and 31 at these anatomic sites in these patients. - Describe risk factors for penile, anal, and oral HPV infection in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients complete interviewer-administered questionnaires on demographics, native place, socioeconomic status, medical history, numbers of sexual partners and sexual practices, circumcision status, and risk factors for oral malignancies and human papilloma virus (HPV), including oral sex, smoking or chewing tobacco, drug use, oral hygiene, and tooth loss. Patients undergo cell sample collection from the penis, scrotum, anus, and mouth, and saliva sample collection for HPV DNA testing by PCR. Patients also undergo blood sample collection to measure CD4+ count and HIV viral load by FACS and PCR.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: HIV1 infection, as documented by ELISA and confirmed by a second testing method (e.g., western blot, HIV1 culture, HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA, or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA) If prior documentation and confirmation of HIV1 infection is not available, two licensed rapid HIV tests are allowed Must have had receptive or insertive anal intercourse with another man within the past 6 months PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Speaks Hindi (in Mumbai) or Tamil (in Vellore) No active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site Investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements No history of a sexchange operation that would preclude collection of penile or scrotal specimens PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Not specified</criteria>
