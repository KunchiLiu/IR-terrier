	<brief_summary>Most HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages in Korea, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is considered a key modality for palliative treatment in these HCC patients. TACE is currently one of the mainstays of palliative treatments worldwide for patients with inoperable HCC and it has shown survival benefits in patients with unresectable HCC. TACE consists primarily of directly targeted chemotherapy and embolization of arteries feeding the tumors, inevitably resulting in a hypoxic insult to HCC and surrounding liver tissues. Ischemic injury after TACE has been found to induce the upregulation of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is essential for tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in patients with HCC. Recent studies have shown a significant correlation between pre-TACE level of circulating VEGF or VEGF upregulation after TACE and HCC characteristics, including tumor size, vascular invasion, and metastasis. TACE consists primarily of directly targeted chemotherapy and embolization of arteries feeding the tumors, inevitably resulting in a hypoxic insult to HCC and surrounding liver tissues. Central tumor hypoxia was found to upregulate proangiogenic growth factors, which are potent mediators of tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, expression of circulating or tissue VEGF was enhanced after TACE in patients or animals with HCC, and there could be some probability of adverse effects of TACE in HCC patients. In addition, the investigators demonstrated that a transient increment of serum VEGF level after TACE was significantly correlated with poor outcomes of tumor progression, especially outcomes relevant to distant metastasis. Therefore, these findings suggest a rationale for applying adjuvant therapy with anti-angiogenesis agent additional treatment of anti-angiogenesis after TACE or during TACE in a selected group of patients HCC. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of sorafenib 400 mg bid with TACE in patients with unresectable and/or inoperable HCC.</brief_summary>
