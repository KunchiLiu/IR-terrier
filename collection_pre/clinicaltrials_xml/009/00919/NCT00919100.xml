	<brief_title>Buzzy Versus Vapocoolant Spray: Pediatric Needle Pain Relief</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Needle pain is the most common and the most feared source of childhood pain, resulting in needle phobia for 10% of adults. Current pain relief options include numbing creams, vapocoolant spray, or injected lidocaine. 17 million pediatric IV access procedures are done yearly with no pain intervention. An inexpensive, immediately acting form of needle pain control could reduce needle phobia in the long term if demonstrated to be effective for needle pain. This study will evaluate pain self report and parent report using the Faces Pain Scale revised, and video-coded OSBD-R scores for patients undergoing emergency department venous access or cannulation procedures. Demographic information, pre-procedural anxiety, and success data from the attempts at placement will be included.</detailed_description>
