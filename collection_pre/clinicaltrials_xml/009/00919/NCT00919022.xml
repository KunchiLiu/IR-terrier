	<brief_summary>Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a steroidal antiandrogen which has affinity with progesterone and with glucocorticoid receptors. Cyproterone acetate is long-term proven effective treatment of inoperable carcinoma of the prostate. Sexual functions remain very important in men with prostate cancer. However sexual functions are deteriorating fast with course of the disease. The influence of CPA on sexual functions remains controversial. IIEF-5 erectile dysfunction questionnaire is currently widely used validated simple scoring system for diagnosing of erectile dysfunction and belongs to most used systems in Czech Republic. At present there are no data on CPA influence on IIEF-5 scored erectile dysfunction within the use of its indication in prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
