	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial studies how well treosulfan and fludarabine phosphate with or without low dose radiation before donor stem cell transplantation works in treating patients with nonmalignant (noncancerous) diseases. Hematopoietic cell transplantation has been shown to be curative for many patients with nonmalignant (noncancerous) diseases such as primary immunodeficiency disorders, bone marrow failure syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, and inborn errors of metabolism (metabolic disorders). Powerful chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation are often used to condition the patient before infusion of the new healthy donor cells. The purpose of the conditioning therapy is to destroy the patient's abnormal bone marrow which doesn't work properly in order to make way for the new healthy donor cells which functions normally. Although effective in curing the patient's disease, many hematopoietic cell transplantation regimens use intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation which can be quite toxic, have significant side effects, and can potentially be life-threatening. Investigators are investigating whether a new conditioning regimen that uses less intensive drugs (treosulfan and fludarabine phosphate) with or without low dose radiation results in new blood-forming cells (engraftment) of the new donor cells without increased toxicities in patients with nonmalignant (noncancerous) diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treosulfan and Fludarabine Phosphate Before Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Nonmalignant Inherited Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate, within the limits of a phase II study, the preliminary efficacy as defined by engraftment, of a regimen consisting of treosulfan and fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in patients with nonmalignant inherited disorders. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the incidence of non-relapse mortality 200 days and 1 year post-HCT. II. To evaluate the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). III. To evaluate the incidence of chronic GVHD as defined as those patients requiring systemic immunosuppression. IV. To evaluate donor chimerism on days +28 and +100. V. To assess disease response following HCT. VI. To evaluate immune reconstitution following HCT. VII. To evaluate the incidence of infections. VIII. To evaluate overall survival. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive treosulfan intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -6 to -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2. Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -4 to -2. Patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation will also receive low dose total-body irradiation on day -1. TRANSPLANTATION: Patients receive either bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), or umbilical cord blood from the donor on day 0. The use of either bone marrow, PBSC, or umbilical cord blood will depend on the donor status. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive a combination of immunosuppressive medications to try and prevent graft-versus-host disease. If patients undergo bone marrow or PBSC transplantation, tacrolimus and methotrexate will be used. If patients undergo cord blood transplantation, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be used. In general, patients will receive immunosuppression until at least 180 days after transplantation; however they could be on immunosuppression longer if they develop graft versus host disease. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a nonmalignant disease treatable by allogeneic HCT Patients with a known nonmalignant disease that is not clearly defined will need to be discussed with the protocol principal investigator (PI) (Dr. Lauri Burroughs) and potentially the nonmalignant board to determine if they are eligible for HCT on this study DONOR: Human leukocyte antigens (HLA)identical related donors or unrelated donors matched for HLAA, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 or mismatched for a single allele at HLAA, B, C, DRB1 or a single DQB1 antigen or allele mismatch by high resolution deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) typing DONOR: Bone marrow is the preferred cell source; PBSC are allowed if donor refuses or is unable to give marrow or as clinically indicated or following discussion with the PI DONOR: Umbilical Cord Blood: Unit selection is based on the cryopreserved total nucleated cell (TNC) dose and matching at HLAA, B antigen level and DRB1 allele level typing; while HLAC antigen/allele level typing is not considered in the matching criteria, if available, may be used to optimize unit selection DONOR: Umbilical Cord Blood: The patient and the cord blood unit(s) must be matched for at least 4 of 6 loci as defined above DONOR: Umbilical Cord Blood: Selection of two umbilical cord blood (UCB) units is allowed to provide sufficient cell dose Patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia; (patients with aplastic anemia associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH] or inherited marrow failure syndromes, except Fanconi anemia, will be allowed) Patients with impaired cardiac function as evidenced by ejection fraction &lt; 35% (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction, shortening fraction of &lt; 26%) or cardiac insufficiency requiring treatment or symptomatic coronary artery disease; patients with a shortening fraction &lt; 26% may be enrolled if approved by a cardiologist Patients with impaired pulmonary function as evidenced by diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 50% of predicted (or, if unable to perform pulmonary function tests, then oxygen [O2] saturation &lt; 92% on room air) Patients with impaired renal function as evidenced by creatinineclearance &lt; 50% for age, weight, height or serum creatinine &gt; 2 x upper normal limit or dialysisdependent Patients with evidence of synthetic dysfunction or severe cirrhosis requiring deferral of conditioning as recommended by a gastroenterology specialist Patients with an active infectious disease requiring deferral of conditioning; as recommended by an infectious disease specialist Patients who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding Patients with a known hypersensitivity to treosulfan and/or fludarabine Receiving another experimental drug within 4 weeks of initiation of conditioning (day 6) unless approved by the PI DONOR: Deemed unable to undergo marrow harvesting or PBSC mobilization and leukapheresis DONOR: HIVpositive DONOR: With active infectious hepatitis DONOR: Females with a positive pregnancy test DONOR: Umbilical Cord Blood: Any cord blood units with &lt; 1.5 x 10^7 total nucleated cells per kilogram recipient weight DONOR: Umbilical Cord Blood: Any cord blood units without full maternal testing and negative results for hepatitis A, B, C, HIV, and human Tcell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV1) viruses; any additional available virology results on the unit itself will be reviewed but are not mandated, complete or always available; cord blood units are presumed to be cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative regardless of serologic testing due to passive transmission of maternal CMV antibodies</criteria>
