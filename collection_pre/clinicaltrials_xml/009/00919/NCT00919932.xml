	<brief_title>Using a Text-message System to Engage Depressed Adolescents in Cognitive-behavioral Therapy Homework</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescent major depressive disorder leads to recurrent episodes, increased rates of attempted and completed suicides, and persistent social impairment between episodes (Weissman et al 1999). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an accepted first-line therapy for mild-moderate depression in adolescents. Integral to CBT is "homework" as it enhances mastery of newly learned coping strategies, facilitates generalization of skills to novel situations, increases self-efficacy, and ultimately reduces vulnerability to relapse (Detweiler et al 1999). Adherence to homework is a recognized problem in adults, and is similarly problematic in adolescents. One method of implementing CBT homework in a manner that is centric to current youth culture is through text messaging. By using a modern modality that many adolescents rely on for daily communication, there is the likelihood that they will find it more engaging than traditional modalities. Thus the potential that a text message system can help improve homework compliance in adolescents is significant, because improved homework adherence may ultimately be linked to improved clinical outcomes for these disorders with high rates of chronic morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>
