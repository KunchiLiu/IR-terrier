	<brief_summary>Hyperuricemia is a very common finding in patients with heart failure. It is usually related to diuretic use and deteriorated renal function. The recently evidence showed that uric acid (UA) lowering therapy may improve clinical status in symptomatic heart failure patients with hyperuricemia. In their clinical practice, the investigators found that glucocorticoids could dramatically lower UA while improving renal function. Thus the investigators design this randomized head to head study to test our hypothesis that prednisone have the same efficacy to allopurinol on lowering UA and could improve renal function at the same time.</brief_summary>
