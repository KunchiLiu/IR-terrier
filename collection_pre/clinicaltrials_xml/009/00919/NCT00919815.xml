	<brief_summary>Study 1A: Ciclosporin in the management of new Type 1 Reactions in Leprosy Objective: A randomised double blind controlled trial comparing Ciclosporin and Prednisolone,to determine whether treatment with Ciclosporin gives the same outcome in the treatment of new Type 1 Reactions as Prednisolone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ciclosporin in the Management of New Type 1 Reactions in Leprosy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We tested our hypothesis that ciclosporin would be as effective as prednisolone in the treatment of patients with leprosy reactions and nerve function impairment and that patients treated with ciclosporin would have fewer side effects than patients treated with prednisolone. A randomised controlled trial comparing ciclosporin and prednisolone in the treatment of acute leprosy T1R was conducted.</detailed_description>
