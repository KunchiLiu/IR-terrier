	<brief_summary>As part of the global clinical development program for AG-013736, studies are ongoing (and planned) in cancer patients in China. An assessment of AG-013736 pharmacokinetics in Chinese subjects, as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted. In the current study the single dose pharmacokinetics of AG-013736 will be characterized at 3 doses (5 mg, 7 mg and 10 mg).</brief_summary>
