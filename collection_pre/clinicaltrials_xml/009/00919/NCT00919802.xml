	<brief_summary>Anecdotal evidence suggests female patients with painful bladder disorder interstitial cystitis (IC) can experience a significant attenuation of their systems while breastfeeding. Since it has been shown that postpartum lactation is a time associated with decreased levels of stress, and stress has been shown to exacerbate IC-related pain, the investigators have developed an interest in the effects of the hormones involved in postpartum lactation on stress and pain. Based on a series of pre-clinical experiments, the investigators believe the hormone oxytoxin has both analgesic and anxiolytic properties which make it a potentially useful agent for the treatment of stress-exacerbated chronic pain syndrome such as IC. Therefore, the investigators propose a double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial of intranasal oxytocin vs. intranasal saline for bladder pain in a cohort of patients with IC and some degree of continuous, daily pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Oxytocin for the Treatment of Pain Associated With Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty patients will be enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled single-dose crossover trial comparing intranasal oxytocin to intranasal saline. At the time of enrollment, patients will complete a series of standardized questionnaires detailing information about their IC-related symptoms at baseline as well as comorbid conditions, coping mechanisms (specifically catastrophizing), and baseline ratings of overall pain, depression, anxiety, and global functioning. Once this information is obtained, the patient will receive a one-time dose of intranasal oxytocin or an equivalent volume of intranasal saline. The patients will be monitored for one hour by a physician investigator for toxicities and efficacy and then contacted for follow-up information at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. At each of these time points, the patient will be asked to report a verbal pain report, a verbal anxiety report, the number of voids since last contact with an investigator, and the use of any additional medications for pain control or anxiety. In addition, a global response assessment (GRA) score will be obtained at 6 and 24 hours. The patient will be asked to return within a one week period at which time he/she will receive the alternative intranasal agent. Following the second dose, the patient will be monitored for one hour and contact made at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours as previously described. The primary outcome measure will be the GRA score, which will be analyzed using a Chi-square analysis followed by Fischer's exact test. Secondary outcome measures will be analyzed via ANOVA. If this study indicates that intranasal oxytocin is efficacious for pain control, this could provide for an alternative to current ineffective or invasive treatments for IC-related pain. It is also possible it could eventually be utilized for other forms of chronic pain as well.</detailed_description>
