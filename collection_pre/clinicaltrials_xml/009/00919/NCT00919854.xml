	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication), safety and antiviral activity to support dose recommendations by body weight of darunavir with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv), in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), in treatment-experienced Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) infected children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study to Evaluate the Antiviral Activity of Darunavir in Combination With Ritonavir in HIV 1 Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and antiviral activity. Approximately 24 HIV-1 infected children will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 48-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. Participants will receive DRV/rtv according to their body weight. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, laboratory tests, physical Examination, neurologic examination, vital signs, and electrocardiogram. The total duration of the study will be 56 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants with a documented HIV 1 infection (by any of the local standard diagnostic methods, such as HIV PCRDNA, ELISA or western blot (WB) test for HIV antibodies, etc.) Body weight from 10 kg to less than 20 kg at screening Participants currently on stable ART (anti retroviral therapy) for at least 12 weeks, who need to change their ARV regimen because it is currently failing, with a viral load of greater than 1000 copies/mL Screening genotype resistance test results showing less than 3 DRV resistanceassociated mutations Parents or legal representative willing and able to give consent Participants with presence of any currently active conditions included in the listing of WHO ( World Health Organisation) Clinical Stage 4 and participants with presence of a nonHIV encephalopathy Administration of any ARV (antiretroviral) or nonARV investigational medication or investigational vaccine within 30 days prior to screening, except for those medications where dose recommendations for children are available Life expectancy less than 6 months, according to the judgment of the investigator Coenrollment in other clinical and/or cohort trials without written permission of the Sponsor Participants with any active clinically significant disease (eg, tuberculosis [TB], cardiac dysfunction, pancreatitis, acute viral infections) or findings during screening of medical history or physical examination that, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the subject's safety or outcome of the study</criteria>
