	<brief_summary>Hypothesis #1: Residents who complete a structured, ultrasound guided simulation training protocol will have superior skills at central venous catheter (CVC) insertion on actual patients as compared to residents who are trained in CVC insertion according to the traditional, bedside apprenticeship model as measured by a reduced failure rate at CVC insertion. Hypothesis #2: Residents who complete a structured, ultrasound guided simulation training protocol will have superior skills at CVC insertion on actual patients as compared to residents who are trained in CVC insertion according to the traditional, bedside apprenticeship model as measured by: 1. a reduced number of attempts at venous cannulation, 2. a decreased rate of technical errors and a decreased complication rate based on an independent rater's evaluation using a procedure checklist, and 3. a decreased time to CVC insertion from opening the catheter kit to placement of sterile dressing as timed by an independent rater.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulation Training for Ultrasound Guided Central Venous Catheter Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resident education has traditionally devoted itself to knowledge acquisition rather than defined levels of clinical competence. Currently, inexperienced physicians are trained to perform invasive procedures such as central venous catheter (CVC) insertion according to the bedside, apprenticeship model, gaining expertise on real patients in neither a rigorous nor standardized manner. Simulators may ease trainees' transition to actual patients and avoid adverse events. This project aims to investigate the efficacy of a structured simulation training protocol in ultrasound guided CVC insertion for resident physicians. The specific aims are to compare: (1) the failure rate of CVC insertion, and (2) the number of attempts at venous cannulation, rates of technical errors and complications of CVC insertion, and time to CVC insertion on actual patients between residents who completed a structured, hands-on simulation training protocol (intervention group) and those who are trained according to the traditional, bedside apprenticeship model (control group). We hypothesize that the intervention group will obtain superior skills at CVC insertion on actual patients as compared to the control group as measured by: (1) a reduced failure rate at CVC insertion, (2) a) a reduced number of attempts at venous cannulation b) a decreased rate of technical errors and complications and c) a decreased time to insertion based on an independent rater's evaluation using a procedure checklist.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligibility is determined by the program director of the residency programs. The racial, gender, and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subject population reflects the demographics of the interns and residents within the specialties of Emergency Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology and Anesthesia. None of the subjects are minors and all are in sufficient health to participate in their residency programs. Of eligible subjects, the only exclusion criterion is unwillingness to participate in the project. No exclusion criteria shall be based on race, gender, or ethnicity.</criteria>
