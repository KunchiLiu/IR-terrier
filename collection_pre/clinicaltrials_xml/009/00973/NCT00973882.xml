	<brief_summary>The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a chemotherapy regimen combining carboplatin and etoposide in patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer and neuro-endocrine differentiation. Eligible patients are treated with the combination of carboplatin AUC4 on day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on day 1, day 2 and day 3 repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. Efficacy endpoints include Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and neuro-endocrine marker response (defined as a 50% or greater decrease from baseline serum values), objective response rate (according to RECIST criteria), and toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin-Etoposide Combination in Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuro-endocrine differentiation is observed in the evolution of hormone-resistant prostate cancer. The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a chemotherapy regimen combining carboplatin and etoposide in patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer and neuro-endocrine differentiation. To be eligible, patients must have either circulating neuro-endocrine markers (Chromogranin A: CgA, Neuron Specific Enolase: NSE)and/or visceral metastases. Eligible patients are treated with the combination of carboplatin AUC4 administered on day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 given on day 1, day 2 and day 3 and repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. The primary objective of the study is to assess objective response to the carboplatin - etoposide combination (according to RECIST criteria for lesions and defined as a 50% or greater decrease from baseline serum values for PSA and neuro-endocrine markers). Secondary objectives include evaluation of toxicity, duration of response, progression-free-survival and overall survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological evidence of prostate adenocarcinoma Metastatic disease, either measurable (lymph nodes, hepatic lesion, pulmonary lesions with longest diameter &gt; or = 1 cm on spiral scan), or non measurable (bone metastasis) Patients must: Have received hormonal therapy via surgical or chemical castration (LHRH agonist) with or without antiandrogens. Antiandrogen withdrawal is recommended before inclusion, with an offtreatment period of at least 4 weeks. LHRH agonist treatment must be continued. Have a relapse or disease refractory to hormonal treatment (defined by a testosterone level &lt; 0.5 Âµg/ml) Have neuroendocrine progression defined, whatever the PSA level, as: NSE and/or Chromogranin A &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) with or without visceral metastases (liver, lung, lymph node) No increase of NSE or Chromogranin A, but visceral metastases (either hepatic, pleuropulmonary, or nodal) with cytological or histological confirmation of the presence of an undifferentiated or neuroendocrine component of prostatic origin Prior treatment by radiotherapy is allowed but radiation therapy must have been completed for at least 4 weeks before inclusion and irradiated areas must not represent more than 25% of marrow reserves Prior treatment by estramustine is allowed but must have been stopped at least 4 weeks before inclusion Age&gt; or = 18 years Life expectancy&gt; or = 3 months Karnofsky index&gt; or = 50% Adequate haematological function: neutrophils&gt; or = 1.5 G/l, platelets&gt; or = 100 G/l, haemoglobin&gt; or = 8 g/dl. Use of erythropoietin is allowed. Adequate liver function: bilirubin level within the institution's normal range, AST and ALT&lt; or = 1.5 ULN Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance&gt; or = 40 ml/min (Gault and Cockroft method) Signed written informed consent. Patients having no&gt; 1.5 x ULN increase of at least one neuroendocrine marker (NSE or chromogranin A) and no cytological or histological (undifferentiated or neuroendocrine type) evidence of visceral metastasis (hepatic, pleuropulmonary, or nodal) History of other malignancies, other than curatively treated basal cell skin carcinoma or any other curatively treated cancer with no sign of recurrence within 5 years Symptomatically uncontrolled brain metastasis Interstitial radiation therapy (using strontium or samarium) within the previous 3 months Prior treatment with platinum salts or etoposide. Other chemotherapy regimens are allowed provided that the last dose has been administered&gt; or = 4 weeks prior to inclusion. Concomitant treatment with other anticancer drugs, except corticoid or LHRH agonist injections Peripheral neuropathy&gt; or = 2 (NCICTCAE) Uncontrolled progressive thromboembolic disease Uncontrolled infection Medical history of acute myocardial infection or uncontrolled angina pectoris, or hypertension or uncontrolled arrythmia Inclusion in another clinical trial Impaired followup for social, geographical, familial or psychological reasons Any other unstable disease.</criteria>
