	<brief_summary>Regional anesthesia, including epidural, spinal and combined epidural spinal anesthesia (CSEA), is a pivotal part in modern anesthesiology. Previously, the investigators found that epidural and spinal anesthesia during cesarean section possesses different responsiveness to fluid (including crystalloid and colloid) management given prior or posterior to anesthesia. Although CSEA is also widely used as an alternative of single epidural or spinal anesthesia for its combined effect of fast onset of anesthesia of spinal anesthesia and the property of duration of epidural catheterization, the fluid resuscitation during CSEA is still unknown. The investigators hypothesized that fluid management during CSEA would produce different effect on hemodynamics in cesarean section compared with epidural and spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
