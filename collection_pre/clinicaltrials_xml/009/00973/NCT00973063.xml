	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Routine Sterile Gloving in Blood Culture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because contamination during sampling for blood culture may interfere in interpreting the results of blood culture, lowering the contamination rates in blood culture is very important. According to current guideline, routine sterile gloving is not recommended. We hypothesized that routine sterile gloving can lower contamination rates in blood culture.</detailed_description>
