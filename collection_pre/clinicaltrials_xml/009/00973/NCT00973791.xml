	<brief_summary>Fluid management plays an essential role in cesarean section. In previous study (NCT00488111) the investigators found that prior-epidural anesthesia fluid management produced a more significant role in stabilizing the blood pressure and better prognosis after cesarean delivery than that of the posterior-anesthesia ones. Given epidural anesthesia has a time interval before reaching the best state of anesthesia, so the fluid management also has a relatively adequate time to resuscitation. In reality, spinal anesthesia is used popularly except for the epidural anesthesia, whereas spinal anesthesia would produce more significant fluctuation of the hemodynamics compared with the latter. Herein the investigators proposed whether the prior-spinal anesthesia fluid management also produced similar effect on hemodynamic characteristics to the epidural anesthesia.</brief_summary>
