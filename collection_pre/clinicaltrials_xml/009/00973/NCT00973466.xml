	<brief_summary>There has been an increase in incidence in sexually transmitted infections in HIV infected patients in the last years. In this study the investigators will prospectively evaluate the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections with N. gonorrhea and Ch. trachomatis as well as the seroprevalence of Herpes simplex Type 2 infection in HIV-infected patients attending the clinic for infectious diseases at the Berne University Hospital. In addition, participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire on sexual behaviour and sexual health. Study hypothesis: STI prevalence is high in certain risk-groups to justify screening in regular intervals.</brief_summary>
