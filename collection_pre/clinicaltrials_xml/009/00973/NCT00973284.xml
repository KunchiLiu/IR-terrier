	<brief_title>Norwalk Vaccine Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called intranasal Norwalk virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Norwalk VLP vaccine is being tested to prevent viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE). This study will look at the illness rate of AGE in people who are administered the Norwalk VLP vaccine. The study enrolled 98 patients and was conducted in 2 stages: the Vaccination Stage and the Challenge Stage. In the Vaccination Stage participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Norwalk VLP Vaccine (100 µg VLP) intranasally - Placebo (dummy inactive powder) - this is a powder that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient During the Challenge Stage participants were administered live Norwalk virus and were monitored for AGE. This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 29 weeks Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and were contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Expressed interest, availability, and understanding to fulfill the study requirements including measures to prevent Norwalk virus contamination of the environment and spread of infection and illness to the community. The prospective subjects must pass (&gt; 75 % correct answers) a written examination on all aspects of the study before enrollment. (Appendix D) 5. Available to return for followup visits following discharge from the inpatient unit and deliver stool specimens to the investigator promptly. 6. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential, or if of childbearing potential (as determined by the investigator) must be practicing abstinence or using an effective licensed method of birth control (e.g. oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream, or foam; intrauterine contraceptive device, or DepoProvera; skin patch; vaginal ring or cervical cap) for 30 days prior to vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions during the study and for 60 days after the Challenge visit. Male subjects must agree not to father a child during the study and for 60 days after the Challenge visit. 7. Demonstrated to be H type1 antigen secretor positive (by saliva test). [This saliva test may be done outside of the 45 day window and does not need to be repeated.] 8. Agrees not to participate in another clinical trial with an investigational product for the entire duration of the study (six months after the last dose of study vaccine or placebo i.e. 201 days). 1. Living with or having daily contact with children age 5 years or less or a woman known to be pregnant. This includes significant contact at home, school, daycare, or equivalent facilities. 2. Nursing mother. 3. Living with or having daily contact with childcare workers. 4. Living with or having daily contact with elderly persons aged 70 years or more, or infirmed, diapered individuals, persons with disabilities or incontinent persons. This includes work or visits to nursing homes and daycare or equivalent facilities. 5. Evidence of recent (within 2 months) or of current nonbacterial gastroenteritis suggestive of Norwalk virus infection [vomiting or unformed or watery stools ( &gt; 2 during a 24 hour period)]. 6. Any gastroenteritis within the past 2 weeks. 7. History of chronic functional dyspepsia, chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gall bladder disease, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, frequent diarrhea, chronic constipation, or diverticulitis anytime during the subject's lifetime. 8. Regular use of medication other than oral contraceptive agents, antihypertensives, antidepressants, vitamins and minerals. 9. History of any of the following medical illnesses: Chronic rhinitis, runny nose, sneezing (including seasonal allergies) Clinically significant nose bleed within the prior 12 months Diabetes Cancer (malignancies other than a resolved skin lesion) Heart disease (hospitalization for a heart attack, arrhythmia, or syncope) Unconsciousness (other than a single brief "concussion") Seizures (other than febrile seizures as a child &lt;5 years old) Asthma requiring treatment with inhaler or medication in the prior 2 years Neuroinflammatory disease Autoimmune disease Eating disorder Chronic headaches associated with vomiting Chronic vomiting syndrome 10. Any current illness requiring daily medication other than vitamins, minerals, birth control, antidepressants or antihypertensives. 11. Blood Type B or AB. [This blood test may be done outside of the 45 day window and does not need to be repeated.] 12. Allergies or hypersensitivity to chitosan, shrimp, other shellfish or any component of the vaccine or placebo. 13. History of nasal surgery of any type (including tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy). 14. Any clinically significant abnormality detected on physical examination, including: Murmur (other than a functional murmur) Focal neurological abnormality Hepatosplenomegaly Lymphadenopathy Jaundice 15. Hypertension defined as BP &gt; 150/90 mm Hg on two separate measurements. Chronic stable wellcontrolled hypertension on medications is allowed. 16. History of more than 3 hospitalizations for invasive bacterial infections (pneumonia, meningitis), acute or chronic dermatitis (e.g. eczema, seborrhea, psoriasis) or collagen vascular disease [e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or dermatomyositis]. 17. Presence of other serious chronic illness (i.e. malignancy other than a resolved skin lesion). 18. Positive stool/fecal culture for bacterial pathogens (salmonella, campylobacter, E. coli 0157:H7, and shigella) or positive stool/fecal screen for ova and parasites. 19.
