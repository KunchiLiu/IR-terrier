	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the APTIMA® HPV Assay Using the TIGRIS® System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the APTIMA HPV Assay, using the TIGRIS System, in cervical cancer screening programs. This will be achieved by determining the performance of the assay for detecting high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types in women with known cervical disease status. The assay will be evaluated in sample populations of women with ASC-US Pap test results ("ASC-US results") and women 30 years of age or older ("30+ years of age") with negative (NILM) cytology results.</detailed_description>
