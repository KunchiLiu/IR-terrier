	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the amplitude and implicit time of electroretinogram (ERG), darkadaptation and the calibre of retinal vessels before and after optimized medical treatment of diabetic individuals (a lower blood glucose level) over a period of 12 months. Newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetics as well as dysregulated type 1 and type 2 diabetic individuals will be included. Retinal vessel calibre measurements will be used as an estimation of changes in the retinal perfusion.</brief_summary>
