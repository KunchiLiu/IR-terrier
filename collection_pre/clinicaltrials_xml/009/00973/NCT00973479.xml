	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical effectiveness and safety of golimumab with methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when compared to MTX alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of Intravenous Golimumab in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Treatment With Methotrexate Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study), multicenter, 2-arm (2 groups) study of golimumab in participants with active RA despite concurrent MTX therapy. Approximately 564 participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio ie, Group 1(approximately 376 participants will receive golimumab + MTX) and Group 2 (approximately 188 participants will receive MTX + placebo). Total duration of study for each participant is 112 weeks. Safety will be evaluated by assessment of adverse events, tuberculosis testing and blood testing.</detailed_description>
