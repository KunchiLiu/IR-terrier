	<brief_title>A Dose-ranging Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of JNJ-42160443 as add-on Treatment in Patients With Osteoarthritis-related Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This current study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned drug) study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of different doses of JNJ-42160443 compared with placebo in the treatment of patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip or the knee who have moderate to severe pain that is not controlled by standard pain medications.Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease that affects the joints, and is characterized by degeneration of cartilage and bone. The duration of the study is approximately 133 weeks (3-week screening phase, 12-week double-blind efficacy phase, 92-week double-blind extension phase, and 26-week post treatment phase).JNJ-42160443 (10 mg/mL) or matching placebo given as an subcutaneous (injection under the skin) (SC) once every 4 weeks will be administered in the study as 1 of 5 JNJ-42160443 dosages:1 mg every 4 weeks, 3 mg every 4 weeks, 3 mg every 8 weeks, 6 mg every 8 weeks; or 10 mg every 8 weeks, or matching placebo for up to approximately 104 weeks (12-week double-blind efficacy phase + 92-week double-blind extension phase).</detailed_description>
