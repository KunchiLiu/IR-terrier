	<brief_summary>Primary Hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) increases bone turnover and resorption and thus calcium efflux out of bone. After successful surgical treatment of pHPT, bone takes up calcium again which may result in secondary hyperparathyroidism or even "hungry bone syndrome". Until today there are no studies about this problem helping to develop recommendations or guidelines how to prevent these symptoms. Study hypothesis: Calcium and vitamin D intake after surgery for PHPT protects the bone by keeping PTH in the normal range (less secondary, reactive hyperparathyroidism), prevents hungry bone- syndrome and improve bone-turnover markers (osteoporosis protection).</brief_summary>
