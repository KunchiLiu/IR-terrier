	<brief_summary>The RECESS study will compare the effects of transfusing red blood cell units stored &lt;= 10 days vs. red blood cell units stored &gt;= 21 days, in patients who are undergoing complex cardiac surgery and are likely to need a red blood cell transfusion. The primary hypothesis is that there is a clinically important difference between the effects of shorter-storage red cell units and longer-storage red cell units on clinical outcomes and mortality risk.</brief_summary>
