	<brief_summary>This study aims to identify and quantify the factors associated with excess weight gain following treatment for breast cancer. It is believed that breast cancer patients gain more than 4% of their weight at diagnosis which is likely accompanied by an increase in body fat and waist circumference. It is further thought that this excess weight and increase in body fat and waist circumference are associated to tumour characteristics, chemotherapy, menopause status at diagnosis and the presence of genes related to obesity. It is also thought that women treated with chemotherapy have higher levels of glucose and insulin.</brief_summary>
