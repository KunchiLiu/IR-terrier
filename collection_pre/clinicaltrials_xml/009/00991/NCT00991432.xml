	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether this study treatment can improve the bone structure of the upper front part of the jaw in patients who are scheduled for surgery to have a dental implant(s) placed into the upper front part of their mouths and need to have more bone in their jaws to support the implant, so that a dental implant can later be inserted.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The INFUSE® Bone Graft is a device approved by the FDA to be used instead of using your own bone (from another site on your body) to replace missing bone in your jaw. INFUSE® Bone Graft is commercially available and is made up of 2 parts - recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (rhBMP 2) placed on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). The rhBMP-2 is a genetically altered protein which recruits bone-forming cells to the surgical area and changes local cells to bone. ACS is made from Type I collagen from bovine (cattle) tendon. It helps to hold the rhBMP-2 in place and acts as a support for the growing bone. The sponge itself will reabsorb in time as the new bone forms. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether this study treatment can improve the bone structure of the upper front part of the jaw so that a dental implant can later be inserted. This post-market study has been designed to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of INFUSE® Bone Graft, along with space holding devices, in a 2-part procedure. Your dental implants will be placed at approximately 6 months after the INFUSE® Bone Graft implant.</detailed_description>
