	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCR3 in the tear film and ocular surface of patients with dry eye syndrome. Thirty-three patients with dry eye (16 Sjögren's syndrome and 17 non-Sjögren's syndrome patients) and 15 control subjects were recruited. The concentrations of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in tears were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The correlation between chemokine levels and tear film and ocular surface parameters was analyzed. Expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCR3 in the conjunctiva was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry was performed to count CXCR3+ cells and CXCR3+CD4+ cells in the conjunctiva.</brief_summary>
