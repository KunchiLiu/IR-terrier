	<brief_summary>The major purpose of this exploratory developmental study will be to develop a patient-centered and feasible protocol for communicating genetic data as it relates to drug efficacy for smoking cessation inpatients receiving medication that is matched to individual genotypes associated with increased efficacy for bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Therefore, our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Conduct formative research to develop and refine a clinical protocol for a multi-component smoking cessation intervention, grounded in the extended parallel process model, consisting of pharmacogenetic treatment (smoking cessation drug matched to each individual smoker's genotype) and genetic feedback (delivery of patient-centered, personalized genotype information and its predictive value for smoking cessation treatment efficacy): We will adapt, pilot-test, and refine a theoretically-grounded PGx smoking cessation intervention using formative interviews of 20 African-American and European-ancestry smokers. Aim 2: Conduct a mixed-methods feasibility trial randomizing treatment-seeking smokers to pharmacogenetic (PGx) treatment combined with genetic feedback (GF) vs. PGx treatment without GF for smoking cessation to examine the feasibility of the newly developed protocol in a primary care setting and characterize its psychological and behavioral impact: Smokers (N = 100) will be randomized to GF vs. no GF and all will receive motivational interviewing (standard care/SC) and PGx treatment. We will assess the impact of GF on time to relapse, medication adherence, and a comprehensive assessment battery of process and cognitive, psychological, and behavioral outcomes. Finally, we will synthesize quantitative and qualitative data to revise protocols, generate hypothesizes, and estimate effect sizes for a follow-up R01 submission.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are the same for participants in the formative interviews (Study A) and the feasibility RCT (Study B) except that Study A will include African American and European American smokers and Study B will include European American smokers. Inclusion criteria: Adults (aged 18 or older) Currently smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day Motivated to quit smoking (&gt;=5 on a 10point Likert scale) Have a telephone Read and speak English. Exclusion criteria: Any medical contraindications for transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or sustainedrelease bupropion hydrochloride (bupropion) use based on the package labels (e.g., for bupropion, risk of seizure) DSMIV Axis I diagnosis (other than nicotine dependence) Subjects who meet criteria for current major depression, or who demonstrate evidence of suicidal ideation at screening will be referred to treatment for depression and will be excluded from the study Must agree not to seek other treatment for smoking cessation during the study.</criteria>
