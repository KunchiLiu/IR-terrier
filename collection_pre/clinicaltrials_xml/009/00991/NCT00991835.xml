	<brief_summary>Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque is responsible for at least two-thirds of acute coronary syndrome. Thus, identification of plaques vulnerable to rupture has become important. The natural history of individual plaques is unknown and needs to be established. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography is a useful noninvasive imaging modality for assessing coronary plaque characteristics. Using MDCT, the researchers prospectively investigate the relationship between the characterization of coronary plaques and cardiovascular events in a large multicenter study.</brief_summary>
