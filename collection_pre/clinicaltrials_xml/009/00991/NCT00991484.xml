	<brief_summary>Analysis of collagen subtype subcutaneously and genetic analysis of patients from families with a tendency to hernias. Furthermore circulating biomarkers and biomarkers extracted from the subcutaneously tissue such as MMP's (matrix metallo proteinases) and TIMP's (tissue inhibitor of metallo proteinases) will be measured.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collagen Analysis and Genetic Analysis of Families With Tendency to Hernias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown relationship between hernias and collagen subtype I/III ratio, biomarkers such as MMP's TIMP's and other diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos, Marfans syndrome, AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysms), diverticulosis and rectal prolapse. Furthermore has research raised hypothesis about inheritance of hernias. The investigators are performing genetic examination combined with analysis of collagen and biomarkers on patients belonging to families with tendency to hernias. Other examinations performed on the patients enrolled in this study: - Ultrasound (US) examination of the abdominal aorta to discover possible abdominal aortic aneurysms. - Beightons score to evaluate the degree of joint hypermobility.</detailed_description>
