	<brief_summary>A multisite trial to testing different dosage levels of a systematic form of Pediatric Constraint-Induced (CI) Therapy called ACQUIREc Therapy. The high dosage treatment involved 6 hours of daily therapy services for 21 days. This was compared to a moderate dosage level of 3 hours of daily therapy services for 21 days. It was hypothesized that children receiving the higher therapy dosage would have greater and more clinically significant benefits from ACQUIREc Therapy but that both groups of children would benefit from the therapy services.</brief_summary>
