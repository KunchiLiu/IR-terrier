	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to collect information on the side effects of proton therapy and detailed information on the proton therapy treatment plan itself so that researchers can develop methods to predict the risk of side effects for future patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Data Collection of Normal Tissue Toxicity for Proton Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of your standard of care, you will be examined by your doctor weekly during your routine proton therapy and then 1-3 more times up to 90 days from the start of treatment and then at least once a year after that. Also as part of your standard of care, certain standard laboratory blood and/or urine test and/or radiologic tests will be done to check if the tumor is under control and to look for any side effect of the treatment. If you agree to take part in this study, all of the information collected during your visits as well as detailed information on the proton treatment plan will be gathered and stored in a computer for future analysis. You will fill out quality-of-life questionnaires that should take about 15-20 minutes to complete. This is an investigational study. Researchers expect to have about 5,000 patients on the study. All the patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. All patients scheduled for radiation treatment with protons at UTMDACC are eligible for this protocol. 2. Patients must be 18 years of age or older (patients under 18 years of age will be eligible for a similar pediatric protocol) 3. Patients must sign a studyspecific consent form prior to study entry. A research nurse/data coordinator will consent the patient at the earliest clinical appointment if currently receiving treatment or when treatment begins. The research nurse/data coordinator has undergone adequate training in the protection of human subjects. 1. Patients who are unable or unwilling to attend the required periodic followups either at M.D.Anderson or at a different site.</criteria>
