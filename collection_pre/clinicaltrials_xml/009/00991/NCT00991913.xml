	<brief_summary>Despite recent advances in postoperative delirium research, the proportion of patients with postoperative delirium is still high ranging between 20-80%. Although postoperative delirium is a frequent complication and is associated with the need for more inpatient hospital care and longer length of hospital stay, little is known about risk factors for recovery room delirium (RRD) occurred in postanaesthesia care unit. The aim of the study was to determine pre- and intraoperative risk factors for the development of RRD among patients undergoing non cardiovascular surgery.</brief_summary>
