	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to further investigate how much of the drug substance "mycophenolate mofetil" can be found in the blood of patients with kidney or renal transplants when treated with Myfenax® or CellCept®. Additionally, the safety and side effects of the two products will be compared. All information already available on these products indicates that the safety profiles of the two products will be the same.</brief_summary>
