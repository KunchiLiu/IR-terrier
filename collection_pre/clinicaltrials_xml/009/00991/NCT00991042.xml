	<brief_title>Study of Cytokines Serum Levels in Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>23 patients with at least three months of back pain due to herniated disk disease were selected Diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) imaging of the spine for all patients. In addition, pain severity had to be Â³ 5 points on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).
