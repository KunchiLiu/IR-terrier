	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to investigate progression of late complications of diabetes during the last ten years in a well characterized cohort of type 1 diabetes with a long duration of the disease, and to define factors responsible for the progression of late complications.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite intensively research in the field of hyperglycaemia and coronary heart disease in type 1 diabetes it is still not known in detail how hyperglycaemia leads to damage of the vessels. The aims of the present proposal are therefore two-fold: 1. To study in detail the progression of atherosclerosis (and micro vascular complications) in a well characterized cohort of type 1 diabetes with a long duration of the disease. This project will be a continuation of the Oslo study, a cohort started in 1982, with the last follow-up study in 1999/2000. 2. To define factors responsible for the progression of coronary heart disease (and micro vascular complications) in this cohort.</detailed_description>
