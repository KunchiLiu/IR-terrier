	<brief_summary>Randomised phase 3 trial comparing 2 arms: an experimental treatment (Isolated pelvis perfusion) and a standard treatment (systemic chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy +/- surgery). Patients included have a non resectable, recurrent gynaecologic or digestive pelvic cancer. The aim of the study is to show a 25% increase in 1 year overall survival rate with isolated pelvic perfusion.</brief_summary>
