	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate whether carotid IMT can predict the presence of more advanced atherosclerosis such as carotid stenosis, coronary or intracranial artery disease by MDCT and whether MDCT could be useful next step for more aggressive treatment modality in Korean type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Intima-media Thickness (IMT) and Large-vessel Atherosclerosis by Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We evaluated mean/maximal carotid IMT in seventy-one type 2 diabetic subjects, and defined increased carotid IMT as maximal IMT ≥ 1.0 mm. Multidetector CT (MDCT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were taken to evaluate carotid artery stenosis (CS), coronary artery disease (CAD), intracranial arterial lesion (ICA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We compared prevalence of large artery stenosis according to carotid IMT group and evaluated whether maximal IMT ≥ 1.0 mm could predict for significant CAD by MDCT. We performed invasive coronary angiography in some patients (N=14) and analyzed association for degrees of CAD between two angiographic methods.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetic patients who had multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited. Patients who had atypical chest pain, EKG abnormality (ischemic STT changes or abnormal Qwave), or history of previous cardiovascular disease were also included. Acute coronary SD, serum Cr&gt;1.4 mg/dL, history of allergy to iodinated contrast dye were excluded.</criteria>
