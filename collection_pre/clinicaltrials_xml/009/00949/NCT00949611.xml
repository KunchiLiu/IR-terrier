	<brief_summary>Emphasis in treating osteoporosis has been on T-scores rather than overall fracture risk. Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) supports a risk sensitive approach to osteoporosis treatment by providing an absolute fracture risk. FRAX combined with a decision aid may promote a shared decision making approach with patients, allowing the clinician and patient to weigh potential fracture risk (without treatment), versus risk reduction with medication (including side effects and costs). OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE II will test the effectiveness of: - FRAX - FRAX + decision aid - Usual care (no decision aid and no FRAX given to clinician)</brief_summary>
