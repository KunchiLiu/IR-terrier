	<brief_summary>Activation of renin-angiotensin plays a crucial role diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin I receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown renoprotection whether it was used alone or in combination. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor (DRI) that has shown renal benefits and safety when combined with ARB. However, to date, the safety of add on aliskiren to the combination treatment of ACEI and ARB in diabetic nephropathy patients remains to elucidate.</brief_summary>
