	<brief_title>Study of Support Groups for African-American Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Characterize five established Los Angeles (LA)-based, peer-led African American Breast Cancer Survivor (AABCS) support groups by identifying and evaluating the successful elements of structure and process that distinguish these groups: the purpose and goals; theories and techniques that are utilized; the structure of the group and implementation of specific goals; the cultural aspects that are incorporated to enhance the efficacy; and similarities and differences among these AABCS support groups. - Develop a preliminary "Culturally Informed Breast Cancer Support Group Guide" on how to organize and maintain support groups, modeled on the "best model" experiences of the five established LA-based support groups for AABCS. - Conduct three needs-assessment focus groups and 5 key informant interviews in the Inland Empire to evaluate the psychosocial needs and resources of AABCS in that region. OUTLINE: At least 10 support group leaders (2 from each support group) undergo semi-structured interviews to elicit information about the needs of breast cancer survivors in their community and the cultural modes of support that are given. Eight to twelve African American Breast Cancer Survivors (AABCS) participate in 5 focus group discussions and complete a questionnaire about their breast cancer and experience with support groups for qualitative and quantitative analysis. At least 5 Inland Empire community leaders undergo semi-structured interviews to elicit information about the needs of breast cancer survivors in their community. Eight to twelve AABCS from the Inland Empire participate in 3 focus group discussions and complete a questionnaire about their breast cancer and experience with support groups for qualitative and quantitative analysis.</detailed_description>
