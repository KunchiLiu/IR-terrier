	<brief_summary>The purpose of this program is to evaluate an effort to provide a comprehensive package of HIV prevention services of which post-exposure prophylaxis (medicines that may help prevent HIV infection after an exposure) can be a part. It will also include risk reduction information and testing for other sexually transmitted infections.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Los Angeles County P-QUAD program is a combined effort of County, City, public health, community, academic, and private agencies and individuals in an effort to provide a comprehensive package of HIV prevention services of which PEP can be an integral component. These services are designed to be easily accessible, non-judgmental, culturally, ethnically, and linguistically appropriate to the relevant populations, community-based, and independent of ability to pay or insurance/documentation status. They will also provide vital linkages to associated services, routine HIV testing, and primary health care. In its initial pilot project, 2 community-based sites will serve as facilities at which patients may present for screening for post-exposure prophylaxis services, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. At the sites, initial eligibility and testing will be performed, and an initial 14-day supply of PEP medications will be provided if appropriate, and referrals will be initiated. All subjects who are provided an initial 14-day supply will be required to return to the site for the remainder of the 28-day course of medication, follow-up testing, adherence counseling, risk-reduction programming, and other appropriate referrals. Follow-up with patients by phone, email, and mobile-phone text message will be used as appropriate to maximize program retention.</detailed_description>
