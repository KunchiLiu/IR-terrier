	<brief_summary>The study is designed to determine the long term, post trial effects of the two interventions studied in ADVANCE (routine blood pressure lowering with perindopril-indapamide as compared with placebo and intensive gliclazide-MR based glucose control as compared to standard guideline based glucose control) in individuals with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. The long term, post randomization effects of the two study interventions will be investigated separately as they were for the main trial. This study will clarify and quantify the long-term, post trial (often referred to as legacy) effects of these two interventions in a broader population of patients with type 2 diabetes from high and low to middle income countries, and in the setting of comprehensive cardiovascular risk factor treatment. With the ADVANCE trial infrastructure and surveillance system already in place, the implementation of extended follow-up will be feasible. The conclusions of this follow up study will have profound clinical implications for the care of patients with type 2 diabetes around the world.</brief_summary>
