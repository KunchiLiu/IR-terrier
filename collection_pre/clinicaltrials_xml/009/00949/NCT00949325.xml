	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify a safe dosing regimen for the combination of Torisel and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent sarcoma. A secondary purpose of the study is to determine how effective this combination is for the treatment of recurrent sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Torisel and Liposomal Doxorubicin for Patients With Recurrent Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of treatments for recurrent sarcomas is quite limited. One hypothesis to explain the refractory nature of recurrent sarcomas is the existence of chemotherapy-resistant sarcoma stem cells.</detailed_description>
