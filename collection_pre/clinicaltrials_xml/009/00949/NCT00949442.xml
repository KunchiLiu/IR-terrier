	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of insulin glargine over insulin NPH (Neutral Protamin Hagedornon) the change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the treatment period. Secondary Objective: To compare between treatment groups: - Plasma glucose (fasting, nocturnal) over time, - Changes from baseline in HbA1c over time, - Percentage of patients who reach the target of HbA1c &lt;7 and &lt;6.5, - Use of prandial insulin as rescue medication at month 6, - Incidence and rate of hypoglycemia (symptomatic diurnal and nocturnal, asymptomatic and severe), - Daily dose of insulin, - Change in body weight from baseline, - Evolution of 8-point plasma-glucose (PG) profiles, - Overall safety, - Patient reported outcomes (treatment satisfaction).</brief_summary>
