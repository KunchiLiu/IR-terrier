	<brief_title>A Study of AGS-1C4D4 Given in Combination With Gemcitabine in Subjects With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A disease assessment will be performed at study week 8 (± 3 days) by the investigator. The assessment will be based both on changes in clinical symptoms, and radiographic images. Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive treatment based on their original treatment assignment until disease progression or intolerability. Disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last dose infusion of AGS-1C4D4 and/or gemcitabine. Post-Treatment: Subjects terminating from protocol therapy for reasons unrelated to documented disease progression will be followed by telephone contact every 2 months until they begin a new anticancer therapy, their disease progresses, they die, become lost to follow-up or withdrawal consent for further follow-up, whichever of these events occurs first. Overall survival: All subjects will be followed by telephone contact every 2 months until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever of these events occurs first.</detailed_description>
