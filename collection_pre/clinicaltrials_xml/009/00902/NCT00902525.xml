	<brief_summary>Despite of the availability of treatment for this disease, this study is justified because no known therapies are really curative and it is necessary to look for new treatment options to improve the clinical outcome and prognosis of relapsed aggressive lymphoma. This study is designed for patients not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cells transplantation.</brief_summary>
