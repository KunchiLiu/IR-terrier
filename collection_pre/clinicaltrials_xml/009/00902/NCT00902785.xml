	<criteria>Sub, extra or juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or macular scar due to AMD in the nonstudy eye. No CNV or geographic atrophy in the study eye. Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye of greater than 20/40 or better than 70 ETDRS letters. Sufficiently clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to permit good quality fundus imaging of the study eye. Subjects of either sex, aged 50 years. Evidence of a signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, laboratory tests, and other trial procedures. Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study: Evidence of manifest CNV by FA, color photography or ICG angiography in the study eye. Any prior treatment for CNV to the study eye (excluding vitamins and AREDS formula). Significant media opacities, including cataract, which might interfere with visual acuity assessments, or fundus imaging in the study eye. Subjects should not be entered if there is likelihood that they will require cataract surgery within the following 2 years. Presence of other causes of choroidal neovascularization in the fellow eye, including pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent of 8 diopters or more negative, or axial length of 25 mm or more), the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, and multifocal choroiditis. Any progressive eye disease other than AMD (eg, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) in the study eye. Presence of subretinal hemorrhage, serous or hemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachments, subretinal fibrosis or pigment epithelial tears or rips in the study eye. Any medical condition that would interfere with the patient's ability to complete the trial. Concurrent enrollment in any other observational or interventional clinical study. Any treatment with an ocular or systemic investigational agent in the past 60 days for any medical condition. Known serious allergies to the dye used in fluorescein angiography or ICG.</criteria>
