	<brief_summary>Very few screenings of any kind will be possible during a woman's lifetime in most low-resource regions, where 80% of the half-million global cases of cervical cancer occur every year. Although a single round of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing was associated with a significant decline in the rate of advanced cervical cancers and associated deaths, whether other methods like as DNA image cytometry can be used as an more accurate means than others in screening cervical cancer or not is yet to be verified. In addition, the accuracy of both DNA image cytometry and conventional cytology is not well known. The investigators hypothesized that DNA image cytometry was superior in screening cervical cancer than conventional cytology.</brief_summary>
