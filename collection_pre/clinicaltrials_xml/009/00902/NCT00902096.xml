	<brief_summary>Background: Increased total serum IgE levels are a common characteristic of atopic diseases. Increased cord blood IgE levels, in conjunction with a family history of atopy, are associated with the development of allergic diseases in children. However, little is known about predictors of cord blood IgE levels. Objective: The aim of our study was to identify predictors of cord blood IgE levels in an ongoing large birth cohort of infants with or without a family history of atopy. Methods: Blood sampling of mothers was performed just before the delivery of newborns. Cord blood was also collected when the child was born. Maternal and cord blood was measured for IgE levels and cytokines. Questionnaires were administered after birth of the infant.</brief_summary>
