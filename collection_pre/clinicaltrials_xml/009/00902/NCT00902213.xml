	<brief_summary>This will be the first multidisciplinary, randomized, longitudinal trial of a tailored, parent- and child-focused physical activity program for children (ages 4- &lt;19 years) with newly diagnosed ALL. It will test the ability of the intervention to prevent or diminish early physical function limitations and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL). The intervention will be tested for its effect on: 1) physical function outcomes (muscle strength, range of motion, endurance, gross motor skills), bone density and bone mineral content (end of therapy only); and 2) HRQL. This multi-site trial will test the intervention in 76 evaluable children with ALL (38 receiving the intervention and 38 receiving a placebo "minimal movement" standard care strategy).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An advanced practice nurse (APN) will meet twice weekly with the patient and family for the first 4 weeks of the intervention to initiate the motivation-based dialogue and therapeutic interaction; this will be followed by once weekly visits during weeks 5-8 of the intervention; and monthly visits during weeks 9-through end of therapy. The physical therapist (PT) will meet at least once weekly with the patient and family during weeks 1-4 to initiate the prescriptive tailored exercise program; subsequent visits to reinforce and modify the program will occur at least once every other week during weeks 5-8, and at least once monthly during weeks 9-135 of the intervention. The PT will visit at least once weekly during weeks 1-4, at least once every other week during weeks 5-8, and at least once monthly during weeks 9-135. During weeks 9-135 of the intervention, the APN will call between the monthly in person-visits, if needed to those randomized to the MAP group to assure fidelity to the intervention and to provide booster support to the intervention where needed.</detailed_description>
