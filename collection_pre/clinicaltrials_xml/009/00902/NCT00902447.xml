	<brief_summary>The Human Blood Cell Disorder Tissue Bank will provide a convenient, comprehensive source of tissue containing populations of human blood cells from patients with various types of lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid proliferative diseases as well as other associated conditions. The tissue bank will continue to be an invaluable asset for understanding of the biology of multiple blood cell disorders involving several cell types as well as the physiology of normal cellular counterparts affected in these disorders. Internal and external investigators will be able to utilize this tissue to test hypotheses relating to the immunologic, virologic, genetic, and molecular properties of these abnormal cells as well as normal cells from normal unaffected family members or normal aged matched subjects to provide better comparisons.</brief_summary>
