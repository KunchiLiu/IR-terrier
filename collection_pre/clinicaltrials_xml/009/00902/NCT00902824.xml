	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of TBC-M4, a MVA HIV Vaccine Alone or in a Prime-Boost Regimen With ADVAX DNA HIV Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two vaccine candidates will be used in two different prime-boost regimens: ADVAX (DNA) + TBC-M4 (MVA) and TBC-M4 (MVA) alone. Both these vaccines have already been tested in humans and both were found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. Approximately 32 volunteers (24 vaccine /8 placebo recipients) will be included in the study.</detailed_description>

Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that is considered progressive or in the opinion of the investigator would make the volunteer unsuitable for the study; Any of the following abnormal laboratory parameters listed below: Haemoglobin &lt;10.0 g/dL Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANL): &lt;1,000/mm3 Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC): &lt;600/mm3 Platelets: &lt;100,000/mm3 Creatinine: &gt;1.3 x ULN AST: &gt;2.5 x ULN ALT: &gt;2.5 x ULN Cardiac Troponin I: &gt; ULN Urinalysis: Abnormal dipstick confirmed by microscopy: blood = 3+ or more (not due to menses) protein = 3+ or more leucocytes = 3+ or more Confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis B (HBsAg), hepatitis C (HCV antibodies), or active syphilis; If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy within 4 months after last vaccination; or lactating; Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within the previous 60 days (live attenuated flu vaccine within 14 days) or planned receipt within 60 days after vaccination with Investigational Product or receipt of other vaccine within the previous 14 days or planned receipt within 14 days after vaccination with Investigational Product; Receipt of blood transfusion or blood products within the previous 6 months. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently, within the previous 3 months or expected participation during this study; Receipt of another investigational HIV vaccine in the last 6 years (note: receipt of an HIV vaccine placebo will not exclude a subject from participation if documentation is available to the study site and the IAVI Medical Monitor gives approval); History of severe local or systemic reactogenicity to vaccines or history of severe allergic reactions; Major psychiatric illness including any history of schizophrenia or severe psychosis, bipolar disorder requiring therapy, suicidal attempt or ideation in the previous 3 years; Smallpox vaccination within the previous 3 years; ECG with clinically significant findings or features that would interfere with the assessment of myopericarditis, including but not limited to: Conduction disturbance (atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction, left or right bundle branch block, AV block of any degree, or QTc prolongation) Repolarization (ST segment or T wave) abnormality Significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmia Frequent atrial or ventricular arrhythmia Frequent atrial or ventricular ectopy (e.g., frequent premature atrial contractions, two premature ventricular contractions in a row) ST elevation consistent with ischemia Evidence of past or evolving myocardial infarction (heart attack). History of, or known active cardiac disease, including but not limited to: Previous myocardial infarction Angina pectoris Congestive heart failure Valvular heart disease, including mitral valve prolapse Cardiomyopathy Pericarditis Stroke or transient ischemic attack Chest pain or shortness of breath with activity (such as walking up stairs) Other heart conditions under the care of a doctor.
