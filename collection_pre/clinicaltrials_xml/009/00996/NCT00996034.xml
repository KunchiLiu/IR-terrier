	<brief_summary>This is a molecular imaging research study designed to examine how much nicotine gets into the brain before and after vaccination with NicVAX, a nicotine vaccine developed by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals. NicVAX (Nicotine Conjugate Vaccine) is an investigational vaccine designed as an aid to smoking cessation and long-term abstinence, as well as an aid to prevent relapses of a treated smoker. In this project we want to understand the degree to which NicVAX administration changes how much nicotine enters the brain in smokers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Vaccination and Nicotinic Receptor Occupancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to examine the occupancy of brain β2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β2-nAChR) by nicotine both at baseline and following administration of a nicotine vaccine. The number of brain β2-nAChR and the amount of nicotine occupancy both before and after vaccination will be measured using the nicotinic agonist [123I]5-IA-85380 ([123I]5-IA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). [123I]5-IA will be administered using the bolus plus constant infusion paradigm to smokers abstinent for 4-9 days (time period necessary for nicotine and pharmacological active metabolites to clear from brain). Three baseline SPECT images will be obtained after equilibrium has been reached (~6 hours into the [123I]5-IA infusion). Then, IV nicotine will be administered (0.5-1.5 mg/70 kg will be infused over 10 minutes). Following a series of 4 nicotine vaccine shots, the same procedure will be repeated for a second [123I]5-IA scan day. We hypothesize that occupancy of β2-nAChR will be significantly lower, and take longer to plateau, following nicotine vaccine administration.</detailed_description>
