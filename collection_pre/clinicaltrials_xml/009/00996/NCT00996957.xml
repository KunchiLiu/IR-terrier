	<brief_summary>For cancer cells to grow, they need to have nutrients supplied to them through blood vessels. The study drug, ACE-041, is designed to work by blocking the growth of those blood vessels and preventing cancer cells from growing. The purpose of this study is to establish safe dose levels of ACE-041 in patients with advanced solid tumors or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma following multiple dose administration. This study will also evaluate if ACE-041 has an effect on tumors.</brief_summary>
