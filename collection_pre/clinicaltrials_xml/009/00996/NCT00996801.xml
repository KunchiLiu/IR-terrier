	<brief_summary>This study seeks to demonstrate that additional gain in bone mineral density (BMD) can be achieved by switching to MK-5442 from an oral bisphosphonate in participants who have been receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy for at least 3 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MK-5442 in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Previously Treated With an Oral Bisphosphonate (MK-5442-012)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was originally planned for a duration of 2 years and included efficacy analysis of a 15 mg MK-5442 treatment arm. Amendment 1 of the protocol eliminated the 2nd year of the study as well the 15-mg arm. Enrollment into the 15-mg MK-5442 arm was stopped as a result of the amendment and all participants who had been randomly assigned to the MK-5442 15-mg treatment arm were discontinued from the study.</detailed_description>
