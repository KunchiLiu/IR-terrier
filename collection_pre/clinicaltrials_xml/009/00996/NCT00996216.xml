	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when used to increase and maintain platelet count. Platelet count to be maintained at a level sufficient to facilitate initiation of antiviral therapy, to minimize antiviral therapy dose reductions, and to avoid permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy.</brief_summary>

Except for localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma treated by local excision or malignancies that were adequately treated and, in the opinion of the oncologist, have an excellent chance of cancerfree survival. Pregnant or nursing women Men with a female partner who is pregnant History of alcohol/drug abuse or dependence within six months of the study start unless participating in a controlled rehabilitation programme. Treatment with an investigational drug or interferon within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) of the screening visit History or platelet clumping that prevents reliable measurement of platelet counts Evidence of portal vein thrombosis within three months of baseline visit</criteria>
