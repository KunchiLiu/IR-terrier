	<brief_summary>Sixteen healthy subjects will be randomized to each of the 3 parallel treatment groups. Eligible subjects will check in to the clinical unit on Day -2 and have 24-hr pharmacokinetic collections on Day -1 and on Day 1. Once the pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulations have been analyzed, doses of GSK2212836 will be selected for further study in Part B. Subjects from Part A will participate in Part B. Part B is a single blind, randomized, placebo controlled study that will consist of a 2-week repeat dose period with 3 dose levels and one dose of the marketed formulation of GSK2212836. Subjects will check in to the clinical unit on Day -3; will participate in a test meal on Day -2 and have 24-hr baseline pharmacokinetic profiles on Day -1 and Day 1. Subjects will be released from the clinic on Day 2, and return for daily dosing on Days 3 through 12. On Day 6, they will also have a brief outpatient visit. Subjects will check into the clinic again on the evening of Day 12, and on Day 13 they will again have 24-hr pharmacokinetic profiles collected. Subjects will be released from the clinical research unit on Day 14, following a test meal, triglyceride sampling and check-out assessments, and will be released from the study 5-10 days later after completing a follow up visit.</brief_summary>

A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for HIV antibody. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Use of omega3 fatty acid supplements and/or fish or fish oil products from screening until final assessment and unwilling to abstain from eating oily fish (salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, sardines, etc.) during the course of the study. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. History of sensitivity or known allergy to fish and /or shellfish. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.
