	<brief_title>Risk Stratification and Benefits With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is two-fold. First, to determine if an algorithm can be developed based on pre-implant clinical variables to predict response to CRT-D therapy. Second, the study aims to determine in patients implanted with CRT-D if the combined use of cTnT and BNP can further predict and risk-stratify HF improvement and all-cause mortality. Additionally, novel biochemical markers defining cardiac mortality in high risk patients detected by plasma proteomic analysis in the CRT-D patients will be evaluated. This study represents a combination of previous CRT studies that evaluated these variables independently. Data from this study will be pooled with data from previous studies to build a more complete picture of CRT therapy.</detailed_description>
