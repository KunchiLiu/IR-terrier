	<brief_summary>1. Primary Objective: The primary endpoint to this study will be to document the toxicities, and reversibility of toxicities, of this regimen of hydralazine and valproic acid in patients with advanced, unresectable, previously treated lung cancers, for whom no acceptable standard therapy is available. A primary endpoint will be to determine any potential dose limiting toxicities, and the Maximal Tolerated Dose of this regimen. 2. Secondary Objectives: The secondary endpoint of this study will be to determine any potential anti-tumor effects, as determined by the objective tumor response (complete and partial responses), clinical benefit (complete and partial responses, and clinical benefit), the time to tumor response, the time to tumor progression, and the overall survival.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. All patients with lung cancer who have disease which has been previously treated and/or for which there is no acceptable standard treatment regimen available, and cannot be treated definitively with either surgery or radiotherapy. 2. All will be appropriate candidates for treatment, and are not candidates for treatment with protocols of higher priority. 3. All patients should have an ECOG/Zubrod/SWOG performance status of less than 2 at the time of the initiation of therapy 4. Adequate endorgan function 5. No severe comorbid disease 6. Ability to provide informed consent. 7. Signed Informed Consent 8. ECOG/Zubrod/SWOG Performance Status less than 2 9. Life expectancy greater than 8 weeks 10. Male or female' age greater than 18 years 11. Patients of childbearing potential must be using an effective means of contraception. 12. Histologic diagnosis of lung cancer that is advanced and cannot be treated adequately by radiotherapy or surgery; or metastatic disease, and for which there is no standard chemotherapeutic option remaining or available 13. All participants must have either previously received or refused standard chemotherapy 14. Baseline laboratory values (bone marrow, renal, hepatic): Adequate bone marrow function: 1. Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/µL 2. Platelet count greater than 100'000/µL Renal function: a. Serum creatinine less than 2.0 mg % Hepatic function: 1. Bilirubin less than 1.5x normal 2. Serum calcium less than 12 mg/dl Exclusion Criteria 1. Pregnant or lactating females 2. Myocardial infarction or ischemia within the 6 months before Cycle 0' Day 0 3. Uncontrolled' clinically significant dysrhythmia 4. Prior radiotherapy to an indicator lesion unless there is objective evidence of tumor growth in that lesion 5. Prior autoimmune disease 6. Uncontrolled metastatic disease of the central nervous system 7. Radiotherapy within the 2 weeks before Cycle 1' Day 14 8. Surgery within the 2 weeks before Cycle 1' Day 14 9. Any co morbid condition that' in the view of the attending physician' renders the patient at high risk from treatment complications</criteria>
