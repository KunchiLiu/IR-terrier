	<brief_title>Ultraviolet Light Exposure and Immunosuppression in Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well established that ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure is related to the development of melanoma. There is also evidence that immune reactions are altered after UV exposure in the skin (locally) and perhaps throughout the body (systemically). Additionally, while the role of vitamin D and melanoma development has not been fully established, UV-B exposure is essential for vitamin D production in the skin. Increased sun exposure is also related to the presence of solar elastosis, which might protect (1) or improve survival from melanoma. Thus, melanoma represents a unique model for studying UV exposure, the immune system, and vitamin D. Malignant melanoma is an antigenic cancer; therefore, the role of UV exposure-induced immunosuppression and vitamin D production in the recognition, destruction and growth inhibition of cancerous melanocytes is worth further study. To underscore the importance of this project, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Melanoma Research Foundation and the Steering Committee of the Society of Melanoma Research have indicated a need to collect more human data on the host immune response mechanisms in melanoma and also to focus on the skin as a whole microenvironment, moving away from only in vitro experiments.</detailed_description>
