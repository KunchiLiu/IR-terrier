	<detailed_description>The age-related degradation of cognitive functions even to the point of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer`s disease are a growing public-health concern with devastating effects. Referring to animal data, empirical studies, and pilot human trials, a healthy diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids and low in calories should improve cognitive functions such as learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general brain functions in healthy elderly subjects (50-80 years old) during a short term diet.</detailed_description>
