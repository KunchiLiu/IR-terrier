	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, partial-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, cross-over trial investigating the effect of GSK1349572 on cardiac repolarization as compared to placebo in healthy adult males and females. Approximately 42 subjects will be enrolled in this study and will be admitted to the clinic for three separate dosing sessions. Subjects will receive single dose administrations of placebo, a supratherapeutic dose of GSK1349572 (250 mg), and moxifloxacin (400 mg) in random sequence. Safety of subjects will be monitored by clinical observation, measures of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and clinical laboratory measurements.</brief_summary>
