	<brief_summary>Multicenter, open phase 2 study on patients with malignant mesothelioma. Standardly, 4 to 6 cycles of palliative chemotherapy, platinum in combination with pemetrexed, are given. Despite of this treatment, median survival is poor (9-12 months). By combining conventional cytotoxic agents with a novel agent, hopefully treatment and survival can be approved. Cetuximab or Erbitux is a monoclonal antibody against the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). By blocking the receptor, it interferes with cel growth and division. Most mesothelioma show a strong expression of the EGFR protein. Apart from that, Cetuximab also has antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In this trial, patients will be treated with standard chemotherapy, combined with Cetuximab weekly. After a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, administration of Cetuximab will be continued until disease progression. Every 6 weeks, a CT scan will be done to evaluate therapy. Most common side effect of Cetuximab is acneiform rash. The translation research program consists of the determination of EGFR- and K-Ras mutations on the tumor tissue and the correlation with outcome. In the first part of the trial, 18 patients will be included. After a positive interim analysis, a total of 43 patients will be included.</brief_summary>
