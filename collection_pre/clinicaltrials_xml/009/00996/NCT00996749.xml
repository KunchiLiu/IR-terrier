	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct a pilot study of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (omega-3 fatty acid) supplementation in a group of patients with advanced prostate cancer to assess the dose of omega-3 PUFA necessary to achieve an omega-6 to -3 ratio of 1:1 on an individual basis and to assess the clinical impact of omega-3 supplementation on disease progression OUTLINE: Patients receive long-term omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation orally (PO). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
