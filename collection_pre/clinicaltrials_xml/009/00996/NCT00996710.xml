	<brief_summary>This study will look for new types of gene changes that may be related to cancer in some patients. Some gene changes (mutations) are passed on from parents to offspring (child). Other gene changes are new and are seen for the first time in a child. They are not seen in the parent. Some of these gene changes may cause cancers in the offspring. We will look for gene changes by studying patients with cancer their parents and family members without cancer. In this study, we will be able to find gene changes that occur in the cancer patient but not in the rest of the family. Knowing the role that new gene changes play in cancer risk may help us find people at a higher risk of getting cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Proband must have living unaffected biologic mother and father available and eligible for participation in the study with one of the following (both incident and prevalent cases will be collected): Colorectal cancer diagnosed at or under the age of 50. Breast cancer diagnosed at or under the age of 45. Germ cell tumor diagnosed at or under the age of 40. Pediatric cancer of any type diagnosed at or under the age of 21 Adult cancer or preneoplastic condition of any type diagnosed at or under the age of 40 Cancer at any age in 2 or more siblings suggestive of a genetic etiology, such as brothers with testicular germ cell tumor or sisters with breast cancer and ovarian cancer Parents: Must be the biologic mother and biologic father of affected proband. Must have (by selfreport) no history of cancer other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ except in the case of inclusion criteria #6.. In certain clinical situations, parent(s) with cancer may be included at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, if the Principal Investigator deems that the etiology of cancer in the parent(s) and proband are biologically unrelated. Sibling(s): Must be age 18 or older and have same biologic parents as proband. Known genetic mutation in proband or a family history that is indicative of hereditary cancer susceptibility.</criteria>
