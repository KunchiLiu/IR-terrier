	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effectiveness, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of TMC435 in Combination With Peginterferon Alfa-2a and Ribavirin in Hepatitis-C Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, randomized (The study medication is assigned by chance.), 5-arm, open label (All people know the identity of the intervention.), multicentre (study conducted at multiple sites) study. Approximately, 84 participants will be randomized to 5 different arms in a 2:2:1:1:1 ratio. In treatment arms 1 and 2, participants will receive 12 weeks of triple therapy (use of 3 medications) with TMC435 50 or 100 mg once daily plus Peginterferon Alfa-2a and Ribavirin followed by 12 weeks of treatment with Peginterferon Alfa-2a and Ribavirin. In treatment arms 3 and 4, participants will receive 24 weeks of triple therapy with TMC435 50 or 100 mg once daily plus Peginterferon Alfa-2a and Ribavirin. In treatment arm 5 (control group), participants will receive Peginterferon Alfa-2a and Ribavirin for 48 weeks. This study will consist a screening phase of upto 6 weeks, treatment phase of upto 48 weeks and a post treatment follow-up period of 24 weeks. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and cardiovascular safety.</detailed_description>
