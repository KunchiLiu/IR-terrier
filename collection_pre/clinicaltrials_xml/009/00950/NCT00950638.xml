	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Macular Degeneration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Dry AMD (drusen and/or geographic atrophy) in both eyes Any intraocular surgery or thermal laser within three (3) months of trial entry. Any prior thermal laser in the macular region, regardless of indication. Any ocular or periocular infection (including blepharitis), or ocular surface inflammation in the past twelve (12) weeks. History of any of the following procedures: Posterior vitrectomy, filtering surgery (e.g. trabeculectomy), glaucoma drainage device, corneal transplant or retinal detachment. Any of the following underlying diseases including: Diabetic retinopathy History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV ), history or clinical evidence of unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or revascularization within last 6 months, ventricular tachyarrythmias requiring ongoing treatment. History or evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, such as intermittent claudication or prior amputation. Clinically significant impaired renal (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or status post renal transplant or receiving dialysis) or hepatic function. Subjects with results outside these ranges may be enrolled in consultation with Ophthotech. Stroke (within 12 months of trial entry). Any major surgical procedure within one month of trial entry. Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the past 60 days for any condition. Women who are pregnant or nursing.
