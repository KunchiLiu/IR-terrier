	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in healthy male or female subjects using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose design. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled; 3 healthy subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 (2 active, 1 placebo) and 8 healthy subjects in Cohorts 3 to 5 (6 active, 2 placebo). The following CPSI-2364 doses are proposed: 1 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg, and 270 mg.Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and include physical examinations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), routine clinical laboratory tests (including blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), and adverse event (AE) assessments. Vital sign assessments and 12-lead ECGs will be performed repeatedly over the 24-hour observation period. Venous blood samples will be taken at specified intervals and tested for the presence of CPSI-2364.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Ascending Dose Study of Oral CPSI-2364 (Semapimod)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in healthy male or female subjects using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose design. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled; 3 healthy subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 (2 active, 1 placebo) and 8 healthy subjects in Cohorts 3 to 5 (6 active, 2 placebo). The following CPSI-2364 doses are proposed: 1 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg, and 270 mg. In Cohort 1 (1 mg) and Cohort 2 (10 mg), the three subjects will all be dosed on the same day, with at least 60 minute intervals between dosing. In Cohorts 3 to 5, the first two subjects of each cohort (one active, one placebo) will receive their drug on the same day with at least a 60-minute interval between dosing, with the remainder of the cohort being dosed the next day once these subjects have been assessed. Safety labs, physical examination findings, and adverse events available up to and including Day 5 data of each cohort will be reviewed by the Investigator, the Study Manager, and the Sponsor (or designee) in order to determine the progression of dose escalation. Subjects will not be enrolled in the next higher cohort until the dose in the preceding cohort is deemed safe and tolerable. Doses will continue to be escalated in subsequent groups until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, or until a top dose of 270 mg is reached, whichever is sooner. Intermediate and repeat dose levels may be administered in addition to or in place of the planned dose levels, if it is deemed appropriate to increase the safety or scientific value of this Phase 1 exploratory study.Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and include physical examinations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), routine clinical laboratory tests (including blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), and adverse event (AE) assessments. Vital sign assessments and 12-lead ECGs will be performed repeatedly over the 24-hour observation period.Venous blood samples will be taken at specified intervals and tested for the presence of CPSI-2364.</detailed_description>

(Minor excursions from the normal range may be allowed if the clinical picture is otherwise normal and they are considered clinically insignificant by the Investigator and Sponsor [or designee]) ; any subject considering or scheduled to undergo any surgical procedure during the duration of the study; have an acute illness within 7 days prior to study agent administration or have had a hospitalization within 1 month prior to study agent administration; any subject who has received any known hepatic or renal clearance altering agents (eg, erythromycin, cimetidine, barbiturates, phenothiazines, or herbal/plantderived preparations such as St. John's Wort, etc.) for a period of 90 days prior to the first dose of study medication; has a positive serology test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis A, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody at screening; has a positive urine drug screen for ethanol or substances of abuse including cocaine, cannabinoids, phencyclidine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, propoxyphene, and methadone at screening and checkin(s); subject has donated plasma or blood within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication or has a history of blood donation of more than 500 mL within 3 months prior to dosing; use of any prescription medications/products, except hormonal contraceptives, within 14 days prior to study entry, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator; use of any overthecounter (OTC) or nonprescription preparation (including minerals and phytotherapeutic/herbal/plantderived preparations), within 14 days prior to dose administration, with the exception of ibuprofen and acetaminophen used at recommended doses.
