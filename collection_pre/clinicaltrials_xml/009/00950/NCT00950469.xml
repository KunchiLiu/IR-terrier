	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the early diagnostic value of the new high sensitive cardiac troponin T assay (TnThs) in suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to compare it with the 4th generation cTnT assay from the same manufacturer, myoglobin and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (h-FABP). METHODS: The study consisted of 94 patients with chest pain admitted to the chest pain unit with the diagnosis of suspected ACS without ST-Elevation. Patients were divided according to time from onset of symptoms to presentation into an early presenter group (&lt;4 hours) and a late presenter group (â‰¥4 hours). A median of 6 samples (range 2-8) were available per patient. The diagnostic performance of TnThs was assessed using ROC analysis and areas under the curve (AUC) of baseline and follow-up results of TnThs, cTnT, myoglobin, and h-FABP were compared using c-statistics. RESULTS: The TnThs assay allows an excellent prediction of non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI) at presentation.A follow-up sample improves diagnostic performance in a time dependent manner. The AUC of the TnThs was superior to cTnT at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: A baseline sample of TnThs allows an earlier prediction of non-STEMI than the less sensitive and precise 4th generation cTnT assay. The excellent performance of TnThs at baseline and follow-up might obviate the need for other early necrosis markers.</brief_summary>
