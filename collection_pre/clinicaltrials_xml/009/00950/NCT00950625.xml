	<brief_summary>Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with less pain than contemporary open procedures; it is definitely not pain free and the magnitude of postoperative shoulder and abdominal pain in the early postoperative period is still quite significant. This postoperative pain is a major concern not only for the patients, but also healthcare workers; and it often contributes to overnight hospital stay after this minimally invasive surgical procedure. Intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetics at the time of surgery to control pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been extensively studied in numerous randomized trials and found to be extremely useful. Lignocaine and Bupivacaine are two commonly used local anesthetic agents. In view of contradictory results from previous studies, it is not yet clear which of these two agents is superior to the other for pain control in this setting. To answer this question, we have designed a prospective randomized controlled trial and the specific aim of the study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of intraperitoneal lignocaine with intraperitoneal Bupivacaine in the postoperative setting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If we can improve pain control after this minimally invasive procedure, it might result in decreased postoperative requirement of narcotic analgesia and its associated side-effects. It may also result in early recovery and the same day discharge of the patients with significant cost-containment for the patient and healthcare systems in future.</brief_summary>
