	<brief_summary>Abstract Background: Effects of orthopedic immobilizations of the lower right limb on driving performances are unknown. Therefore, clinicians and legislators cannot put forth recommendations for road safety for patients requiring such immobilizations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different orthopedic immobilizations on braking performances in simulated driving conditions. Methods: The braking performances of 48 healthy volunteers were evaluated under 3 conditions: wearing their running shoes, and 2 types of orthopedic immobilizations of the lower right limb, a walking cast and an Aircast walker. A computerized driving simulator was used to measure the maximum force applied on the brake pedal during braking, the braking reaction time and the total braking time during emergency braking with and without a distracter.</brief_summary>
