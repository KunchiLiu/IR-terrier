	<criteria>Healthy females between 55 to 80 years of age Postmenopausal females (based on medical history) defined as 12 continuous months of spontaneous amenorrhea Women 60 years of age and older will be considered postmenopausal Women 5559 must have a serum folliclestimulating hormone result ≥ 40mIU/mL and serum estradiol ≤ 20 pg/mL Low bone mineral density [BMD, Tscore between 1.0 and 2.5 at the lumbar spine (L1L4) and/or femoral neck] Weight ≤ 98 kg (216 lb) and/or height ≤ 196 cm (77 in) 25hydroxyvitamin D ≥ 20 ng/mL at screening Willing and able to take ≥ 500 mg calcium and ≥ 400 IU (but ≤ 1,000 IU) vitamin D daily Osteoporosis, defined as a BMD Tscore ≤ 2.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck History of vertebral fracture, or fragility fracture of the wrist, humerus, hip or pelvis Diagnosed with any condition that will affect bone metabolism Subjects with fewer than 2 evaluable vertebrae; metal in forearms bilaterally that would not allow for at least one evaluable forearm Administration of the following medications within 6 months before study drug administration. This includes all routes of administration, for example intranasal and topical skin patches, unless otherwise noted: Hormone replacement therapy [(eg, estrogen, estrogenlike compounds such as raloxifene). Infrequent use of estrogen vaginal creams (&lt; 3 times per week) is allowed.] Calcitonin Parathyroid hormone (or any derivative) Glucocorticosteroids (inhaled or topical corticosteroids administered more than 2 weeks before the enrollment date are allowed) Anabolic steroids Calcitriol, and available analogues Administration of daily, weekly, or monthly bisphosphonates (BP) unless meeting the following criteria: &lt; 2 weeks of BP use requires a 2month washout period 2 weeks to 3 months of BP use requires a 9month washout period 3 to 6 months of BP use requires a 1year washout period &gt; 6 months of BP use requires a 3year washout period; Greatly differing levels of physical activity or constant levels of intense physical exercise during the 6 months before study drug administration Known sensitivity to mammalianderived drug preparations Known to be hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus or Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive or a known diagnosis of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Any organic or psychiatric disorder, which, in the opinion of the investigator, poses a risk to subject safety and may prevent the subject from completing the study or interfere with the interpretation of the study results Unavailable for followup assessment or any concerns for subject's compliance with the protocol procedures Any other condition that might reduce the chance of obtaining data required by the protocol or that might compromise the ability to give truly informed consent History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Amgen physician would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion Clinically significant abnormality during the screening physical examination, ECG or laboratory evaluation Participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks of screening or within 5 times the halflife of the investigational agent in the other clinical study, if known Has donated or lost 400 mL or more of blood or plasma within 8 weeks of study drug administration Previous AMG 785 exposure</criteria>
