	<brief_summary>In this open-label multicenter trial, participants with operable or locally advanced breast cancer will be randomized to pre-operative treatment with 8 cycles of chemotherapy (4 cycles of docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) concurrent with either SC Herceptin or IV Herceptin. After surgery, participants will receive a further 10 cycles of SC or IV Herceptin as per randomization to complete 1 year of treatment. All cycles will be 21 days in length. After the end of study treatment, participants will be followed for safety and efficacy for up to 5 years or until disease recurrence, whichever is earlier.</brief_summary>
