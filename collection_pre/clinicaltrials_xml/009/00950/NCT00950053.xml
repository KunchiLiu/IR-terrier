	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Achilles tendon debridement and decompression augmented with flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer results in improved clinical and functional outcome as measured by ankle plantar flexion strength and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score compared to debridement and decompression alone in patients over 50 years of age with chronic insertional Achilles tendinosis. H0: There will be no difference in ankle plantar flexion strength measured using a handheld dynamometer between patients randomized to achilles tendon decompression and debridement alone (Group 1) and patients randomized to achilles tendon decompression and debridement augmented with FHL transfer (Group 2). HA: Patients randomized to achilles tendon decompression and debridement alone (Group 1) will have less ankle plantar flexion strength compared to patients randomized to achilles tendon decompression and debridement augmented with FHL transfer (Group 2).</brief_summary>
