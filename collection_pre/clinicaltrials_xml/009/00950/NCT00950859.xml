	<brief_summary>Integrase is an enzyme produced by HIV so that the virus can multiply in the human body. GSK1349572 is a new drug in the integrase inhibitor class that prevents the enzyme from working properly and therefore prevents the virus from multiplying. GSK1349572 has shown to be effective against viruses in a short-term monotherapy study in adults with no previous exposure to integrase inhibitors. The purpose of this study is to determine whether GSK1349572 is effective in the treatment of HIV-infected patients who no longer respond to treatment with the approved integrase inhibitor raltegravir and carry viruses with resistance to this drug. The safety and efficacy of GSK1349572 50mg once daily in combination with the background HIV drugs previously administered (unless discontinuation of a particular drug is required) will be assessed over 10 days (functional monotherapy phase), followed by the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of GSK1349572 given with a new optimised background regimen from Day 11 through at least Week 24.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assessing the Integrase Inhibitor GSK1349572 in HIV-infected Persons With Virus Resistant to Raltegravir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study (ING112961) is a Phase IIb, multicentre, open-label, single arm, two cohorts, pilot study to assess the antiviral activity of GSK1349572 containing regimen in HIV-1 infected ART-experienced adults with raltegravir (RAL) resistance. The study will include approximately 50 ART-experienced subjects with either current or past virologic failure to RAL. All subjects must harbour isolates with RAL resistance mutations at Screening. Subjects should also have documented genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to at least one compound from each of three or more of the approved classes of ART (including integrase inhibitors [INIs]). Subjects with current RAL virologic failure will substitute RAL with GSK1349572 50mg once daily and continue the remaining components of their failing regimen through Day 10. Subjects with historical RAL virologic failure will add GSK1349572 50mg once daily to their failing regimen through Day 10. On Day 11 all subjects will continue GSK1349572 and optimize their background therapy. Antiviral activity, safety and tolerability of GSK1349572 will be evaluated at Day 11 and over time through at least Week 24. ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.</detailed_description>
