	<brief_summary>In this study will be randomised before induction treatment either to receive two courses of melphalan 200 mg/m2 (MEL200) or two courses of melphalan 100 mg/m2 (MEL100). Informed consent will be obtained upon enrolment. Inclusion criteria included: diagnosis of untreated Durie e Salmon stage IIA-IIIB measurable multiple myeloma; age &lt; 65 years. Exclusion criteria included: prior treatment for myeloma; abnormal cardiac function, defined as systolic ejection fraction &lt;50%; abnormal pulmonary spirometry test; serum bilirubins &gt; 2.5 times normal and ALAT and/or ASAT &gt; 2 times normal; seropositivity for HIV, HCV or HBV, active non-hematologic malignancies. Induction therapy, PBSC mobilization, and autografting Initial treatment plan included induction chemotherapy with 2 courses of vincristine, 1 mg/m2 on day 1, adriamycin, 50 mg/m2 on day 1, and dexamethasone, 40mg/day days 1-4, administered 28 days apart, followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilisation and harvest after 1 or 2 cycles of cyclophosphamide, 4 g/m2, and G-CSF, 10 ug/kg given i.v. or subcutaneously. After at least one month from PBSC collection, autografting consisted of melphalan, 200 mg/m2 or melphalan, 100 mg/m2, on day -2, and cryopreserved PBSC infusion on day 0. Patients received G-CSF, 5 ug/kg, from days +3 until neutrophil count &gt; 1000/ul were achieved. Supportive care and toxicity grading Following autografting, all patients received standard prophylaxis against bacterial and fungal infections; herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus reactivation; and Pneumocystis carinii. Cytomegalovirus CMV reactivation was monitored through levels of CMV antigenemia and/or serum CMV DNA levels and treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet as clinically indicated. Standard criteria (Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0) were used for grading hematological and non-hematological toxicity.</brief_summary>
