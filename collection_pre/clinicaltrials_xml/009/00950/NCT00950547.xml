	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: Autotransfusion devices may be employed in cardiac surgery to decrease allogenic blood requirements. Limitations of previous trials include the use of cell saver systems in selected high risk patients only or the lack of blood transfusion-sparing strategies. The aim of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of cell salvage CardioPAT routinely used in cardiac surgery. METHODS: The investigators will randomize 350 patients in two groups: group 1 receives a CardioPAT cell saver device (175 patients), group 2 doesn't receive any cell saver device. The incidence of allogenic blood transfusion and clinical outcome in both groups are evaluated.</brief_summary>
