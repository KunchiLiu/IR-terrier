	<brief_title>Assessment of Response Rates and Yields for Two Tools for Early Detection of Non-diabetic Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The University Hospitals of Leicester and The University of Leicester have developed a self-assessment risk score and a practice data risk score that can be used in a variety of setting to detect undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose regulation. This is done to establish a simple and effective 1st stage screen to identify those people at risk of diabetes and engage the public to increase the number of high risk individuals attending screening invitations but reducing the overall number of oral glucose tolerance tests. This study aims to test in a pragmatic way the use of such tools in a primary care setting administered by primary care staff as part of the NHS Health Check programme.</detailed_description>
