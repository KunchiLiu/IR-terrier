	<brief_summary>Immune therapies, such as a IL-2, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are designed to mobilize immune effector cells that recognize and destroy cancer. The investigators have recently observed a 50% objective response rate (16% CR) in mRCC patients treated with autologous tumor lysate -dendritic cell (DC)-vaccine, IL-2 and interferon alfa (IFN). New agents inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways have demonstrated significant benefit in mRCC patients as well, but rarely induce CRs. High blood VEGF is associated with poor response to IL-2 and can cause tumor specific immune dysregulation. To test whether complementary mechanisms of immune activation and disruption of regulatory pathways enhance outcome the investigators plan to treat 24 mRCC patients in a phase II trial using bevacizumab, DC vaccine, IL-2, and IFN. Observations from this project will be used in the development of novel cancer therapies which, if successful, will decrease the burden of cancer on the public. The investigators propose to determine 1) the objective clinical response rate to treatment and progression free survival, 2) the clinical and autoimmune related toxicity profile of therapy, and 3) the treatment related tumor-specific immune response and the relationship of tumor-specific immune response and objective clinical response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab, Autologous Tumor/DC Vaccine, IL-2 and IFNα-2b in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patients will receive a total of five treatment weeks, each consisting of approximately 5 days. Prior to therapy, patients will undergo apheresis for DC preparation. DC-Tumor vaccines will be frozen in 90% pooled human AB serum/ 10% DMSO to be used for treatment Patients will be dosed with bevacizumab (10mg/kg, Genentech) intravenously every two weeks beginning four weeks prior to the first vaccine. Each treatment week includes ultrasound guided intranodal DC-vaccine injection (1 X 107 cells/1mL), followed by 5 days of continuous intravenous infusion of IL-2 (18 MiU/m2, Novartis), and three subcutaneous injections of IFNa-2b (6 MiU, Schering -Plough Corp.) (every other day). The first two treatment weeks, the induction phase, will be separated by a 9 day rest. Three additional treatment weeks, the maintenance phase, will be separated by 23 rest days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma with measurable disease. 2. Adequate tumor tissue properly stored and available to produce lysate for a minimum of three vaccine preparations. 3. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from their last therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy, radiation, surgery or chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosureas) and recovered from all ill effects. 4. Have measurable disease. 5. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from major surgery, 1 week from minor surgery, and recovered from all ill effects. 6. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥80%. 7. Adequate end organ function: 8. Women should not be lactating and, if of childbearing age, have a negative pregnancy test within two weeks of entry to the study. 9. Appropriate contraception in both genders. 10. The patient must be competent and have signed informed consent. 11. Patients may have received one prior therapy with targeted therapies (e.g. sorafenib and sunitinib). 1. Patients who have previously received bevacizumab or IL2 are not eligible. 2.

In patients with a prior history of invasive malignancy, less than five years in complete remission. 4. Positive serology for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C which should be confirmed with antigenemia. 5. Significant comorbid illness such as uncontrolled diabetes or active infection that would preclude treatment on this regimen. 6. Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppression (if patient had been taking steroids, at least 2 weeks must have passed since the last dose). Inhaled steroids &gt; 1000mcg beclomethasone per day or its equivalent. 7. History of inflammatory bowel disease or other serious autoimmune disease. (Not including thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis). 8. Patients with organ allografts. 9. Uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;150/100 mmHg). 10. Proteinuria dipstick &gt; 3+ or &gt; 2gm/24 hours, or a urine protein:creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 at screening. 11. Major surgery, open biopsy, significant traumatic injury within 28 days of starting treatment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. 12. Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to starting treatment. Central venous catheter placements are permitted. 13. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intrabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to starting treatment. 14. Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. 15. History of tumorrelated or other serious hemorrhage, bleeding diathesis, or underlying coagulopathy. 16. History of deep venous thrombosis, or other thrombotic event within the past six months or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease. 17. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures.</criteria>
