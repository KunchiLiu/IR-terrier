	<brief_summary>Aim of this NIS is to obtain further information on efficacy, tolerability, and acceptance of Wellnara in a large user population under the conditions of routine medical practice. Furthermore, any adverse drug reactions will be recorded in a large user population under the conditions of medical routine. To investigate the efficacy of Wellnara, patients will fill in a questionnaire, the so-called Menopause Rating Scale (MRS II). Further, the effects of treatment on skin and hair will be evaluated by the investigator. Patients will assess treatment effects on their sexual life. Safety parameters include monitoring of vaginal bleeding, measurement of blood pressure and body weight, and - as far as routinely used in the practice - calculation of waist-hip-ratio. Any relevant additional information related to adverse drug reactions will also be documented.</brief_summary>
