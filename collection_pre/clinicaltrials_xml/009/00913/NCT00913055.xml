	<brief_title>Open Label Study of Octreotide Implant in Patients With Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group, Phase I/II study conducted in 30 male and female patients with acromegaly. Eligible patients received 1 implant, either hydrated or non-hydrated, within 7 days of their Screening Visit. The octreotide implant was inserted subcutaneously in the inner aspect of their non-dominant arm under local anesthesia. Blood samples for the determination of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), growth hormone (GH), and octreotide serum concentrations were collected at predetermined timepoints within the first 6 weeks after implantation.</detailed_description>
