	<brief_summary>Leukotriene receptor antagonists appear to posses additive anti-inflammatory effects to the effect of inhaled corticosteroids. Hypothesis: Treatment with oral montelukast will lower the dose-response plateau to inhaled methacholine in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma treated with a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
