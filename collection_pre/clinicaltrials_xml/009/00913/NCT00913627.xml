	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a single dose of an ibuprofen 600 mg extended release formulation in post-operative dental pain. There is concern that the manufacturing process may affect the performance characteristics of the selected prototype. Therefore, two formulations of this prototype manufactured by two different processes, [roller compaction] and [wet granulation] will be included in this study. The preferred prototype manufactured by two different methods will be compared to placebo and each other. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship with these formulations.</brief_summary>
