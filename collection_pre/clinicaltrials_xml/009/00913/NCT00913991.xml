	<brief_summary>Systolic Hypertension is a disorder which is characterized by significant elevations in systolic blood pressure in association with normal diastolic blood pressure. Typically, this develops in individuals &gt;50 years of age and is associated with an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. While there are many effective therapies for essential/diastolic hypertension, the treatment of systolic hypertension is complicated by side effects from traditional therapies. This limits therapeutic options and has resulted in a number of at-risk individuals being left untreated. We are conducting a randomized, controlled trial (n=90) to compare the effects of two different stress management training on blood pressure. The primary outcome is change in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Secondary outcomes are changes in nitric oxide, stress hormones and psychological well-being. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess for other confounding effects on BP and PP.</brief_summary>
