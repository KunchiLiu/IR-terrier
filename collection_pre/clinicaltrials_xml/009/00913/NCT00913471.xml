	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to compare plasma protein profiles for SCI patients with/without chronic neuropathic pain in order identify biomarker(s) that are associated with this medical condition. Secondly, the investigators propose to identify a temporal relationship to initial SCI at which these biomarkers manifest. Our working hypothesis is that sustained alterations in specific inflammatory molecules are associated with chronic neuropathic pain following SCI, and that their plasma levels can serve as biomarkers to identify patients at risk for the development of neuropathic pain. Additionally the investigators are collecting skin tissue biopsy samples from patients following acute and chronic spinal cord injury to create vector-free human iPS cells from fibroblasts by direct delivery of reprogramming proteins.</brief_summary>
