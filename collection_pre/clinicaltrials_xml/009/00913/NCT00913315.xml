	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Tamsulosin and Tolterodine Treatment for Chronic Prostatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in urological clinics. Most of the clinically CP/CPPS are to some extent associated with storage (irritative) symptoms, such as increased frequency, urgency, and nocturia, namely many patients with CP/CPPS have overactive bladder symptoms. Alpha-blocker therapy has been advocated as a treatment modality for CP/CPPS. Some trials showed a statistically and likely clinically significant treatment effect, while other trials showed no benefit. Therefore, tamsulosin combination with tolterodine treatment for CP/CPPS may be more effective than tamsulosin single.</detailed_description>
