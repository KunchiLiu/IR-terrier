	<brief_summary>Niacin, or vitamin B3, is known to improve cholesterol disorders and is the most effective drug to raise HDL, or the "good cholesterol". The use of niacin has been limited because of a peculiar adverse effect referred to as "flushing', which consists of redness, warmth, tingling and burning. A recent animal study suggests that flavonoids may prevent flushing due to niacin better than drugs like aspirin. The ANTI-FLUSH study is being done to assess whether a presently available dietary supplement known as quercetin, which is a flavonoid, can reduce the flushing that occurs with niacin. We will also assess whether using quercetin to prevent flushing from niacin, can improve how niacin lowers cholesterol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involves people between 21 and 75 years. It will be conducted over a period of 8 weeks, with 4 visits, each separated by 2 weeks. The duration of each visit is 9-10 hours. We will test a different dose of quercetin in each visit.</detailed_description>
