	<brief_summary>To determine whether impedance cardiography (ICG) parameters can predict favorable or unfavorable blood pressure (BP) response and time to BP control prior to initiation or intensification of specific antihypertensive drug classes and drug combinations, independent of initial BP levels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patients with higher vascular resistance index and/or lower arterial compliance index will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving vasodilating agents - such as ACEI's, ARB's, dihydropyridine CCB's, direct vasodilators, and central alpha agonists. - Patients with an elevated cardiac index will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving agents that reduce contractility, heart rate, or blood volume - such as beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCB's, and other agents that are known to reduce cardiac index. - Patients with an elevated thoracic fluid content or lower orthostatic change in thoracic fluid content will lower BP faster and to a greater degree overall when receiving diuretics (thiazide, loop, potassium sparing), however - one of these agents will emerge as a superior alternative to reduce BP in patients with high thoracic fluid content / low orthostatic change in thoracic fluid content.</detailed_description>
