	<brief_summary>Subjects will participate in this study because they are undergoing scheduled abdominal surgery. The usual standard care participants receive in the operating room include maintaining normal temperature during planned surgical procedure. The anesthesiologist and staff will use warm blankets, warm air and warmed intravenous fluids (fluid given into the patient's IV). This study will evaluate the timing of applying warming devices and evaluating whether there is a difference between the timing and the patient's post operative recovery. Maintaining normothermia in this group of patients will lead to a decreased 30 day morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Impact of Perioperative Warming on Maintenance of Normothermia and Outcome After Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized into two groups. The first group will have the warming devices started in the pre operative area. Subjects will receive warm blankets and a full body warm air blanket called the Bair Paws. This device is non experimental and is FDA approved and used within the hospital to keep patients warm. They will then have an intravenous catheter (IV is a small plastic flexible hollow tubing) placed by the pre operative care staff. Then they will receive warmed IV solution (salt water).They will then have their temperature taken and documented by the staff at various prescribed times. The second group will receive the warming devices and warmed IV fluids after they are in the operating room. Intraoperative period: The participants temperature will be monitored and documented at prescribed times. Postoperative period: The participants will have temperature monitored in the post anesthesia care area. Your part in this study will last until you are admitted to your room after surgery.</detailed_description>
