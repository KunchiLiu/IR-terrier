	<brief_title>Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis: Low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) Versus Standard-dose CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute appendicitis is a very common disease with the lifetime incidence of 7%. Abdomen CT is an established first-line diagnostic test in patients suspected of having acute appendicitis. Since many individuals suspected of having acute appendicitis are young, with a mean age of 30 years, CT radiation is of particular concern. The estimated lifetime attributable risk of death from cancer due to the radiation exposure of a single abdomen CT study is 2-7/10,000 for average adults ranging 20-40 years in age. The purpose of this study is to determine whether low-dose CT is not inferior to standard-dose CT in the negative appendectomy rate.</detailed_description>
