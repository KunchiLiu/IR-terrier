	<brief_summary>The aims of this prospective, randomized study are: - To assess the effect of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) - To investigate if MS patients will have symptom reduction (urgency, frequency, nocturia and incontinence) when using CIC in combination with anticholinergic drugs - To identify at what volume of Postvoid Residual (PVR) urine, starting CIC improves bladder control and QoL - To increase the evidence of CIC, and support clinical guidelines of bladder management in MS patients</brief_summary>
