	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer have a better outcome when treated with IMC-3G3 in combination with Liposomal Doxorubicin then when treated with Liposomal Doxorubicin alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin With or Without IMC-3G3 in Platinum-refractory or Resistant Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer when treated with the monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in combination with liposomal doxorubicin versus liposomal doxorubicin alone.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma, fallopian tube cancer, or ovarian clear cell carcinoma The patient must have at least one of the following: a platinumfree interval of ≤ 12 months after the final dose of primary or subsequent platinumbased therapy (platinumresistant), progression during primary or subsequent Platinumbased therapy (platinumrefractory), or persistent radiographic disease after primary or subsequent platinumbased therapy (platinumrefractory) The patient has a prestudy echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan with an actual left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, within 21 days prior to randomization The patient has at least one unidimensionally measurable target lesion (≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques, or ≥ 10 mm by spiral computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.0 (RECIST v 1.0) guidelines. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy The patient has recovered to Grade ≤ 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (NCICTCAE v3.0) from the effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other targeted therapies for ovarian cancer, with the exception of alopecia or peripheral neuropathy (which must have resolved to Grade ≤ 2). The exceptions for such effects are allowed lab values of ≤ Grade 2 specified elsewhere in these inclusion criteria The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤ 1 at study entry The patient has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent The patient has adequate hematological functions (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1200 cells/μL, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/μL) The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 × the ULN (or ≤ 5 × the ULN in the presence of known liver metastases) The patient has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × the institutional ULN. If creatinine is above the ULN, the patient's creatinine clearance is ≥ 60 mL/min The patient has urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is ≥ 2+, a 24hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg of protein to allow participation The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above ULN. Patients on anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of anticoagulant with a therapeutic INR and no active bleeding within 14 days prior to randomization, or on low molecular weight heparin AND have no pathological condition carrying a high risk of bleeding. Mild elevations of PTT of up to 1.5 × the ULN are acceptable, provided that, in the opinion of the investigator, they are related to ongoing use of coumarins (eg, warfarin) The patient has a prestudy echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan with an actual left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, within 21 days prior to randomization women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to randomization and for the duration of study participation The patient has brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease The patient received more than one biologic and/or more than one hormonal therapy, administered either concomitantly with platinumbased therapy or separately The patient has a history of treatment with other agents targeting PDGF or PDGFR The patient has an increased level of CA125 in the absence of concomitant clinical or radiographic progression The patient has received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy directed at the malignant tumor within 3 weeks prior to randomization, or hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor within 1 week prior to randomization. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted The patient has a suspected impending bowel obstruction (including partial obstruction), based on clinical or radiographic data The patient has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biologic composition similar to that of IMC3G3 The patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements The patient has a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: a) curatively resected nonmelanomatous skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma insitu; or c) other primary solid tumor treated with curative intent and no known active disease present and no treatment administered during the last 3 years prior to randomization The patient is pregnant or lactating The patient has ongoing side effects ≥ Grade 2 due to agents administered more than 28 days prior to randomization. The exceptions for such effects are allowed lab values and toxicities of ≤ Grade 2, specified in the inclusion criteria The patient has unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac stenting, or myocardial infarction 6 months prior to randomization The patient has participated in clinical trials of experimental agents within 28 days prior to randomization The patient has a history of uncontrolled hereditary or acquired bleeding or thrombotic disorders The patient has a serious or nonhealing active wound, ulcer, or bone fracture The patient has known human immunodeficiency virus positivity The patient had a major surgical procedure, an open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomization The patient has received an anthracycline for any indication in the past</criteria>
