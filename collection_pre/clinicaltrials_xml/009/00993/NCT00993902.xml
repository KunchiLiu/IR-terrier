	<brief_title>Double and Single Intrauterine Insemination In Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COH) Cycles With Multifollicular Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metaanalysis for the effects of double IUI demonstrates that effects of this procedure is not different from single IUI. It is known that nearly 25% of coh cycles is evident by monofollicular development.For this reason it is possible that this monofollicular cycles in the studies could decrease the effects of double IUI. Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with unexplained infertility or mild male factor infertility whom admitted to the COH+IUI programme in our infertility unit. 2. Female age &lt;37 years old. 3. Baseline FSH &lt;12 mIU/L 4. Total antral follicle count&gt;6 5. During the first three cycles of COH+IUI 6. Minimum 2 follicles &gt;16 mm at the day of HCG. Primary outcome: Ongoing pregnancy rates Secondary outcomes: The effects of different coh regimens (CC,FSH,CC+FSH)on the outcomes.</detailed_description>
