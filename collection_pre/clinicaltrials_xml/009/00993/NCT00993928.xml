	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Following a program that uses written materials and pre-recorded mp3 devices may help improve the sleep of cancer survivors. It is not yet known which home-based program is more effective in improving the sleep of cancer survivors. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is comparing two home-based programs for improving sleep in cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home-Based Programs for Improving Sleep in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the efficacy of two home-based sleep interventions as therapy for sleep-wake disturbances,as measured by sleep latency or time to fall back asleep after initial sleep onset per sleep diaries, at baseline (week 1) and at the end of week 7 in cancer survivors. Secondary - To compare the efficacy of these interventions as therapy for sleep-wake disturbances as measured by the number of awakenings after sleep, sleep quality, sleep difficulty, and sleep latency at baseline (week 1) and weeks 4 and 7 in these participants. - To compare the efficacy of these interventions as therapy for sleep-wake disturbances as measured by the percentage of participants in each group who show improved sleep per the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. - To compare the effects of these interventions on fatigue, mood disturbance, sleep, benefit, and distress in this patient population. - To describe the side effects associated with these interventions in these patients. - To describe patient practice habits and adherence measured via a sleep behavior record. - To explore symptom clusters in this patient population and look at distress as a mediating variable. (Exploratory) - To explore predictors of sleep quality. (Exploratory) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to current (≥ 1 per week in the past 4 weeks) pharmacological treatment, including anxiolytics, for insomnia or mood (yes vs no), current pharmacologic treatment for pain (yes vs no), sleep difficulty period (≤ 1 month vs &gt; 1 month), and age (≤ 50 vs 51-70 vs &gt; 70 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups. - Group 1: Participants receive a home-based sleep intervention comprising a Sleep Hygiene Education booklet, printed stimulus-control guidelines, instructions on sleeping restrictions, and a guided-imagery pre-recorded mp3 device. Participants meet with study personnel for intervention refinement and are asked to practice behaviors consistent with the stimulus-control sheet, to read the sleep hygiene booklet one chapter per day for 7 days during the first week, and then as needed during study. They are also instructed to use the CD, with or without headphones, in a quiet and comfortable place without lights for up to 30 minutes every day for 6 weeks before bedtime. Participants are instructed to go to sleep and wake at the same time every day during study intervention. - Group 2: Participants receive a home-based sleep intervention comprising a Sleep Hygiene Education booklet, printed stimulus-control guidelines, and a pre-recorded mp3 device containing short stories and essays. Participants meet with study personnel and are instructed to practice behaviors consistent with the stimulus control sheet, to read the sleep hygiene booklet, and use the CD as in group 1. Participants are not instructed about sleeping restrictions. They are offered the guided-imagery CD after study completion. Patients complete a Three-Day Sleep Behavior Record for 3 consecutive days at baseline and during weeks 4 and 7 of study intervention. Patients also complete questionnaires on Numeric Analog Sleep for Pain Scale, daily use of CD, Sleep Hygiene Practice, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Profile of Mood States, Brief Fatigue Inventory, Distress Thermometer, Side-Effect Questionnaire, and a Subject Global Impression of Change at baseline, during weeks 2 and 6, and after completion of study intervention.</detailed_description>
