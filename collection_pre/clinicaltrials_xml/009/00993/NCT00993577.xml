	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy of global postural reeducation (GPR) with static stretching exercises (SS) in the treatment of women with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Physical therapy is of importance in the treatment of myogenic temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Both stretching exercise and global posture reeducation are equally effective in the treatment of TMD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose: To compare the efficacy of global postural reeducation (GPR) with static stretching exercises (SS) in the treatment of women with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Methods: A total of 24 subjects with TMD were randomized into two treatment groups: GPR, where therapy involved muscle global chain stretching, or SS, with conventional static stretching. Eight treatment sessions lasting 40 minutes each (weekly) were performed. Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment end, and again two months later. Measurements included pain intensity at the temporomandibular joint, headache, cervicalgia (visual analogue scale - VAS) and teeth clenching. Additionally, electromyographic activity and pain thresholds were measured at the masseter, anterior temporalis, sternocleidomastoid, and upper trapezius muscles. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc test was used for in-between group comparisons. Significance level was 0.05.</detailed_description>
