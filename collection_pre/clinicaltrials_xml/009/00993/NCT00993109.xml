	<brief_summary>This will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel design, two arm comparator trial. In the proposed study, the investigators will compare low-dose combination therapy of Nifedipine GITS/OROS plus Valsartan with up-titrated monotherapy of Valsartan with respect to their blood pressure-decreasing effects in patients with essential hypertension.The study consists of a screening visit, followed by randomization and administration of either Nifedipine GITS/OROS 30 mg in combination with Valsartan 80 mg or Valsartan 160 mg for 12 weeks of treatment.The primary efficacy parameters will be mean SBP and DBP on office BP monitoring at 12 weeks of treatment compared to baseline.</brief_summary>

Patients on prior treatment with monotherapy diuretic, ACEI or beta blocker or an ARB other than valsartan and switched to the current low dose valsartan 80 mg monotherapy for at least 4 weeks are also eligible, provided the hypertension is still not well controlled.

BMI &lt;33 kg/m2 Participation in any clinical investigational drug study within the previous 12 weeks Concomitant treatments with: 1. Any antihypertensive treatment other than Valsartan 80 mg 2. Cytochrome P4503A4 inhibitors or inducers 3. Potassiumsparing diuretics Severe hypertension (DBP &gt;/= 110 mm Hg and/or SBP &gt;/= 180 mm Hg) and/or evidence of secondary forms of hypertension Any of the following cardiovascular diseases: History of cardiovascular shock Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 6 months Severe cardiac valve disease Past or present severe rhythm or conduction disorder. Cerebrovascular ischemic event and/or history of intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) within the previous 12 months Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus Proteinuria Uncorrected hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, sodium depletion and/or hypovolemia Gastrointestinal disease resulting in the potential for malabsorption and/or severe gastrointestinal tract narrowing; kock pouch (ileostomy after proctocolectomy) Cholestasis or biliary obstruction Liver disease or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels &gt;3 x upper limits of normal (ULN) Renal failure, creatinine level &gt;2.0 mg/dl</criteria>
