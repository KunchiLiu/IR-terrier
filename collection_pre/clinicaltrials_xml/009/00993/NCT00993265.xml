	<brief_summary>Trichotillomania (hair pulling) has an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1-3%. Children with trichotillomania can experience significant impairment due to peer teasing, avoidance of activities (such as swimming and socializing), difficulty concentrating on school work and medical complications due to pulling behaviors. Despite the fact that trichotillomania has a childhood onset, no randomized, controlled trials have been completed in childhood trichotillomania. Research in adults with trichotillomania has demonstrated that most commonly currently prescribed treatment for trichotillomania, (pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) is ineffective in treating this condition. By contrast, randomized controlled trials in adults have suggested the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as well as behavioral treatments such as Habit Reversal Therapy. The goal of this trial is to determine the efficacy of N-Acetylcysteine for pediatric trichotillomania. N-Acetylcysteine is a glutamate modulating agent, with a fairly benign side-effect profile.</brief_summary>
