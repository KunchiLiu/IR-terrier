	<brief_summary>The primary aims are to test whether an asthma care management system (M-CHESS) delivered via a smartphone (cellular phone with internet access) can support low income teenagers (ages 12-18) with significant asthma and can improve asthma control and reduce asthma-related emergency or urgent care visits and hospitalizations. Secondary aims include whether M-CHESS increases adherence to asthma control medication and reduces absenteeism from school, work or an event they wanted to attend.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Four hundred Milwaukee Medicaid recipients (ages 12-18), with an asthma-related emergency care visit or hospitalization in the last twelve months, will be recruited through their managed care organization (MCO). They will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms and will participate in a 12-month intervention plus a 12-month follow-up period. Subjects in the control group will receive a smartphone with internet access &amp; text messaging service. These devices will provide the ability to collect smartphone use data electronically. The experimental group will also receive the same smartphone devices (with internet access and text messaging service and ability to collect usedata. In addition the experimental group will have access to the Mobile CHESS (M-CHESS) interface. The M-CHESS smartphone interface features an interactive, internet based asthma education program, peer support mechanisms and automated reminders for asthma control medicines and data collection.</detailed_description>
