	<brief_summary>This trial is a randomised controlled trial with a parallel design taking place in centres across the UK, Scandinavia and Brazil. 650 infants with a diagnosis of isolated cleft palate who are considered medically fit for operation at 6 months, and who meet the inclusion criteria, will be included in the trial and randomised to receive either: - Surgery at age 6 months, OR - Surgery at age 12 months. The main objective is to determine whether surgery for cleft palate, using a specified technique, at age 6 months, when compared to surgery using the same technique age 12 months, improves speech development. All infants will be followed up at age 12 months, 3 years and five years for the assessment of the primary outcomes(age 5) and secondary outcomes.</brief_summary>
