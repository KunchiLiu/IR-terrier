	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BIBW 2992 therapy when given continuously in combination with Sirolimus. The MTD will be based on the Dose Limiting Toxicity information collected during the first two cycles. Overall safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour efficacy will be evaluated as secondary objectives.</brief_summary>
