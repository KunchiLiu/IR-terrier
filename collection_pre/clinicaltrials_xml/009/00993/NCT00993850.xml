	<criteria>Bipolar disorder patients with sleep disturbance 1. Meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Text Revision (DSMIVTR; APA, 2000) diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder type 1 (established with the SCID: Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV). 2. Being interepisode throughout the experiment as defined by cutoffs widely used in previous research. On the basis that a drugfree group would likely be unfeasible and unrepresentative, participants will not be excluded on the basis of medications prescribed for bipolar disorder. Comorbidity will be allowed as long as bipolar disorder is the primary diagnosis. However, it is necessary to assess comorbidity for reporting purposes. 3. Participants who have a history of bipolar 1 or suicidal ideation must be under the care of a psychiatrist. 4. Experience distress related to significant sleep disturbance. 1. Presence of an active and progressive physical illness (e.g., congestive heart failure, cancer, COPD) or neurological degenerative diseases (e.g., dementia, multiple sclerosis) directly related to the onset and course of insomnia; 2. Alcohol or drug abuse (except nicotine) within the past year 3. Active posttraumatic stress disorder 4. Evidence of sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements during sleep, or a circadianbased sleep disorder (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) 5. Patients who pose a current suicidal risk or homicidal risk (assessed by treating psychiatrist) or who have made a suicide attempt within the past 6 months. 6. Pharmacotherapy for sleep defined as the benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics that operate via the GABA A receptor complex and are FDA approved for the treatment of insomnia, selective melatonin agonists, benzodiazepine anxiolytics and over the counter medications with proven efficacy such as melatonin or herbs such as St. Johns wort. 7. Use of certain medications known to alter sleep (e.g., steroids, theophylline, propranolol, antihistamines that cause drowsiness).</criteria>
