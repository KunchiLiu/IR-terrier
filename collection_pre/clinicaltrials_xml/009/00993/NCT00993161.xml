	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate different devices to quantify upper limb function (Motriplate) and strength (Myogrip, Myopinch) in non-ambulatory patients with neuromuscular disorder. Motriplate measures the ability of the patient to reproduce a repetitive movement of the wrist to push two 5cm*5cm targets during 30 seconds. One hundred patients aged 8-30 years and 60 controls will be evaluated during twelve months (M0, M6 and M12) with theses new tools, and results will be compared to other testing, such as wrist, grip and pinch strength, taping, MFM measurement, and self evaluation of hand ability.</brief_summary>
