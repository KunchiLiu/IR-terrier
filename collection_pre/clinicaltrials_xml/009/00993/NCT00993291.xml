	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will evaluate the effect of both low and high frequency Deep Brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's patients who have noted a change in their walking. The investigators' hypothesis is: 1. Stimulation at 60 Hertz (Hz) is associated with improved gait with increased stride length and faster time on the Stand walk sit test. 2. There is no worsening of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) at 60 Hz.</brief_summary>
