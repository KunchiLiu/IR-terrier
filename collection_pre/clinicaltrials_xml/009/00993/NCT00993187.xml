	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effect of sitagliptin/metformin FDC 50/1000 mg (JanumetÂ®), MK-0431A) compared with the effect of glimepiride on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The primary hypothesis is that after 30 weeks, sitagliptin/metformin FDC 50/1000 mg provides superior reduction in HbA1c (mean change from baseline) compared to glimepiride.</brief_summary>
