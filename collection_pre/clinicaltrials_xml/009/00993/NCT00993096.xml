	<brief_summary>This trial was conducted in Europe. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic dose-response relationship of NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) at three therapeutically relevant doses in subjects with type 1 diabetes. The trial is designed as a four period, incomplete block cross-over trial where the trial participant will be randomised to a treatment sequence by which the subject will receive two matched dose levels of NN5401 and biphasic insulin aspart, respectively.</brief_summary>
