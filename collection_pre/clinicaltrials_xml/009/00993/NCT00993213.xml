	<brief_summary>Liposuction surgery is common, yet animal and limited human data suggest that fat returns when removed. This study was designed as a 1-year randomized-controlled trial of suction lipectomy versus no intervention to determine if adipose tissue is defended, and if so to determine the anatomic pattern of redistribution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Defending Fat Mass in Humans After Lipectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: 1. To determine if suction lipectomy fails to modify regional and/or total body fat over three years. 2. To determine if the expression of candidate genes predicts and/or relates to subcutaneous adipose tissue growth or depletion in subcutaneous adipose tissue after suction lipectomy. 3. To examine adipose tissue before and after suction lipectomy to uncover novel genes where expression predicts and/or relates to subcutaneous adipose tissue growth or depletion after subcutaneous suction lipectomy.</detailed_description>
