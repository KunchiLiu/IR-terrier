	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Rift Valley Fever Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives: The objectives of this two-part, primary immunization and booster dose, study are to continue to collect safety data on Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine, Inactivated (TSI-GSD 200); and, to continue to collect immunogenicity data on Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine, Inactivated (TSI-GSD 200) and analyze interim data to determine whether a 6-month dose is indicated; and, to provide potential protection for personnel at risk for occupational exposure to the RVF virus and collect data on incidence of occupational RVF infection (subclinical and clinical) in immunized personnel.</detailed_description>
