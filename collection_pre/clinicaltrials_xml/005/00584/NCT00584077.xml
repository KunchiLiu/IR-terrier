	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the presence of cough reflex in the transplanted lung of patients who have had either a single or double lung transplant or heart-lung transplant at University of Texas Medical Branch. At the 1 year post transplant bronchoscopy, the presence of the cough reflex will be assessed by placing 3 to 5 ml of 5% dextrose and placement of the bronchial biopsy forceps on teh airway mucosa. Three to four separate areas of the transplanted airways will be assessed. The cough reflex will be assessed by recording the surface electrical activity by placing external electrodes to monitor the movement of abdominal muscles during a cough. The data will be recorded and compared with recordings from coughs recorded using the surface electrical activity of a cough generated by non-transplant patients.</brief_summary>
