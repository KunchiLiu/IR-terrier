	<brief_title>An Open Label Pharmacokinetic Study Of Gabapentin In Japanese Subjects With Renal Impairment Including Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was terminated on September 30, 2008 at the current study site due to reported adverse events in the study subjects (n=8). While the adverse events reported were generally consistent with the known profile of gabapentin, it was decided that the study should continue at a different study site. The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in the subjects with renal impairment will be evaluated in a separate study with a different study number at a different site. The study will be entitled: "The Pharmacokinetic Study of Gabapentin in Japanese Epileptic Subjects with Renal Impairment".</detailed_description>
