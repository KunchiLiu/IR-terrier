	<detailed_description>The concept of open reduction and internal fixation of large and complex traumatic orbital deformities is well established. It is known that successful orbital reconstruction hinges upon restoration of native orbital volume in order to establish pre-morbid function and avoid long-term complications. To date, a facile, reliable, and reproducible method to measure orbital volume has not been rendered, despite numerous approaches. The objective of this study is to assess the performance and clinical predictive value of a novel software program designed to perform complex volumetric analysis with application in the field of orbital trauma.</detailed_description>
