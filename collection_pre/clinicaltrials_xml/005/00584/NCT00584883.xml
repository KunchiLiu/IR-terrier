	<brief_title>A Phase I Study of ABT 510 for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. 2. To determine the duration of disease free survival and overall survival associated with this therapy. 3. Evaluate thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) and 2 (TSP-2) in tumor vs. corresponding normal tissue using quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-RT-PCR). 4. Determine the effect of ABT 510 on tumor permeability and tumor blood volume as measured by non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must be 19 years of age or older. 2. Patients must have histologically proven newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. 3. Patients must have fully recovered from the immediate postoperative period and be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for 5 days prior to entry. 4. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60% (i.e. the patient must be able to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others). 5. Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3, Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine 1.5 mg/dl . 6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. 7. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. The effect of the investigational drugs on the developing human fetus is not known, but these drugs are likely to be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (either surgical sterilization; approved hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills DepoProvera, or Lupron Depot; barrier methods such as condom or diaphragm along with spermicide; or an Intrauterine device (IUD)). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician and study PI immediately. 8. The patient is able to selfadminister or has a caregiver who can reliably administer subcutaneous injections. 9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Pregnant or breast feeding. 2. Prior therapy for the brain tumor (except surgery) 3. Prior treatment with antineoplastic agents. 4. Exclude sexually active males and females unwilling to practice contraception during the study. 5. Serious concurrent infections. 6. Clinically significant cardiac disease not well controlled with medication (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias ) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months. 7. Patients who have had prior cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy. 8. Patients with other serious uncontrolled comorbid diseases that the investigator feels may comprise the study findings. 9. Patients must be able to learn to self administer or have another person administer subcutaneous(SQ) injections. 10. Patients who have received any other investigational agents within the 28 days prior to Day 1 of the study.</criteria>
