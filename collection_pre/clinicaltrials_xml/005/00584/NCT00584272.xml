	<brief_title>Retrospective Study on the Outcome of Cleft Palate Repair: Comparing US Surgical and Ethicon Suture Materials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to show what the effects of changing suture material were on the healing and outcome of cleft palate surgery. The study will be considered successful if we find that either there is an effect on the healing after surgery, one of the suture materials seems to promote better healing and final outcome, or that there is no difference between the suture materials.</detailed_description>
