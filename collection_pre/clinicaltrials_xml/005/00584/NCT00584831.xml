	<brief_summary>The relative performance of a new toric soft contact lens against toric contact lenses currently available in market, specifically for visual acuity and lens orientation. The study will be conducted in a staged approach (2 stages).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. They are aged between 1839 years. 2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing to sign a Statement of Informed Consent. 3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol. 4. They can attain at least 6/9 in each eye with their spectacle refraction. 5. They have successfully worn contact lenses within six months of starting the study. 6. They can be fitted with toric soft contact lenses to match the available power range. 1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear. 2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear. 3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment. 4. They are aphakic. 5. They have had corneal refractive surgery. 6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or have keratoconus. 7. They are pregnant or lactating. 8. They have grade 2 or greater of any of the following ocular surface signs: corneal oedema, corneal vascularisation, corneal staining, tarsal conjunctival changes or any other abnormality which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear. 9. They have taken part in any other clinical trial or research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.</criteria>
