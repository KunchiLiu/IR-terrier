	<brief_title>Using Dexamethasone After Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was designed because patients have a lot of pain after they have a UPPP. Certain drugs called steroids may lessen the pain associated from this surgery. This study uses Dexamethasone (a corticosteroid), to see if it will help reduce pain, decrease the amount of time until the patient can begin to eat or return to normal activity, or increase their satisfaction with pain management. In this study the patients will be randomized (computer chosen) to receive either the study drug (dexamethasone), or a placebo. The patient will start the day before surgery with a single pill. They will then receive the dexamethasone or a placebo twice daily for the next four days and then once daily for the next two days for a total of seven days. Afterward, they will be asked to complete a questionnaire. The five questions ask patients to access the amount of pain they have, how much of their normal diet or activity they have returned to, and how much pain medication they have taken. At the next follow-up visit they will be asked to complete another questionaire (9 questions) about the patient's satisfaction with pain management.</detailed_description>
