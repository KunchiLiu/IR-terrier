Dyskinesias at least moderately disabling (historical information from item 33 of UPDRS). 5. Stable dose of antiparkinsonian medication 4 weeks prior to study entry. 6. Women of childbearing potential must use a reliable method of contraception and must be willing to perform a pregnancy test paid for and provided by Dr. Zesiewicz and the USF Medical Clinic.

Pregnancy will not be allowed whether as a preexisting condition or a positive result on the pregnancy test in the screening process. Lactation includes any woman wanting to participate who is currently breastfeeding. 3. Patients may not be dual enrolled to another research study requiring the patient to sign informed consent. 4. Dementia or other psychiatric illness that prevents the patient from giving informed consent (Mini Mental Status Exam score of less than 20). 5. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity. 6. Presence of severe renal disease (BUN 50% greater than normal). Patients must have evidence from their PCP or Urologists of normal PSA and urodynamic tests within the last 12 months; patients with BUN 50% greater than normal (5 to 20 mg/ d L) or creatinine 50% greater than normal (0 .7 and 1.4 mg/ d L) will be excluded. Labs will be requested from PCP. 7. Concomitant or prior therapy with the following treatments: neuroleptics, metoclopramide, domperidone (in doses &gt;60mg/day), azole antifungals (e.g. ketoonazole), etomidate, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, fludrocortizone, encainide, flecainide, mexiletine, propafenone, guanoxane, maprotiline, antidepressants on doses higher than the maximum approved daily dose for outpatients, intermittent therapy with oral corticoids. 8.
