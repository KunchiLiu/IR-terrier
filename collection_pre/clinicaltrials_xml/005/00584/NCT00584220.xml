	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the relative performance of a new toric soft contact lens against a toric contact lens currently available in market, specifically with regards to the comfort and vision after two weeks of use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Two Toric Soft Contact Lenses After Two Weeks of Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dispensing, single-masked (subject-masked), randomized, 2-visit controlled study of two-weeks duration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prior to being considered eligible to participate in this study, subjects MUST 1. be at least 18 and less than or equal to 39 years of age and have a need for vision correction in BOTH eyes (monovision or uniocular fitting is NOT allowed). 2. be of Asian descent (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Polynesian or other Asian ancestry) and have Asian Eye anatomy. 3. have successfully worn toric or spherical soft (hydrogel or silicone hydrogel) contact lenses for at least 4weeks prior to enrollment in the study. 4. be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in the protocol. 5. agree to wear their contact lenses in both eyes on a daily wear schedule for at least 8 hours per day every day during the study. 6. have a distance spherical component between 1.00 D and 5.50 D with cylinder in the range of 0.75 D to 2.25 D and cylinder axis within 10 ° of the vertical and within 20 ° of the horizontal in both eyes 7. have a best corrected manifest refraction visual acuity of at least 20/25 or better in each eye. 8. be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge. 9. read, be given an explanation of, indicate understanding of, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT. 1. The subject is a rigid gas permeable (RGP) or daily disposable soft lens wearer. 2. The presence of clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities; inflammations such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated structures. 3. The presence of ocular or systemic disease or need for medication which might interfere with contact lens wear or which would cause the lenses to be removed more than twice a day. (i.e., Sjögren's syndrome, type II diabetes, etc). 4. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as: Pathological dry eye or associated findings Pterygium or corneal scars within the visual axis Neovascularization &gt;1mm in from the limbus History of giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) worse than Grade 2 Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present) Seborrhoeic eczema, seborrhoeic conjunctivitis 5. A history of recurrent erosions, corneal infiltrates, corneal ulcer or fungal infections. 6. A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity.) 7. Aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea. 8. Current pregnancy or lactation (to the best of the subject's knowledge). 9. Active participation in another clinical study at any time during this study.</criteria>
