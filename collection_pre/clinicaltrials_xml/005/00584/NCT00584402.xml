	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Definity (perflutren lipid microsphere Injectable Suspension) ultrasound contrast agent in identifying small tumors (hepatomas &amp; metastases) within the liver. Primary objective: To estimate the increase in conspicuity of small intrahepatic tumors with contrast-enhanced sonography Secondary Objectives: To estimate the effect of tumor type, size, location and depth on the conspicuity of small tumors on contrast-enhanced sonography</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An estimated 75 patients (age 18 years of age or older) will be enrolled from the population of patients who present for ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of CT or MRI-confirmed multiple primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic carcinoma, with at least one of the tumors being ≤ 1.5 cm in diameter.</detailed_description>
