	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if corneal topography can be used to predict the fluorescein pattern of keratoconus lenses on the eye. A corneal topography image will be taken and the computer selected lens will be placed on the eye. After placement of the lens color photographs will be taken of the eye's fluorescein pattern and compared to the computer predicted pattern.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject population: keratoconus patients who have not undergone corneal surgery 100 subjects who come to UIHC for their contact lens care. We will approach them at their visit. We will not call potential participants from a database. If topography is impossible to capture. Concommitant Corneal Disease Minors will be excluded</detailed_description>
