	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this study is to correlate findings between two commonly-used types of swallowing studies: videofluoroscopy and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Specifically, the timing of swallowing events will be correlated between teh two studies. In addition, the pharyngeal constriction ratio (a validated measure of pharyngeal strength on videofluoroscopy) will be compared with the pharyngeal squeeze maneuver (an assessment of pharyngeal strength on FEES), with the hypothesis that there will be a strong correlation between PCR and pharyngeal squeeze.</detailed_description>
