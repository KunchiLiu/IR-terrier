	<brief_title>A Trial of Homeopathic Medication TRAUMEEL S for the Treatment of Radiation-Induced Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis is a debilitating side effect of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer patients. The severe inflammation of the oral cavity can be detrimental to quality of life and cause interruption in vital cancer treatment. Despite numerous proposed therapies, an effective agent for oral mucositis has yet to be found. TRAUMEEL S, a homeopathic remedy made up of highly diluted botanical extracts and minerals, has shown benefit for mucositis in children undergoing chemotherapy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of TRAUMMEL S in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis. The patients will use the medication as a mouthwash during radiation therapy and will be evaluated weekly with physical examination criteria and questionnaires for symptoms and side effects.</detailed_description>
