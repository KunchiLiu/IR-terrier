	<brief_title>Rate of Postpyloric Migration of Spiral Nasojejunal Tubes in Brain Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nutrition support is important in brain injured patients. Several studies have shown that small bowel feeding compared with gastric feeding may be associated with a reduction in pneumonia in critically ill patients. The Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that small bowel feedings should be considered for patients at high risk for intolerance to enteral nutrition. There are several methods to place postpyloric tube, but there is a high success rate with endoscopic or radiological assistance. However, they are time consuming procedures, which is of limited availability at bedside and requires trained staff. Nasojejunal tube with spiral end (Flocare Bengmark NJ tube) has been used for bedside placement for 10 years. But only limited data are available for success rate, especially in brain injured patients. The aim of this study is to access the success rate and influencing factors of spiral end nasojejunal tube in such a population.</detailed_description>
