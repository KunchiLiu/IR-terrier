	<brief_summary>For most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, surgery or other curative procedures are not possible and only palliative measures could be applied (chemoembolization, targeted drugs, best supportive cares, etc). In the ICAR study, increasing doses of a cell therapy product will be evaluated in patients in a palliative setting. All patients will have one hepatic intra-arterial injection of immunological cells (gamma-delta T lymphocytes) and will be evaluated for safety.</brief_summary>
