	<brief_summary>This protocol is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin given with rituximab compared to a defined investigator's choice therapy. Subjects will be randomized to one of these two arms of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Inotuzumab Ozogamicin In Combination With Rituximab Versus Defined Investigator's Choice In Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On January 14th 2009, enrollment in the study was discontinued because of poor enrollment and because it was unlikely that the study would meet the estimated enrollment of approximately 978 subjects. The decision was not prompted by the identification of any safety signals in this or other studies. Active treatment and follow-up of the already enrolled subjects was continued. On July, 22th 2010 , the study was amended to shorten the long-term follow-up to one year after active treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of CD20 and CD22positive, follicular lymphoma, who have received 1 or 2 prior regimens, at least 1 of which should have contained administration of rituximab (either as a single agent or in combination). Age 18 years or older. ECOG performance status &lt;= 2. ANC &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L (1500/mL) and platelets &gt;= 75 x 10^9/L (75,000/mL), serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN and urine protein to creatinine ratio of &lt;= 0.5, total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN, AST and ALT &lt;= 2.5 x ULN. At least 1 measurable disease lesion that is &gt;= 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm by CT or MRI, in an area of no prior radiation therapy, or documented progression in an area that was previously irradiated. Subjects with clinical evidence of transformation to a more aggressive subtype of lymphoma or grade 3b follicular lymphoma. Subjects whose disease is rituximab refractory, meaning that they did not have a CR or PR, or that they experienced disease progression within 6 months from the initiation of the rituximab or rituximab containing treatment regimen administered immediately preceding study enrollment.</criteria>
