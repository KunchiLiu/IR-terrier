	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving doxorubicin together with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I and phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carboplatin when given together with doxorubicin to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of intravenous doxorubicin hydrochloride and intraperitoneal carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. - To evaluate the feasibility of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - To evaluate the response rate and progression-free survival of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have had no more than two prior salvage regimens. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of carboplatin followed by a phase II study. - Phase I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin intraperitoneally on day 1 until the maximum tolerated dose is achieved. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Phase II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride as in phase I and carboplatin at the maximum tolerated dose as in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 weeks for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients (18 patients in phase I and 43 patients in phase II) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
