	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of Prochymal™ versus placebo in combination with corticosteroids as initial therapy for acute GVHD. Corticosteroids have been the primary therapy for patients with previously untreated acute GVHD and the historical published data define an expected 35% complete response (CR) at Day +28 using this therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Prochymal™ Infusion in Combination With Corticosteroids for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be treated with a total of 6 infusions of investigational agent during the first 4 weeks of the study. Four infusions will be administered during the first two weeks (twice weekly), then two infusions administered during the next two weeks (once weekly). Subjects assigned to the active treatment group will receive Prochymal™. Subjects assigned to the non active treatment group will receive placebo (excipient, less cells). It is recommended that all subjects receive all six infusions. The discontinuation of investigational agent is allowed for GVHD worsening with subsequent need for salvage therapy. All infusions must be given at least 3 days apart. Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety until death, withdrawal or 90 study days after randomization, whichever occurs first. Study will be unblinded and data analyzed at Day 90 post 1st infusion (Day 0)following final subject enrollment. Subjects will be followed for safety for 12 months post 1st infusion (Day 0).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must be 18 years to 70 years of age, inclusive Subjects must have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using either bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or cord blood or administered a donor leukocyte infusion. Subjects must have newly diagnosed Grades BD acute GVHD. Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is strongly recommended but not required. Randomization should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results. Subjects must be randomized and treated with corticosteroid (12 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone, or equivalent) and Prochymal™/placebo within 72 hours of onset of acute GVHD. Subjects must have adequate renal function as defined by: Calculated Creatinine Clearance of &gt;30mL/min using the CockroftGault equation Subjects who are women of childbearing potential, must be nonpregnant, not breastfeeding, and use adequate contraception. Male subjects must use adequate contraception Subject must have a minimum Karnofsky Performance Level of at least 30 at the time of study entry Subject (or legal representative where appropriate) must be capable of providing written informed consent. Subject has been previously treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for acute GVHD Subject has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the subject including uncontrolled infection, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, etc. Subjects may not receive any other investigational agents (not approved by the FDA for any indication) concurrently during study participation or within 30 days of randomization. Subject has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products or DMSO Subject has received a transplant for a solid tumor disease. Subject requires more than 2L/min of oxygen to maintain stable SaO2 greater than or equal to 92% Subject requires a renal dopamine dose greater than 13 mcg/kg/min to maintain renal blood flow associated with renal failure and improved urinary output.</criteria>
