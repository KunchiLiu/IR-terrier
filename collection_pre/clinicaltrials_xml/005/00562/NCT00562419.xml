	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: CT-322 may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving CT-322 together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase 2 trial is studying the side effects, tolerability, and efficacy of CT-322 when given alone and in combination with irinotecan to patients with glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
