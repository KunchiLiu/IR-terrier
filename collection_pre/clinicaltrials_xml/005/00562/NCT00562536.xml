	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the present study is to examine the effects of delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants on neonatal outcomes using a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing immediate cord clamping (standard at present) with delayed cord clamping. Our specific aim is to determine if a 30 to 45 second delay in umbilical cord clamping improves neonatal outcome as assessed by a composite of intraventricular hemorrhage and late onset sepsis in preterm infants born between 24 and 32 weeks gestation. Secondary outcomes to be examined include improvements in the following: 1) lung function as assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA), 2) cardiovascular function as assessed by the need for volume expansion, inotropes, or clinically suspected PDA requiring intervention prior to discharge home, and 3) anemia as assessed by initial hemoglobin, need for transfusion during stay in the NICU, and number of transfusions.</brief_summary>
