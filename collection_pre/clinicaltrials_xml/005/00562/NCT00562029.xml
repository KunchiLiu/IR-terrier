	<brief_summary>Premise: Complete resolution of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with normalization of blood glucose and HbA1c in the abscence of medication support is possible with a surgical procedure named the "Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass (DJB)" a modification of an established duodenal switch procedure and is performed utilizing the laparoscopic approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass(DJB) as a Potential Cure for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The duodenum plays a major role in glucose homeostasis through mechanisms largely unknown at this time. Evidence of this hypothesis comes from accumulated data in bariatric surgery patients who underwent Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass or Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD) with or without a Duodenal Switch. Current evidence strongly supports this hypothesis with a long term (over 10 years) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus(T2DM) resolution rate of 84-86% following the gastric bypass and over 95% for the duodenal switch. The clinical resolution of T2DM is defined as independence of all anti-diabetic medications and maintaining a HbA1c less than 6.0. Recent rodent experiments by Francesco Rubino and subsequent human case reports by Cohen et al. supports the validity of this hypothesis. The modified procedure involved a roux-en-y bypass of the duodenum and 30-50cm of proximal jejunum, unaltering the stomach and pylorus resulted in resolution of T2DM with no weight loss in all subjects.</detailed_description>
