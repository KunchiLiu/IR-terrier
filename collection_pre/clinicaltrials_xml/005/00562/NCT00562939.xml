	<brief_title>Immune Response to Toll-Like Receptor 9-Agonist Adjuvanted Pneumococcal Vaccination in HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumococcal disease is a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-patients. HIV-patients are vaccine hyporesponders. A good immune response to pneumococcal vaccination enhances vaccine effectiveness, thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality caused by pneumococcal disease. Even when an optimized regimen containing both conjugated and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is used, only 13% of the immunized HIV patients are high responders at week 96. Recent data indicate that TLR9-agonists have excellent vaccine adjuvant potential and are safe to use in immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised individuals. The aim of this study is to evaluate the qualitative and quantitive immune response to pneumococcal vaccination with or without TLR9-agonist in HIV-infected adults</detailed_description>
