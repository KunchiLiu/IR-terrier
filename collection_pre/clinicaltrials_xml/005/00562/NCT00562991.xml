	<brief_summary>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the airways develop increased responsiveness to various stimuli such as exposure to an allergen, cold air or exercise. It is characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, increased mucus production, and airway obstruction. Since inflammation is an important feature of asthma, the use of non-invasive tests to measure lung inflammation to monitor asthma are of interest.The purpose of the study is to relate costs associated with healthcare utilization and loss of work and school time to the primary health outcome of cumulative number of symptom-free days. This will enable the researchers to determine whether the costs of monitoring exhaled NO to regular management strategy in recently diagnosed asthma will be offset by reductions in other costs of asthma-related care, and, if not, whether the additional costs are likely to be acceptable in terms of the improvement in health outcomes as measured by the additional number of symptom-free days.</brief_summary>
