	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the postprandial time course of nitrotyrosine after injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular human insulin. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the postprandial time course of the following efficacy parameters after injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular insulin on - Blood Glucose - Insulin - Intact proinsulin - Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) - Metal matrix proteasis (MMP-9) - Oxidative status (per ox) - Interleukin 18 (IL-18) - Free fatty acids (FFA) - Oxidised LDL (ox-LDL) - Microvascular blood circulation measured with laser Doppler at 37 °C (LDF37) - Microvascular blood circulation measured with laser Doppler at 44 °C (LDF44)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase III b Indication Type 2 Diabetes Trial Objectives 1) Primary objective: The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the postprandial time course of nitrotyrosine after injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular human insulin. 2) Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are to evaluate the postprandial time course of blood glucose, insulin, intact proinsulin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), metal matrix proteasis (MMP-9), free fatty acids (FFA), oxidised LDL (ox-LDL), oxidative status (per ox), IL-18 as well as postprandial time course of microvascular blood circulation measured with laserdopplerflux at 37 °C (LDF37) and 44 C (LDF44). Efficacy Variables Primary efficacy variablePostprandial time course of nitrotyrosineSecondary efficacy variablePostprandial time course of glucose, insulin, intact proinsulin, ADMA, MMP-9, FFA, ox-LDL, per-ox, and IL-18 as well as postprandial time course of laserdopplerflux at 37 °C and 44 °C Safety Variables Incidence and frequency of adverse events and evaluation of safety laboratory parameters Medication/Dosage Insulin glulisine, dose 0.10 U/kg and Regular Human Insulin, dose 0.10 U/kg Study Duration Duration of study participation for one patient: 5 - 43 days Overall duration of the study: 6 months Design Single-centre, open label, randomized, 2-way-crossover trial Population Male and female type 2 diabetic patients between 40 and 70 years with HbA1c between 6.5 % and 9.9 % and treated with sulfonyurea alone or in combination with Metformin in a stable dosage within the last 3 months Sample Size N = 15</detailed_description>
