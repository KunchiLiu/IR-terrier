	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose and spectrum of toxicities encountered with intraperitoneal delivery of a RGD modified conditionally replicative adenovirus (Ad5-Delta 24RGD) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Secondary objectives : - To determine the biologic effects encountered with intraperitoneal delivery of Ad5-Delta 24RGD in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer cells - To determine immunologic response generated against Ad5-Delta 24RGD when administered intraperitoneally to patients with recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma - To determine potential clinical activity of Ad5-Delta 24RGD when administered intraperitoneally to patients with recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma</brief_summary>
