	<detailed_description>Observational, prospective, open-label, in-patient study, that includes patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding of variceal or peptic origin, and in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The adrenal function of every patient included will be evaluated in the first 24 hours of admission This assessment shall be performed using the corticotropin-stimulation short test (synacthen test), that includes serum and saliva determination of cortisol, in basal conditions and 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of 250 ug of corticotropin synthetic (Synacthen, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). The cortisol levels will be determined by competitive immunoassay using direct chemoluminescence technology (Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). In patients with severe acute pancreatitis all of these determinations will be repeated at the third day of admission. Several other clinical and biochemical features will be recorded.</detailed_description>
