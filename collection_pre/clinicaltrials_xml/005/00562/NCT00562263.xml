	<brief_summary>The current study aims to investigate the impact of a comprehensive, team-based, family-centered, lifestyle modification program on body weight, metabolic abnormalities, fitness measures, and self-esteem in overweight adolescents beginning the study at ages 11-18 years. The intensive program will uniquely include a "team" structure and a component designed to address the role of parental modeling in effective lifestyle changes. By comparing the demographic, psychosocial, and metabolic characteristics of adolescents according to the degree of weight loss, the study will also more fully characterize the barriers that prevent successful participation in an intensive lifestyle modification program.</brief_summary>

The study is designed for 2 years of participation with data collection points at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.
