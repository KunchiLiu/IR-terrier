	<brief_summary>One hundred patients with moderate to severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) will be asked to exercise on a treadmill. NT-pro-BNP levels will be drawn before and after exercise. Changes in NT-pro-BNP levels will be correlated to outcomes at one year. In the pilot phase an additional 10 control subjects without AS will be enrolled to document the control response of NT-pro-BNP elevations with exercise.</brief_summary>
