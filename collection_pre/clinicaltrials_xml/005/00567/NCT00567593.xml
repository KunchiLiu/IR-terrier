	<brief_title>Gene Regulation by Thiazolidinediones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the study is to examine the effect of rosiglitazone (Avandia) on gene regulation in colonic epithelium in the absence of pathologic acute and chronic intestinal inflammation. The secondary aims are to determine the effect of rosiglitazone (Avandia) therapy on T cell activation and cytokine expression in the absence of pathologic acute and chronic intestinal inflammation.</detailed_description>
