	<brief_title>Comparison of the Alpha-2 Agonists for Prevention of Intraocular Pressure Elevation After Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized double blind trial of patients undergoing selective laser trabeculoplasty for primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Enrolled patients are randomized to receive one drop of brimonidine 0.1% in one eye and one drop of apraclonidine 0.5% in the fellow eye. The trabecular meshwork in both eyes of each enrolled patient is treated 360 degrees at the same sitting. Intraocular pressure is measured in each eye one hour before applying the study medications and at one hour and one week after laser surgery.</detailed_description>
