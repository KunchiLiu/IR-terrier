	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic radiation therapy in treating patients with liver metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To identify the maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic radiation therapy in patients with hepatic metastases. - To determine the toxicity and adverse events profile of this patient population. - To examine patient response, treatment effect on blood chemistry, and hematology values and patient quality-of-life in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to stereotactic radiotherapy level (1 vs 2 vs 3) and the number of liver lesions present (1-2 vs 3-5 vs &gt; 5). Patients undergo percutaneous placement of metallic fiducial markers within the liver for stereotactic targeting and planning. Patients then undergo 1 fraction of stereotactic radiotherapy within 1 week of the marker placement. Patients complete Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaires to assess quality of life at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and months 3, 6, and 9 after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
