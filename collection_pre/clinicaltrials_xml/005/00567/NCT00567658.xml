	<brief_title>Effect of Acid Suppression With Esomeprazole on Vocal Cord Granulomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vocal cord granulomas (VCG) are common structural lesions of vocal cords attributed to vocal abuse / misuse and recently to gastroesophageal reflux. Vocal process granulomas are reactive/reparative process, in which an intact or ulcerated squamous epithelium is underlaid by granulation tissue or fibrosis (4, 5). Ulualp et al (6) have reported a higher prevalence of pharyngeal acid reflux (PAR) events in patients with vocal cord lesions. In a case control study they showed that the prevalence of pharyngeal reflux, documented with 3 site pharyngoesophageal pH monitoring, is higher among patients with posterior laryngitis and vocal cord lesions than control (78% vs. 21%). Most recently our cohort trial in over 80 patients with laryngeal findings suggestive of GERD suggested that vocal cord abnormalities such as granulomas may be more specific sign of GERD than any other (7). Thus, there is reasonable scientific intrigue regarding this laryngeal finding and the causal role from gastroesophagopharyngeal acid reflux requiring better studies. However, no study has evaluated the potential causal association between GERD and VCGs.</detailed_description>
