Subject taking more than 500 mcg/day of fluticasone or equivalent associated to a longacting β2agonist. Inhaled corticosteroid and longacting beta2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) doses that remained fixed during the last 12 weeks prior to screening. Medical history of at least two episodes of asthma exacerbation treated with systemic corticoid or at least one severe asthma exacerbation treated with systemic corticoid and hospitalization or emergency room visit in the last 12 months prior to screening.
