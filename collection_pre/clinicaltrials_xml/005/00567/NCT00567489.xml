	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate that use of glucose sparing prescriptions (PEN vs Dianeal only) in diabetic (Type 1 and Type 2) Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD)patients leads to improved metabolic control as measured by the magnitude of change from the baseline value in the HbA1c levels. Secondary Objectives: To demonstrate that use of glucose-sparing PD solutions (PEN vs Dianeal only) in diabetic (Type 1 and Type 2) CAPD and APD patients leads to lower glycemic-control medication requirements, decreased incidence of severe hypoglycemic events requiring medical intervention, improved metabolic control, nutritional status, and Quality of Life. In a subgroup of patients, the impact of glucose-sparing PD solutions (PEN vs Dianeal only) on abdominal fat and left ventricular (LV) structure and function will be assessed.</brief_summary>
