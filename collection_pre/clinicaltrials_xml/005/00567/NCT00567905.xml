	<brief_title>Effect of Green Tea Extract on Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Green tea is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It is believed to have beneficial effects in prevention and treatment of many diseases, one of which is anti-obesity and anti-diabetes. The benefit effects of green tea are mainly attributed to its polyphenol content, especially the most abundant one-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which might inhibit adipocyte proliferation and differentiation in vitro studies We hypothesized that GTE would improve insulin resistance in type 2 overweight diabetes and related hormone peptides will be influenced. Thus, we conducted this randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of GTE on type 2 diabetes and to explore the relationship between GTE and related hormone peptides.</detailed_description>
