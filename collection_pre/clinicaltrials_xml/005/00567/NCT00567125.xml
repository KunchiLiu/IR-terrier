	<brief_title>Comparison of Systemic Response After Laparoscopies Performed With Standard and Low-Pressure Pneumoperitoneum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The purpose of the study was to access the influence of low pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum on the inflammatory and angiogenic responses during the postoperative period after laparoscopy. Summary background data: Surgical procedures enhance production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors that play a pivotal role in the immunological response to surgical trauma and take part in the pathogenesis of tumor growth and adhesions formation. Methods: Study group consisted of 40 patients, operated on due to cholelithiasis using standard- (n=20) and low-pressure (n=20) CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Serum concentration of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF-A and endostatin were measured before the surgeries and thereafter at 6, 24 and 48h with commercially available ELISA assays. Results: Concentrations of IL-6 increased significantly after the operations in both groups. No differences were observed between the groups in regards to IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels. Concentrations of VEGF-A measured at 6 and 48h were significantly lower in patients who underwent laparoscopies performed with low pressure pneumoperitoneum. No significant variations were observed in endostatin serum concentration. Concentrations of the studied parameters were not influenced by the duration of surgeries, age, gender, or BMI of the patients. Conclusions: The results obtained in our study do not show any significant differences between studied operative procedures with regards to systemic inflammatory response. Changes in the concentrations of VEGF-A and endostatin observed in the studied population may suggest this technique to be more favorable with regards to angiogenesis process intensity, along with all its consequences and implications.</detailed_description>
