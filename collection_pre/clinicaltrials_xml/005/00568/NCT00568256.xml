	<brief_summary>Ulcerative Colitis is an Inflammatory Bowel disease that is a life-long, relapsing disabling disorder. Current treatments for Ulcerative Colitis are not satisfactory. Most medications provide only partial relief, are not successful for at least 30% of patients, and have major negative side effects. Mounting evidence indicates that stress is one of the important triggers that activates symptoms of ulcerative colitis and therefore causes flare-up. The primary aim of this study is to see if either of two 8-week Mind-Body courses has an effect in reducing stress and affecting the course and severity of UC. Hypotheses: Stress causes Ulcerative Colitis flare-up and stress reduction will prevent Ulcerative Colitis flare-up.</brief_summary>
