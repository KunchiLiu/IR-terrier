	<brief_title>Chronic, Low Dose Erythropoetin Beta in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several effects known to be exerted by erythropoetin (EPO) directly in the heart independent of hemoglobin levels could be of value immediately after revascularization procedures in ischemic cardiac remodeling: the generation of new capillaries is enhanced by the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow. EPO is neuron- and cardio-protective after ischemia/reperfusion. Administration of EPO enhances neuronal progenitors to differentiate into functional neurons; this observation may also be valid for the cardiac compartment. The concept of organ-specific effects of EPO independent of hemoglobin levels is supported by the analysis of EPO analogues lacking hematopoietic activity. In humans, currently this concept can only be tested by the use of EPO-doses that do not affect hemoglobin levels. The concept is valid as clinical trials have been performed showing that doses as low as 5000 I.U. EPO once weekly increase the levels of endothelial progenitor cells in blood. On the other hand, recent clinical trials have also shown neutral or even deleterious effects of high dose EPO treatment raising hemoglobin levels to above 12mg/dl in pre-dialysis patients concerning cardiovascular endpoints. Therefore, the chronic, hemoglobin-neutral administration of low doses of EPO might be a successful approach concerning ischemic cardiomyopathy. Study outline: This investigator initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is testing the hypothesis, that low doses of erythropoietin beta (35 I.U./kg body weight) started within 14 days after a successful percutaneous coronary intervention enhance left ventricular remodeling as determined by comparison of two cardiac MRIÂ´s over a course of 6 months. Secondary endpoints include changes in diastolic dysfunction as measured by echocardiography, VO2 measured by spiroergometry and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels.</detailed_description>
