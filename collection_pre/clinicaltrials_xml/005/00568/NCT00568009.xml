	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, sequential cohort study in subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF) and impaired renal function who are on stable furosemide treatment (Â³ 40 mg daily). A total of 50 subjects will be randomized to each increasing dose level of SLV320 or placebo in a sequential fashion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects aged 18 to85 years who gave written informed consent. Subjects must have a history of chronic, symptomatic, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIII CHF and impaired renal function (baseline eGFR of 20 to 75 mL/min/1.73m2). Congestive heart failure should have been diagnosed at least 3 months before Visit 1 (Day 1) and the subjects should be on chronic treatment with furosemide (40 mg daily) for at least 3 weeks before Visit 1 (Day 1). Subjects must be on stable doses of their individually optimized medication regimen for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Day 1). Any history of a convulsive disorder or preconvulsive state and any risk for a convulsive disorder or preconvulsive state (for example any past brain trauma, abuse of alcohol) will lead to an exclusion from the study. Females of childbearing potential not using specified contraception, subjects with malignant tumors with a short life expectancy, subjects with known severe reactions to drugs and subjects with bilateral renal artery stenosis will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
