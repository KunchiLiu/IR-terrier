	<brief_summary>In this study, 140 heavy drinking young adults (aged 18-25) will be provided with brief counseling and either naltrexone, a medication that is FDA-approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence, or placebo over the course of 8 weeks. A novel strategy will be used for administering low-dose naltrexone, in which daily dosing will be combined with targeted dosing in anticipation of high-risk situations. The main hypotheses are that daily + targeted naltrexone will result in greater reductions in frequency of heavy and any drinking compared with daily + targeted placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naltrexone for Heavy Drinking in Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NIAAA has designated underage drinking as a priority research area. Of note, the highest prevalence of problem alcohol use is among young adults ages 18-25. Heavy drinking that occurs during this period can have important immediate and lifelong adverse consequences. Behavioral interventions, notably BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students), have been developed to help young adults reduce their drinking. Although these interventions are effective, including with college students mandated to treatment and others with minimal motivation to stop drinking, the effect sizes are modest, suggesting that new approaches are needed to enhance these interventions. A promising strategy yet to be tested in young adults is the use of the opiate antagonist naltrexone. In other research, naltrexone has been shown to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed, even in the absence of strong internal motivation to change, and to reduce the frequency of any and heavy drinking in problem drinkers seeking treatment. Thus we propose to conduct an 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled trial to test the combined efficacy of BASICS + naltrexone in 132 young adults aged 18-25 who drink heavily. A novel strategy will be used for administering low-dose naltrexone, in which daily dosing will be combined with targeted dosing in anticipation of high-risk situations. The main hypotheses are that daily + targeted naltrexone will result in greater reductions in frequency of heavy and any drinking compared with daily + targeted placebo. In order to enhance the sensitivity with which we are able to assess naltrexone's effects on drinking, daily ratings will be obtained during treatment. These will permit us to examine alternative measures of alcohol involvement (e.g., reports of subjective intoxication, estimated blood alcohol levels) in addition to the traditional measures based on number of drinks consumed. These data will also be used to examine potential mediators (e.g., craving, subjective effects of alcohol) of treatment response in order to better understand the effects of naltrexone. The durability of treatment effects will be examined at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. Demonstration of the efficacy of naltrexone in this population will provide the essential information needed for its adoption by college counseling centers and other health care settings committed to reducing the risk of heavy drinking in young adults.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each subject must: 1. Be between the ages of 18 and 25; 2. Report heavy drinking 4 or more times in the past 4 weeks. Heavy drinking is defined as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men on an occasion; 3. Be able to read English and show no evidence of significant cognitive impairment. 4. That women of childbearing potential (i.e., who has not had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation), be nonlactating, practicing a reliable method of birth control, and have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to initiation of treatment. No subject may: 1. Exhibit current, clinically significant physical disease or abnormality on the basis of medical history, physical examination, or routine laboratory evaluation, including AST or ALT levels greater than 3 times normal or bilirubin levels greater than 110% of normal. Individuals with common medical conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease) that are adequately controlled and who have a relationship with a primarycare practitioner will not be excluded; 2. Exhibit serious psychiatric illness (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe major depression, panic disorder, borderline personality disorder, organic mood or mental disorders, or substantial suicide or violence risk) by history or psychological examination; 3. Have a current diagnosis of DSMIV drug dependence other than nicotine, or a lifetime history of DSMIV opiate dependence; 4. Have a current DSMIV diagnosis of alcohol dependence that is clinically severe defined by a) a history of seizures, delirium, or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal, b) a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment scale (Sullivan et al., 1989) score of &gt; 8, c) report drinking to avoid withdrawal symptoms, or d) have had prior treatment of withdrawal. 5. Have used opioids or concomitant therapy with any psychotropic drug in the past month, except that subjects who are on a stable dose of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor for at least two months for the indications of Major Depressive Disorder, Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) will not be excluded; SSRIs are allowed due to their safety profile relative to other classes of antidepressants. 6. Have a history of hypersensitivity to naltrexone; 7. Be considered by the investigators to be an unsuitable candidate for receipt of an investigational drug. 8. The investigators may exclude participants who complete daily questionnaires on less than half of the days between intake and treatment.</criteria>
