	<brief_title>ELND005 in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ELND005 (formerly known as AZD-103), scyllo-inositol, is being investigated as an orally administered treatment for AD. ELND005 may prevent or inhibit the build up of amyloid protein in the brains of AD patients. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, safety and efficacy study of oral ELND005 in male and female participants aged 50-85 years with mild to moderate AD. Approximately 340 patients will be enrolled into the study at approximately 65 study sites. Patients will be randomized to receive either ELND005 or placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 18 months.</detailed_description>
