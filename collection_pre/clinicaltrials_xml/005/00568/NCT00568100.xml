	<brief_summary>The investigators' aim is to study the effect of pressure support ventilation at two levels of PEEP and Pressure Support versus neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in COPD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Pressure Support Ventilation and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, two levels of pressure support and PEEP during pressure support ventilation are compared with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in COPD patients by measuring respiratory mechanics, intrinsic PEEP, work of breathing and patient's level of comfort.</detailed_description>
