	<brief_summary>To evaluate the role of inhaled corticosteroids to suppress nitric oxide gas exchange in stable patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who are current non-smokers and not on oral corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Inhaled Corticosteroids on Exhaled Nitric Oxide Gas Exchange</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stable, non-smoking COPD patients not on oral corticosteroids will be randomized in single blinded study to evaluate nitric oxide gas exchange at baseline, and subsequent effects of fluticasone 100mcg/salmeterol 50mcg bid, and fluticasone 250mcg/salmeterol 50mcg bid. Primary end points will include measurements of nitric oxide at varying expiratory flow rates to calculate bronchial, and small airway/alveolar nitric oxide. Secondary end points will evaluate lung function. Exhaled nitric oxide production presumably reflects endogenous inflammation. Normal healthy, non-smoking controls will be used for comparison, with exhaled nitric oxide measured before and after 3 weeks of low dose inhlaed corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
