	<brief_summary>The original protocol was a randomized, open-label, 3-way cross-over study with 9 scheduled visits. The visits comprised an initial screening visit, 3 treatment visits for the meal challenge followed by a 2-6-week blood-loss recovery period, an interim safety visit, 3 sequential visits for the glucose clamp, and a final close-out visit. Protocol Amendment 1 was a randomized, open-label, 2-way cross-over study with 7 visits for each completed subject. The visits comprise an initial screening visit, 2 treatment visits for the meal challenge followed by a 2-6-week blood-loss recovery period, an interim safety visit, 2 sequential visits for the glucose clamp, and a final close-out visit. For both the original protocol and Protocol Amendment 1, subjects were hospitalized in the clinical unit for all procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Subcutaneous Rapid Acting Insulin and One Formulation of Inhaled Insulin in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The original protocol was a randomized, open-label, 3-way cross-over study with 9 scheduled visits. The visits comprised an initial screening visit, 3 treatment visits for the meal challenge followed by a 2-6-week blood-loss recovery period, an interim safety visit, 3 sequential visits for the glucose clamp, and a final close-out visit. After review of the meal challenge data from the Original Protocol design, it became apparent that the TI Inhalation Powder, insulin lispro, and Exubera doses were not well matched, and resulted in significantly higher insulin exposure following insulin lispro than the two inhaled treatments. All meal challenge visits were completed for the 18 subjects enrolled. However, the glucose clamp visits were discontinued since it was discovered that a direct comparison between the treatments was not possible. The protocol was amended (Amendment 1) to ensure that the insulin exposures between TI Inhalation Powder and insulin lispro were more suited (increased the TI Inhalation Powder doses and decreased the insulin lispro dose). An Exubera arm was not included in Amendment 1 due to the market removal of this product. Protocol Amendment 1 was a randomized, open-label, 2-way cross-over study with 7 visits for each completed subject. The visits comprise an initial screening visit, 2 treatment visits for the meal challenge followed by a 2-6-week blood-loss recovery period, an interim safety visit, 2 sequential visits for the glucose clamp, and a final close-out visit. For both the original protocol and Protocol Amendment 1, subjects were hospitalized in the clinical unit for all procedures.</detailed_description>
