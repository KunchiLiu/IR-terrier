	<brief_title>Effect of Pioglitazone on Portal and Systemic Hemodynamics in Patients With Advanced Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cirrhotic liver disease is associated with portal hypertension including elevated portal pressure as well as hyperdynamic circulation and low peripheral vascular resistance. Endothelial nitric (NO) release is impaired in liver microvasculature, upregulation of eNOS activity in the cirrhotic liver may constitute a new strategy to correct the increased hepatic vascular tone in these patients. In contrary to this impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation (endothelial dysfunction) and NO deficiency in the cirrhotic liver, systemic and splanchnic circulation of cirrhotic patients is characterized by increased vascular tone and hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, thiazolidinediones, like pioglitazone decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve endothelial function. In a randomized controlled, parallel group double-blind study 20 Patients with advanced (Child´s Grade B or C) liver cirrhosis will receive pioglitazone or placebo for nine days. Portal hemodynamics and forearm blood flow response will be measured at baseline and after pioglitazone/placebo to investigate the effect of pioglitazone in these group of patients.</detailed_description>
