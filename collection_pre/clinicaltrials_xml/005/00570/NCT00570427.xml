	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve access to quality depression care for older, low-income, minority adults in public sector health care. The study will examine current depression care in a public sector geriatric clinic that serves mostly Spanish-speaking Latinos and pilot study assessments and treatments in order to lay the groundwork for a large study of quality improvement for depressed older minorities</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Depression Treatment for Older Minority Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depressive disorders affect 5-10% of older primary care patients, although rates may be higher among Latinos, especially among immigrants and those less acculturated. Late-life depression may be chronic and recurrent and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Despite a growing evidence base for the treatment of geriatric depression, only half of depressed older adults receive mental health care; fewer than 10% receive specialty services. Treatment rates are even lower for low-income, ethnic minorities who may be more ill and disabled, may lack adequate insurance and have different treatment preferences, and who frequently face barriers to accessing care. Recent quality improvement interventions for geriatric depression have targeted primary care, the location where older patients and ethnic minorities are most likely to receive mental health services. A recent multi-site, randomized trial of collaborative care for geriatric depression in primary care offered patients their choice of treatments, including antidepressant medication or 6-8 sessions of a structured psychotherapy. Although the intervention had few cultural accommodations, both processes and outcomes of care improved for depressed older minorities. However, because the study only included Latinos who were English-speaking and mostly high school graduates, these results may not generalize to a large proportion of ethnic minorities. This study first examines current rates of depression and patterns of depression treatment in a public-sector geriatric clinic that serves mostly Spanish-speaking Latinos. Then depressed patients are identified and their depression treatment preferences and barriers to care are assessed. Patients are enrolled in a 6-month patient-centered, evidence-based intervention, and they, family members, and clinic medical providers are interviewed at program end to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and possible effectiveness of the intervention.</detailed_description>
