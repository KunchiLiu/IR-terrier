	<brief_summary>This research aims to facilitate the successful implementation of the new Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario dysphagia screening model for acute stroke patients. The objectives will be 1) to determine the natural history of dysphagia screening skill decay, and 2) to assess the benefit of independent web-based practice and periodic feedback on screening skill maintenance. We will enrol a convenience sample of nurses who currently work with stroke patients but who have had no prior formal training with dysphagia screening. The study will consist of 2 phases: A) an initial pilot phase followed by B) a prospective randomized controlled study. During Phase A, three new web-based, self-instructed skill refresher courses will be developed to help nurses maintain the skills they will learn in an 8-hour workshop on dysphagia screening. During Phase B, nurses will receive the 8-hour workshop and one-on-one evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Following training, competent screeners will be randomized into one of two groups: Group A - Control group with no refresher course or periodic feedback from SLP; Group B - Web-based skill refresher courses only. Nurses will be evaluated at several timepoints throughout Phase B to assess theoretical dysphagia screening knowledge and skills.</brief_summary>
