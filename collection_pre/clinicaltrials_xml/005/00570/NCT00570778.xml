	<criteria>1. Male or female adults aged ≥40 years, who have signed an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedure. 2. Patients with moderate to severe stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines 2006. 3. Patients who have smoking history of at least 10 pack years. 4. Patients with a postbronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥30% and &lt; 80% of the predicted normal and postbronchodilator FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70. 1. Pregnant or nursing women, or women of childbearing potential, regardless of whether or not sexually active if they are not using acceptable methods of contraception. 2. Patients requiring long term oxygen therapy (&gt; 15 hours a day) on a daily basis for chronic hypoxemia, or who have been hospitalized or visited an emergency department for a COPD exacerbation or as result of their airways disease in the 6 weeks prior to screening. 3. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to screening. 4. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease, pulmonary tuberculosis (unless confirmed by chest xray to be no longer active) or clinically significant bronchiectasis. 5. Patients with any history of asthma indicated by (but not limited to) a blood eosinophil count &gt; 400/mm3. 6. Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator or the responsible Novartis personnel, have a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition. 7. Patients with uncontrolled Type I and Type II diabetes. 8. History of malignancy of any organ system (including lung cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years. 9. Patients who are contraindicated for or who have shown an untoward reaction to inhaled anticholinergic agents. 10. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc interval (Fridericia method) measured at screening is prolonged (&gt;450 ms for males or &gt;470 ms for females). 11. Patients with a history of untoward reactions to sympathomimetic amines, inhaled medication or any component thereof, or any of the study drugs or drugs with similar chemical structures. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
