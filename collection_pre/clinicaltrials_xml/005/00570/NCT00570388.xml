	<brief_summary>This study will test the safety and efficacy of the PROMETA® Treatment Protocol (which includes the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil) in reversing the neurocognitive impairment and this in turn will lead to improved ability to resist alcohol related cues and enhance involvement in psychosocial treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Functioning Following The PROMETA® Treatment Protocol In Subjects With Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal aim of this study is to extend our evaluation of the PROMETA® Treatment Protocol as a means to improve neurocognitive functioning in recently detoxified alcohol dependent subjects. For many alcohol dependent patients entering treatment, a range of neurocognitive deficits are present that not only had adverse effects on the patient's ability to function and think clearly but these deficits also impair the process of addiction treatment. For example, alcohol dependent subjects typically experience high levels of alcohol craving in the early stages of treatment. The patient is left with the choice of relieving craving by drinking alcohol to provide immediate relief of craving symptoms or abstaining from alcohol to obtain long-term benefits from recovery of the complications from excessive drinking. We have previously shown in open label trials that the PROMETA® Treatment Protocol helps stimulant abusers in the early stages of recovery, have relatively low rates of relapse to stimulant use. It is not clear if the Protocol is effective because of less urges to use stimulants or the ability to resist these urges is improved from a recovery of Neurocognitive functioning. The present proposal extends our previous research by comparing the efficacy of the PROMETA® Treatment Protocol in a double blind placebo controlled trial using a new population of substance abusers (alcohol dependent subjects) and assessing the effects of the PROMETA® Treatment Protocol on neurocognitive functioning, particularly those aspects of functioning that affect the ability to make decisions that have important long-term benefits.</detailed_description>

Patients with a history of unstable or serious medical illness, including need for benzodiazepines. Known severe physical or medical illnesses such as AIDS, active hepatitis, Current severe psychiatric symptoms, e.g., psychosis, dementia, acute suicidal or homicidal ideation, mania or depression requiring newly initiated antidepressant or psychotropic therapy, or which would make it unsafe for the patient to participate in the opinion of the primary investigator.
