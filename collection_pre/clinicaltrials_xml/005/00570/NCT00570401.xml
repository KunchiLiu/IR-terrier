	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well dasatinib works in treating patients with advanced lung cancer that is no longer responding to erlotinib or gefitinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer That Is No Longer Responding to Erlotinib or Gefitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with acquired erlotinib hydrochloride- or gefitinib-resistant advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung treated with dasatinib. Secondary - To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - To determine the overall response rate in patients with EGFR T790M lung adenocarcinomas treated with this drug. - To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with EGFR T790M lung adenocarcinomas treated with this drug. - To determine the toxicity profile of dasatinib in these patients. OUTLINE: Beginning 1 week after completion of erlotinib hydrochloride or gefitinib therapy, patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response is assessed by CT scan at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>
