	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out if a new anti-cancer drug, dasatinib (Sprycel®), previously approved for treatment of some forms of leukemia, will be safe and helpful in treating patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This is a research study because the study drug, dasatinib (Sprycel®), has not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of some forms of leukemia; thus, dasatinib (Sprycel®) is not an investigational drug. It has been given safely to hundreds of patients already. However its safety and usefulness in this study population (prostate cancer) is unknown. Subjects who agree to participate will take 150mg (3 pills) of dasatinib (Sprycel®) daily by mouth for as long as the drug benefits them. During this time, the subject will periodically return to the office for blood/urine tests, X-rays, imaging scans, and/or to complete questionnaires.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must have biopsyproven adenocarcinoma of the prostate Must have hormonerefractory prostate cancer, defined as an increasing PSA by &gt;= 3 ng/ml from androgenblockade nadir, or new measurable or evaluable lesion on imaging studies, after treatment with orchiectomy, luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, antiandrogen or diethylstilbestrol (DES) Subjects must have received at least one cycle of singleagent or combination chemotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), last administered at least 4 weeks prior to the start of dasatinib Subjects may not have received more than one type (single agent or combination) of chemotherapy regimen; subjects may include (but are not limited to) the following: HRPC subjects who were treated with palliative chemotherapy and either failed to respond, or responded for a period of time but now have worsening disease (i.e. relapsed/refractory to chemotherapy); HRPC subjects who were treated with palliative chemotherapy but stopped treatment because of toxicity (i.e. intolerant of chemotherapy); HRPC subjects who have been treated with palliative chemotherapy with response, whose chemotherapy has been interrupted, and who now have evidence of progressive disease (i.e. potentially chemotherapy responsive but subject does not desire to restart cytotoxic drugs) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Life expectancy of at least 8 weeks, based on clinical judgment of the treating physician Adequate hematologic, renal and liver function as evidenced by the following (subjects may have lower hematologic parameters if the cytopenias are thought by the treating physician to be secondary to marrow involvement by prostate cancer): white blood cell count (WBC) &gt; 2.0 bil/L; grade 01 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 bil/L; grade 01 Platelets &gt; 100 bil/L; grade 01 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0gm/dL Creatinine &lt; 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Prothrombin time (PT), Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) &lt; 1.2 x ULN; grade 01 Total bilirubin &lt; 2x ULN aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5x ULN Na, K, Mg, P, Ca &gt;= lower limit of normal Elevated PSA level (at least 3 ng/mL), or measurable prostate cancer by CT or MRI scans (PSA level must have shown two consecutive increases [at &gt;= 14 day intervals] since the previous nadir) Ability to take oral medication (dasatinib must be swallowed whole) Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study drug is stopped Signed informed consent documents including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) according to institutional guidelines Concomitant Medications: Patient agrees to discontinue St. Johns Wort while receiving dasatinib therapy (in addition Patient agrees that IV bisphosphonates will be withheld for the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia) Subjects should have had no chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the start of treatment with dasatinib Prior localized radiotherapy for metastatic disease is permitted, provided the treatment volume is less than25% of potential marrow space (the radiotherapy must have been completed 6 weeks prior to enrollment) Systemic radiotherapy with samarium153 must have been completed at least 2 months prior to enrollment (subjects may not have received prior strontium89 [Metastron] therapy) At least 6 weeks have elapsed from the last dose of cytotoxic or targeted therapeutics to the time of prescreening; if the subject has received a combination regimen of standard chemotherapy plus an investigational agent, a 6 week washout period is required Subjects may not have received treatment with any kinase inhibitor At least 2 months must have elapsed from time of dosing with vaccines to the time of prescreening No malignancy, other than prostate cancer, that required radiotherapy or systemic treatment within the past 5 years Subjects may not have any of the following: Clinical evidence of uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction, or angina within the previous 6 months; prolonged QT interval Fridericia's (QTcF) &gt; 450msec; history of unstable ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes); concomitant use of drugs known to cause torsades de pointes [quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, erythromycins, clarithromycin, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine,thioridazine, pimozide, cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine] (these agents must have been discontinued at least 7 days prior to starting dasatinib); subjects with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia are excluded if the electrolyte anomaly cannot be corrected Subjects may not be enrolled with any of the following: History of a significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including diagnosed congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease), and diagnosed acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired antifactor VIII antibodies); GI bleeding from any cause within 3 months; Concomitant use of anticoagulants, except for lowdose warfarin (for prophylaxis to prevent catheter thrombosis) or heparin flushes (for IV lines), is prohibited (Note that chronic use of aspirin is prohibited) Subjects must meet the following restrictions: Subjects may not have a concurrent medical condition which may increase the risk of toxicity, including pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade, or uncontrolled hypertension; Concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not recommended (The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving dasatinib therapy); Patient must discontinue St. Johns Wort while receiving dasatinib therapy; Subjects must not use intravenous bisphosphonates during the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia; Subjects may not be receiving any restricted cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (If the investigator feels that any of these agents should be given as uniquely useful for a clear diagnosis, the situation should be discussed with the Principal Investigator, and a clear monitoring program should be planned) Subjects may not have evidence of untreated intracranial metastases, or untreated prostate cancer producing spinal cord compression</criteria>
