	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Phase I part of this research study is to determine the safest and most effective dose of Abraxane when given in combination with carboplatin and Erbitux during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. The purpose of the Phase II part of this study is to determine the effects of the treatment on head and neck cancers, as well as to further study the safety of this treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abraxane in Combination With Carboplatin, Erbitux and IMRT for Locally Advanced Squamous Cancer of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1. Phase I—To identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of Abraxane given with carboplatin plus concurrent IMRT (AC-RT) 2. Phase II—To evaluate efficacy in the phase II portion of the study by evaluating 2-year disease-free survival Secondary Objectives 1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability 2. To estimate the overall response rate 3. To estimate 2-year overall survival 4. To evaluate functional outcome at 2 years with respect to speech, swallowing and overall quality of life (QoL), by determining mean duration of PEG-dependence and change in FACT-HN scores from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. STATISTICAL DESIGN: The Phase I study followed a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Four potential dose levels of Abraxane ultimately were under evaluation including a de-escalation dose level -1. [Note: Erbitux was originally planned to be given with carboplatin and Abraxane, but removed due to toxicity experienced at dose level 1.] The DLT observation period is the 7 weeks of treatment. The Phase I incorporated a10-patient expansion cohort to ensure that the toxicity at the MTD for AC-RT was acceptable. Planned enrollment for the Phase II study was 34 patients primarily to test whether 2-year disease-free survival was consistent with 75% rate as opposed to the null hypothesis of 53.5% based on prior research (RTOG 99-14).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of th head and neck or its variants. Primary tumor sites eligible include nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or unknown primary SSCHN. Although they have squamous histology, tumors of the skin, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are excluded because their responsiveness to chemotherapy and radiotherapy may differ. Stage III or IV disease, without evidence of distant metastasis, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Measurable disease, according to RECIST. Treatmentnaive SSCHN, i.e. no prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy or attempted complete resection. &lt; CTCAE v3.0 Grade 2 neuropathy 18 years of age or older ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 No active alcohol addiction or other condition that, in the opinion of the study investigators, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the treatment plan. Lab values as outlined in the protocol Negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women and men of childbearing potential not willing to use adequate contraception while receiving treatment and for at least 6 months thereafter. Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or greater by CTCAE v3.0 History of other malignancy within the previous 5 years, except for nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, bladder or head and neck. Prior therapeutic radiation to the head and neck Other serious illness or medical conditions, including but not limited to: unstable cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry; history of significant neurologic disorder, including advanced dementia or uncontrolled seizure disorder; clinically significant uncontrolled infection; active peptic ulcer disease defined as unhealed or clinically active ulcer; hypercalcemia; active drug addiction including cocaine or intravenous drug use, defined as occuring within 6 months preceding diagnosis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; autoimmune disease requiring active therapy; severe psoriasis; chronic uncontrolled diarrhea. Patients who experienced involuntary weight loss of more than 20% of their body weight in the two months preceding study entry Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy Prior therapy that targets the EGFR pathway Participation in an investigational drug trial within 30 days of study entry</criteria>
