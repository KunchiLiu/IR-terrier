	<brief_title>The Effect of Valproate on Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Severity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Finland, 90% of subjects with opioid dependence are dependent on benzodiazepines too. Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines has increasingly caused deaths. Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment usually comprises gradual drug discontinuation. In one study, valproate was shown to improve benzodiazepine discontinuation success in chronic benzodiazepine users. In the present study, the effectiveness of gradual benzodiazepine discontinuation combined with valproate treatment and carried out in an inpatient setting is compared with gradual discontinuation without pharmacological augmentation.</detailed_description>
