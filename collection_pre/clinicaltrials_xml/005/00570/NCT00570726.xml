	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety in the use of Ranibizumab, an effective vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF) inhibitor, in treating patients with a failing bleb, characterized by increased fibrosis and vascularization of the conjuctiva, following trabeculectomy. Six subjects from one site will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>
