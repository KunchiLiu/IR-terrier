	<brief_title>Left Atrial Volume and Function Evaluation in Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have been suggesting that Obstructive Sleep Apnea contributes to deterioration of left ventricular diastolic function . It may lead to atrial myocardium stretching and enlargement which may be associated to increased risk of cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that morphological and functional LA changes might be found using three dimensional echo, and that such alterations are related to obstructive sleep apnea presence.</detailed_description>
