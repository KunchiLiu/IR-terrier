	<brief_summary>Combination regimens of 3 active drugs have shown promising activity in treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. Docetaxel combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (FU) yielded superior overall survival and response rates when compared to standard cisplatin and 5-FU. However, a toxicity profile showed the need for development of less toxic modifications. In a prior phase I trial, the maximum tolerated dose was defined. In this phase II trial, a first evaluation of activity will be performed.</brief_summary>
