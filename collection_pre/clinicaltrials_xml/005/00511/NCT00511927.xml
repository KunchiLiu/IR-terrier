	<brief_title>Growth Hormone Deficiency in Chronic Heart Failure: an Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone and its main effector IGF-1 have well-documented roles in the regulation of cardiac and circulatory function. Evidence suggests that GH/IGF-1 exert a beneficial effect on cardiac load, cardiac growth and remodeling, despite their hypertrophying action. Several studies in the last years have demonstrated worse cardiovascular outcomes in adult patients with GH deficiency and/or low levels of IGF-1. A wide range of alterations in the GH/IGF-1 axis have been described to date in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF): reductions in GH levels, reductions in IGF-1 and a pattern of peripheral resistance to GH, in particular in patients with severe heart failure and cardiac cachexia. Our study hypothesis is that an actual status of GH deficiency coexists with CHF in a large percent of patients, and that it may represent a predictor of worse functional status and possibly of a worse prognosis. Aim of this study is to explore the latter hypothesis, comparing the clinical and functional evolution of patients with CHF and GHD with that of a general CHF population.</detailed_description>
