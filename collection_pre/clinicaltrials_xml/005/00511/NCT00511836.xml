	<brief_summary>This was a study of the effects of VIVITROL® on alcohol cue-induced craving and the associated brain activation patterns in alcohol-dependent adults who had recently completed alcohol detoxification and were seeking further treatment for their alcohol dependence. The study was powered to to detect whether VIVITROL attenuates or blocks the BOLD signal increases in response to alcohol-related cues. In the double-blind portion, subjects received a single administration of study drug (VIVITROL 380 mg or placebo). Subjects who completed the double-blind portion could opt to continue to the open-label portion and receive 2 additional months of treatment with VIVITROL 380 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ALK21-018: Effects of Medisorb® Naltrexone (VIVITROL®) on Alcohol Craving in Treatment-seeking, Alcohol-dependent Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The double-blind phase consisted of 6 visits over a 5- to 6-week period and included 2 telephone contacts and 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The optional open-label extension included 2 visits approximately 1 month apart. Subjects who completed both phases participated in a total of 8 scheduled visits (including 2 fMRI scans and 2 telephone contacts) over a period of up to 14 weeks. At screening, eligible, consenting subjects were given an Actiwatch®-Score device. They were instructed to record their alcohol craving using this device throughout the double-blind phase. The Actiwatch was programmed to beep every 3 hours ±20 minutes, thereby signaling the subjects to enter their craving or desire to use alcohol, at that exact moment, on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 0 being no craving at all and 10 being extreme craving). In addition, subjects entered any drug and/or alcohol use at the time of occurrence. The Actiwatch was not utilized in the open-label portion of the study.</detailed_description>
