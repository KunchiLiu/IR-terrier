	<brief_title>Effects of Cocoa Products on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies carried out during the last decades have demonstrated of conclusive form that foods like nuts, products like cocoa or other ingredients, to be consumed of isolated form or when taking several from integrated them in a same diet can contribute to the prevention or the treatment of the cardiovascular diseases. The study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel multi-center study in which the 4 different types of cocoa products [1)cocoa and other ingredients (sugar and vegetal oils), 2)cocoa plus hazelnuts and other ingredients, 3)the same as 2 plus other ingredient and 4) cocoa, hazelnuts and other ingredients called (LMN)], introduced into a calorie-balanced diet for 4 weeks with a prior stabilization period of 2 weeks in which all participants received the cocoa product type 1. Cocoa product type 1 is a control of type 2, and types 1 and 2 were controls of types 3 and 4. Cocoa products type 4 is registered as patent. The trial was conducted in Reus and 3 other cities in Catalonia (Alcover, Centelles and Vic) (Spain).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible participants had systolic blood pressure (BP) of 120 to 159 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 99 mm Hg. This range includes participants with prehypertension (systolic, 120139 mm Hg or diastolic, 8089 mm Hg) and stage 1 hypertension (systolic, 140159 mm Hg or diastolic, 9099 mm Hg). Moreover, participants' plasma LDLcholesterol concentrations were ≥ 3.35 mmol/L (≥ 130 and ≤ 189 mg/dL) and triglyceride concentrations &lt; 4 mmol/L (350 mg/dL) in the fasting state and at least one CVD risk factor such as age (men ≥45 years; women ≥55 years), cigarette smoking, low high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (&lt;1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) and &lt;1,18 mmol/L (46 mg/dL), men and women, respectively), family history of premature CVD (in male firstdegree relative &lt;55 years of age, in female firstdegree relative &lt;65 years of age. Assessed from the medical history and a complete physical examination, were plasma triglyceride concentrations ≥4 mmol/L (350 mg/dL), BMI &gt;35 kg/m2, CVD clinical events, use of lipidlowering drugs at least 2 months prior to the start of study, diabetes mellitus (at least 2 fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L (≥ 126 mg/dL), renal insufficiency, thyroid or other endocrine disease.</criteria>
