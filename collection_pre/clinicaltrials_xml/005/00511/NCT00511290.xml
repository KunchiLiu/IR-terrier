	<brief_summary>In the present study inflammatory mediators will be isolated in induced sputum and exhaled breath condensate and will be correlated with particulate matter measured in these samples.Particulate matter will be assessed by partcle size distribution method and shape analysis. The aim of the study is to perform biological monitoring in environmental and occupational diseases in a non invassive fashion.</brief_summary>
