	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Beta-blockers improve left ventricular (LV) systolic function and prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. Both carvedilol and nebivolol have hemodynamic and clinical benefits in chronic heart failure (CHF), but it is unknown whether their pleiotropic properties may play a role in different subgroups of patients with CHF. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of nebivolol and carvedilol on LV function and clinical outcome in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced LV systolic function. METHODS: 160 hypertensive CHF patients, LV ejection fraction (EF) 40% and in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol or nebivolol therapy for 24 months. At baseline and after 24 months of treatment, all patients underwent clinical evaluation: echocardiogram and 6-minute walking test.</brief_summary>
