	<brief_summary>GW842166X is being developed for the treatment and management of inflammatory pain. GW842166X is a CB2 receptor agonist and the mechanism is not fully understood, although it is thought that for the anti-inflammatory action the drug is required to cross inot the brain from the blood. This study aims to look at if the drug crosses into the brain once given orally using an imaging technique called positron emission tomography.</brief_summary>
