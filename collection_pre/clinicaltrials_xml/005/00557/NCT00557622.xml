	<brief_summary>This is a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of BRL29060A (paroxetine hydrochloride hydrate, hereafter paroxetine) administered orally over the dose range of 20 mg to 50 mg once daily after supper for 12 weeks in Japanese patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as assessed by the change from baseline in CAPS-SX total score. Also the effect of paroxetine on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by subthreshold emotional arousing (or symptom stimulating) tasks will be determined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for exploratory assessment of the correlation between the change in rCBF and the efficacy. The sample size is 30 subjects. The study period consists of 4 weeks of run-in phase, 12 weeks of treatment phase, 0-3 weeks of taper phase and follow-up examination at 2 weeks after the last dose, for a total of 18-21 weeks. Subjects will visit the clinic at the start of run-in phase, Week -2, the start of treatment phase, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 of treatment, and follow-up examination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who are primarily diagnosed with PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: 309.81) using DSMIVTR criteria. The CAPSDX (ClinicianAdministered PTSD ScaleDX) and M.I.N.I. (The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Japanese version 5.0.0. [2003]) will be used for diagnosis Pathologic condition: Patients who experienced a motor vehicle accident (MVA) with severe or potential severe physical injury more than 3 months ago but less than 12 months ago Patients aged 20 and &lt;65 at the time of signing the Informed consent Male and female patients Inpatient/outpatient status: Both are permitted Patients who are able to give written informed consent in person (i.e., patients who are capable of giving written informed consent on their own) Patients whose combined score of the CAPSSX standard B, C, and D is over 50 Patients primarily diagnosed with a DSMIVTR Axis I disorder other than PTSD (e.g. major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, specific phobia [simple phobia], obsessivecompulsive disorder, panic disorder, etc.) within 6 months of week 4 (start of baseline phase) Patients presenting with a current major depressive episode that preceded the diagnosis of PTSD Patients receiving disability payments due to PTSD or other psychiatric diseases Patients currently engaged in compensation litigation whereby personal gain would be achieved from prolonged symptoms of PTSD or any other psychiatric disorders Patients who meet the DSMIVTR criteria for substance abuse or dependence (alcohol or drugs) within 6 months of Week 4 (start of baseline phase) Patients with history of a suicide attempt within 6 months before Week 4 (start of baseline phase), or have, in the opinion of the investigator, "C. high risk of suicide" according to the MINI at Week 4 Patients who are pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential and are likely to become pregnant Patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) prior to Week 4 (start of baseline phase) Patients receiving another investigational product within 12 weeks before Week 4 (start of baseline phase) Patients with a history or complication of manic psychosis Patients with a history or complication of convulsive disorder (epilepsy, etc.) Patients with a diagnosis or complication of a cognitive disorder (MMSE &lt;=24 points) Patients with a history and complication of serious cerebral organic disorder. (e.g. cerebrovascular disorder, meningitis, degenerative disease and other neurological disorders and seizures; however, bleeding in the upper arachnoid membrane should not be excluded) Patients unable or unwilling to undergo the fMRI procedure (e.g., cerebrovascular clipping surgery, pacemaker, any internal metals with magnetism, and claustrophobia) Patients with glaucoma Patients with a known tendency for bleeding or those with predisposing conditions Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to paroxetine Patients with serious physical symptoms (cardiac, hepatic and renal dysfunction, or hematopoietic dysfunction, etc.). For seriousness, Grade 3 of "Criteria for seriousness of adverse reactions to drugs, etc. (Yakuan No.80)" is used as an index Patients with a history or complication of cancer or malignant tumour Patients with chronic hepatitis type B and/or C which is positive of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis C antibody Others whom the investigator or subinvestigator considers ineligible for or unable to participate in the investigation Criteria at Week 0 (start of Treatment Phase): Subjects whose drug compliance rate for Drug 1 (Runin Phase placebo) is &lt;80% between Week 4 and Week 0; Subjects whose CAPSSX total score of the standard B, C, and D at Week 0 varied by 25% or more compared with those at Week 2</criteria>
