	<brief_title>The Effect of rhDNase on Ventilation Inhomogeneity in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life expectancy in CF patients has greatly increased due to improved clinical care. While this is certainly beneficial to CF patients, it has made it more difficult to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions. Currently, FEV1 remains the primary outcome parameter for most clinical trials, but many CF patients have normal pulmonary function and the annual rate of decline is now less than 2 %. Therefore, additional parameters are needed that are more sensitive to define abnormalities in CF patients and that can be used in therapeutic trials. Gas mixing techniques have been shown to be sensitive parameters to define abnormalities in patients with cystic fibrosis, but it is unclear how useful this technique is to detect changes after a therapeutic intervention. Abnormalities in gas clearance from the lung are largely due to retention of inhaled gases due to mucous obstruction in the lower airways and can be assessed with the lung clearance index (LCI). Interventions that improve mucous accumulation are expected to improve lung clearance as assessed by this technique. RhDNase has been demonstrated to improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis due to improved mucus clearance. Lung clearance index (LCI) has been shown to be more sensitive than spirometry in detecting abnormalities in CF patients. Clear cut-offs have been found which can differentiate normal patients from even newly diagnosed CF patients. However, little is known about how LCI may change with treatment.</detailed_description>
