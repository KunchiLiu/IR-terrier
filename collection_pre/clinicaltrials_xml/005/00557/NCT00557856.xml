	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of PF-03446962 when given as a single agent. Tumors require new blood vessels to support their ability to grow and to spread (metastasize). New treatments aimed at preventing these blood vessels have the ability to improve the clinical management of cancer.</brief_summary>
