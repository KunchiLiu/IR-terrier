	<brief_title>Safety and Feasibility of the Injectable BL-1040 Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ENDPOINTS Preliminary safety endpoints Occurrence of all adverse events including but not limited to All MIs Cardiovascular hospitalization Serious ventricular arrhythmias sustained: VT (symptomatic or sustained VT [duration longer than 30 seconds or 100 beats, or associated with hemodynamic collapse]) VF symptomatic bradycardia, pauses of longer than 3.0 seconds, complete atrioventricular block, Mobitz II atrioventricular block Symptomatic heart failure (NYHA criteria + physical examination OR hospitalization due to heart failure) Renal failure Stroke Death Secondary safety endpoints Change from baseline in LV dimensions (end-systolic volume index, end-diastolic volume index) Change from baseline in regional (infarct related) and global wall motion score Change from baseline in ejection fraction Cardiac rupture NT-proBNP</detailed_description>
