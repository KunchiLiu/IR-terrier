	<brief_summary>The von Willebrand Disease Prophylaxis Network (VWD PN) is an international study group formed with the goal of investigating the role of prophylaxis in clinically severe VWD that is non-responsive to other treatment(s).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) International Prophylaxis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most common indications for vWD prophylaxis included joint bleeding, epistaxis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and menorrhagia. Thus, an effort to establish optimal treatment regimens for these indications, through a period of prospective evaluation, is the primary focus of this research. Other goals include a retrospective study of the effect of prophylaxis on bleeding frequency, and a retrospective natural history study of GI bleeding in VWD.</detailed_description>
