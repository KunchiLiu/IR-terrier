	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use imaging technologies to demonstrate the effects of teriparatide on bone structure following 18 to 24 months of therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Using Imaging Technology to Measure Changes in Bone Structure After Treatment With Teriparatide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As teriparatide is approved for up to 24 months of treatment in the US, patients will be given the option to continue in a 6-month extension phase upon completion of 18 months of teriparatide treatment. This extension will allow for collection of additional bone quality data. In Canada, the use of teriparatide is currently approved for 18 months. Patients in Canada may be given the opportunity to participate in the 6-month extension phase, contingent upon Health Canada approval of the use of teriparatide treatment for 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>postmenopausal (after the "change of life") women with osteoporosis between the ages of 4585 have low bone mass as determined by a bone density test have at least one prior atraumatic vertebral or nonvertebral fracture(with a Tscore of 2.0 or lower at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck) or, no prior fracture (with a Tscore of 3.0 or lower at these same sites) could have taken up to 5 years total of certain oral osteoporosis medications such as alendronate, risedronate, or ibandronate have conditions that would affect the bone in the region of the wrist or have had a previous fracture of either wrist which might affect results of study have a metal implant or have had a hip replacement in either hip which might affect results of study have an increased risk of osteosarcoma; includes Paget's disease of bone, a previous bone tumor, or xray treatment to the skeleton currently have active or suspected diseases that affect the bone, other than osteoporosis have abnormal levels of calcium, parathyroid hormone in blood, or other laboratory values</criteria>
