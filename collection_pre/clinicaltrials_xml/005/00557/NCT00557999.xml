	<brief_summary>The following objectives were used for comparison: 1) primary objective: reintubation rate during hospitalization; 2) secondary objectives: length of hospitalization at the Coronary Care Unit; time from intubation to start of weaning; time from start of weaning to extubation; time from SBT and extubation; presence of respiratory infection in patients requiring reintubation; mortality of patients requiring reintubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Protocol in the Coronary Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once the cause leading to the need of MV was resolved, patients from both groups underwent a daily clinical evaluation in the mornings, to determine whether they were ready for mechanical ventilation weaning, according to the following clinical SBT criteria: 1) Cause of MV: resolution of the cause and abnormalities leading to MV; 2) neurological stability: patient awake, without or with minimal infusion of sedatives/narcotics, with effective cough and Glasgow scale ≥ 9; 3) cardiovascular stability: mean blood pressure (MBP) ≥ 60 mm Hg, without vasopressors or with low vasopressor doses, heart rate (HR) ≤ 140 / min, hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 8,0 - 10,0 g/L, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) ≥ 60 mm Hg with fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 0.4, oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2) ≥ 150 - 300 without significant respiratory acidosis; 4) metabolic stability: temperature &lt; 37.8° C (armpit) and lack of hydroelectrolytic disorders.</detailed_description>
