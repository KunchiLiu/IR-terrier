	<criteria>Informed consent Male or female, at least 18 years old Documented medical history of asthma (diagnosis at least 6 months ago) Nonsmoker or at least stopped for 1 year (in case smoked earlier: maximum of 10 packyears) Able to conduct a technically acceptable spirometry, methacholine and neurokininA provocation test. At visit 1: PC20 methacholine ≤ 8 mg/ml AND ≤ 3.3x107 mol/ml for the neurokininA provocation test. At visit 1: forced expiratory value in one second &gt;= 80% of the predicted value. Female subjects may not get pregnant and should be using adequate contraception. Airway infection within 6 weeks prior to first study visit. Other respiratory diseases (eg COPD, lung cancer, etc.) Participating in another clinical trial. Clinically relevant systemic diseases, other than asthma. Clinically significant laboratory deviations. Alcohol or drug abuse. Female subjects who are lactating.</criteria>
