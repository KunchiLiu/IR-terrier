	<brief_summary>- Severe post-traumatic hypoxia is mainly due to lung contusion. The intubation rate of these patients is near 20%. - Treatment before intubation is needed, is based on pain control with epidural anesthesia and oxygen. - The investigators' hypothesis is that adding non-invasive mechanical ventilation to the standard treatment can reduce the intubation rate if applied early in the course of the disease. - As thoracic trauma is often associated with injuries in other body regions that may increase the complications of the technique, specific contraindications have been described.</brief_summary>
