	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a dose-escalation regimen (400 to 800mg bid) relative to the standard dosing regimen (400mg bid) of sorafenib given in patients with metastatic RCC. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of the dose-escalation regimen on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with metastatic RCC and to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of a dose-escalation regimen of sorafenib in patients with metastatic RCC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 years old. Diagnosis of unresectable/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Nonclear cell histology is permitted (except for medullary, collecting duct, or sarcomatoid &gt;50% of specimen). Prior metastasectomy is permitted as long as there is measurable disease at time of consent. Karnofsky Performance Status of 50% or greater at study entry. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following: o Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL. o ANC ≥ 1500/mm3. o Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3. o Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN. o ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 × ULN (≤ 5 × ULN for patients with liver involvement). o Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active men must agree to use adequate barrier contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least three months after the last administration of sorafenib. INR &lt; 1.5 or a PT/ PTT within normal limits. Patients receiving anticoagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin may be allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation of sorafenib and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of care, until INR is stable. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. Prior systemic anticancer treatment for metastatic disease, including investigational therapy. Prior treatment with bevacizumab, sunitinib, or sorafenib even in the adjuvant setting. Prior cytokine therapy with interleukin (IL)2 or interferon (IFN) for metastatic disease. Active malignancy other than RCC (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) within 5 years of enrollment. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Treatment with radiotherapy within 2 weeks of enrollment. Cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure Class II or higher per NYHA. Patients must not have unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Uncontrolled CNS metastases. All patients must undergo a CT) scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis. Patients with adequately treated CNS disease may be considered for participation as long as the first dose of sorafenib is 4 weeks after completion of CNS therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as SBP &gt; 150 mmHg or DBP &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management. Active clinically serious infection &gt; Grade 2 per the CTCAE v3. Thrombolic or embolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks within the past 6 months. Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ Grade 2 per CTCAE v3.0 within 4 weeks of administration of the first dose of study drug. Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ Grade 3 per CTCAE v3.0 within 4 weeks of administration of the first dose of study drug. Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of administration of the first study drug dose. Use of St. John's Wort, rifampin (rifampicin), phenytoin, Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, dexamethasone. Known or suspected allergy to sorafenib or any agent given in the course of this trial. Any condition that impairs patient's ability to swallow whole pills. Any malabsorption problem. Pregnancy or lactation.</criteria>
