	<brief_summary>Sometime osseous reconstruction needs allogeneic bone, in this study we use Ostéopure™ from Ostéobanque d'Auvergne, which is a osseous matrix. However Ostéopure™ integration lasts a long time. To optimize this integration we purpose to associate mesenchymal progenitors cells from autologous bone marrow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osseous Setting Improvement With Co-implantation of Osseous Matrix and Mesenchymal Progenitors Cells From Autologous Bone Marrow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will be treated for tibia or femur pseudo-arthrosis. At the beginning of chirurgical intervention, autologous bone marrow will be sampling and will be concentrated during this one. Meanwhile osseous matrix (Ostéopure™ ) will be incubated in autologous blood serum and finally implanted in the fracture site. And after (at the end of chirurgical intervention), concentrate autologous bone marrow will be injected in the same place.</detailed_description>
