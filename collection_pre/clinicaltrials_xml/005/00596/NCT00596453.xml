	<brief_summary>Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate infections, including prostate infections. It has been suggested that antibiotic treatment influences PSA levels due to the fact that an increase in PSA levels may be caused by inflammation or swelling of the prostate. Antibiotics are used to treat such inflammatory conditions. However, it has not been proven that antibiotics can be used to lower PSA. This research is being done to see if treatment with the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride affects the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test. This study may also help doctors in deciding which patients need a prostate biopsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Antibiotic Treatment on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is directed towards men who have been referred to the Urology clinic at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center in Baltimore, MD. If a patient fits the eligibility criteria and signs a consent form, the patient will have his blood drawn for the first PSA measurement. The patient must return to the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center one week later for a second PSA measurement. The patient will be randomized to receive treatment with placebo or Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride for 14 days. The patient must return to the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center at the end of the treatment cycle for the third PSA measurement. The patient will return one week later for his biopsy and fourth PSA measurement.</detailed_description>
