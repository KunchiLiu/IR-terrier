	<brief_summary>Decline in muscle function may increase risk of hip fracture and decrease quality of life. Different tests are currently used to measure muscle function but they do not work for all individuals. A test called "jumping mechanography," which measures jumping power, may be useful in more people and obtain better information. This study will help us determine whether this test is able to detect differences between muscle function in younger and older adults, as well as whether it is a safe method to use in all ages.</brief_summary>
