	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about sexual problems after treatment for ovarian cancer. At this time, we do not know how many women have sexual problems after they are treated for ovarian cancer. How common are sexual problems after treatment for ovarian cancer? - What factors make women more likely to have sexual problems after treatment for ovarian cancer? - What happens to sexual functioning over the first 12 months after treatment? ie. Does it get better or worse? â€¢ Does referral to a specialized sexual health clinic help?</brief_summary>
