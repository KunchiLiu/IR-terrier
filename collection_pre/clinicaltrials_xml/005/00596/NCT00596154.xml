	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of this new treatment offered in this study. PCNSL can be cured in less than half of patients with standard treatment, a combination of chemotherapy and brain radiation. Also, the combination of chemotherapy and brain radiation may result in serious lasting side effects. Most patients older than age 60 develop memory problems, difficulty walking or inability to control their bladder. Some patients younger than age 60 also develop these side effects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have nonHodgkin's lymphoma involving the brain, as demonstrated by CT or MRI and histologic confirmation by one of the following: A positive CSF cytology for lymphoma or a monoclonal lymphocyte population as defined by cell surface markers.

Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during treatment and for six months after completion of treatment. Patients must be between 18 and 72 yearsold. Patients must sign an informed consent.
