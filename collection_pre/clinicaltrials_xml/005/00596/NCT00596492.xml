	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that DYME is safe and effective as a drug to facilitate continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) by selectively staining the anterior capsule. Secondary objectives are to compare the safety and effectiveness of DYME to that of a smaller dose of the same API.</brief_summary>
