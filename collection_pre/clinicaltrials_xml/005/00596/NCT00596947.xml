	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to determine if rapid discontinuation of corticosteroids (also known as prednisone withdrawal) and maintenance immunosuppression with Prograf (tacrolimus) and CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) while using Thymoglobulin (Rabbit antithymocyte globulin) will give similar safety and efficacy results compared to continuation of corticosteroids (also known as prednisone maintenance) and standard maintenance immunosuppression with Prograf (tacrolimus), CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) while using Thymoglobulin (Rabbit antithymocyte globulin).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prednisone Withdrawal Versus Prednisone Maintenance After Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids (one specific type is prednisone) have been used in clinical transplantation for more than 30 years. There are many side effects of corticosteroids including significant bone disease, diabetes (elevated blood sugar levels), fluid retention and hypertension (high blood pressure), psychosis, peptic ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia (elevated lipid levels such as cholesterol and triglycerides), obesity (overweight), acne, and susceptibility to infections. It is hoped that the new generation of potent immunosuppressive medications (such as Prograf and CellCept) will permit avoidance or withdrawal of corticosteroids for the majority of patients to avoid both short- and long-term complications of corticosteroid use in kidney transplant recipients.</detailed_description>
