	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how women who have had or now have ovarian cancer are doing 5 years or more from their diagnosis. We want to learn about general quality of life, long-term side effects of treatment, sexual function, thinking, memory, and psychological effects (such as anxiety and depression). We will also look at how these women are being followed for ovarian cancer. We hope this study will help us better understand how women surviving ovarian cancer are doing.</brief_summary>
