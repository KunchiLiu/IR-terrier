	<brief_summary>High blood glucose levels in surgical patients with diabetes are associated with increased risk of medical complications and death. Improved glucose control with insulin injections may improve clinical outcome and prevent some of the hospital complications. In patients who have undergone surgery, high blood glucose increases the risk of wound infection, kidney failure and death. It is not known; however, what is the best insulin regimen in patients who will undergo surgery. The use of repeated injections of regular insulin is commonly used for glucose control in hospitalized patients with diabetes. Recently, the combination of Lantus® and Apidra® insulins has been shown to improve glucose control with lower rate of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). We hypothesize that in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to general surgery wards, treatment with once daily glargine (Lantus) plus supplemental glulisine insulin (Apidra®) will produce better glycemic control and a lower rate of hospital complications than treatment with regular insulin per sliding scale (SSRI). The present study aims to determine which insulin treatment is best for glucose control in hospitalized patients with diabetes. Glargine and glulisine insulins are approved for use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA. Subjects included in the study will have type 2 diabetes and be admitted to Grady Memorial Hospital, Veterans Administration Medical Center, and Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. A total of ~94 patients will be recruited at each institution. A post-hoc cost analysis of hospitalization costs and charges of the Rabbit surgery trial will be completed in order to determine differences in hospitalization cost between basal bolus insulin and SSI regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males or females between the ages of 18 and 80 years admitted to a general surgery service. 2. Patients admitted for noncardiac elective or emergency surgery or trauma. 3. A known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus &gt; 3 months, receiving either diet alone or any combination of oral antidiabetic agents (sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones). 4. Subjects must have an admission blood glucose &gt; 140 mg and &lt; 400 mg/dL without laboratory evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate &lt; 18 mEq/L or positive serum or urinary ketones). 1. Subjects with increased blood glucose concentration, but without a known history of diabetes (stress hyperglycemia). 2. Subjects with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or ketonuria. 3. Acute critical illness or CABG surgery expected to require prolonged admission to a critical care unit (ICU, CCU, SICU, Neuro ICU). 4. Patients with clinically relevant hepatic disease or impaired renal function, as shown by a serum creatinine ≥ 3.5 mg/dl. 5. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. 6. Female subjects are pregnant or breast feeding at time of enrollment into the study.</criteria>
