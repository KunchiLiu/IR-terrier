	<brief_summary>The researchers' long-term goal is to develop a small implantable device that can continually monitor glucose levels. This will be an antenna. Changes in the glucose levels in will affect the antenna signals and those can be used to predict the patient's glucose levels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our goal is to develop a small size implantable device that can continually monitor glucose levels. The scientific objective of this application is to examine the efficacy of using implantable antennas to measure the glucose levels. The central hypothesis of this application is that the changes in the glucose levels in the medium surrounding the antenna will affect the antenna parameters such as input impedance and resonance frequency, and these changes can be used to predict the patient's glucose levels. We have formulated this hypothesis on the basis of our preliminary data, which will be detailed later, in the Preliminary Studies section. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once the correlation between the glucose levels and antenna parameters are determined, the design of a miniaturized long term glucose monitoring device will become a reality.</detailed_description>
