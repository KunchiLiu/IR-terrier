	<brief_title>RECOVER I Impella RECOVER LP/LD 5.0 Support System Safety and Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate that the device is safe and potentially efficacious for use as a left ventricular cardiac assist device for postcardiotomy patients who require hemodynamic support post weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Postcardiotomy patients, weaned from a cardiopulmonary bypass system (CPB) in need for hemodynamic support due to ineffective standard medical therapy will be considered for enrollment. An attempt shall be made to reverse the hemodynamic situation with medications (e.g. inotropes, vasopressors). The IMPELLA RECOVER LP/LD 5.0 will be implanted by the surgeon when no improvement in hemodynamics is observed.</detailed_description>
