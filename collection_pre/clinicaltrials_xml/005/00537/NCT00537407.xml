	<brief_summary>Debio 025 (alisporivir) is an oral cyclophilin inhibitor with a new mechanism of action demonstrating potent anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity in pre-clinical models and patients. The current standard of care (SOC) in HCV patients consists of a combination of peg-IFN alpha and ribavirin. Treatment duration and ribavirin dose depend on the genotype treated. Only 40-50% of patients with genotype 1 achieve a sustained viral response (SVR). This study assesses whether Debio 025 administered in combination with peg-IFN alpha 2a and ribavirin can improve the outcome of treatment in this group of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Debio 025 in Combination With PegIFN Alpha-2a and Ribavirin in Chronic HCV Patients Non-responders to Standard Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized, 5 arm parallel-group, multiple dose study in 50 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 non-responders to standard treatment with peg-IFN alpha (2a or 2b) and ribavirin. The entire study lasts a maximum of 96 weeks and consists of a 48- or 72-week treatment period (according to response). A follow-up visit to assess the sustained viral response (SVR) takes place 24 weeks after treatment cessation, i.e., at study Week 72 or 96, or earlier for discontinued study participants. There were 2 parts in the treatment period. Part 1 lasted from Day 1 to Day 29 (Weeks 1 to 4); Part 2 lasted from Week 5 to Week 48 or 72. During Part 1 of treatment (Weeks 1 to 4), participants are randomized to 1 of 5 treatment arms and receive 4 weeks of Debio 025 (alisporivir) monotherapy, Debio 025 combined with standard dose peg-IFNα2a, or 1 of 3 triple therapies combining different doses of Debio 025 with peg-IFNα2a and ribavirin at standard doses. During Part 2 of treatment (Weeks 5 to 48 or 72), participants receive standard doses of peg-IFNα2a/ribavirin dual therapy for 44 or 68 weeks, depending on their response to treatment. At Week 12, participants who do not achieve ≥ 2 log10 decrease in HCV RNA are withdrawn and considered treatment failures. Participants who have undetectable HCV RNA levels and/or ≥ 2 log10 decrease in HCV RNA continue treatment until Week 24. At Week 24, participants who still have detectable HCV RNA levels are withdrawn and considered treatment failures. Participants with undetectable HCV RNA levels at Weeks 12 and 24 continue treatment until Week 48. At Week 24, "slow responders" (defined as participants with a detectable, but &gt; 2 log10 decrease in HCV RNA levels at Week 12 and undetectable levels at Week 24) are eligible to continue treatment until Week 72.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients between 18 and 60 years of age. Hepatitis B negative and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. Diagnosed with hepatitis C genotype I and not responsive to treatments such as peginterferon alpha2a or 2b and ribavirin for at least 12 weeks. Adequate liver function (ChildPughTurcotte score A) and other laboratory parameters within acceptable range. Females may participate only if they cannot become pregnant, i.e., are surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or using 2 reliable contraceptive methods. Male patients must be surgically sterile or utilizing a barrier contraceptive method. For female patients of child bearing potential, negative pregnancy test within 1 week of first investigational product administration. Treatment with any investigational drug within 6 months prior to the start of the study. Ongoing or recent use of antiviral medication within 1 month before the start of the study. A known bad reaction or intolerance to Debio 025, peginterferon alpha2a, and/or ribavirin. Presence or history of any severe related disease.</criteria>
