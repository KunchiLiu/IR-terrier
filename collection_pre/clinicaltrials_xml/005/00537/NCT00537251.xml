	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy (in terms of metabolic control evaluated through HbA1c levels) of treatment with insulin glargine as basal insulin and insulin analogue (insulin lispro) as mealtime insulin with a regimen of insulin NPH as basal insulin with regular insulin, as mealtime insulin, after a 16 week treatment phase with each regimen and to compare the safety of both treatments, evaluated through hypoglycemic rates.</brief_summary>
