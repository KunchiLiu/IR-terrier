	<brief_title>Vivitrol for Reducing Driving While Impaired Behavior Among Repeat Offenders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to conduct an open label trial of Vivitrol in combination with an individual compliance enhancement therapy known as Medication Management Therapy (MMT) as an adjunct to Ignition Interlock in the management and treatment of DWI. Subjects will be recruited from a local Interlock provider. This program of research will collect pilot data for a study to determine whether pharmacotherapy, previously recognized as effective, can be successfully combined with existing counseling treatments and sanctions for persons convicted of a repeat DWI alcohol offense. We will investigate the extent to which this combination of sanctions and treatment will significantly decrease attempts to drive after drinking among offenders, and whether the effect persists following discontinuation of Vivitrol.</detailed_description>
