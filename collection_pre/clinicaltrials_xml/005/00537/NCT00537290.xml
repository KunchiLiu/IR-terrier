	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Rituximab for the Anticoagulation Resistant Manifestations of Antiphospholipid Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistently antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positive patients, age 18 - 75 years of age, with anticoagulation-resistant manifestations of APS and fulfilling protocol defined study inclusion criteria will receive two doses of Rituximab, and will be followed for 6 and 12 months for clinical and safety outcomes, respectively.
