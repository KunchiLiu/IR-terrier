	<brief_summary>Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are either treated for 4 weeks with a standard dose (20mg) of omeprazole, a drug of first choice, or by an individualized dosing (20 or 60mg/day) according how fast the patient can metabolize (eliminate) the drug. The individual elimination capacity is genetically controlled and therefore all patients will be genotyped prior to therapy.</brief_summary>
