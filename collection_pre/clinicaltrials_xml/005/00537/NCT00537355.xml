	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. After passing the initial Screening Visit, subjects will be in the environmental exposure chamber(EEC), a room with a controlled amount of ragweed pollen, for 4 hours each day on 4 consecutive days. At the last visit, subjects who have achieved a minimum Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) will be randomized to receive either TOLAMBA or placebo treatments. Subjects will receive 6 weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of the study drug. About three weeks after the last injection, subjects will be asked to be in the EEC for 2 consecutive days (Visits 11 and 12, Days 60 and 61). Approximately 3 weeks after Visit 12 (Day 61), the subjects will again be in the EEC for 4 consecutive days (Visits 13-16, Days 82-85). During all EEC visits, the subjects will be exposed to ragweed pollen at an average concentration of 3500 ± 500 pollen grains per cubic meter. Each EEC visit will last 4 hours. During each EEC visit, patients will be asked to record symptom scores for nasal and non-nasal symptoms at scheduled time points. The total duration of a subject's participation in this study is expected to be a minimum of 85 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of TOLAMBA™ for Ragweed-Allergic Rhinitis in an Environmental Exposure Chamber</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ragweed allergy is the most common seasonal allergy in North America. Allergen immunotherapy is a therapeutic option for patients who have allergy symptoms that cannot be adequately controlled by avoidance of the allergen or medication. It may also be appropriate for those who cannot tolerate their medications due to side effects or have difficulties with medication compliance. This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. After passing the initial Screening Visit, subjects will be in the environmental exposure chamber(EEC), a room with a controlled amount of ragweed pollen, for 4 hours each day on 4 consecutive days. At the last visit, subjects who have achieved a minimum Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) will be randomized to receive either TOLAMBA or placebo treatments. Subjects will receive 6 weekly subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of the study drug. About three weeks after the last injection, subjects will be asked to be in the EEC for 2 consecutive days (Visits 11 and 12, Days 60 and 61). Approximately 3 weeks after Visit 12 (Day 61), the subjects will again be in the EEC for 4 consecutive days (Visits 13-16, Days 82-85). During all EEC visits, the subjects will be exposed to ragweed pollen at an average concentration of 3500 ± 500 pollen grains per cubic meter. Each EEC visit will last 4 hours. During each EEC visit, patients will be asked to record symptom scores for nasal and non-nasal symptoms at scheduled time points. The total duration of a subject's participation in this study is expected to be a minimum of 85 days. Comparison: Allergy symptoms of subjects treated with TOLAMBA™ compared with subjects treated with placebo.</detailed_description>
