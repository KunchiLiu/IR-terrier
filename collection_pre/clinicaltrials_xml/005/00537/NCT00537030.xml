	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is studying the side effects of Erwinia asparaginase and what happens to the drug in the body in treating young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are allergic to PEG-asparaginase. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as Erwinia asparaginase, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erwinia Asparaginase After Allergy to PEG-Asparaginase in Treating Young Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aims 1. To determine if the 48 hour trough serum asparaginase activity is ≥0.1 IU/mL. 2. To determine the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity following Erwinase® treatment. 3. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of Erwinase in children with leukemia and allergy to PEG-asparaginase. Secondary 1. To informally compare serum asparaginase activity and plasma asparagine concentration between patients treated with Erwinase® on this trial and historical controls treated with PEG-asparaginase on CCG-1962 and 1961. 2. To determine the 72 hour serum asparaginase activity (Day 8 (pre-dose 4) if the course of Erwinase® is started on Monday; Day 13 (pre-dose 6) if the course of Erwinase® is started on Wednesday; and Day 11 (pre-dose 5) if the course of Erwinase® is started on Friday). 3. To determine the presence of anti-Erwinia asparaginase antibodies in children treated with a course(s) of Erwinase® following clinical allergy to PEG -asparaginase (PEG, pegaspargase). 4. To determine if plasma asparagine is adequately depleted (Day 12 (pre-dose 6) if the course of Erwinase® is started on Monday; Day 13 (pre-dose 6) if the course of Erwinase® is started on Wednesday or Friday) in a subset of patients. Patients receive 6 doses of Erwinia asparaginase intramuscularly (IM) on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule as a replacement for each scheduled dose of PEG-asparaginase remaining on the original treatment protocol. All other chemotherapy continues according to the original treatment protocol. Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antibody studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
