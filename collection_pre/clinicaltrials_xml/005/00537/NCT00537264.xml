	<brief_title>A Comparison of Computerised Versus Interviewer-Administered Approach for Assessing Health-Related Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are no drug treatments involved in this study. The administration of health-related quality of life questionnaires is the intervention being studied. Health-related quality of life questionnaires measure the physical, mental and social well-being of an individual, are recognised as important patient-reported outcomes and are increasingly being used in clinical trials and routine clinical practice. By asking study participants to complete a questionnaire assessing their physical, mental and social well-being, we are increasing their awareness of these aspects of their health and may directly or indirectly prompt them to take actions and/ or have thoughts that may improve or worsen their health status. Hence, we have considered this an interventional study. This survey will be conducted in Chinese.</detailed_description>
