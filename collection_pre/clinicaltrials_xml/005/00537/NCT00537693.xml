	<brief_summary>This pilot study will compare the effect of diffusive versus convective Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) in children with sepsis who require CRRT. The hypothesis for the study is that convective forms of CRRT provide enhanced clearance of cytokines and improved clinical responses as compared to a diffusive CRRT modality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that convective forms of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) provides enhanced clearance of cytokines compared to a diffusive CRRT modality. Also, we plan to test the hypothesis that patients who receive convective CRRT modalities demonstrate improved clinical responses to patients who receive a diffusive CRRT modality.</detailed_description>
