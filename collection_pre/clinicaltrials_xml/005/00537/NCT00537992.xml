	<brief_summary>Although commonly used in cataract surgery, the use of the blue light-filter IOLs in vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery has not been reported yet. A prospective controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effect of the blue light-filter IOL on the surgeon's ability to perform specific vitreoretinal procedures and on the patients' outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blue-Blocking IOLs in Combined Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive a UV-filter IOL (transparent IOL group) or a blue light-filter IOL (yellow IOL group) combined with a vitreoretinal procedure. Outcome measures were intraoperative conditions for the surgeon, complication rates, the functional outcome and vitreoretinal diagnoses.</detailed_description>
