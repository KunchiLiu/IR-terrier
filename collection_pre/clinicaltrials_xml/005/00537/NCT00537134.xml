	<brief_summary>The management of patients with unruptured aneurysms is controversial. Patients with unruptured aneurysms may suffer intracranial hemorrhage, but the incidence of this event is still debated. Endovascular treatment can prevent rupture, but involves immediate risks; furthermore, successful treatment does not eliminate all risks. A randomized trial may be the best way to demonstrate the potential benefits of endovascular over conservative management of unruptured aneurysms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial on Endovascular Aneurysm Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a pragmatic trial. All candidates for endovascular treatment of one or more unruptured intracranial aneurysms will be offered to participate. Unruptured aneurysms may be recently discovered or prevalent. If they accept, subjects will be randomized to one of the two arms of the trial: Conservative management (Observation) or Endovascular treatment. Both groups will be advised to obtain medical treatment for hypertension if necessary and will receive counselling for behavioural risk factor modelling (smoking or excessive drinking) when indicated. A non-invasive (MRA or CTA) or catheter angiogram and a baseline CT-scan or MRI of the brain are required to enter the study. These studies should demonstrate the unequivocal presence of a saccular aneurysm &gt;=3 mm treatable by endovascular methods. A catheter angiogram is required if there is doubt. Imaging studies will be reviewed centrally. Both treatments will be standardized. Patients will be followed similarly for a minimum of 10 years.</detailed_description>
