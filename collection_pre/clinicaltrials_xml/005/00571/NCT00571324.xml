	<brief_title>Effect of Exendin-(9-39) on Glycemic Control in Subjects With Congenital Hyperinsulinism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, pilot study , to determine if Exendin-(9-39), an antagonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor with effects on the pancreatic beta cells, increases fasting blood glucose levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism. Our overall hypothesis is that abnormal GLP-1 secretion resulting from dysfunctional nutrient sensing in intestinal L-cells plays a role in the dysregulated insulin secretion characteristic of this disorder, and that antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor will increase fasting blood glucose levels. Aim 1. To evaluate the dose of exendin-(9-39) required to elevate fasting blood glucose levels in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism due to KATP channel mutations. Aim 2. To determine therapeutic plasma levels, plasma half-life and pharmacokinetics of exendin-(9-39) during an intravenous short-term infusion in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism due to Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) mutations.</detailed_description>
