	<criteria>1. Patient between 18 and 80 years of age 2. Patient with documented symptomatic persistent or permanent AF and failure or intolerance of one or more Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. Persistent AF: AF that is not selfterminating or is terminated electrically or pharmacologically. Longstanding AF: Persistent AF of 12 months (or longer) duration. Permanent AF: Longstanding AF in which electrical or pharmacological cardioversion has failed or has not been attempted. 3. Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent. 4. Patient has a life expectancy of at least 2 years. 5. Patient is willing and able to attend the scheduled followup visits. 1. Prior cardiac catheter ablation for the treatment of arrhythmia within 4 months. 2. Patients who refuse, but have not failed and can tolerate antiarrhythmic medications 3. Myocardial infarction within 8 weeks. 4. Prior cardiac surgery. 5. Patient requires cardiac surgery for treatment other than for AF. 6. Class IV NYHA heart failure symptoms, unless due to uncontrolled AF 7. Cerebrovascular accident within previous 6 months 8. Known carotid artery stenosis greater than 80% 9. Evidence of significant active infection 10. Patient unable to undergo TEE 11. Pregnant woman 12. Patient requires antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmia 13. Presence of thrombus in the left atrium 14. Comorbid condition that in the opinion of the investigator poses undue risk of general anesthesia or port access cardiac surgery 15. Patient is enrolled in another cardiac clinical trial 16. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% 17. Left atrial transverse diameter &gt;6.0 18. Patient has undergone previous thoracic targeted radiation</criteria>
