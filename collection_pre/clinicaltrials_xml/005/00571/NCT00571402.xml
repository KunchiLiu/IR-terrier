	<brief_title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Family-Focused Psychoeducation in Treating Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder, also called manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes dramatic changes in a person's mood and energy. People with bipolar disorder undergo periods of extreme happiness and extreme sadness, known as episodes of mania and depression. Early onset of bipolar disorder poses an especially high health risk to affected individuals. For example, adolescents with bipolar I disorder are at increased risk for hospitalizations, social and academic deterioration, suicide, substance abuse, and nonadherence to medications. Treatment-based research for bipolar adolescents has lagged behind research for adults, particularly in the psychosocial arena. Family-focused treatment (FFT), consisting of psychoeducation about bipolar disorder for the patient and relatives, communication enhancement training, and problem-solving training, has shown promise as an effective psychosocial model. In two previous studies, FFT was found to be a useful addition to bipolar medications in treating adult bipolar I disorder. This study will test the effectiveness of FFT that is centered upon the developmental needs of adolescents with bipolar I disorder. This study will be divided into three phases. In Phases I and II, adolescent participants and their parents will be enrolled into FFT sessions; the adolescents will also be treated with medications using a clinical management manual. The first two phases will be used to revise and perfect the FFT adolescent (FFT-A) focused manual to be used in the Phase III clinical trial portion of the study. Participation in Phase III will last about 2 years. All adolescent and parent participants in Phase III will first undergo research interviews. Child-only interviews will last 2 hours and will include questions about mood problems, problems with friends or family members, and substance use history. Parent-only interviews will be conducted in two 1-hour sessions and will include questions about their child's mood and behavioral problems, treatments, and how their child's problems have affected family life. Parent participants will also be asked to assist their child in filling out a questionnaire on mood and behavioral problems and to fill out a questionnaire concerning their own history of problems with mood or anxiety. The last of the initial research interviews will be conducted at the University of Colorado's Psychology Department. Parent and child participants, as well as other relatives, will be asked to talk about problems in family life and ways to solve them. Participants will also be asked to describe pictures from inkblot cards. Next, participants in Phase III will be divided into 1 of 2 treatment groups: FFT-A plus standard bipolar medication or treatment as usual (TAU) plus standard bipolar medication. There will be a total of 25 FFT sessions over a 2-year period. The sessions will occur weekly for 12 weeks, every other week for the next 12 weeks, every month for 3 more months, and every 3 months for 1 more year. During FFT sessions, parent and adolescent participants will learn about mood disorders and ways to solve family problems. The sessions will be held at the Denver Children's Hospital, the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center's outpatient offices, or the University of Colorado's Psychology Department. Participants receiving TAU will be given an educational workbook on mood disorders and ways to cope with them as a family. TAU participants will attend three 3-hour family counseling sessions to explain the content of the workbook. The sessions will take place at the same locations as the FFT sessions. Child participants in both groups will take their prescribed medications for their bipolar disorder and will continue to see their psychiatrists on a regular basis. Repeat research interviews will occur every 3 months during the first year of the study and every 6 months during the second year of the study. Questionnaires will be distributed for children and their parents every 6 weeks during the first year of the study and every 3 months during the second year of the study. A questionnaire on the child's functioning in the school setting will also be sent to the child participant's school teacher every 3 months. Outcome assessments will be made at baseline and Months 3, 6, 9, and 12.</detailed_description>
