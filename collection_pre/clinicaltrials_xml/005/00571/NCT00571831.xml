	<brief_summary>To compare the effect on blood retinal barrier disruption 3 and 12 months after implantation of either a blue light filtering intraocular lens(blue-filtering IOL) or an ultraviolet light filtering intraocular lens(UV-filtering IOL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of a Blue Light Filtering IOL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following parameters were measured for evaluation of blood retinal barrier disruption. - the incidence of macular leakage by fluorescence angiography (FA) - the mean fluorescein concentration in the vitreous by fluorophotometry (VFP) - the thickness of the macula by optical coherence tomography (OCT) Results - the incidence fo macular leakage decreased significantly from 24%(3 months) to 5% (12 months) in the blue-filtering IOL group (P&lt;0.05), and was significantly lower compared with the UV-filtering IOL group at 12 months. - the VFP significantly decreased in both group from 3 to 12 months. - the OCT decreased from 175 (3 months) to 166 um (12 months) in the blue- filtering IOL group.</detailed_description>
