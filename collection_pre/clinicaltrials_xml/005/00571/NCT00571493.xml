	<brief_title>VELCADE®-BEAM and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, or Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To evaluate in a phase I study the toxicity and MTD of the addition of VELCADE™ (bortezomib) to a standard BEAM autologous transplant regimen. The phase II portion of the study will determine a preliminary estimate of the response rate. Secondary Objectives: To obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate to this regimen. To obtain preliminary estimates of event-free and overall survival using this regimen. Enrolled subjects will receive Velcade in combination with BEAM and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT). Phase I treatment will administer Velcade in four dose cohorts,in addition to the BEAM and AHSCT. Three patients will be accrued in each dose cohort with enrollment starting at dose cohort. These subjects will be evaluated to establish the maximum tolerated dose of Velcade in combination with BEAM autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Once established, the maximum tolerated dose will be utilized in treating an additional 20 subjects. Follow-Up: Data collected will be utilized to obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate, event-free and overall survival using this regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Persistent, relapsed or refractory indolent nonHodgkin's lymphoma (Follicular grade I, II, or III), nonHodgkin's lymphoma, composite lymphomas with ≥ 50% of tumor showing follicular histology, transformed follicular, lymphoplasmacytic, marginal zone lymphoma, small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (including Tcell subtypes), or mantle cell lymphoma that is relapsed, refractory, or in PR1 or CR1 (MCL only for CR1). Age &gt;19 years. Signed written informed consent. Expected survival duration of &gt; six months. Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70. Eligible patients must have: Liver functions &lt; 3x upper limits of normal (ULN) unless due to disease; ANC &gt; 500 cells/mm3 and Platelet Count &gt; 50 mm3. Patients &gt; age 60 or with clinical signs of heart disease must have ejection fraction ≥ 45% LVEF. Patients with clinical signs of pulmonary insufficiency must have DLCO to be measured at &gt; 50% of predicted value. Able to collect &gt; 1.2 X 106/kg CD34+ cell for transplantation. No serious disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the study. Female patients must not be pregnant or lactating. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must follow accepted birth control measures. Patients who are HIV seropositive Serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance ≤ 50ml/min Total bilirubin &gt;3 times upper limits of normal (unless due to Gilberts disease or malignancy), ALT and AST &gt;4 times the upper limits of normal Active infection at the time of transplant Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Hospital Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant. Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol. Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women.</criteria>
