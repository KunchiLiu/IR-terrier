	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of metastatic stage IV or locally advanced (unresectable) stage III cancer of any solid tumor type. Patients may have been previously treated or chemo naïve or healthy volunteer Age &gt; 18yo Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (Appendix 2) Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria: WBC ≥2000/µL Neutrophils ≥1500/µL Platelets &gt;100x103/µL Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL Creatinine &lt;2.5 x ULN AST ≤2.5 x ULN without, and ≤ 5 x ULN with hepatic metastases Bilirubin ≤2 x ULN (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) Primary Hematologic Malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma) Patients with any active infection requiring therapy (fever, localizing source) will be excluded until the infection resolves. History of, or a positive test for HIV1, HIV2, or HTLV1 serum antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C positive RNA Underlying medical condition that, in the Principal Investigator's or treating oncologist's opinion, will obscure the interpretation of the patient's safety.</criteria>
