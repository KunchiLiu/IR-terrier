	<brief_summary>Normal adolescence requires a successful resolution of identity crisis, which results in the development of satisfying relationships, success in school/work pursuits, and achievement of personal goals. Adolescents, who do not resolve this crisis, are at high risk for problems in those areas of functioning. Transference Focused Psychotherapy for Adolescents (TFP-A) is a treatment that specifically addresses these issues, permitting adolescents to develop satisfying friendships, more appropriate interactions with authority, and achieve realistic life goals. This study will evaluate the application of TFP-A, (a empirically validated treatment for adults with identity disturbance), to adolescents exhibiting the same behavioral and identity pathology. Subjects will be females; ages 14-21, with behaviors associated with identity problems, interpersonal difficulties with teachers, parents and/or peers, and live with their families. These adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment cells, TFP-A or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Subjects in TFP-A will receive weekly individual therapy for six months. The TAU group will receive standard individual therapy in the Outpatient Department. Both will receive medication as necessary. All subjects will participate in initial, weekly, and bi-monthly assessments during the six-month treatment period, and participate in a naturalistic follow-up study for an additional six months. Hypothesis: Adolescents with identity problems as seen in interpersonal, school, and/or family difficulties in the Transference Focused Psychotherapy for Adolescents (TFP-A) group will reduce these problem behaviors and improve management of their feelings and moods compared to adolescents with identity problems in the treatment as usual control group (TAU).</brief_summary>
