	<brief_summary>Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (EN-DCR) is an effective procedure when treating saccal and postsaccal obstructions of the nasolacrimal pathway. The benefit of silicone tubing after DCR is still controversial. We conducted a prospective, randomized study in order to evaluate 1) the necessity of bicanalicular silicone tubes after primary EN-DCR, 2) efficacy of the perioperative Mitomycin C for the prevention of adheesion and re-stenosis of rhinostomy site in revision EN-DCR, 3) the subjective symptoms and QoL changes before and after DCR-operation.</brief_summary>
