	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C using peginterferon alpha-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin (Copegus) to those same medications plus a dietary supplement called betaine when added for the first 12 weeks of treatment. Peginterferon alpha-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin (Copegus) are approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Betaine is a dietary supplement and occurs naturally in the body. It is not a medication regulated by the FDA or an approved drug for chronic hepatitis C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Comparison of Standard Antiviral Therapy With and Without 12 Weeks of Betaine in Genotype 1 Naive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although pegylated alpha interferon and ribavirin will likely be part of the core therapy for chronic HCV for the next several years, there are a number of complimentary antiviral agents in development including protease or polymerase inhibitors, RNA vaccines and immunomodulators (5). However, it would be unlikely to have FDA approval for any of these newer agents before the next 3 - 5 years, i.e. 2010-2012. Betaine, a naturally occurring anti-oxidant metabolite of choline and an amino acid analog (tri-methyl-glycine), serves as a methylation agent to re-methylate damaged cell proteins or enzymes (6). By virtue of its metabolic role in decreasing toxic metabolites, betaine also protects against alcohol-induced fatty liver and apoptosis. Recently, pilot studies performed both at the Mayo Clinic and here at UNMC showed its applicability as a treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver in human subjects (7, 8). Betaine has also recently been found to promote interferon function by overcoming HCV - induced inhibition of interferon signaling (9). Naturally-occurring HCV proteins during human infection can hypo-methylate proteins integral to the Jak - STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway, thereby inhibiting the antiviral activity of interferon. In cultured cells betaine administration, in a physiologically attainable concentration, restored STAT methylation and improved interferon signaling (9).</detailed_description>
