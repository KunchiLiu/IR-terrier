	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized, double-blind trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 therapeutic regimens of fentanyl administration in a population of preterm newborns of GA &lt;= 32 weeks in MV: - Group A) continuous infusion of Fentanyl + open label boluses of Fentanyl; - Group B) continuous infusion of placebo + open label boluses of Fentanyl.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the analgesic superiority of Fentanyl given as 'continuous infusion + boluses' versus 'boluses alone' by comparing pain scores obtained by the application of validated algometric scales for chronic pain (EDIN - Echelle Douleur Inconfort Nouveau-Nè) and acute pain (PIPP- Premature Infant Pain Profile). The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety equivalence of the above 2 therapeutic regimens by recording: - Rate of mechanically ventilated newborns at one week of age - Age at which neonates will reach total enteral feeding - Age (hours) of first meconium passage - Incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) or death within 28 days of life - Incidence of bladder globe during the first week of life - Incidence of hypotension during the first week of life 5.2.1 Pain measurement: during the study phase acute pain will be measured once a day during a heel prick by a validated algometric scale for acute pain (PIPP); chronic pain will be measured 3 times a day by a validated algometric scale for chronic pain (EDIN). Inter-rater reliability has been shown acceptable for both scales (26,27). Moreover, in October 2006 the Coordinating Center organized a theoretical and practical course on the correct application of the PIPP and EDIN scales (26,27) for all the participating centers in order to reduce the inter-Center variability in pain measurement. The EDIN scores will be recorded in a specific CRF (CRF N°1, p. 15). The PIPP scores will be reported in a specific CRF (CRF N° 1, pp. 8-14). 5.2.2 Painful procedures: the following painful procedures, as well as the action taken to reduce pain, will be recorded in the same CRF (CRF N° 1, pp. 8-14): - heel pricks - endotracheal aspirations - venous blood samplings - pneumothorax drainage - peripherally inserted central catheter positioning - others (specify) 5.2.3 Fentanyl open label boluses administration: all the boluses of open label fentanyl administered according to the criteria reported in paragraph 6.1.1 have to be recorded in a special CRF (CRF N° 1, p. 7). 5.2.4 Instrumental examinations: a heart ultrasound has to be obtained in all newborns in the first week of life in order to diagnose patent ductus arteriosus. Brain ultrasound has to be repeated at 4, 7 days of age and then twice a month or when clinically indicated.</detailed_description>
