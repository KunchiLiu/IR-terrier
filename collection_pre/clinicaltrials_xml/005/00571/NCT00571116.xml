	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide when given together with disulfiram in treating patients with metastatic and progressive melanoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as disulfiram and arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disulfiram Plus Arsenic Trioxide In Patients With Metastatic Melanoma and at Least One Prior Systemic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the tolerability of disulfiram and arsenic trioxide administration as a therapeutic combination. (Phase IB) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: l. Determine the response rate (complete and partial responses) and time to progression of previously treated patients with metastatic malignant melanoma when treated with disulfiram plus Arsenic Trioxide. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide. Patients receive disulfiram orally (PO) twice daily and arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on Monday through Friday, alternating two weeks on treatment followed by two weeks off treatment. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have bidimensionally measurable disease. All measurable lesions must be assessed (by physical examination, CT scan, radionuclide scan or plain Xray) within 28 days prior to registration. Nonmeasurable sites must be assessed within 42 days prior to registration. The subject's disease status must be completely assessed and reported. All subjects must undergo a CT of abdomen and chest within 28 days prior to registration. All subjects must undergo either a CT or MRI of the brain within 28 days of registration. Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible for this protocol but their metastasis must be clinically stable and asymptomatic. Subjects with Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis must have been evaluated by neurosurgery prior to entry to confirm that they are a candidate for this trial. Treatment of symptomatic CNS metastasis that is required before protocol entry. Subjects must have progressed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria after at least one prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologic/immunotherapy, or a combination regimen) for metastatic disease. This includes development of any new lesion or a 20% increase in the sum of the subject's measurable disease compared to their previous nadir. New CNS metastasis could be the reason for disease progression, but they must be stable clinically and satisfy criteria delineated in section 5.4. Prior systemic therapy must have been completed at least 28 days before registration. Subjects may have received prior biologic or immunotherapy given in an adjuvant fashion. Prior adjuvant therapy must have been completed at least 28 days prior to registration Subjects may have received prior radiation therapy. If all known sites of disease have been previously radiated, there must be objective evidence of progression for the subject to be eligible. Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 28 days before registration. Subjects may have received prior surgery. Prior surgery must have been completed at least 28 days before registration. Performance status must be 02 according to Southwest Oncology Group Criteria Performance Status: GRADE SCALE 0 Fully active; able to carry on all predisease activities without restriction. 1. Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work. 2. Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours. 3. Capable of only limited self care; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours. 4. Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self care. Totally confined to bed or chair. 5. Dead Subjects must have a normal ECG, without evidence of congestive heart failure. 1. Normal heart rate (less than 100 per minute) 2. Normal sinus rhythm 3. Normal interval from the beginning of the Q wave to the termination of the S wave, representing the time for ventricular depolarization (QRS) interval 4. Subjects with QT prolongation &gt; 500msec on their ECG will be considered ineligible. Pregnant or nursing women are not eligible to participate in this trial because the safe use of this drug in pregnancy has not been established. Subjects with severe myocardial disease or coronary occlusion, psychoses, and hypersensitivity to disulfiram or other thiuram derivatives used in pesticides and rubber vulcanization are excluded from the study. Subjects who can not abstain from alcohol intake during the entire duration of this protocol are not qualified for this study.</criteria>
