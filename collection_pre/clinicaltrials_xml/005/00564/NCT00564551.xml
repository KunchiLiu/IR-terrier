	<brief_title>Effect of Increased Intake of Low Fat Dairy Products on Weight Loss and Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity can cause many health problems as it is linked to several chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes. We know that individuals who are overweight or obese, and have impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance, have a good chance of developing type 2 diabetes. Research tells us that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be decreased by losing weight and making dietary changes. A promising area of study involves using low-fat milk products and calcium to prevent and/or control obesity and diabetes. This study is important because it will determine if including low-fat milk products in weight reducing diets can enhance weight loss, improve fat loss and decrease levels of blood glucose and insulin in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes not treated with medication. This information is directly applicable to treating diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</detailed_description>
