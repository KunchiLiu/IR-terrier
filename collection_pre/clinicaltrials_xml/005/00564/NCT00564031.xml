	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction in resistance arteries in women after the menopause is important for the development of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormonal Replacement Therapy and Small Artery Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim to study the effects of different hormone replacement therapies (HRT) on the function and morphology of resistance arteries, and to look for their mechanistic basis. We expect that HRT with estrogens or in combination with MPA may benefit the function of resistance arteries and may preserve the morphological integrity of endothelial cells by regulatory actions on the cytoskeleton.</detailed_description>
