	<brief_summary>Identify the possible mechanisms and the relative effectiveness of existing rehabilitation approaches that target upper extremity deficits of stroke patients on the ground that these approaches are based on neuroplasticity principles and sound motor control theories.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanism and Efficacy of Rehabilitation Approaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparisons of constraint-induced therapy (CIT) vs. bilateral arm training (BIT)vs. combined therapy were made. Stroke patients will receive one of these three approaches and be evaluated pre- and post-treatment. the treatment will last 3 weeks and 5 days per week. The evaluation will include clinical measures of motor function, ADL, and quality of life, kinematic performance, and activation patterns of cortex.</detailed_description>
