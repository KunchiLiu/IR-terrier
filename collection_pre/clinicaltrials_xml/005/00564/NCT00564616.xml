	<brief_title>Simulation-Based Study of Adding Video Communication to Dispatch Instruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of adult death and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) significantly improves survival. Dispatch assistance increases the chance of bystander CPR but the quality of dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR) remains unsatisfactory. This study is conducted to assess the effect of adding interactive video communication to dispatch instruction on the quality of bystander CPR, including chest compressions and rescue breathing, in simulated cardiac arrests.</detailed_description>
