	<brief_summary>Human immunodeficiency virus infection and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease: a wide range of alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism has been increasingly recognized in HIV patients treated with HAART. Few data are available on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cardiac morpho-functional characteristics and metabolic parameters in HIV patients. Aim of the study is to assess the effects of chronic therapy with angiotensin receptor blocker(candesartan)or calcium channel blocker (lercanidipine)on metabolic profile and cardiac remodelling in HIV hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
