	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare kidney function, long term patient and graft survival, and incidence of acute rejection in liver transplant recipients between one group receiving thymoglobulin induction and delayed initiation of tacrolimus and another group of liver transplant recipients having immediate administration of tacrolimus without any induction immunosuppression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal insufficiency following liver transplantation in adult recipients is a major cause of morbidity and a major contributor to mortality. One of the key factors contributing to this renal dysfunction is the use of calcineurin inhibitors. There is some evidence to suggest that the first 7-10 days following liver transplantation are crucial in terms of renal function and the ability to avoid the use of nephrotoxic agents such as calcineurin inhibitors may have a significant impact on long-term outcome.</detailed_description>
