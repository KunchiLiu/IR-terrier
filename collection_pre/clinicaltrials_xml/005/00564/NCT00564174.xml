	<brief_title>Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Aspirin in the Treatment of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss: A RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies of these therapeutic regimens in the population of recurrent pregnancy loss and autoantibodies, have not provided conclusive evidence of their efficacy due to small sample size and/or weak study design. We undertook a RCT of low molecular weight heparin plus aspirin versus aspirin alone to investigate if the low molecular weight heparin treatment resulted in an increased rate of livebirths as compared to treatment with aspirin alone.</detailed_description>
