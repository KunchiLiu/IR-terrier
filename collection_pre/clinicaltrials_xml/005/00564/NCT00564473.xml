	<brief_summary>Herbs are physiologically active substances which can significantly affect the outcome of medical treatment, either by inhibiting or promoting drug disposition or through additive and synergistic effects when used in conjunction with conventional medications. Herb-drug interactions are potentially dangerous, and may be difficult to predict since regulation of the preparations is often lacking, and patients most often do not report the use of these products to their physicians. The risk for toxic effects and adverse interactions increases among high-risk groups, such as the elderly or patients with renal or hepatic disease. The purpose of this study is to study the prevalence of use of herbal medicine among patients hospitalized in the internal medicine department of an Israeli hospital, as well as examine the effect of herbal remedies on patient health, either beneficial or harmful. For this purpose, a questionnaire evaluating demographic data, medical history (both current and past), use of and attitudes towards herbal medicine will be administered to patients in the Department of Internal Medicine at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Israel. The Beck Depression Questionnaire will be used as well.</brief_summary>
