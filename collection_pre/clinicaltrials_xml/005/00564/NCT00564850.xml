	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of triptorelin 11.25 mg pamoate in the delay of premature onset of puberty in girls less than 9 years and boys less than 10 years. This is measured by assessing the proportion of children who have a suppressed Luteinizing Hormone (LH) response to Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) test performed 3 months after injection with triptorelin 11.25 mg.</brief_summary>
