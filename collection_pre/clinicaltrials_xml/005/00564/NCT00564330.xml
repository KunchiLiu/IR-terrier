	<brief_summary>Dental erosions in 30 male and female patients with proven abnormal gastrooesophageal reflux will be assessed clinically and using a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) laser technique before and after double-blind randomization to antisecretory treatment with esomeprazole 20mg or placebo bid for 3 weeks. The primary objective is to quantify tooth substance loss as well as changes in optical reflectance and scattering of dental hard tissues with and without acid inhibition. Secondary objectives are: To compare standardised visual scoring with OCT quantification of reflux damage at the different time points on different teeth. To assess sex differences in OCT- quantified dental tissue loss.</brief_summary>
