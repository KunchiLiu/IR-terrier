	<criteria>Patient with a breast mass highly suspicious for malignancy from clinical, mammographic or sonographic examination. The study has been explained to the patient when she is scheduled for surgery. Healthy normal volunteers for imaging protocol optimization. Pregnancy Patients with implanted surgical clips (hemostatic clips) or other ferromagnetic material, Patients engaged in occupations or activities which may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic materials, or who may have imbedded metal fragments from military activities, Patients with metallic implants, because they may cause artifacts in diagnostic images due to magnetic field distortion, Patients with implanted prosthetic heart valves, Patients with pacemakers, neurostimulation devices, A breast mass with features of benign tumor The patients unwilling to participate in the study or fail to sign the consent form</criteria>
