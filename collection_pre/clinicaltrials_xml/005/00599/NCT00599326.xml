	<brief_title>Pilot Trial of Deferasirox in the Treatment of Porphyria Cutanea Tarda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phlebotomy is the standard therapy for Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT), but it can be inconvenient and cause anemia in some patients. Deferasirox is a new class of tridentate iron chelators with high affinity and selectivity for iron. The medication is administered orally, which if effective for PCT would make it a more convenient and possibly more tolerable option for patients.</detailed_description>
