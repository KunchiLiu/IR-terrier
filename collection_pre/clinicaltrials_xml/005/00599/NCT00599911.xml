	<brief_title>Dose-finding Study With Lu AA24530 in Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the World Health Organisation, Major Depressive Disorder is the leading cause of disability and the 4th leading contributor to the global burden of disease. There are unmet medical needs in the treatment of depressive disorders in terms of insufficient effectiveness and unpleasant side-effects of current therapies. The overall prognosis of the disorder is positive for the majority of patients, but as many as 30% of patients will develop a chronic and treatment-resistant depression. In the study, patients with depression are treated for 6 weeks. Assessments of efficacy and safety are taking place every week for the first 4 weeks and again after 6 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
