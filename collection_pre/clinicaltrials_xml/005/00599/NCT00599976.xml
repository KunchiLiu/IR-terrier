	<brief_summary>For patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure, current treatment can include AV nodal ablation with biventricular pacing. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a new procedure for this patient population which attempts to restore sinus rhythm. This trial is a randomized controlled trial of AVN ablation with biventricular pacing versus PVI for atrial fibrillation patients with congestive heart failure.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation with NYHA IIIII symptoms despite the use of antiarrhythmic medications. Ejection fraction was required to be ≤ 40%. Patients were required to be on a heart failure regimen that included betablockers and aceinhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for all patients and spironolactone for NYHA III patients. Patients were required to complete a 6minute walk test and to be ≥ 18 years of age. Reversible causes of AF and heart failure (HF) such as pericarditis, hyperthyroidism, valvular heart disease and tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy. Postoperative AF, previous MAZE or MAZElike surgery, previous left atrial instrumentation Life expectancy ≤ 2 years Likely cardiac transplant within the next 12 months Contraindication to antiarrhythmic medications and/or anticoagulation Severe pulmonary disease Documented intraatrial thrombus Tumor or other abnormalities which preclude catheter introduction Cardiac surgery, MI or PCI within the past three months.</criteria>
