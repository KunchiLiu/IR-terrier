	<brief_title>Stress-Reducing Interventions in HIV+ Patients: Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV+ patients will be randomized to receive either PE therapy (up to 18 possible sessions) or weekly symptom monitoring (described below) and will complete measures of PTSD, adherence, and QOL pre- and post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments.
