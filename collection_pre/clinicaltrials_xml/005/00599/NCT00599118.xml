	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish a genebank repository of blood samples and data to generate information about the hereditary (genetic) basis of atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Genetic, Biochemical and Hormonal Factors Contributing to Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood samples and data will be collected from subjects with atrial fibrillation and normal controls. The primary aim of future research using these samples is to identify mechanisms and pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Through this information, we hope to identify targets for new therapies and improve knowledge and understanding of atrial fibrillation. Identification of disease genes could improve strategies that prevent progression of atrial fibrillation to more persistent disease.</detailed_description>
