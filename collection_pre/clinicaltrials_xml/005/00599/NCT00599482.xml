	<brief_summary>Most patients with sickle-cell disease have periodic intensely painful episodes. To manage this pain, we are proposing the drinking of at least 500 mL of water followed by far infrared radiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Far Infrared Radiation for Sickle Cell Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Painful sickle cell crises are treated with hydration and analgesics. Ischemia is an absolute or relative shortage of the blood supply to an organ. Relative shortage means the mismatch of blood supply (oxygen delivery) and blood request for adequate oxygenation of tissue. It is hereby postulated that far infrared radiation of the body will promote blood and oxygen supply to the affected tissues. In addition, the analgesic properties of far infrared will alleviate pain due to the crisis.</detailed_description>
