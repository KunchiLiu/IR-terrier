	<brief_title>MAKE IT CLEAN, Impact of Pocket Revision on the Rate of Infection and Other Complications in Patients Requiring Pocket Manipulation for Generator Replacement and/or Lead Replacement or Revision: A Prospective Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, prospective, single-blind study that evaluates the effect of removal of scar tissue during pacemaker/ICD pocket revision on infection and complications. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either removal of the scar tissue surrounding the implanted device during device replacement or to device replacement without removal of this tissue. Subjects will be followed for one year post-procedure for the occurrence of infection, bleeding/hematoma, or other complications.</detailed_description>
