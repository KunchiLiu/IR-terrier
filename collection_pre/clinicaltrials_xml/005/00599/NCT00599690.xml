	<brief_title>Epi-LASIK : A Confocal Microscopy Analysis of the Corneal Epithelium and Anterior Stroma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 eyes of 10 patients underwent epi-LASK, epithelial flaps were created with the Amadeus II, epi-LASIK-LASIK microkeratome (Ziemer ophthalmics systems AG, Switzerland). A Visx star 4 system (Visx, Santa Ana, CA, USA) was used to perform the laser ablation in all eyes. A central scan of the total corneal thickness was taken with the confocal microscope (Confoscan 4, Fortune Technologies, Italy) before and at 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery. Corneal epithelial thickness and the Anterior stroma morphology were analyzed by using the NAVIS software V. 3.5.0 (NIDEK, Multi-Instrument Diagnostic System, Japan).</detailed_description>
