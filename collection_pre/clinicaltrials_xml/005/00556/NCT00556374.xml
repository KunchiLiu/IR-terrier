	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether denosumab compared to placebo, will reduce the rate of first clinical fracture in women with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving (non-steroidal) aromatase inhibitor therapy. Subjects who receive open-label denosumab will be followed-up until completion of 36 months of treatment. Subject not receiving treatment in the open label phase will be followed for approximately 66 months after Primary analysis data cut-off date (PADCD).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Double Blinded Phase: Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast; Female subjects with nonmetastatic disease who are estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and who have completed their treatment pathway; Subjects who are currently on, or will initiate an approved nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy (eg, anastrazole) in the adjuvant setting; Postmenopausal woman, defined as a woman fulfilling any one of the following criteria: Having undergone a bilateral oophorectomy; Age â‰¥ 60 years; Aged &lt; 60 years meeting the following requirements: Folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol in the postmenopausal range; A negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization. Subjects who have undergone a hysterectomy do not require a pregnancy test. More criteria may apply. Exclusion Criteria for Double Blinded Phase: Aromatase inhibitor therapy for more than 24 months; Prior or concurrent treatment with Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (eg, tamoxifen); Evidence of metastatic disease; Current or prior intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate administration; Oral bisphosphonate treatment greater than or equal to 3 years continuously OR greater than 3 months but less than 3 years unless there was a washout period of at least 1 year prior to randomization OR any use during the 3month period prior to randomization; Prior administration of denosumab; Known liver or renal deficiency; Recurrence of the primary malignancy (e.g., during the allowed interval of pretreatment with aromatase inhibitor); Diagnosis of any second nonbreast malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or for in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri; Any kind of disorder that compromises the ability to give written informed consent and/or comply with study procedures. Inclusion Criteria to Receive Openlabel Phase Denosumab: Obtain signed and dated written informed consent prior to performing any studyspecific procedure; Subjects currently taking an approved nonsteroidal AIT (eg, anastrazole) or who have completed or discontinued AIT within 12 months prior to participation in the OLP; Randomized to placebo arm during the doubleblind phase (as determined by unblinding procedures); Exclusion Criteria to Receive Openlabel Phase Denosumab: Current or prior IV bisphosphonate administration; Subjects meeting the following criteria for oral bisphosphonate treatment: Greater than or equal to 3 years continuously, Greater than 3 months but less than 3 years unless subject has had a washout period of at least 1 year prior to participation in the OLP, Any use during the 3month period prior to participation in the OLP; Prior or concurrent treatment with SERMs (eg, tamoxifen); Subjects who ended treatment with investigational product (IP) prematurely in the doubleblind phase; Treatment with commercial denosumab (Prolia or Xgeva) prior to participation in the OLP.</criteria>
