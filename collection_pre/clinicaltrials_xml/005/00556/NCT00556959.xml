	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of CLONICEL® to Treat Children and Adolescents With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2 adrenergic agonist that has been used effectively since the early 70s to treat mild to moderate hypertension. In addition to hypertension, clonidine has been evaluated and used extensively for several other indications, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An easy to administer clonidine formulation is needed that retains the efficacy of the current oral formulation but has an improved safety profile. The current trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of clonidine delivered from the sustained release formulation of CLONICEL in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD.</detailed_description>

If female of childbearing potential, pregnant or lactating or does not agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, such as hormonal medication, doublebarrier method, or IUD Presence of a clinically significant illness or abnormality on physical examination or clinical laboratory evaluations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would increase the safety risks from clonidine administration or interfere with the ability of the patient to take part in the study. Presence of clinically significant abnormality on centrally interpreted Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings History or presence of a concomitant psychiatric disorder requiring psychotropic medication or a severe concomitant Axis I or Axis II disorder that could interfere with study assessments in the judgment of the Principal Investigator History of concomitant conduct disorder (CD) History of seizures, except for a single episode of febrile seizure prior to age 2 History of syncopal episodes Presence of a disorder that would interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of clonidine History of intolerance to clonidine, including any dermatologic reaction to transdermal clonidine Presence or history of alcohol or drug abuse Positive drug screen, with the exception of ADHD drugs Use of any investigational drug within 30 days of study start.</criteria>
