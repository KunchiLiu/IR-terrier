	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM-700C as an add-on treatment to the combination drug therapy (Peginterferon α-2b plus Ribavirin) for patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infections. This will be demonstrated by a higher sustained virologic response rate, defined as the absence of detectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the termination of combinational drug treatment, compared with the placebo add-on.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Adding TCM-700C on the Standard Combination Treatment for Patients With Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2 study to evaluate the effects of adding a Chinese formulation (TCM-700C) on the standard combination treatment for patients with Genotype 1 hepatitis C infection. Patients were screened within 4 weeks before receive the first study drug dose. Eligible patients at baseline were stratified according to baseline HCV RNA (≤800,000 IU/ml vs &gt;800,000 IU/ml) and randomized with an equal chance to receive either TCM-700C or placebo as an add-on to the combination drug therapy. The combination drug therapy was peginterferon α-2b (PEG-INTRON®, Schering-Plough) 1.5 micrograms/kg once weekly injection for 48 weeks plus oral ribavirin (REBETOL®, Shering-Plough) 1000mg-1200mg daily for 48 weeks. The add-on treatment of TCM-700C or placebo was given 2 tablets thrice daily for 48 weeks. During the 48 week treatment period and 24 week untreated follow-up, patients were assessed at regular intervals for safety and efficacy at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and then every 8 weeks thereafter until study completion. Patients who prematurely discontinued test drug therapy had laboratory examination re-taken on the week patient was discontinued from study.</detailed_description>
