	<brief_summary>Background: Neuropsychiatric side effects (NPSEs) occur in a significant proportion of subjects after initiation of efavirenz (EFV) and may limit its use in certain patients. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence and severity of NPSEs and antiviral efficacy of EFV given as a stepped dosage over 2 weeks versus the usual dosage. Methods: Randomized, double blind, multicentric clinical trial in which a progressive dosage (arm A: 200 mg qd for 6 days, 400 mg qd for 7 days and 600 mg qd from day 14 forward) was compared with conventional administration (arm B: 600 mg qd from the first day). All patients received additional treatment with 2 NRTIs. The incidence and intensity of NPSEs and sleep disorders were assessed using a Likert-type scale specifically designed. Efficacy was assessed by percent of virological failures.</brief_summary>
