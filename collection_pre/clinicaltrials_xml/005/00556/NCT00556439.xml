	<brief_summary>Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) are diseases that cause swelling of the arteries in the head, neck, upper body, and arms. TAK specifically affects the aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, and its branches. Therapies are available to improve the symptoms of GCA and TAK, but relapse often occurs, and better treatments are needed. Abatacept is a drug that interacts with certain cells in the body that are involved with GCA and TAK. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of abatacept in treating GCA and TAK and preventing disease relapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abatacept for Treating Adults With Giant Cell Arteritis and Takayasu's Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GCA and TAK both cause inflammation in the lining of the arteries, which can interfere with the body's ability to carry oxygen to areas that need it. Symptoms of GCA include headaches, jaw pain, and blurred or double vision. Serious symptoms that occur less commonly are blindness and stroke. TAK symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthritis, and non-specific aches and pains. There may also be tenderness near affected arteries. Researchers believe that GCA and TAK are diseases that are controlled by the body's immune system. Activated T-cells, specifically, are critical to the origin and development of these diseases. Abatacept is a medication that modulates the signal required for T-cell activation. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of abatacept in treating GCA and TAK and preventing disease relapse. Participation in this study may last up to 4 years. Participants will receive abatacept intravenously on specified days during Months 1, 2, and 3. They will also receive daily prednisone, which will be started at a dose of 40 to 60mg, then tapered to 20mg by Month 3, and finally further tapered until discontinuation is reached. At Month 3, participants who have achieved remission will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to either continue abatacept or be switched to placebo infusions. Both treatments will be given once a month at study visits. Blood samples will also be collected at the monthly study visits to conduct laboratory-based studies. Participants who remain in remission will continue to receive abatacept or placebo monthly until the common closing date, defined as 12 months after enrollment of the 33rd participant for each disease.</detailed_description>
