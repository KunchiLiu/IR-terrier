	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevacizumab for Choridal Neovascularization Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conducted a retrospective study of 500 eyes with choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration who were treated with at least two (initial and one month after) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab and had a follow-up of at least 2 months.
