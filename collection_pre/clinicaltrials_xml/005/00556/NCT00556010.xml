	<brief_summary>Ankle fractures are common injuries that are being operated routinely. In order to restore the long term function and prevent arthritis of the ankle the broken fragments should be put in place precisely. Inadequate reduction can result in pain and long term disability. Recently, based on MRI studies and clinical studies, a significant number of ankle fractures are apparently fixed with less than optimal results. We suggest that the use of a new device that enables better three dimensional imaging will improve the quality of operations performed for ankle fractures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with unstable ankle fractures (as classified by the AO as 44B 44C by Lauge Hansen PER4 or SER4) amenable to open reduction and internal fixation. 2. Patients with syndesmotic rupture as evident from the injury films or during clinical testing in the OR be included in the study. 3. Intraoperative testing will include both a cotton Test and a stress view obtained after bimalleolar fixation has been attained. 4. A positive syndesmotic injury will be defined by the criteria of Pettrone et al as follows: a tib/fib clear space &gt;5mm or tib/fib overlap of &lt;10mm (on the AP view), or a tib/fib overlap of &lt;1mm on the mortise view. 1. Patients with a pilon fracture (i.e. plafond fractures AO type 43B and C) will be excluded even if associated with a fibula fracture and syndesmosis disruption. 2. Patients with contraindications to operative treatment and diabetics 3. Women of childbearing age will be excluded if they present with a positive preop Beta HCG test or if they refuse a B HCG test.</criteria>
