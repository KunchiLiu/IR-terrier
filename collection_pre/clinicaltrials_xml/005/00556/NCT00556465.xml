	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy has become the single most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. On a molecular level, at least five major pathways have been implicated in glucose-mediated vascular and renal damage and all of these could reflect a single hyperglycaemia-induced process of overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have shown that inflammation, and more specifically pro-inflammatory cytokines play a determinant role in the development of micro- vascular diabetic complications, most of the attention has been focused on the implications of TNF-Î± in the setting of diabetic nephropathy. Glutathione is the most abundant low-molecular-weight thiol, and Glutathione/ glutathione disulfide is the major redox couple in animal cells. N-acetylcysteine is effective precursors of cysteine for tissue Glutathione synthesis. Not only does N-acetylcysteine exhibit antioxidant properties, but it may also counteract the glycation cascade through the inhibition of oxidation. N-acetylcysteine can also reduce the apoptosis elicited by reactive oxygen species . Indeed, N-acetylcysteine has been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species induced mesangial apoptosis and to be able to protect cells from glucose-induced inhibition of proliferation.</brief_summary>
