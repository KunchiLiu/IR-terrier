	<brief_summary>A common soft tissue injury in sports involving sprinting and jumping is the hamstring strain. In addition to the frequency of injury, hamstring injuries are also the most recurrent soft tissue injury occurring in sport. There is a need for further research concerning diagnosis and different prognostic parameters for the rehabilitating process. The aims for this study are: A longitudinal comparison of sonographic and MRI assessments of acute and healing hamstring injuries. A study investigating different biomechanical parameters in the process of determining whether a former hamstring injured soccer player is fully rehabilitated. We hypothesize that it is possible to use electromyography, muscle strength measurements and different tests on a force platform to help determine this issue.</brief_summary>
