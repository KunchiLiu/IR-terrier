	<brief_summary>Growing evidence shows that altered blood flow plays a major role in many vision-threatening diseases including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion, and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion. Optical coherence tomography, an established imaging technique use for eye exam in clinical ophthalmology, provides high-resolution cross sectional images of the retina and has increased our ability to understand many eye diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Functional Optical Coherence Tomography for Ocular Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optical Coherence Tomography is a non-invasive technique use a broadband light source to illuminate the area of study with light in the near infrared spectrum, then obtains static images of tissue structure from interference signals of the back-reflected light. Optical Coherence Tomography a non-contact, non-invasive means of documenting both tissue structure and blood flow changes in ocular disease and can provide high resolution cross-sectional images of tissue structure, direct visualization of blood flow in blood vessels of the eye.</detailed_description>
