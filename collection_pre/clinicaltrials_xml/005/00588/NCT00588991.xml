	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, high-risk myelodysplasia, or aggressive myeloproliferative disorders. Veliparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving veliparib together with topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib and Topotecan With or Without Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia, High-Risk Myelodysplasia, or Aggressive Myeloproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxicities of ABT-888 (veliparib) when administered alone and in combination with topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, high-risk myelodysplasia, or aggressive myeloproliferative disorders. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ABT-888 when administered with topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin in these patients. III. To determine if ABT-888 when administered with topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin can induce clinical responses in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 when administered alone and in combination with topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin in these patients. II. To obtain pharmacodynamic data regarding the ability of ABT-888 to inhibit poly (ADP-ribose) levels in leukemic blasts. III. To obtain descriptive data regarding the mutational status and/or methylation status of key genes in selected DNA repair pathways (Fanconi complementation groups A-F, Blooms, and ataxia-telangiectasia) in leukemic blasts. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients receive veliparib orally twice daily on days 1-8, 1-14, or 1-21 and topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin IV continuously over 120 hours on days 3-7. Treatment repeats every 28-63 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.</detailed_description>
