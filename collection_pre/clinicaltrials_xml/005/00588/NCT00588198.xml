	<brief_title>Peripheral Blood and/or Bone Marrow, Including Detection of Occult Metastases, in Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with melanoma can succumb to subclinical metastatic disease, not detectable at presentation by conventional physical examination, hematologic and biochemical screening, or radiologic evaluation. More intensive radiologic evaluation with CT or radioisotope scanning has not proven to be useful. What may be useful is a more sensitive method of staging melanoma patients at presentation, specifically evaluating them for subclinical systemic disease.</detailed_description>
