	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the return of sensation in the breast(s) following breast mastectomy with and without reconstruction. Four different sensations: touch, vibration, superficial pain, and temperature will be evaluated. In addition, we will look at factors that may contribute to the return of breast sensations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantification of Breast Sensation Following Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study entitled "The Quantification of Breast Sensations Following Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction" will evaluate the recovery of sensation in the reconstructed as well as in the nonreconstructed breast. Touch, vibration, pain and temperature sensation will be objectively evaluated greater than 1 year following completion of reconstruction. Breast sensation following immediate, tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction will be compared with that following immediate, autogenous tissue reconstruction. A formal sensory examination will be performed. SemmesWeinstein monofilaments will evaluate touchpressure sensation in the breast. A Bioesthesiometer will determine the recovery of vibratory sensation. Temperature sensation will be evaluated by application of warm and cool stimuli. Superficial pain sensation will be evaluated by application of sharp and dull stimuli. A patient reported assessment of sensory changes in the breast will be administered to patients. The Breast Sensation Assessment Scale Â© is designed to measure the prevalence, severity, and distress of 18 different sensory symptoms following breast surgery. A "Patient Demographic and Treatment Information Form" and patients' medical records will be used to obtain demographic and treatment data. The role of confounding variables (including: patient age, breast volume, axillary procedures performed and adjuvant therapies received) on the recovery of sensation will be evaluated. The estimated accrual time for this study is 12 months.</detailed_description>
