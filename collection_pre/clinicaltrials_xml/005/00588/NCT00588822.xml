	<brief_summary>This study was done to find out if the investigational medication, rituximab, could help relieve the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (such as numbness [abnormal protein in the blood] and weakness of the lower and upper extremities) in people who have monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and people with a symptomatic or smoldering Waldestrom macroglobulinemia. Rituximab is an antibody which attacks a particular type of white blood cell (B Cell). By targeting the B-cells which make the abnormal protein which is involved in causing the nerve trouble, it is hoped that damage to nerve fibers will be stopped and improvement will be allowed to proceed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab in Treating Patients With Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase II single arm trial evaluating the use of Rituximab administered at standard dose and schedule as an initial cycle of therapy, followed by a re-evaluation at 6 months. If progression in neuropathy (as indicated by an increase in the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of greater than or equal to 10 or a modified Rankin Score increase of &gt; 1 grade) the patient was off study. In addition, if the subject elected to pursue other active treatment including but not limited to plasmapheresis, high-dose intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIG), chemotherapeutic agents, or high dose corticosteroids, or if conditions in the exclusion criteria develop subsequent to enrollment, the subject was off study. If the neuropathy is stable or responding (NIS of &lt; 10 or a modified Rankin Score increase of &lt; 1 grade) the patient would have received Cycle 2 of rituximab followed by a reevaluation at 12 months. The study had a Simon Optimal two-stage Phase II design (α 5%, β 10%, π0 5%, π1 20%). The minimum clinically important response rate was 20%. The first stage was to include 21 patients and the second stage a total of 41 patients. The treatment would be rejected if there were fewer than 2 responders at the first stage or fewer than 5 responders at the second stage. The treatment would be accepted for further study if there were at least 5 responders out of 41 patients.</detailed_description>
