	<brief_summary>The blockade of angiotensin II synthesis attenuates hepatic fibrosis in different experimental models of chronic liver injury. We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of moexipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on liver biochemistries, Mayo risk score, and health-related quality of life in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who have had a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Moexipril for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of presumed autoimmune cause characterized by progressive inflammatory destruction of interlobular and septal bile ducts, resulting in fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis (1). In PBC patients, the most disabling symptoms are fatigue and pruritus which diminish health-related quality of life (HRQL. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg per day, is a safe and effective medical therapy for most patients with PBC. Nevertheless, UDCA therapy has not ameliorated symptoms associated with PBC. Some UDCA-treated patients show progressive disease resulting in the liver transplantation or death from liver-related causes. For these patients, who show a persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase at least twice the normal level after 6 months of UDCA monotherapy (incomplete responders), the evaluation of combination therapy in clinical trials has been recommended. Moexipril is a long-acting, nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor with lipophilicity, and so can readily penetrate lipid membranes and thus target tissue ACE in addition to plasma ACE. This drug also demonstrated antioxidative properties in addition to efficiently controlling blood pressure in hypertensive postmenopausal subjects. Moreover, quality-of-life data suggest favorable effects of moexipril treatment in a patient population at high cardiovascular risk. The tolerability and safety profile of moexipril resembles that of other ACE inhibitors along with no reports of hepatotoxicity in controlled trials. Hence, moexipril is an attractive drug for evaluation in patients with chronic liver disease.</detailed_description>
