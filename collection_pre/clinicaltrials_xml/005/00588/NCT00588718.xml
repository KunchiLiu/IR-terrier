	<brief_summary>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe, sometimes life-threatening inflammation of the intestine that occurs most often in premature babies. If it progresses, the wall of the intestine may perforate, spilling bacteria and stool into the abdomen. Parts or all of the intestine may die. Despite 30 years of clinical studies, the cause of NEC remains unknown. In this study, we will be conducting an independent case-control validation study to verify the diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels, develop validated biomarkers on boisensors in preparation for prospective validation studies, and conduct independent prospective validation of biosensor based biomarker panels on clinical samples.</brief_summary>
