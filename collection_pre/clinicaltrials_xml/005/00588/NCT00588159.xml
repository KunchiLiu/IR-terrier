	<brief_summary>One dose of either gabapentin or placebo will be given to patients prior to thoracotomy. Patients will also receive an epidural infusion, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl, oral acetaminophen and intravenous ketorolac as needed to achieve optimal analgesia. Pain ratings and supplemental medication use will be recorded for 48 hours and will also be assessed at 3 months postoperatively to determine whether the patients who received gabapentin had improved analgesia and/or required less supplemental medication than the placebo group.</brief_summary>
