It was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a Web-based format of the PFH intervention, compared to a written Materials control condition. The study was conducted among childhood and young adult cancer survivors, who smoke, at four survivor clinics. Participants in both conditions received access to pharmacotherapy at no cost. Participants in the Web condition received access to an interactive Web site that focuses on survivorship, health, and smoking.
