	<brief_summary>To study the fibrinogen metabolic changes in relation to coagulation disorder in patients with severe burns and trauma injuries. As a result of the burn or trauma injury breakdown of fibrinogen is accelerated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Fibrinogen Metabolism During Severe Trauma and Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this protocol, we will investigate fibrinogen metabolism in burn and trauma patients, using an 8h infusion of stable isotopes labeled amino acids (1-13C-phenylalanine, 2H5-phenylalanine, and 2H3-ketoisocaporate). The increase of the labeled amino acids incorporating into fibrinogen during the infusion and the decay of labeled fibrinogen after stopping the isotopes infusion (as measured by GC-MS) will be used to calculate fibrinogen synthesis and degradation. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive.</detailed_description>
