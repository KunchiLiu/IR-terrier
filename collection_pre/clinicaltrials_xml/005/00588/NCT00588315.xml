	<brief_summary>This study investigates new non-invasive imaging techniques for the evaluation of skin lesions, as well as normal skin. Our primary goal is to collect and study these images of different skin lesions along with matching biopsy specimens. The long-term goal is to develop a technique that will improve the early detection of skin cancer and eliminate the need for many skin biopsies. The integrated handheld CSLM-OCT device will provide the first truly co-registered images of en face "optical section" planes (confocal) with orthogonal "optical section" planes (OCT). The imaging with a polarization-sensitive hyper-spectral dermoscope (SkinSpect) will add to the interpretation of CLSM images. SkinSpect will produce tissue-level functional data (i. e., skin chromophore maps of melanin and hemoglobin) in larger fields of view, which will be combined with the cellular-level detail from CLSM imaging. The combined approach will be tested for more accurate detection of skin morphologic characteristics.</brief_summary>
