	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study on the Addition of Aprepitant to Cisplatin - Etoposide Treatment in Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aprepitant acts initially as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 followed by a short period of CYP3A4 induction. Etoposide is a substrate of CYP3A4 and may therefore be suvject to a drug interaction with aprepitant. CE can be classified as a highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic regimen and the use of aprepitant may therefore be considered when no clinically relevant drug interaction with etoposide can be determined.</detailed_description>
