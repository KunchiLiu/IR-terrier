	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out the genetic and biochemical makeup of your neuroblastic tumor, which influences its aggressiveness and the suitable therapy. These research studies include surface marker analysis, cytogenetics, cancer genes,genome sequencing, tumor growth-related genes and tumor growth in test tubes. Your blood, marrow, and hematopoietic stem cell samples will also be tested for tumors or leukemia cells, and your serum tested for anti-tumor antibodies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Characterization of Neuroblastic Tumor: Correlation With Clinical Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To collect tumor, marrow specimens prospectively to study the molecular-genetic makeup of individual neuroblastic tumor and its metastasis by blood and marrow, and to correlate these findings with clinical outcome, and to relate the signaling circuitry of neuroblastic tumors to that of embryonic neuroectodermal cells. .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Neuroblastic tumors diagnosed in accordance with the International Neuroblastoma Staging System viz., either (a) histologic confirmation (by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) which may involve immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, or cytogenetic studies, or (b) elevated urinary catecholamines plus tumor cells/clumps in the bone marrow. OR Clinically suspected neuroblastic tumors.</criteria>
