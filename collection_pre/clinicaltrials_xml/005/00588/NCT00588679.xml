	<criteria>Patient must have clinically suspected or biopsy proven prostate cancer. If a patient has been diagnosed with prostate cancer an official report of biopsy from MSKCC or outside site is required. All outside pathology reports will be confirmed at MSKCC. For those patients who have undergone prostate biopsy it is recommended that the interval between biopsy and protocol MRI/MRSI should be at least 8 weeks. Patient is a potential surgical candidate for treatment of prostate cancer Patient is willing to undergo an endorectal MRI/MRSI exam on the 3.0T MR scanner Patients who because of general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic status unrelated to the presence of prostate cancer cannot give valid informed consent. Patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo MRI/MRSI (including patients with contraindications to MRI such as the presence of cardiac pacemakers or noncompatible intracranial vascular clips. Patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to endorectal coil insertion; for example, patients who have had a prior abdominoperineal resection of the rectum or have Crohn's disease, patients with severe hemorrhoids, patients who have had prior radiation to the pelvis to treat a malignancy, or patients who have had minor rectal surgery within the previous 8 weeks. Patients with an allergic reaction to latex. Patients with a metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device in the pelvis that might distort local magnetic field and compromise quality of MRI/MRSI.</criteria>
