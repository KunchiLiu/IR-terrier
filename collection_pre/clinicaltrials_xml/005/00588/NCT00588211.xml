	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop an accurate way of measuring people's thoughts about cancer risk. The researchers at the Queens Hospital Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Adelphi University are working together to design a new measure. Findings from this study will help us find new ways to help people avoid cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to develop and provide initial evidence for the reliability and validity of a measure of cancer-related risk perception. As such, the primary outcomes of the study will be initial construct validity (convergent validity and discriminant validity) of the proposed scale as evidenced by correlations of this test with other tests that vary in the degree of association to the proposed construct of cancer-related risk perception. It is anticipated that the cancer-related risk perception scale will correlate most highly (.50-.60) with measures of tobacco and environmental risk exposures, readiness to quit smoking, and family cancer history.</detailed_description>
