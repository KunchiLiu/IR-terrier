	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to first understand how MSKCC Clinical Genetics Service doctors talk to women with breast cancer about any genetic risks they might carry, and if they help women to think about what they might say, in turn, to their relatives, especially their daughters. A second part of the study asks women for their opinions about when and how their daughters should be told about any genetic risks. All of this will help us develop teaching methods to help our doctors improve the way they talk about genetic risk when women with breast cancer have adolescent daughters.</brief_summary>
