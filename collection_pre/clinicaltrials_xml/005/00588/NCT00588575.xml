	<detailed_description>In the search for means to enhance the surveillance of BE, optical spectroscopy is emerging as a candidate with high potential. Optical spectroscopic techniques measure specific light-tissue interactions, such as fluorescence, elastic scattering, and Raman (inelastic) scattering, which provide objective and quantitative diagnostic information about the molecular and/or structural status of tissue. Moreover, optical spectroscopy has the capacity to identify tissue pathology in situ in a rapid and non-destructive fashion. Among the optical spectroscopic techniques, near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (NIRS) is particularly promising because of the wealth of molecular-specific information contained in its spectra</detailed_description>
