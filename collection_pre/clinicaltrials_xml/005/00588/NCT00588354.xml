	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, blinded study of transforaminal epidural injection of clonidine versus a similar injection of corticosteroid for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. The hypothesis was that clonidine will be as effective as steroid for this condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidural Clonidine for Lumbosacral Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with approximately 3 months of low back pain and leg pain due to intervertebral disc herniation were randomized to transforaminal epidural injections of 2% lidocaine and either clonidine (200 or 400 micrograms) or triamcinolone (40 mg) (corticosteroid). Patients received one to three injections administered at about 2 weeks apart. Patients, investigators, and study coordinators were blinded to the treatment. The primary outcome was an 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale at 1 month. The hypothesis was that clonidine will be as effective as steroid for this condition.</detailed_description>
