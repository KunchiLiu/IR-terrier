	<brief_summary>The object of this open-labeled, uncontrolled pilot study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of percutaneously transplanting autologous bone marrow (ABM) cells into the myocardium using the helical needle transendocardial (TE) delivery system in stable coronary patients with ventricular dysfunction due to chronic myocardial infarction (MI). A secondary goal was to assess the possibility that such cell injections could improve ejection fraction (EF).</brief_summary>
