	<brief_summary>The objective of this 96-week study was to evaluate the safety and antiviral efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF, coformulated; Truvada®) with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) in preventing the recurrence of chronic hepatitis B following liver transplantation, in participants who were chronically infected with hepatitis B prior to transplantation. Prior to enrollment, participants were required to have received at least 12 weeks of HBIg therapy following liver transplantation. Enrolled participants then received FTC/TDF plus HBIg for an initial 24-week pre-randomization treatment period. Participants who completed the pre-randomization period and who achieved sustained viral suppression were randomized to continue treatment with FTC/TDF with or without HBIg for an additional 72 weeks (randomized period). The antiviral efficacy of treatment was assessed by measuring hepatitis B virus levels in the blood (HBV DNA). Safety and tolerability was monitored by assessing adverse events and various laboratory parameters.</brief_summary>
