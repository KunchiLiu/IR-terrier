	<brief_title>Complex Problem Solving Training in Schizophrenic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with schizophrenia, cognitive deficits often lead to an impairment in daily life. This observation has led to the development of cognitive training packages aiming a improving these deficits. However, it is far from clear which level of cognitive functioning provides the best target for cognitive interventions. Traditionally, training has aimed a basic cognitive functions like attention and memory. In the present study we aim at a higher-level of function, namely planning and problem-solving skills, which are trained using the software package Plan-A-Day. The primary hypothesis is that complex problem solving training improved functional capacity more than traditional training programs addressing basic cognitive function.</detailed_description>
