	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with VELCADE, dexamethasone, and Revlimid® (VDR) as well as VELCADE, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, and Revlimid (VDCR) in patients with multiple myeloma who have received no prior treatment. This study will evaluate whether the addition of Revlimid to VELCADE and Dexamethasone will increase the complete response (CR)/ very good partial response (VGPR) rate.</brief_summary>
