	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of Megestrol Acetate in Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease With Loss of Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been demonstrated that the body weight measured as a Body mass index (BMI)is an independent risk factor of mortality in the severe COPD.It seems to be one influence of inflammatory factors in the development of denutrition in these patients. The use of especial diets has no so good results in the aim to improve the weight, being necessary to complement with muscular rehabilitation or anabolic products. The megestrol acetate has demonstrated good results in a short period of time, nevertheless the studies are scarce. The beneficial effects of the megestrol acetate seems to be mediated by cytokines.</detailed_description>
