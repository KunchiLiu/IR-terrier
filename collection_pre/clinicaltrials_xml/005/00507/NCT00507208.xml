	<brief_title>Dynasplint Therapy for Trismus in Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a single-institution, randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dynasplint Trismus System (DTS) for patients with trismus. Improvement of mouth opening and quality of life of participants using DTS will be compared to improvement of mouth opening and quality of life of participants using standard therapy. Standard therapy will be the use of tongue depressors. Crossover from standard therapy to DTS will be implemented if at three months there is no improvement in mouth opening when using tongue depressors.</detailed_description>
