	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open label, multicenter clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Velcade (bortezomib) and dexamethasone versus Velcade, thalidomide, and dexamethasone versus Velcade, melphalan, and prednisone in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma not considered candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female 18 years of age or older Not a candidate for highdose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (HDT/SCT) due to age, presence of important comorbid condition(s) likely to have a negative impact on tolerability of HDTSCT, or subject preference. A Karnofsky Performance Status score of ≥50% Symptomatic multiple myeloma or asymptomatic multiple myeloma with related organ or tissue damage. Asymptomatic multiple myelomarelated organ or tissue damage can include presence of an asymptomatic lytic bone lesion or plasmacytoma, the presence of anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL), renal function impairment (serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal [ULN]) or hypercalcemia (serum calcium &gt;ULN). Must have measurable disease requiring systemic therapy. Measurable disease is defined by at least 1 of the following criteria: Quantifiable serum Mprotein value (&gt;1 g/dL of immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgM Mprotein, &gt;0.5g/dL of IgA Mprotein, &gt;0.5 g/dL of IgD Mprotein) Urine lightchain excretion ≥200 mg/24 hours Voluntary written informed consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Diagnosis of smoldering multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Smoldering multiple myeloma is defined as asymptomatic multiple myeloma with absence of lytic bone lesions. MGUS is defined by presence of serum monoclonal protein &lt;3 g/dL; absence of lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency related to the monoclonal protein; and (if determined) proportion of plasma cells in the bone marrow of 10% or less. Diagnosis of Waldenström's disease or other conditions in which immunoglobulin M (IgM) Mprotein is present in the absence of a clonal plasma cell infiltration or lytic bone lesions. Previously or currently treated with any systemic therapy for multiple myeloma. Prior treatment of hypercalcemia or spinal cord compression with corticosteroids or radiation therapy, respectively, does not disqualify the subject (the dose of corticosteroids should not exceed the equivalent of 160 mg of dexamethasone in 2week period). Radiation therapy within 2 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of patients who require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 2 weeks have elapsed since the last date of therapy. Major surgery within 30 days before randomization (Kyphoplasty is not considered major surgery) History of allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the various formulations ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy on clinical examination within 21 days before enrollment. Any of the following clinical laboratory values within 21 days prior to enrollment: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1000 cells/mm^3 Platelets &lt;100,000 × 10^9/L, or &lt;70 × 10^9/L if thrombocytopenia is considered by the investigator to be due to myeloma infiltration of bone marrow Aspartate aminotransferase [serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase] (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase [serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase] (ALT [SGPT]) &gt;2× the upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL (&gt;176.8 µmol/L); if the rise in creatinine is related to myeloma and there has been demonstrated a response to hydration, the subject may be enrolled. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or New York Hospital Association Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or significant conduction system abnormalities in the opinion of the investigator. Prior to study entry, any abnormality on electrocardiogram at screening must be determined and documented by the investigator as not medically relevant. Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the Investigator places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study. This includes but is not limited to serious medical conditions or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study. Prior malignancy except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, in situ breast cancer, in situ prostate cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been diseasefree for at least 3 years. Female who is pregnant or breastfeeding. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL during Screening. Use of any investigational drugs within 30 days before randomization.</criteria>
