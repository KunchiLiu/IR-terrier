	<brief_title>Study of Vintafolide (MK-8109, EC145) in Participants With Advanced Ovarian and Endometrial Cancers (MK-8109-007, EC-FV-02)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II clinical trial of vintafolide administered to participants with advanced ovarian and endometrial cancers. Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on virtually all ovarian cancers as well as the majority of endometrial cancers. Early clinical evidence in a small number of Phase I patients suggests that vintafolide may have antitumor effect in women with advanced ovarian cancer and that it is generally well-tolerated. This evidence suggests that vintafolide may be useful as chemotherapy against advanced ovarian and endometrial cancers. The primary objective of Part A of this study is to collect data on clinical benefit produced by therapy with vintafolide. The primary objective of Part B of this study is to collect data on the safety and efficacy of vintafolide. All participants will undergo imaging with the FR targeting investigational imaging agent ertafolide (EC20, FolateScan) during the screening period to confirm eligibility for the treatment portion of the clinical trial. Clinical evidence suggests that ertafolide may be used to identify women with cancers that express the target receptor. Information about the safety and tolerability of both vintafolide and ertafolide will be assessed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Part A: Radiographic evidence of measurable disease (by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) and either: Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with serous or endometrioid histology, as confirmed by previous biopsy or, ertafolide scan positive ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Prior treatment with platinum and/or taxane compounds. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 02. At least 4 weeks from prior therapy and recovered from associated acute toxicities. Adequate bone marrow reserve, renal, and hepatic function. Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and willingness to practice contraceptive methods. Serious comorbidities (as determined by the Principal Investigator). Women who are pregnant or lactating. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Prior radiation therapy to assessable disease, unless disease progression is confirmed at that site. Requires palliative radiotherapy at time of study entry. Unable to tolerate conditions for radionuclide imaging. Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational. Those who have been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere with the assessment of 99mTcertafolide scan. Part B: Radiographic evidence of measurable disease (by RECIST criteria) ertafolide scan positive recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, primary fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. Prior treatment with platinum compounds, but not more than 4 prior cytotoxic chemotheraputic regimens. ECOG Performance status of 02. At least 3 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy and recovered from associated acute toxicities. Adequate bone marrow reserve, renal, and hepatic function. Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and willingness to practice contraceptive methods. Serious comorbidities (as determined by the Principal Investigator). Women who are pregnant or lactating. Symptomatic CNS metastasis. Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational. Those who have had prior therapy with Vinorelbine or vincacontaining compounds.</criteria>
