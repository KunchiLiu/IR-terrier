	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of CPAP in the prevention of acute respiratory failure in neutropenic ( or hematologic malignancy ) patients .CPAP applied preventively in hematological patients with high risk of ARF may reduce:need for intubations and mechanical ventilation, incidence of pneumonia and sepsis,mortality,length of ICU and hospital stay</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immunocompromised patients with a hematological malignancy that requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and subsequently mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure was estimated between 20- 50 per cent of all admitted in hospital. The survival rate of this patients that requiring mechanical ventilation is very poor. In many cases the immunodepression with a great improvement in severe complication as infections , pneumonia, sepsis , is the consequence of our therapy ( chemotherapy , bone marrow transplantation and stem cell transplantation ) . Pneumonia is very common cause of mechanical ventilation in about 45-74 per cent of the all patient with acute respiratory failure (ARF) . The trial was designed to enroll 40 patients in two groups to demonstrate reduction from 50% to 10 % of the need of mechanical ventilation , with a type I risk of error of 5% and a power of 80 %. Patients were randomized to be treated for four days Venturi mask at a FiO2 of 0.4 (control) or with oxygen at a FiO2 of 0.4 plus a CPAP of 10 cm H2O (CPAP). At the end of the 4-days period, patients passed a screening test breathing ambient air. Patients returned to the assigned treatment if SaO2 less than 95% a.a or respiratory rate more than 25 bpm.CPAP was generated using a flow generator with an adjustable inspiratory oxygen fraction set to deliver a flow of up to 140 liters per minute (Whisperflow, Caradyne, Ireland) and a spring-loaded expiratory pressure valve (Vital Signs Inc, Totoma NJ) and applied using a latex-free polyvinyl chloride transparent helmet (CaStar, Starmed, Italy) (15); all centers measured the inspiratory oxygen fraction using an oxygen analyzer (Oxicheck, Caradyne, Ireland) through the Venturi mask or the helmet.</detailed_description>
