	<brief_title>Collection of Outcomes Data for Pregnant Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If participant agrees to take part in this study, information about the type of cancer, the type of treatment they have had or are having, and details about their pregnancy will be collected for the database. Data will be collected from participants seen at MD Anderson since September 2003 until data has been collected for 500 cases. This information will serve as a basis for future studies about pregnant women with cancer. Participant will receive no special tests or treatment at MD Anderson as a result of this study. Progress notes and ultrasound reports about participant's pregnancy will be requested from Maternal Fetal Medicine and/or from their personal obstetrician. This information will be entered into the database and also included in participant's medical record. If the information is not consistent in the record, we may contact participant to clarify the information. Participant will remain on study until their pregnancy and/or any treatment they are receiving are completed. Periodically the database will be updated to include information about patient survival. This information is usually found in the medical record however it may be necessary to contact participant directly. This is an investigational study. About 500 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
