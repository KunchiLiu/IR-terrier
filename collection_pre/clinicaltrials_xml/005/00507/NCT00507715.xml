	<brief_title>Study of the Modification of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Levodopa by the Fiber Plantago Ovata Husk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the treatment with l-dopa is the election treatment for Parkinson´s disease, a high number of patients develop motor complications, including, fluctuations and dyscinesia after some years of treatment. The origin of the fluctuations is not well established, but it could be attributed, al least partially, a pharmacokinetics factors. So that, it could improve the answer and reduce the adverse reaction if we reach more stable levels of L-dopa in the circulation. The first experimental studies in animals showed that Plantago ovata husk has an influence in the pharmacokinetics parameters of L-dopa, obtaining more stable levels.</detailed_description>
