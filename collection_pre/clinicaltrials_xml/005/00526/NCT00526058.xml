	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that the performance of the modified Plasmat® Futura H.E.L.P. Apheresis System is non-inferior to the current FDA approved Plasmat® Secura H.E.L.P Apheresis System for use under the approved indication of the acute reduction of LDL-cholesterol from the plasma in populations for whom diet has been ineffective and maximum drug therapy has either been ineffective or not tolerated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>(H.E.L.P.)Apheresis Therapy to Compare the Reduction of LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study endpoint is the change in percent measurements of the pre-to-post apheresis LDL measurements between the approved H.E.L.P. system and the modified H.E.L.P. system. The secondary study endpoints are clinical lab profiles and device parameters analyzed at specific time points throughout the study.</detailed_description>

A history of hemorrhagic diathesis, bleeding/clotting disorder, thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count &lt; 150 x109/L), or for whom the use of heparin would cause excessive or uncontrolled anticoagulation or for whom adequate anticoagulation cannot be safely achieved (ie., hemophilia, recent surgery, acute internal bleeding, gastrointestinal ulcers). Females who are pregnant or lactating. Subjects&lt; 106 lbs. or &lt;48.2 kg in body weight; or whose weight is &gt;1.5 times their ideal weight.

Renal insufficiency defined as creatinine greater &gt;2.0 mg/dlL or is dependent upon renal dialysis. Untreated hypothyroidism; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus; or fasting triglycerides &gt;500 mg/dL. Serious systemic disease (e.g., advanced neoplasms, and acute hepatitis) including Immune system suppression or compromise, that could preclude survival to study completion. History of stroke within 6 months of the screening visit. Received thrombolytic treatment &lt; 7 days of screening.visit. Taken or requires a prohibited treatment &lt; 30 days prior to the Screening Visit, or requires a prohibited treatment at anytime during the course of the study. Neutropenia (neutrophil count &lt; 0.5 x109/L). History of liver disease or serum ALT and/or AST &gt; 2X upper limit of normal range. History of dementia. History of anemia (value outside the lower normal range). acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) &gt; 325 mg/day. Subject currently enrolled in another investigational study (does not apply to PMS for Secura device). Subject with any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator might put the subject at risk or interfere with his/her participation. Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or to cooperate fully with the investigator or site personnel.</criteria>
