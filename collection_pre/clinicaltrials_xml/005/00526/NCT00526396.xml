	<brief_title>STAD-1 Small Cell Lung Cancer Toxicity Adjusted Dosing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment for advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is combination chemotherapy of cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide. Standard fixed doses of this combination have been based on calculating a patient's body surface area. This method of dose calculation has been shown to be poorly correlated with the activity of many chemotherapy drugs, and some patients do not obtain adequate levels of the drug in their circulation. Recent reports suggest that patients who have a very high tolerability to chemotherapy (without significant toxicity), are at risk for having less effectiveness of the therapy. This study will compare fixed doses of standard chemotherapy with a new strategy of the same chemotherapy with doses that will be adjusted according to the toxicity observed.</detailed_description>
