	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Assess Safety and Effectiveness of the Zenith® Dissection Endovascular System in Patients With Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Zenith® Thoracic Dissection Study is a clinical trial to study the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith® Dissection Endovascular System in the treatment of dissections (length-wise tear) of the descending thoracic aorta. The Zenith® Dissection Endovascular System is comprised of the Zenith TX2® TAA Endovascular Graft and the Zenith® Dissection Endovascular Stent. Instead of making a large incision in the chest, the physician makes a small incision near each hip to insert, and guides the graft and the dissection stent into place in the aorta.</detailed_description>
