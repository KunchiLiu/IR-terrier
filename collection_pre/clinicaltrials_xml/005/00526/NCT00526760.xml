	<brief_title>Long-term Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine in ICU Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the current dexmedetomidine indication, the duration of dexmedetomidine administration is limited within 24 hours. However, there is a strong demand from the medical specialists for continued administration of dexmedetomidine in excess of 24 hours in the medical practice because a large number of patients require sedation for more than 24 hours in ICU. To meet such clinical demand, it was planned to conduct a phase III long-term administration study of dexmedetomidine to obtain the approval on the infusion of dexmedetomidine for more than 24 hours.</detailed_description>
