	<brief_summary>The purpose of the Consulta clinical study is to evaluate the overall system safety and clinical performance of the Consulta Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT-D).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ConsultaTM CRT-D Clinical Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Consulta CRT-D is an investigational bi-ventricular device that provides atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection and therapy, cardioversion, defibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy. The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical study, conducted in approximately 18 centers. To allow for sufficient experience with the device, a maximum of 80 subjects may be implanted with the Consulta device. Data will be collected at baseline (enrollment), implant, 1-, 3-, and 6- months post implant and every 6 months thereafter or until study closure (whichever occurs first), unscheduled follow-up visits, System Modifications, Technical Observations, Study Deviations, Study Exit, upon notification of new or updated Adverse Events and in case of death.</detailed_description>
