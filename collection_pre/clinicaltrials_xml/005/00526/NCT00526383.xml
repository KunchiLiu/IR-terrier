	<brief_summary>Since antidepressants and antipsychotics have common receptorial mechanisms of action (H1 antagonism, 5HT2 antagonism), the impact of antidepressants in terms of metabolic syndromes is a matter of concern. The main objective of this study is to assess the differential impact of antidepressants in terms of weight gain and metabolic syndromes.</brief_summary>
