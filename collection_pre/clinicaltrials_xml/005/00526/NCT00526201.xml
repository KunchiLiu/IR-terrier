	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to determine if an evidence-based, community-delivered physical activity program, EnhanceFitness, yields benefits for participants with arthritis. The 3-year project will: 1) conduct a meta-analysis of community-based exercise programs for adults, 2) implement and evaluate the EnhanceFitness program in West Virginia using a randomized, controlled (wait list) design, and 3) disseminate the results to community and public health partners. It is anticipated that participation in the EnhanceFitness program will result in reduced pain, improved physical function and physical activity levels for adults with arthritis.</brief_summary>
