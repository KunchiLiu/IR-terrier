	<brief_title>SecuraTM ICD Clinical Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Secura ICD is an investigational dual chamber ICD that provides atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection and therapy, cardioversion, defibrillation, dual chamber rate-responsive bradycardia pacing and diagnostics. The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical study, conducted in approximately 15 centers. To allow for sufficient experience with the device, a maximum of 80 subjects may be implanted with the Secura device. Data will be collected at baseline (enrollment), implant, 1-, 3-, and 6- months post implant and every 6 months thereafter or until study closure (whichever occurs first), Unscheduled Follow-up visits, System Modifications, Technical Observations, Study Deviations, Study Exit, upon notification of new or updated Adverse Events and in case of death.</detailed_description>
