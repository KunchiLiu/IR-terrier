	<brief_summary>This Phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABT-888 when given together with Temozolomide (chemotherapy) in treating patients with solid tumors, including metastatic melanoma (MM), BRCA deficient breast, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ) in subjects with non-hematologic malignancies (NHM), including metastatic melanoma (MM), BRCA deficient breast, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Dose escalation and expanded safety cohorts Evaluable disease, histologically confirmed malignancy (metastatic or unresectable) and standard curative measures or other therapy that may provide clinical benefit do not exist or are no longer effective ECOG Performance Score less than or equal to 2 Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function Normal sodium, calcium and magnesium levels Voluntarily signed informed consent Expanded Safety Cohorts Only Population: Metastatic melanoma (MM) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Child Pugh Category A and B classification only BRCA deficient tumor status*: advanced breast cancer (with soft tissue disease), or advanced ovarian cancer, or advanced primary peritoneal cancer, or advanced fallopian tube cancer* *Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors with a positive genetic test result documenting BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation status, to be considered eligible. Serial tumor biopsies: Required for all subjects enrolled in one of the Expanded Low Dose Safety Cohorts. Dose Escalation and Expanded Safety Cohorts Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases or CNS primary cancer. Previous or current malignancies at other sites, except: adequately treated in situ carcinoma of cervix uteri; basal/squamous cell carcinoma of skin; previous malignancy considered cured. Previous history or current seizure disorder. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical condition(s) or any medical condition that places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities. Transplant recipients and patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV due to the use of immunosuppressant therapies. Lactating or pregnant female. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic or any investigational therapy will not be allowed within either 4 weeks, or 5 half lives of a targeted therapy prior to study drug administration (Study Day 1). Prior therapy with regimens containing dacarbazine (DTIC) or TMZ is not permitted. Anticancer therapy is not permitted during the treatment portion of the study. Hormone therapy, bisphosphonates or LHRHagonists for prostate cancer are permitted prior to and during the study. Significant adverse event or toxicity due to previous anticancer treatment that has not recovered to within one grade level (not to exceed Grade 2) of baseline. Expanded Safety Cohorts Only: MM Only: Prior treatment with DNA damaging agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy including carboplatin, cisplatin, fotemustine, paclitaxel, vincristine, TMZ and DTIC. Prior therapy with biologic agents (including IL2, interferon, bevacizumab, vaccines and immunostimulants) and signal transduction inhibitors (including sorafenib, erlotinib, sutent and elesclomol) are allowed. Lower Dose Expanded Safety Cohorts Only Anticoagulant restrictions for subjects that have tumor biopsies.</criteria>
