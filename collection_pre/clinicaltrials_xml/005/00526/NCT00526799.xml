	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional phase I/II clinical trial will test the tolerability and efficacy of the combination sorafenib and topotecan in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, which is platinum-resistant (recurrence within 6 months from completing platinum based therapy) or refractory (progressive disease during platinum based therapy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib + Topotecan for Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. - Topotecan: 4mg/m2 weekly, 3 weeks on and one week off. - Sorafenib: Assigned cohort dose for phase I (up to 12 patients) Maximum tolerated dose for phase II (21 total patients) Cycles will consist of 4 weeks (28 days) with disease evaluations every 8 weeks. Non-PD and acceptable toxicity: Patients will continue protocol therapy PD or unacceptable toxicity: Patients will discontinue protocol therapy ECOG performance status 0-1 Life expectancy: Three (3) months Hematopoietic: - White blood cell count (WBC) &gt; 3 K/mm3 - Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9 g/dL - Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm3 - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 K/mm3 - INR &lt; 1.5 or a PTT within normal limits. NOTE: Patients receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin may be allowed to participate. - No evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Hepatic: - Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN - Alkaline phosphate &lt; 2.5 x ULN Renal: - Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Cardiovascular: - No history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris or angina equivalent within 6 months prior to registration for protocol therapy (the patient may not be on anti-anginal or anti-arrhythmic medications), or have uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA Pulmonary: - No thrombolic or embolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident, including transient ischemic attacks within the past 6 months. - No pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. - No non-pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 3 within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy.</detailed_description>
