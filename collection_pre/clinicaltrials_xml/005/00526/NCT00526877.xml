	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting risperidone microspheres (small uniformly-sized spherical particles, of micrometer dimensions, frequently labeled with radioisotopes or various reagents acting as tags or markers) in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) and schizoaffective disorders (a mixed psychiatric disorder relating to a complex psychotic state that has features of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder), who are receiving psychiatric home-care treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Long-acting Risperidone in Participants With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorders Who Are Receiving Psychiatric Home Care Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric (conducted in more than one center), non-randomized and single-arm study of long- acting risperidone microspheres in participants with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. The duration of this study will be 6 months and will include following parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1), run-in period (that is, Week 1 to 3) and Treatment period (that is, Week 1 to 24). Participants will receive previous medication for the first three weeks during run-in period and previous medications will be tapered off during the third week. Participants will receive long-acting risperidone microspheres starting at a dose of 25 milligram (mg) every two weeks by intramuscular injection (injection of a substance into a muscle). Efficacy of the participants will be primarily evaluated through Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.</detailed_description>
