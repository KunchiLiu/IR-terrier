	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine imaging characteristics of radiolabelled 131-I-NM404 in ten patients with cancer, including calculations of PKs, radiation dosimetry, biodistribution, and optimal imaging times (part 1 - complete). In addition, specific tumor accumulation and metabolic fate of 131-I-NM404 will be determined in NSCLC tumors collected in 5 patients (part 2 - complete). Lastly, the study will collect preliminary data on imaging NSCLC tumors in up to 12 patients with evaluable disease (part 3 - ongoing).</brief_summary>
