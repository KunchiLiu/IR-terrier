	<brief_title>LABS-3 Psychosocial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses 1. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery will experience significant decreases in the rates of psychopathology, in particular depressive illness, and significant improvements in quality of life, post-operatively. 2. Untreated psychopathology that persists well beyond the surgery (e.g. to one-year follow-up) or that develops post-operatively will be associated with less weight loss and decreased quality of life. 3. Untreated psychopathology at the time of bariatric surgery, including affective disorders and substance abuse/alcohol abuse will be associated with increased short-term (e.g. 90 day) complications (e.g. problems with plugging, vomiting, and dehydration) 4. Syndromal/subsyndromal eating disorders prior to surgery including binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome will be associated with eating disorder symptoms and less weight loss at long-term follow-up.</detailed_description>
