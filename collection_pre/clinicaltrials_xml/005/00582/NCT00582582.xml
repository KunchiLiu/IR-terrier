	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out the toxicities of doxercalciferol given in combination with docetaxel (TaxotereÂ®), as well as to see how well this combination works in the treatment of prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Docetaxel With Doxercalciferol or Placebo for Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-institutional, double-blinded, randomized study comparing docetaxel plus doxercalciferol versus docetaxel plus placebo in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer. Docetaxel is given intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 for every 28 day cycle and doxercalciferol or placebo is taken orally every day of the 28 day cycle. Please refer to the Eligibility Criteria below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>

At least one new lesion on bone scan, 2. Increase in size or number of measurable disease lesions, 3. At least 2 rising PSA measurements at least two weeks apart. Prior bilateral orchiectomy or on LHRH agonist therapy with a serum testosterone level of &lt; 50.

No radiotherapy within the past 4 weeks. No known brain metastases. No chronic hypercalcemia (serum calcium &gt;1.0 mg/dl above the upper limit of normal range), chronic gastrointestinal disease (malabsorption, surgery affecting absorption, chronic ulcerative colitis) or any condition that the investigator feels would put the patient at undue risk. Must not be taking digitalis, thiazide diuretics (or drugs in combination with thiazides) or calcium supplements within one week of treatment initiation.
