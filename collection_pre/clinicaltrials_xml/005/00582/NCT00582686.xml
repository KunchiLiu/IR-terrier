	<brief_title>Open Reduction Internal Fixation of Calcaneus Fractures With and Without Bone Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed as a randomized, prospective evaluation of patients who have sustained an intra-articular calcaneus fracture that requires open reduction with internal fixation as the preferred method of treatment. Patients who desire to participate in this study will be randomized into one of two groups. Group A will be made up of patients that undergo open reduction with internal fixation and Tricortical iliac crest bone grafting. Group B will consist of patients that undergo open reduction with internal fixation without bone grafting. All other surgical techniques and management of the fracture and patient will remain unchanged.</detailed_description>
