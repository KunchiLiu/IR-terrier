	<brief_summary>We will directly test the hypothesis that an initial strategy of lisinopril-based therapy will be more effective than atenolol-based therapy in causing regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) over one year in patients with hemodialysis hypertension despite similar degree of BP reduction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a parallel group, active control, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of initial therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) vs. beta-blocker therapy (atenolol) each administered three times weekly after dialysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients on chronic hemodialysis for &gt; 3 mos. 2. Compliance with hemodialysis treatments as defined by less than one missed dialysis per month 3. Hypertension as diagnosed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) &gt;135/75 mm Hg after participation in the ultrafiltration (UF) Trial, or those on no antihypertensive medications but unwilling to do UF Trial. 4. Presence of LVH on echocardiogram defined as left ventricular mass index (LVMi) &gt;104 g/m2 in women and &gt;116 g/m2 in men. 5. Willingness to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria: 1. Vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction or limb ischemia requiring bypass) within previous six months 2. Noncompliance with hemodialysis treatments 3. Known drug abuse 4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) requiring home oxygen 5. Congestive Heart Failure Class III or IV. 6. Body mass index &gt; 40 kg/m2. 7. Known contraindication to atenolol (severe heart failure, bradycardia, bronchial asthma, intolerance or allergy) or lisinopril (cough, pregnancy, intolerance or allergy)</criteria>
