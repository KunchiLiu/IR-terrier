	<detailed_description>To compare the volumetric response achieved using semi-automated computer techniques with the uni-dimensional (RECIST) and bi-dimensional (WHO) criteria as part of clinical trials running at MSKCC, testing new agents for different types of solid tumors.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Registered and being treated on one of the following therapeutic protocols: 06043, 07052, 07057, 07112, 07116, 08093, and 08054 Have at least one measurable lesion* as per RECIST criteria situated in lung, liver or lymph node meeting RECIST criteria noted on a baseline CT scan. Baseline** and at least one followup CT scan to likely to be obtained at an MSKCC facility All patients must be &gt; or = to 18 years old The measurable lesions are metastatic in the liver, lung and lymph nodes. The algorithms do not distinguish between primary and metastatic disease, therefore, in selected cases, a primary lesion such as in the liver or lung may also be assessed. Baseline CT are prefer but if not able to obtain for volumetric reconstructions follow up studies will still be use for other objectives if the study. Pregnant or lactating women</criteria>
