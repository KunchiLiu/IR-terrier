	<brief_summary>This blinded, placebo-controlled study will administer inhaled nitric oxide to patients undergoing liver transplantation. The purpose of the study is to test if inhaled nitric oxide prevents liver injury associated with the restoration of blood flow. The premise of the current study is provided by previous studies which document a protective effect of inhaled nitric oxide in this clinical setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate if Inhaled Nitric Oxide Improves Liver Function After Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically, presenting ischemia-reperfusion injury to transplanted livers remains a therapeutic goal in improving liver function and potentially expanding the number of transplantable livers. This study aims to assess the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide to limit ischemia-reperfusion injury in transplanted livers and by doing so improve liver function post transplantation and decrease patient hospital length of stays.</detailed_description>
