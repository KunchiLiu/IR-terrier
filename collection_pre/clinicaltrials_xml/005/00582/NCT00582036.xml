	<brief_summary>To determine whether intensive glucose control results in improved mortality and reduced hospital stay length by performing a randomized trial of intensive glucose management (blood glucose goal 110 mg/dl) using continuous IV insulin and glucose vs. non-intensive glucose management (goal 200 mg/dl)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TO determine whether there are fewer infections, days without a fever, days on antibiotics given for an infection and time to marrow engraftment are improved by intensive glucose management; and to determine whether there is evidence of a reduction in measures of inflammation in patients randomized to intensive glucose management and whether reduction of inflammation is associated with outcome.</detailed_description>
