	<brief_title>Vacuum Assisted Closure as a Treatment for Draining Hematomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Application of the VAC device may significantly decrease the incidence of draining hematomas that require surgical irrigation and debridement. The aim of this project is to perform a prospective, randomized study evaluating the VAC negative pressure device as a treatment for draining hematomas. We will also analyze the cost of treating a hematoma with a VAC compared with currently employed treatments. Additionally, we will document the incidence of infection of the hematoma with and without use of the VAC device. Patients who have a draining hematoma five days following surgery and who give informed consent to enter the study will be randomized into two groups. Group A will be patients treated with a pressure dressing and observation, which is the most common current method of treatment. Group B will be patients treated with a VAC negative pressure device. Patients will be carefully monitored for continued drainage by evaluating the wounds and dressings clinically. Patients in either group that are still draining at ten days following surgery will be taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement. Patients in either group who develop infection will be immediately treated with irrigation and debridement.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Hematoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient who has had an orthopaedic surgical procedure following trauma and has a draining wound for at least five days No clinical evidence of infection Adult patient (19 years and older) An infected hematoma. Infection will be defined by clinical signs and symptoms of infection that include increasing drainage, increasing pain, purulent drainage, and increasing erythema. Any hematomas that are thought to be infected will be cultured to confirm the diagnosis A surgical incision that can not be covered with VAC sponges and a water impermeable sheet (such Tegaderm) to achieve a closed vacuum environment over the wound Wounds associated with the surgical incision that are intentionally left open to heal with either a delayed primary closure or secondary granulation Abnormal coagulation leading to an expanding hematoma that will require surgical debridements Prisoners Pregnant Women Inability to comply with protocol Patients or family members who are unable or unwilling to sign study consent</criteria>
