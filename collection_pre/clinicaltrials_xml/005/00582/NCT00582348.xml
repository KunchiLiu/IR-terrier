	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn how often lung cancer survivors exercise. We also want to learn what helps people to be active or prevents them from being active. Learning this will help us to expand services for lung cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Activity and Inactivity in Lung Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the potential benefits of physical activity, particularly for cancer survivors with comorbid pulmonary and cardiac conditions, no previous research has examined the physical activity levels of lung cancer survivors, an underrepresented subpopulation in cancer survivorship research. We address this research gap in the current study, in which a random sample of 200 lung cancer survivors will complete a comprehensive telephone interview or use self-report to complete a questionnaire focusing on physical activity, related covariates, and preferences regarding physical activity counseling and interventions. We estimate the total time for the completion of the interview or self-report questionnaire to be 45-60 minutes. This study will be conducted with survivors of primary lung cancer who are from 1 to 5 years posttreatment and were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).</detailed_description>
