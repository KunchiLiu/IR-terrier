	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled in the study at their first prenatal visit after the details of the study have been discussed. Potential subjects will be presented with a questionnaire to determine eligibility for the study. The patient will be scheduled for an exam between 18-24 weeks at which time they will undergo a periodontal assessment, to determine the presence or absence of periodontal disease, a sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and a vaginal swab collection. Periodontal disease will be determined by measuring the depth of gingival sulci, amount of periodontal attachment loss, and prevalence of gingival bleeding at six sites for each tooth present.</detailed_description>
