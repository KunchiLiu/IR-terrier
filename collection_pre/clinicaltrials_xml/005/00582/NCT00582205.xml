	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial of Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Because ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal and uterine cancer spread in the abdominal cavity, giving chemotherapy drugs by infusion into the abdominal cavity may result in a greater dose of the drugs reaching the tumor cells. Intraperitoneal treatments will be administered through an implantable peritoneal catheter. These catheters are to be inserted into the peritoneal cavity, tunneled through the subcutaneous tissue, and connected to an implantable port, which is placed in the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior, inferior thorax.</detailed_description>
