	<brief_title>Role of Positive Affect in Adjustment to HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A growing body of literature indicates that positive affect may have a unique adaptive role in the process of adjustment to chronic stress, independent of the effects of negative affects like depression. The overarching goal of this research is to provide evidence and direction for the development of interventions for people with HIV that include a focus on positive affect. To this end, this study will document the occurrence, predictors, and consequences of positive affect during the 18 months post-notification of HIV+ serostatus.</detailed_description>
