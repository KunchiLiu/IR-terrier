	<brief_summary>The REFINE-PD study is a controlled trial embedded within a larger cluster controlled study (the IMPACT study). The study aims to investigate the efficacy of a multifactorial falls prevention program for patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This program contains PD-specific elements (e.g., optimizing dopaminergic therapy), plus a generic falls prevention program. The intervention will be tailored to each individual's specific risk profile for falls, as identified during detailed baseline examination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction of Falls in the Elderly - Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls and postural instability are common complications of advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD). Falls in PD often have devastating consequences, leading to a poor overall prognosis. In addition, falls in PD are associated with substantial medical expenses due to treatment of injuries and nursing home admission. The risk of falls in older PD patients is aggravated by "generic" age-related factors, such as sedative medication or poor vision. Observations on elderly persons without PD suggest that a multifactorial prevention program might be more effective. We propose to investigate the effectiveness of a multifactorial prevention program aimed at the prevention of falls in PD, which is based on disease-specific treatment strategies with demonstrated efficacy in PD, as well as prevention strategies with proven effectiveness for the general elderly population. In this study an individualised multifactorial program aimed at the prevention of falls in PD containing PD-specific elements and a generic falls prevention program will be compared to usual care.</detailed_description>
