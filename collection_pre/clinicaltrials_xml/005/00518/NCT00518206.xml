	<brief_title>Study of NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® in Patients With Measurable Stage III or IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial cohort tests the combination of NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine given after low dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced melanoma. NY-ESO-1 protein is an immune target found in many cancers including melanoma. ISCOMATRIX® adjuvant enhances immune responses. Low dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to suppress a population of lymphocytes called "regulatory T cells". Regulatory T cells can interfere with immune responses in patients with cancer. The rationale for treating this new cohort of patients in the study is to use a small dose of cyclophosphamide to suppress the regulatory T cells and thus try to increase patient responses to the NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine. Eligible patients will receive three intramuscular injections of NY-ESO-1 ISCOM® vaccine at approximately four-week intervals (week 1, week 5, week 9). Low dose cyclophosphamide will be administered by intravenous infusion one day prior to the each NY-ESO-1 ISCOM® vaccine. Tumor evaluations (CT scans and physical evaluations), safety evaluation (blood tests and medical reviews) and immunological testing (special DTH skin tests and blood immunology tests) will be performed before, during and at the end of the 11 week treatment cycle. Treatment may continue for further cycles unless there is a reason to remove the patient from study.</detailed_description>
