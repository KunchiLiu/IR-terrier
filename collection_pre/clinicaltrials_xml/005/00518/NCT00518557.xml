	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and potential therapeutic benefits for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma by transcatheter chemoembolization with the recombinant endostatin (commercially available in China)which is also administrated via the hepatic artery. The hypothesis of this protocol is that TACE with antiangiogenic treatment may inhibit the proangiogenic effects induced by the hypoxia of TACE.</brief_summary>
