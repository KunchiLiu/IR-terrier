	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Ultra-Rush Sublingual Immunotherapy in Children With Asthma Allergic to Grass Pollen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific immunotherapy is the only causal treatment method of atopic diseases including bronchial asthma in children. Sublingual immunotherapy seems to be the most promising alternative to traditional specific subcutaneous injection immunotherapy. The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy applied preseasonal and seasonal in ultra-rush scheme in children with bronchial asthma allergic to grass pollen. We will assess clinical symptoms, reliever drugs usage, lung function, chosen markers of allergic inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity with methacholine, and presence and type of allergy after two years of SLIT in children with asthma. After two years the study will be unblinded, all the children will be given grass pollen allergen extract for a year.</detailed_description>
