	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of a new health care system in which an individualised multidisciplinary assessment is given to patients with Parkinson's Disease(PD)in combination with treatment by a dedicated team of specifically trained health professionals, compared to usual care. Overall, we anticipate to gain more insight in the clinical effectiveness and health care costs of multidisciplinary treatment in PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Multidisciplinary Care for Parkinson's Disease: a Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PD is a complex disorder, with motor as well as non-motor symptoms. Despite the complexity of PD, management of the disease is often 'monodisciplinary' since most patients are only treated by a neurologist. Stimulating compensatory strategies by allied health professionals might offer additional therapeutic relief, but this assumption is mainly based on theoretical arguments and expert opinion. Even less is known about the claim that a multidisciplinary team of multiple professionals active in complementary domains (e.g. physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy) is superior to management by each of these professionals alone. This study anticipates to provide more insight in the clinical effectiveness and health care costs of multidisciplinary treatment in PD. Therefore, our multidisciplinary care concept (a comprehensive assessment by a dedicated multidisciplinary team and subsequent treatment by specifically trained health professionals) that is tailored to the patients' individual needs will be compared to usual care in terms of effectiveness and costs.</detailed_description>
