	<brief_summary>This study is being performed to prospectively determine whether dacarbazine plus Genasense is significantly better than dacarbazine plus placebo in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced melanoma and low baseline LDH (LDH less than or equal to 0.8 times the upper limit of normal). LDH is a biomarker strongly associated with improved outcomes in a recent trial of dacarbazine plus Genasense.</brief_summary>
