	<brief_title>Effects of Oral Care in the Neuroscience ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with neurological dysfunction requiring intubation and ventilation are at risk for developing ventilator acquired pneumonia. Several studies have suggested that oral hygiene plays a role in the subsequent development of pneumonia for patients in the intensive care unit requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.</detailed_description>
