The aim of this trial is to compare the effect on glycaemic control of liraglutide or exenatide when added to subject's ongoing OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment of either metformin, sulphonylurea or a combination of both in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Two trial periods: A 26 week randomised, followed by a 52 week extension (14 + 38 weeks) where all subjects received liraglutide + OAD after previous randomisation to either liraglutide or exenatide, both combined with OAD treatment.</brief_summary>
