	<brief_summary>This study evaluated renal graft function (based on calcuated creatinine clearance) 12 months after transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of reduced dose or standard dose cyclosporine in combination with sirolimus and corticosteroids. The incidence of acute graft rejection at 6 and 12 months following transplantation and patient and graft survival at 12 months were evaluated also.</brief_summary>
