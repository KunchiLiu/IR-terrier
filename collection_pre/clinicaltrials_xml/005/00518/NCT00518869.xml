	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PG2 as a complementary treatment to conventional chemotherapy among NSCLC patients. In reference to previous studies, "Clinical Benefit Response" and "Incidence of Grade III plus VI Neutropenia" will be used as the primary endpoints in this study. Clinical Benefit Response is a metric measurement including change in cancer or cancer treatment related "fatigue" which is related to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), change in karnofsky performance status and change in weight. The secondary endpoints include patient's global quality of life, and the blood c-reactive protein level which is related to weight change, tumor response, survival time, incidences of myelosuppression (including neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia) and the related G-CSF and antibiotics consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complementary Treatment of PG2 to Improve Clinical Benefit Response and Quality of Life in Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study to evaluate complementary effect of PG2 in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer under conventional chemotherapy. Patients with Stage IIIb-IV non-small-cell lung cancer will be screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria and only eligible patients will be enrolled into this study. All enrolled patients will be randomized to PG2 or Placebo arm and will receive the cisplatin-based chemotherapy treatment (Cisplatin 75mg/m2 and Docetaxel 60mg/m2 on Day1) during the first three 21-day chemo-cycles. Chemo regimen modification is allowable, as usual, in case of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (see Section 6). After randomization, each patient will be administered with PG2 or placebo for 4 days in the 1st week, 3 days in the 2nd week and 3 days in the 3rd week of each chemo-cycle for 3 cycles (Dosing Schedule in Section 6). Total 10 doses will be given in each cycle.</detailed_description>
