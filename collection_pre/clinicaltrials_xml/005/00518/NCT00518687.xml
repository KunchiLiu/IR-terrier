	<criteria>Participant is scheduled to undergo cardiothoracic surgery involving a full median sternotomy (not including cardiac transplantation surgery) within 14 to 60 days after vaccination. Female participants of reproductive potential are required to have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test immediately prior to study vaccination and must use an acceptable form of birth control. Participants had an invasive Staphylococcus aureus infection within the past 3 months prior to study entry. A realistic (&gt;50%) possibility that cardiothoracic surgery will be necessary sooner than 10 days after vaccination. Participant is planning to undergo cardiac transplantation surgery or sternal debridement to remedy an infection resulting from a prior cardiothoracic surgery. Participant has any type of ventricularassist device in place at the time of study entry. Participant has a history of anaphylaxis to any of the vaccine components. Participant received V710 vaccine, any other investigational Staphylococcus aureus vaccine, or investigational Staphylococcus aureus antibodies. Participant has a temperature of ≥100.4ºF (≥38.0ºC), oral equivalent, within 48 hours prior to study vaccination. Participant has impairment of the immune system. Participant has a medical condition in which the expected survival is less than 90 days.</criteria>
