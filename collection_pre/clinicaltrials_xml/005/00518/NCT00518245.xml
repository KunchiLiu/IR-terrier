	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether enoxaparin (an anticoagulant) is effective in the treatment of patients presenting to the emergency room with chest pain and no electrocardiogram or bloodwork evidence of a heart attack, but with other high risk clinical features</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ischemia Driven Enoxaparin Therapy in ACS Presenting as Low Risk (IDEAL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chest pain and abnormal electrocardiogram or bloodwork (biomarker) indicative of a heart attack benefit from anticoagulant therapy such as enoxaparin. However, even patients without abnormalities on the electrocardiogram or bloodwork are at increased risk for heart attack or death, if they have certain clinical risk factors. It is currently not known whether enoxaparin is also beneficial for these patients. Comparison: enoxaparin in addition to optimal standard care at the discretion of the treating physician, versus optimal standard care without enoxaparin</detailed_description>
