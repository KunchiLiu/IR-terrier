	<brief_title>The Effects of ProAlgaZyme on HDL Cholesterol in Individuals With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of mortality in the United States. In 1988, Reaven, et al. published findings that indicate a majority of individuals who developed CVD had multiple concurrent risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Reaven, et al., defined this cluster of risk factors as Syndrome X and hypothesized that insulin resistance was the underlying factor in its development. Over time, metabolic syndrome has been used as a more meaningful term and additional risk factors have been associated with its diagnosis (Grundy, et al. 2004). Metabolic syndrome is an increasingly prevalent problem in the United States and other westernized nations. It is estimated that approximately 50 million Americans have metabolic syndrome. The risk factors linked to metabolic syndrome include: - Abdominal obesity - Atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol) - Elevated blood pressure - Insulin resistance with or without glucose intolerance - Pro-thrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the blood) - Pro-inflammatory state [e.g. elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)in the blood] The management goals for metabolic syndrome include reducing the risk for developing CVD and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, therapy is directed at reducing LDL cholesterol, blood pressure and glucose as well as increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Additional interventions to control blood pressure and lipids provide the next line of treatment for patients with metabolic syndrome. ProAlgaZyme, a novel fermentation product of a freshwater algae ecosystem, will be evaluated in this trial for its effects on circulating lipids. According to the sponsor, ProAlgaZyme is expected to increase the circulating levels of HDL cholesterol while lowering total cholesterol and CRP. ProAlgaZyme was previously tested in a double blind, placebo controlled, pilot trial in 60 subjects with metabolic syndrome (30 subjects per arm), conducted at the University of Yaound√©, Cameroon. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05 or better) improvements were seen in total cholesterol, HDL-C and C-reactive protein when compared to placebo. (In Press - Lipids in Health and Disease) The present study will evaluate the effect of ProAlgaZyme versus placebo on blood lipids and hsCRP in subjects who meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome.</detailed_description>
