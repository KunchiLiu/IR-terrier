Follicular phase (days 812 after first day of menses) daily average less than or equal 2.5 on DRSP scale for nonphysical symptoms only. The average will be calculated for days 812 of the cycle, day 1 being the first day of menstrual bleeding.

Ongoing psychotherapy, which has begun &lt;3months prior to the study visit. 4. Participation in another clinical trial within the last 3 months prior to the screening visit. 5. Known hypersensitivity to Levetiracetam 6. Any disease or condition that can compromise the function of body systems and which could result in altered absorption, excessive accumulation, impaired metabolism, or altered excretion of the study medication. 7. Severe systemic disease that might interfere with the conduct of the study or the interpretation of the results. 8. Uncontrolled thyroid problems. 9.
