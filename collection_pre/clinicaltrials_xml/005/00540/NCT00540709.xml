	<criteria>diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least one year. Subjects with no previous experience with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) or insulin glargine, capable of managing a basalbolus regimen and meeting glycaemic targets in accordance with the protocol. HbA1c &gt; than or = to 6.5 &lt; than or = to 9.0% at screening visit with evidence of lack of insulin secretion (e.g. fasting Cpeptide concentration is &lt; 0.1 nmol/l with fasting blood glucose(FBG) &gt; 126 mg/dl). Previous therapy using insulin glargine or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Lipodystrophy preventing adequate use of CSII. Unwilling or unlikely to be able to use MiniMedr insulin pump with insulin lispro for CSII. Unwilling or unlikely to be able to use an MDI regimen with insulin glargine and insulin lispro in accordance with the protocol (for instance, subjects who routinely use a twicedaily mixed insulin regimen should not be included). History of more than two severe hypoglycaemic episodes in the past 6 months. Acute infection which, in the opinion of the investigator, could lead to increased insulin resistance. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. Episode of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) within the last three months. Active, uncontrolled, advanced diabetic retinopathy. Impaired hepatic function, as shown by &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal range for AST. Impaired renal function, as shown by serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl. History of gastroparesis. Congestive heart failure requiring ongoing pharmacological treatment. Stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or angina pectoris within the last 12 months. Treatment with a nonselective beta blocker. Treatment with inhaled or systemic steroids. History of hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any drug with a similar chemical structure to insulin glargine or insulin lispro or to any of the excipients of the insulin glargine and insulin lispro preparations used in the study. Any malignancy within the last five years, except adequately treated basal cell carcinoma. History within the last two years or current addiction to substances of abuse including ethanol. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
