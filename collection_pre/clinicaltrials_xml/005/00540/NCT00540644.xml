	<criteria>Patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic multiple myeloma based on the following criteria: Presence of an Mcomponent in serum and/or urine plus clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or a documented clonal plasmacytoma PLUS one or more of the following: Calcium elevation (11.5 mg/dl) [42.65 mmol/l] Renal insufficiency (1.5 x the ULN of serum creatinine) Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;=10 g/dl or 2 g/dl &lt;= normal) Bone disease (lytic lesions or osteopenia) Measurable disease is defined at least one of the following three measurements: Serum Mprotein &gt;=1 g/dl ( or 10 g/l) Urine Mprotein &gt;=200 mg/24 h Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level &gt;=10 mg/dl (&gt;=100 mg/l) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal Measurable plasmacytoma NOTE: If a patient meets the criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma but does not meet serum Mprotein, urine Mprotein or serum FLC levels stated above, percent plasma cells in bone marrow will be used to follow response. Laboratory test results within these ranges: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.0 x 109/L Platelet count &gt;= 50 x 10(9)/L Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dl Serum creatinine &lt;= 2.5mg/dL. Total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x upper limit of normal AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;= 3 x ULN Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs. Patients with a solitary plasmacytoma Patients with uncontrolled diabetes Patients with ≥ Grade 3 sensory neuropathy History of cardiac disease, with NYHA Class II or greater</criteria>
