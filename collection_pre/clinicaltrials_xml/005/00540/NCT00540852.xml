	<brief_summary>Optimal management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer remains a complex therapeutic problem. Newly diagnosed breast cancers in the United States with a higher incidence in medically underserved areas. The optimal intensity and duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy still remains controversial due to the difficulty of evaluating response to therapy. The goal would be to prevent over and under treatment of patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring the Response of Chemotherapy on Breast Cancer Tumor by Photon Migration Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Researcher developed a diagnostic device called Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging is a non-invasive optical technique that utilizes intensity-modulated, near-infrared light to quantitatively measure optical properties in thick tissues. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging can images tissue hemoglobin , oxygen saturation, blood volume fraction, water content, fat content and cellular structure. The measurements provide quantitative optical property values that reflect changes in tissue perfusion, oxygen consumption, and cell/matrix development. There is no therapeutic benefit to the subject, especially none that might influence the indication for the diagnostic procedure as indicated. However, information obtained may lead to a new form of non-invasive imaging for the early detection of breast cancer.</detailed_description>
