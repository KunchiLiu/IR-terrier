	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of NESP administered by SC injection in subjects with solid tumours and anaemia receiving multicycle chemotherapy. Subjects in this study enter one of two schedules: Schedule 1 or Schedule 2. Schedule 1 is a sequential dose escalation study which consists of Parts A and B. Part A is the initial treatment phase, where the clinically effective dose (CED) of NESP administered every 3 weeks will be determined after 12 weeks of treatment. Part B is an optional 12-week, open-label, dose-maintenance phase that follows Part A. Schedule 2 is a parallel dose-finding study and also consists of Parts A and B. Part A is the initial treatment phase, where the CED of NESP administered every 4 weeks will be determined after 12 weeks of treatment. Part B is an optional 12-week, open-label, dose-maintenance phase that follows Part A.</brief_summary>
