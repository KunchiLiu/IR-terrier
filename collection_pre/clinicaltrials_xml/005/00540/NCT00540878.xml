	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effects of formulation on the relative bioavailability of SB-751689 (400 mg) administered to healthy postmenopausal women. Subjects will receive a single oral dose of each formulation, with five formulations of SB-751689 tested in total. Blood samples will be taken up to 24 hours postdose after each dose administration. This study will provide information for future possible formulation development of SB-751689 for Phase III.</brief_summary>
