	<criteria>Men aged greater than or equal to 50 years with a history of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH for greater than or equal to 6 months, an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (0 to 35 points scale) of at least 13 points, a maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) between 5 and 12 mL/sec (with a voided volume of greater than or equal to 150 mL), a residual urine volume of less than or equal to 350 mL, and a bothersomeness score (0 to 6 points scale) of at least 3 points. All patients will undergo prostate size assessment by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) if not done within past 12 months. Include, but are not limited to: concomitant lower urinary tract disease; previous prostatic surgery; history of postural hypotension or syncope; concomitant use of medications that may alter the voiding pattern; and clinically relevant biochemical abnormalities. Patients with a serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA) &gt;10 ng/mL will be excluded, and those with an elevated serum PSA between 4 and 10 ng/mL must have prostate cancer excluded to the satisfaction of the investigator. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
