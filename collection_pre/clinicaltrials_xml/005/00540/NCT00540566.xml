	<brief_summary>This study is to compare the ability of optical biopsy. Research can use light enters the skin, collected, analyzed by the computer, and a picture created for the pathologist to conventional histologic examination compare with the pathologist looking at the piece of tissue through a microscope makes the diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Biopsy of Human Skin in Conjunction With Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Optical measurements provide quantitative optical property values that reflect changes in tissue perfusion, oxygen consumption, and cell/matrix development. Each measurement requires less than 5 minutes to execute. The measurements will be taken before and after skin treatment.This non-invasive, non-contact technique has great potential as a means to diagnose different skin problems without the need to obtain a piece of tissue from the skin.</detailed_description>
