	<brief_summary>Overall objective of this work is to identify changes in the optical properties of tissues, and to compare these with conventional semi-quantitative histo-pathological assessment to (1) gain a better understanding of processes involved in oral pathology and (2) develop a non-invasive tool for the detection, diagnosis and screening of oral pathology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Sensor for Photodynamic Detection of Oral Pathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher can use Optical Sensor for imaging the oral tissues. The Imaging system is a non-invasive imaging device and can measure the change in oral tissues. This imaging device is a non-invasive, non-significant risk use for optical tissue biopsy and can reduce procedural complication from clinical standard surgical tissue biopsy procedure. The imaging devices are; 1. Coherence and Doppler Tomography (OCT) 2. Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI) 3. Photon Migration Spectroscopy (PMS) The researcher use toothpaste call Livionex Colgate Product to evaluate oral tissues changes and use the imaging devices to measure the changes of oral tissues.</detailed_description>
