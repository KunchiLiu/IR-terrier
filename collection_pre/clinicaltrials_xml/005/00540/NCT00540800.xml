	<brief_summary>Some chemotherapies, including docetaxel, are better tolerated and just as effective when giving the dose weekly rather than on an every three week basis. The purpose of this study is to compare 2 schedules of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel for the effects on quality of life. Standard every three week chemotherapy will be compared with weekly chemotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BREAST-10: Three-weekly Versus Weekly First-line Chemotherapy for Metastatic or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced breast cancer and patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received an anthracycline will be treated with docetaxel and epirubicin. Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have already received anthracyclines will be treated with docetaxel and capecitabine. All patients will be randomized to receive their treatment either on an every three week schedule, or on a weekly schedule.</detailed_description>
