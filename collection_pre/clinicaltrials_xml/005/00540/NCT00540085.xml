	<brief_summary>Aim: To optimize the use of rocuronium (a neuromuscular blocking agent) in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass or gastric banding. Background: During general anaesthesia, a neuromuscular blocking agent is needed to allow surgery and airway management. Optimal dosing is important in order to avoid inadequately muscle relaxation, but also to avoid overdosage, which can result in prolonged anaesthesia and respiratory complications. Main hypothesis: Rocuronium dosed according to ideal body weight results in shorter duration of action compared to rocuronium dosed according to corrected body weight without prolonged onset time or compromised airway management or surgical demands for muscle relaxation.</brief_summary>
