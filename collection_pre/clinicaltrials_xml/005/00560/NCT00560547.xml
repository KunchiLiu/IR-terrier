	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the long-term maintenance of hemoglobin levels, safety and tolerability of once-monthly intravenous administration of Mircera in hemodialysis patients with chronic renal anemia. Patients currently receiving darboepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa maintenance treatment will receive intravenous Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms/4 weeks (based on the ESA dose administered on week-1). Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range of 10.5-12.5g/dL. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
