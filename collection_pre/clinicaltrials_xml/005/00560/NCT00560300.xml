	<detailed_description>Pediatric patients treated with CCPD who displayed biochemical and bone biopsy proven secondary hyperparathyroidism were randomly assigned to one of 2 vitamin D analogues (calcitriol or doxercalciferol) and one of two phosphate binders (sevelamer or calcium carbonate) in a two by two factorial designed prospective trial. Serum biochemical measurements were obtained at baseline and monthly throughout the 8 months of the trial. Bone biopsy was obtaine at baseline and repeated at study completion.</detailed_description>
