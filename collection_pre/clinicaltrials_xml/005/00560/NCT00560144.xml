	<brief_summary>This 3 arm study will determine the dose of R1507 which will achieve a mean drug exposure in children and adolescents with advanced solid tumors equivalent to the exposure achieved in adults at the recommended dose of 9mg/kg/week. It will also determine the maximum tolerated dose (if appropriate) and the pharmacokinetic profile of R1507. Groups of patients will be sequentially enrolled in one of up to 3 dose levels (3,9mg/kg or a PK-derived dose, not to exceed 16 mg/kg) of R1507 administered weekly by intravenous infusion.An expanded cohort of patients will be enrolled at the optimal dose/MTD. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or dose limiting toxicity, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
