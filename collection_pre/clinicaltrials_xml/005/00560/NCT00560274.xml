	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the safety of NeoRecormon in the correction of anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C who are being treated with Pegylated interferon + ribavirin combination therapy. Patients will receive NeoRecormon at a starting dose of 30,000 IU s.c. which will be adjusted as required to maintain a target Hb of 11-13g/dL. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
