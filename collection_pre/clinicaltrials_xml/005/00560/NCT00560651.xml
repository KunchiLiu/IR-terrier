Corneal Cross Linking is designed to - increase the cornea's mechanical stability - to stop progression of bulging and thinning of the cornea - to prevent the need for corneal transplantation Corneal Cross Linking is performed by 1. Applying Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) eye drops every 2 minutes for 30 minutes to the cornea 2. Illuminating the cornea with UV-light This register of Corneal Cross Linking procedures performed in Germany serves to - gather long-term results - detect rare complications and side-effects - evaluate the efficacy in a large number of patients</brief_summary>
