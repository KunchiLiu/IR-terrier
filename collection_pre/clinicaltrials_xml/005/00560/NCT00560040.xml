	<brief_title>Myocardial Injury is Not Related to Training Levels Among Recreational Participants in the Silicon Valley Marathon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigations have shown increases in cardiac markers consistent with myocardial injury and left ventricular dysfunction in both recreational and elite athletes after endurance exercise. Pre-race training is an important component of endurance events, yet its effect on cardiovascular injury is unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the correlation between myocardial injury and training level in recreational marathon runners utilizing both objective and subjective measures.</detailed_description>
