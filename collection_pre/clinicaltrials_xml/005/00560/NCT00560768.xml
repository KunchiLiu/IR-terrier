	<criteria>Patient has been prescribed the implantation of an SORIN GROUP OvatioTM DR 6550 / VR 6250 system according to relevant currentlyapproved guidelines CHF since &gt; 3 months and LVEF &lt; 35% and NYHA class II or III OR Prior Myocardial infarction since more than 4 weeks and LVEF &lt; 30% Documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia Prior implant of any device for ventricular cardiac pacing Existing indication for permanent ventricular pacing Myocardial infarction within 4 weeks prior to enrollment Arrhythmogenic RVDysplasia Brugada syndrome Long QT syndrome Performed within 3 months prior to enrollment or scheduled (within 3 months) cardiac revascularization (interventional or surgical) Any indication for CRT accordingly to the relevant currentlyapproved ACC/AHA1 or ESC35 guidelines for the implantation of a CRT system. Excisting or planned administration of amiodarone initiation of amiodarone therapy during the run of the study will lead to immediate exclusion of the patient Permanent chronic atrial fibrillation / flutter Patient is unable to attend the scheduled followup visits at the participating centre Patient is already included in another ongoing clinical study Patient is unable to understand the objectives of the study Patient refuses to cooperate Patient is unable or refuses to provide informed consent Patient is minor (less than 18year old) Patient has life expectancy of less than 1 year Patient is pregnant.</criteria>
