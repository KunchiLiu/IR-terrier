	<brief_summary>CP 751,871 is a fully human monoclonal antibody against the Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF-1R). Preclinical and clinical data indicate that CP 751,871 augments the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapy. This study will identify the Maximal Tolerated Dose of CP 751,871 (or the Maximal Feasible Dose) in combination with standard gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced Non-Small Cell Lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of Stage IIIB (N3 and/or T4) or Stage IV NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer in patients 18yearold or older, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy and an adequate organ function (bone marrow, hepatic, renal, and cardiac) within 14 days prior to enrollment. Any prior treatment for NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer including chemotherapy, biologic response modifiers or therapy with any investigational agents. Patients with known brain metastases, spinal cord compression, uncontrolled superior vein cava syndrome or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with gastrointestinal abnormalities including active gastrointestinal bleeding, prediabetes (prefasting glycemia &gt; 120 g/dL and/or glycosylate haemoglobin level &gt; 7.5%), known HIV or AIDSrelated illness, significant active cardiac disease or receiving chronic steroid therapy or concurrent use of growth hormones or growth hormone inhibitors or aminoglycoside antibiotics should be excluded from the study.</criteria>
