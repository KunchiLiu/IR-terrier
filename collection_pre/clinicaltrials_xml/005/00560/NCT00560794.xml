	<brief_title>Phase II Study of the BiTE® Blinatumomab (MT103) in Patients With Minimal Residual Disease of B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presence of leukemia cells below the cytological detection limit (5% leukemic cells) is defined as minimal residual disease (MRD). If no MRD is detectable (&lt; 10^-4 = less than 1 leukemia cell per 10^4 bone marrow cells) a complete molecular remission is reached. In the last years a series of retrospective studies has shown that MRD in adult ALL is an independent prognostic factor as already demonstrated for childhood leukemia. Diagnostic tools for MRD are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or flow cytometry. PCR analysis can detect fusion transcripts such as bcr/abl and individual clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulins (IgH) and/or T-cell receptor genes (TCR). About 25% of patients with MRD defined by rearrangement comprise a high-risk group with a 94% relapse rate within 3 years. In general for patients with MRD, who are not eligible for allogenic stem cell transplantation, curative treatment is not available. This accounts for MRD defined by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation as well as for MRD defined by rearrangement. The current study is set up to address the question of treating MRD positive ALL with the bispecific anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 x anti-CD3 antibody derivative blinatumomab (MT103).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Bprecursor ALL patients in complete hematological remission with molecular failure or molecular relapse starting at any time after consolidation I of frontline therapy within German Multicenter Study Group on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) standards or at any time outside GMALL standards. Patients must have a molecular marker for evaluation of minimal residual disease which is either Breakpoint cluster region/gene on human chromosome #9 (Bcr/abl) at any detection level or individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or Tcell receptor (TCR)genes measured by an assay with a sensitivity of minimum 10^4: At least one individual marker at a quantitative level ≥ 10^4.
