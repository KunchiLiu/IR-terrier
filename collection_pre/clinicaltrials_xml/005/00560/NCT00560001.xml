	<brief_title>MD.2 Medication Dispenser Medication Adherence Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sizeable portion of admissions to hospital and even nursing homes can be avoided if individuals with medication management problems were provided assistive devices to assist with their medications. The MD.2 medication dispenser and monitoring system was developed by Interactive Medical Developments LC and may offer increased support to the elderly with fewer human resources and a substantially reduced cost to the public health system. A rigorous evaluation of this technology has not been conducted. The objective of this Phase III clinical trial (Phase II of this STTR Fast Track Application) is to quantify the benefits of using the MD.2 on health outcomes. The specific aims are to: (1) Quantify healthcare utilization including hospitalizations and emergency room visits for MD.2 clients compared to control clients, (2) Determine the length of time in case management for MD.2 clients compared to control clients, (3) Measure changes in caregiver burden between those with the MD.2 and those with usual medication routines and (4) Determine if cognitive and functional characteristics influence compliance rates among the MD.2 clients and control clients. This study will be conducted in all counties in four of the Area Agencies on Aging in Iowa (who participated in the Phase I study), with the Veteran's Administration(VA)in Iowa, and with Area Agencies on Aging in Illinois. One hundred and fifty clients will be randomized to receive the MD.2 and 150 clients will be randomized to the control group. Primary caregivers for these 300 subjects will also be recruited. Nurses employed by Interactive Medical Developments LC will collect all data. From homecare charts/claims, age, sex, residence, living status, social support, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, cognition, medical conditions and medication lists will be obtained. Enrolled subjects will also complete an interviewer-administered survey of the Geriatric Depression Scale, SF-12 Health Status Inventory, self-reported medication compliance and recent hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Caregivers will complete the Caregiver Burden Interview. Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models will be the primary statistical approaches.</detailed_description>
