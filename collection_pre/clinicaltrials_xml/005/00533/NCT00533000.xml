	<detailed_description>Tobacco smokers suffers from postoperative complications after surgery more extensively than non-smokers. Our primary aim is to study if smoking cessation four weeks prior to elective surgery decreases the number of postoperative complications. Secondary aims is to analyse if smoking cessation four weeks prior to elective surgery decreases wound complications, analyse the effect on abstinence rate, effect on postoperative pain, quality of life and if smoking cessation normalises; the immunological response to surgery. The study is randomised, prospective, multicenter-based trial. Daily smokers are randomised to 1. Control group (standard care) or 2. smoking cessation. Patients randomised to smoking cessation will undergo professional motivational counselling and will receive free nicotine substitution. The study will include elective cases that are scheduled for surgery. Cessation starts 3-5 weeks prior to surgery. All patients are prospectively followed up for four weeks concerning post-operative complications and for one year concerning other outcomes. Outcome (complications) is registered by a blind observer. Analyses will be performed by intention to treat. The intervention group is compared with the control group and an adjustment for possible confounders will be done. There will also be an analysis in the subgroups depending on which surgical procedure was performed.Secondary analyses will be by protocol</detailed_description>
