	<brief_summary>Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the CYP450 and decrease the plasmatic concentration of NNRTI and Protease Inhibitors. In our study we are going to compare the 600 an 800mg doses of efavirenz concomitant of rifampicin use to treat tuberculosis. The hypothesis is that the 800 mg dose would be more adequate than the 600mg</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Concomitant Use of Rifampicin and Efavirenz 600 X 800mg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist in a open label randomized clinical trial comparing efavirenz 600mg QID versus efavirenz 800mg QID in patients with tuberculosis (treated with regimens including rifampicin) and AIDS diagnosis. The total duration of the study is 6 months for each patient. All eligible patient will be treated with a fist line regimen for tuberculosis according to Brazilian guidelines: rifampicin (600mg QID); isoniazid (400mg QID) e pyrazinamide (2g QID) during 6 months for a weight of 45 kg or more and adapted doses for persons with less than 45 kg. For patients with previous history of TB therapy etambutol 1.200mg QID will be added to the regimen. Both groups will receive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)and a non nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to treat HIV. The ITRN of first choice will be zidovudine and lamivudine association. Patients presenting contra indication for the use of those drugs will receive others NRTI. The NNRTI is efavirenz (800 or 600mg). Antiretrovirals will be initiated 30 days after stable TB therapy. In case of adverse events during TB therapy that lead to treatment interruption, the study drugs will be delayed until the 30th day after triple therapy for TB. During HIV therapy NRTI can be changed in case of intolerance</detailed_description>
