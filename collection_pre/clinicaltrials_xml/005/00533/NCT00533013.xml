	<brief_title>Comprehensive Heart Failure Disease Management Community Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure remains a significant cause of death, in spite of recent declines in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease. Heart failure is associated with increasing costs for healthcare, mainly for recurrent hospital admissions. Disease management programs aimed to improve patients outcome while containing healthcare costs,were employed in heart failure patients with varying results. Such programs contain various components, including patient education and empowerment, monitoring patients' adherence to therapy, telemonitoring of vital parameters, etc. Designated heart failure clinics were also employed in care given to these patients.</detailed_description>
