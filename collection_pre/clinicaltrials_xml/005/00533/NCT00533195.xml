	<brief_title>Comparison of UVA1 Phototherapy Versus Photochemotherapy for Patients With Severe Generalized Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will be randomized assigned to UVA 1 phototherapy or to 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy as a first therapy. Besides emollients no additional treatment will be allowed. First a detailed history inclusive drug history will be gathered. The skin type will be determined and a clinical photo will be made. Prior to 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy an ophthalmological examination, blood cell count and blood chemistry will be routinely performed. A determination of the serum level of 5 MOP will be routinely made at the minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) determination before start of the 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy. The serum levels of total Ig E and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) will be additionally determined at the start and at the end of each therapy. In all patients receiving 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy reliable eye protection by wearing photoprotective glasses during the treatment and on the day of taking 5-MOP until night will take place. The skin of the patients should not be exposed to direct sun light or to other artificial UV sources at the day of irradiation. A determination of SCORAD Score will be performed by a blinded investigator at baseline, after 10 and 15 irradiations as well as at every follow-up visit at month 1, 3, 6 and 12. A clinical photo will be made at the beginning of each therapy, at the end as well as at every follow-up visit. In case of a relapse (SCORAD Score &gt; 50 % of initial value), or on patients' request for a premature resumption of the therapy (despite SCORAD Score &gt; 50 %) patients will receive that treatment which have not been performed until now. That means, patients who were treated with 5-MOP UVA as a first therapy will now receive the UVA 1 phototherapy and vice versa. The minimum interval between the two therapies is at least 1 month except in a case of complete non response on the first therapy. Irradiation protocol of the UVA 1 phototherapy: Irradiation 5 x week for 3 weeks (altogether 15 exposures) Determination of the UVA 1 MED prior to treatment Start with 1 MED if MED &lt; 70 J/cm2. Increase of the dose by 20 % every time if there is not an erythematous reaction and by good tolerability until a maximal dose of 70 J/cm2. Irradiation protocol of the 5-MOP UVA photochemotherapy: Irradiation 3 x week for 5 weeks (altogether 15 exposures) Intake of 5-methoxypsoralen (Geralen) 2 hours prior to each irradiation in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg Determination of a minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) prior to treatment Determination of the 5-MOP serum level at the MPD testing Start with 70 % of MPD, no dose increments during the first week. From the second week increase of the UVA dose by 20 % if there is no an erythematous response (respectively by 10 % if there is a light erythemal reaction), but at the earliest 96 hours after the last increment.</detailed_description>
