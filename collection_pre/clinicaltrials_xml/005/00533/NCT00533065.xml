	<brief_summary>The planned study has two purposes: 1. It is to provide evidence that the administration of a cholinesterase inhibitor will result in an increase of IGF-I (primary variable) and in an increase of the secretion growth hormone (secondary variable) that can be maintained throughout the treatment-period of one year. 2. The study also tests the hypothesis that maintenance of increased blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I can stop or delay the age-related changes of body composition (secondary variables) .</brief_summary>
