	<criteria>The participant has histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma that is stage IV (metastatic) The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 01 The participant has completed any prior radiotherapy, biologic/immunotherapy or vaccine therapy (for adjuvant or advanced disease) at least six weeks prior to the first dose of study therapy The participant has adequate hematological functions [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/microliter (μL), hemoglobin ≥ 9 grams/deciliter (g/dL) and platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/μL]. The participant has adequate hepatic function [bilirubin within normal limits (WNL), aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤ 5.0 times the ULN if the transaminase elevation is due to liver metastases] The participant has serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN [or a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 milliliters/minute (mL/min)] The participant's urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis [(UA); if urine dipstick or routine analysis is ≥ 2+, a 24hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 milligrams (mg) of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study] The participant must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN Exclusion Criteria The participant has mucosal or intraocular melanoma The participant has known or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases The participant has had prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic malignant melanoma The participant has had more than one line of biologic, immunologic or vaccinebased therapy for metastatic malignant melanoma (including therapy for adjuvant or advanced disease) The participant has a nonhealing wound or ulcer The participant has a known alcohol or drug dependency The participant is pregnant or breastfeeding The participant has a coexisting medical or psychiatric problem of sufficient severity to limit compliance with the study and/or increase the risks associated with study participation or study drug administration or interfere with the interpretation of study results The participant has an ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social situations, or any other serious uncontrolled medical disorders in the opinion of the investigator</criteria>
