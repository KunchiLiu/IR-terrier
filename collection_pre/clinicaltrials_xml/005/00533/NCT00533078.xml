	<brief_summary>In patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a high proportion will suffer from inflammation of the large bowel (colitis) during their intensive treatment. As there is no standard treatment available for this potentially lifethreatening condition, the investigators focus on the role of parenteral nutrition which these patients inevitably require. Preclinical and clinical data have shown strong anti-inflammatory properties of fish oil preparations containing poly-unsaturated omega3 fatty acids (PUFA) as opposed to other lipid fractions. There may be a therapeutic benefit of adding omega3 PUFA to standard nutrition in patients with chemotherapy-induced colitis. In this small phase II study, the investigators address the effectiveness of this approach to reduce the incidence and severity of colitis in AML patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipid Use, Nutrition, and Colitis in Patients With Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental and clinical data attribute multiple anti-inflammatory effects to a diet enriched in omega-3 PUFA containing oils, mainly FO. These effects are mediated by their active metabolites, the EPA- and DHA-derived eicosanoids, which antagonize the predominantly pro-inflammatory derivates of omega-6 PUFA origin. In cardiovascular disease these data are supported by several large-scale trials, but there also is growing evidence of beneficial effects of an omega-3 PUFA rich diet in GI conditions such as postoperative trauma and inflammatory bowel disease. AML patients with neutropenic colitis suffer from a condition which is pathophysiologically closely related to the studied diseases. It is therefore reasonable to raise the question whether this cohort would equally benefit from a novel nutritional regimen enriched in omega-3 PUFA. The proposed pilot study will address the question of the clinical value of adding an omega-3 PUFA containing lipid emulsion to the TPN regimen as regards protection against colitis ≥ °3 (primary objective). A numerical cutoff will be provided to support the decision whether further investigation is warranted or the intervention is considered not promising. Target accrual is n=35 patients receiving TPN. An interim analysis will be performed after n1=13 patients will be evaluable for the primary endpoint. The results of this interim analysis will determine whether continuation of the trial is of interest or the trial be stopped. The sample size has been calculated by the use of Simon's two-stage minimax design.</detailed_description>
