	<criteria>Males or females 17 years or older with confirmed closure of the tibial epiphyses, with a closed fracture of the tibial diaphysis undergoing treatment with reamed locked IM nailing procedure and the absence of an associated compartment syndrome or vascular injury; Closed tibial fractures Types A, B &amp; C (See OTA fracture classification) can be included. Previous fractures of the same tibia that may impact nailing procedure or impaired visibility of current fracture or a history of osteomyelitis; Subjects with any other clinically significant injuries, which may significantly impair weight bearing of the affected limb; Subjects with a fracture gap of &gt;1cm after initial surgery and prior to drug administration; Any other planned invasive or non invasive interventions intended to promote bone healing of the tibial fracture under study are not allowed in the first 24 weeks after treatment.</criteria>
