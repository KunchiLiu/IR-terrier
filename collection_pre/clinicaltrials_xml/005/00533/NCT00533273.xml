	<brief_summary>This 12-month study had two phases: a 90-day double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase and a nine-month open-label extension phase. Before treatment, eligible subjects were stratified by the primary joint type (30 metacarpophalangeal [MP] joints and 30 proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joints) and by severity of the primary joint contracture (ie, up to 50° or &gt;50° for MP joints and up to 40° or &gt;40° for PIP joints) and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo. Upon completion of the double-blind phase (ie, 90-day evaluation after the first injection), all subjects were eligible to enter the open-label extension phase of the study in which they were followed for an additional nine months. Subjects who required further treatment because they either did not achieve reduction in contracture to 5° or less, the cord affecting the primary joint received placebo, another cord received less than three injections of AA4500, or they had untreated cords that were affecting other joints had the option to receive up to five additional injections of AA4500 0.58 mg in the open-label extension phase, with individual cords receiving up to three injections of AA4500. This study was designed to be part of the larger clinical program, for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, where the data from 2 pivotal Placebo-Controlled studies (AUX-CC-857 [NCT00528606] and AUX-CC-859 [NCT00533273]) and 7 non-pivotal studies were evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Dupuytren Contracture</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of advanced Dupuytren's disease, with a fixed flexion deformity of at least one finger, other than the thumb, that had a contracture at least 20°, but not greater than 100°, for MP (80° for PIP) joints, caused by a palpable cord. Had a positive "table top test," defined as the inability to simultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top. Were naive to AA4500 treatment Were judged to be in good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical examination, and safety laboratory profile. Had a chronic muscular, neurological, or neuromuscular disorder that affected the hands. Had received a treatment for advanced Dupuytren's disease, including surgery (fasciectomy or surgical fasciotomy), needle aponeurotomy/fasciotomy, or injection of verapamil and/or interferon on the selected primary joint within 90 days before the first dose of study drug. Had a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, a disease process that affected the hands, or other medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion, would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study.</criteria>
