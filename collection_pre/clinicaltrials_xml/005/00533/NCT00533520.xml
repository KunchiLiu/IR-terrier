	<brief_title>Evaluation of Dosing Interval of Higher Doses of Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 4 study to test the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of a higher doses (1.0 mg and 2.0 mg) of ranibizumab versus the standard dose (0.5 mg), in adults with age related macular degeneration who have never been treated with ranibizumab. An additional purpose is to determine if the higher doses (1.0 mg and 2.0 mg) of ranibizumab can increase the time between doses beyond that currently needed with the 0.5 mg dose.</detailed_description>
