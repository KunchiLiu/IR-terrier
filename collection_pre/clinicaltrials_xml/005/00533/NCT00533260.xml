	<brief_summary>The basic hypothesis of this trial is that forgetfulness and failure to establish a routine that facilitates medication adherence are prominent reasons for non-adherence. Daily use of the SMS text messages is designed to enhance patient adherence with medication by promoting daily routine and demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS technology within normal clinical practice in The Netherlands. PLEASE NOTE: Seroquel SR and Seroquel XR refer to the same formulation. The SR designation was changed to XR after consultation with FDA.</brief_summary>
