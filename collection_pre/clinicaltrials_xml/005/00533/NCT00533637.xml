	<brief_title>Taste and Local Tolerance Study of NLA Nasal Spray in Patients With Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral or intranasal antihistamines is the first line treatment for allergic rhinitis. Cetirizine is a second-generation selective antihistamine widely used in an oral formulation for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Local administration of cetirizine has been shown to reduce symptoms after allergen challenge, and has the potential to shorten the time to onset and decrease systemic side effects. However, local irritation and nasal burning/pain has been reported after nasal administration. For the compliance of the patients taking a nasal spray, the taste and tolerance of the product is of particular importance. NLA Nasal Spray contains cetirizine in a liposomal formulation aiming to improve the tolerability. The present study aims to compare the NLA Nasal Spray with cetirizine in an aqueous formulation and placebo with regard to taste perversion and local tolerance. This will be investigated off-season in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis after provocation with allergen.</detailed_description>
