	<brief_title>Plug Arterial Closure System (PACS, 7F)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieving hemostasis at the arterial puncture site after percutaneous cardiac catheterization is a potential cause of bleeding, hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and various other vascular complications. Hemostasis at the femoral artery access site after diagnostic or interventional procedures is typically achieved using either manual compression or the deployment of a vascular closure device. Manual compression is time consuming for the health-care provider, and painful for the patient. In addition, prolonged periods of immobilization and bed rest may be required. Vascular closure devices have been developed to avoid manual compression, shorten bed rest, and allow earlier ambulation. The Ensure Medical Vascular Closure device (VCD) is intended for femoral artery puncture site closure in patients who have undergone coronary catheterizations using a standard 7F introducer sheath. The device is comprised of a bio-absorbable plug and a plug delivery system. The plug delivery system is designed to position the bio-absorbable plug to the extravascular surface of the femoral artery access site, facilitating a hemostasis response. The Ensure Medical VCD has been studied in a prior feasibility trial of 149 patients utilizing a 6F introducer sheath, which demonstrated that: (1) the device could be used to successfully obtain rapid hemostasis and early ambulation in patients undergoing catheterization procedures; and (2) the low incidence and relatively minor nature of the observed closure related complications suggests that the device is safe for its intended purpose.</detailed_description>
