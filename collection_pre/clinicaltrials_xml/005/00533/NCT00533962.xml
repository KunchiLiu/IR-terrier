	<brief_summary>Introduction: Ocular administration of glucocorticoids is a common and effective treatment for several ocular diseases. However it is often complicated with the elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Anecortave acetate (AA) is an analog of cortisol acetate and lacks the typical anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticoids. The effect of its anterior juxtascleral depot (AJD) injection has been evaluated in cases of glaucoma caused by intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide, presenting impressive results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the AA injection as a possible antiglaucoma treatment alternative. Methods: A prospective clinical study will be carried out including 30 glaucoma patients (30 eyes). After inclusion each patient will receive a single AJD injection of 30 mg of AA in the selected eye. Main outcome measure include: intraocular pressure at 1st day, 7th day, 1st, 2nd and 3rd months.</brief_summary>
