	<brief_summary>THis study aims to determine whether frequent dosing of intravitreal injections of Ranibizumab (Lucentis) or Bevacizumab (Avastin), which act as VEGF inhibitors, has a deleterious effect on the retina, studied by electrophysiologic testing. This prospective, non-randomized clinical study will include patients assigned to intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab due to neovascular AMD. The patients will undergo repeat ophthalmic evaluation and intravitreal injections every 4-6 weeks, as long as will be deemed necessary. Periodic electrophysiologic evaluation including Electroretinogram (ERG), electro-oculogram (EOG) and Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) tests will be performed every 3 months.</brief_summary>
