Have been treated with drugs that promote weight loss (for example, Adipex® [phentermine], Acomplia® [rimonabant], Xenical® [orlistat], Meridia® [sibutramine], Acutrim® [phenylpropanolamine], or similar overthecounter medications) within 3 months of screening. Have been treated for longer than 2 weeks with any of the following excluded medications within 3 months prior to screening: *Insulin; *Alphaglucosidase inhibitors (for example, Glyset® [miglitol] or Precose® [acarbose]); *Meglitinides (for example, Prandin® [repaglinide] or Starlix® [nateglinide]); *Sulfonylureas (for example, Glucotrol® [glipizide] or Micronase® [glyburide]); *Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors (for example, Januvia™ [sitagliptin]) Have donated blood within 60 days of screening.</criteria>
