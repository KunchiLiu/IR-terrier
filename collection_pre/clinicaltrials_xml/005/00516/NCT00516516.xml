	<brief_title>Oral Carnitine for Cramps in Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle cramps occur frequently among pregnant women, and few therapeutic options exist. This is a study of oral L-carntine, a dietary supplement, for the treatment of muscle cramps in pregnancy. The conceptual basis for this study comes from the fact that carnitine has been used effectively in multiple randomized trials for the treatment of muscle cramps in other carnitine deficient states (such as hemodialysis). In pregnancy, women have decreased serum carnitine concentrations (from decreased intake, increased clearance by the kidney, and increased demands from the fetus). Thus, our hypothesis is that carnitine will alleviate or eliminate muscle cramps experienced by pregnant women.</detailed_description>
