	<brief_summary>Acute low back pain is one of the most common reasons for all physician visits(1). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a potent inflammatory mediator, has demonstrated to be released by discs following injury(4). Clinical practice and animal research suggest that lumbar radicular pain is the result of inflammation of the nerve root in the epidural space(5). The study will evaluate the efficacy of intravenous Dexamethasone for acute disc herniation-induced sciatica. 40 patients aged 18 years or older, who will be transferred to the emergency room due to sciatic pain will be blindly randomized to receive Dexamethasone 30 mg IV for 3 days an tapering off, 10 mg daily, or normal saline. 20 patients will be in each group. The patients will continue their standard care during the study period. Follow up will last for 3 months. Mann-Whitney test will be used for parametric correlation, Wilcoxon for numeral and xÂ² for categorial variables. Dexamethasone IV can help physicians in treating patients with acute sciatic pain.</brief_summary>
