	<brief_summary>Over the past decade, avian influenza (AI) has become a major health concern. The development of safe and effective vaccines against avian strains infecting people is important. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a new AI vaccine in healthy adults against the H7N3 strain of avian influenza.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Group Study of the Safety of and Immune Response to a Bird Flu Vaccine (H7N3) in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current pandemic risk associated with avian influenza H7N3 infection is significant as an increasing number of humans are infected. H7 influenza transmission usually occurs in humans when they are exposed through direct contact to infected poultry or surfaces and objects contaminated by infected poultry feces. A pandemic occurs when a new influenza subtype emerges that infects humans, causes serious illness, and spreads easily between humans. The development of a safe and effective vaccine is necessary, should a pandemic occur. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated AI virus vaccine, H7N3 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 x A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca). This study will last approximately 90 days. Participation in this study includes two 12-day hospital stays in an isolation unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. All participants will receive two doses of vaccine in nasal spray form, at study entry and sometime between 4 and 8 weeks after initial vaccination. Participants will be admitted to the isolation unit 2 days prior to each vaccination. A targeted physical exam, vital signs measurement, and a nasal wash will occur daily following each vaccination until discharge. Participants will be discharged after three consecutive nasal washes on or after Day 6 are negative. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the study. A follow-up outpatient visit will occur approximately 4 weeks following each vaccination.</detailed_description>
