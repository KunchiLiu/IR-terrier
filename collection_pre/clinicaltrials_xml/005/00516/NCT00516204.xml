	<brief_summary>A screening project of diabetics with a very high cardiovascular risk (e.g. diabetes plus coronary heart disease) who already receive cholesterol-lowering therapy. Lipid profile and rate of patients who are treated to target (which is &lt;70mg/dl for such patients with very high risk) are screened. The doctors therapy decisions after the screening will be documented and 8-10 weeks later the lipid profile of each patient will be evaluated again. Our aim is to evaluate dosing habits, to evaluate how many patients are treated to their LDL-C target and to underline the importance of treating patients to their cholesterol targets.</brief_summary>
