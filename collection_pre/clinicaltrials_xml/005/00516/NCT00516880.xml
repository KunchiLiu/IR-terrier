	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and are related to the presence of accelerated atherosclerosis. Our recent data showed that inflammation predicts mortality and cardiovascular death, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors in peritoneal dialysis patients. As a considerable proportion of peritoneal dialysis patients showed evidence of inflammation, it raises an important question as to whether anti-inflammatory treatment has any cardiovascular and survival benefit in these patients. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-g) agonist is a class of drug with insulin sensitizing property. Recent experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that this class of drug has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties other than insulin sensitizing effect in type 2 diabetics. We therefore hypothesize that modulation of the PPAR-g activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing inflammation and retarding the progression of atherosclerosis and possibly lowering mortality in our peritoneal dialysis patients.</brief_summary>
