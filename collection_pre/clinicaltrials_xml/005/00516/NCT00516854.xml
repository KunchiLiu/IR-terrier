	<brief_summary>Non-cardiac chest pain is a common clinical problem encountered in our practice but at present, the results of treatments are unsatisfactory. The pathogenesis remains unknown but altered motility of the esophagus and psychological factors including anxiety have been implicated as important factors. Reports of the single use of anticholinergic drugs and anxiolytics have yielded conflicting results, has been demonstrated to yield marginal or of no value. However the use of the combination therapy, especially with a double blind fashion have not been reported. On that basis, we propose to use a combination of anti-cholinergic and tranquilliser for the symptomatic treatment of non-cardiac chest pain. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy of anti-cholinergic and anxiolytic drugs in the treatment of non-cardiac chest pain.</brief_summary>
