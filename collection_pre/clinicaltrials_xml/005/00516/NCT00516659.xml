	<brief_title>ETEC Logistics Trial (TREK)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the incidence of ETEC illness in a field setting and to compare the safety of LT delivered by TCI with placebo. The secondary objectives include, but are not limited to: evaluate the stool frequency per episode of ETEC illness in placebo recipients, to evaluate the immunogenicity of LT delivered by TCI, to evaluate the incidence of IBS following travel to areas of ETEC endemnicity, and to evaluate the incidence of VPO in placebo and LT patch recipients.</detailed_description>
