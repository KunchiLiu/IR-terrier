	<brief_title>Study of Bedside EEG to Evaluate Brain Injury in Premature Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient enrollment and electroencephalographic (EEG) and clinical data collection stopped May 2009. Data analysis is ongoing, and results have been described (O'Reilly D, Navakatikyan MA, Filip M, Greene D, Van Marter LJ. Peak to Peak Amplitude in Neonatal Brain Monitoring of Premature Infants. Clin Neurophysiol 2012 May 16), via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Another manuscript has been completed and is undergoing revision for resubmission. We anticipate several additional articles will be completed from the data collected during this study. There is no relationship between industry and no current funding for this study. We maintain institutional review board approval due to ongoing data analysis.</detailed_description>
