	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Baclofen-amitriptyline-ketamine (BAK) gel may lessen peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether BAK gel is more effective than a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy . PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying BAK gel to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Baclofen-Amitriptyline Hydrochloride-Ketamine Gel in Treating Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effectiveness of baclofen-amitriptyline hydrochloride-ketamine (BAK) gel versus placebo, in terms of improving sensory neuropathy, in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Secondary - Compare motor and autonomic symptoms and functioning, mood states, pain, and peripheral neuropathy in these patients. - Assess the adverse event profile of topical BAK gel. - Explore whether topical BAK gel is absorbed systemically. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy (active vs non-active), current use of opioids or oral pain medications (yes vs no), pain rating (4-7 vs 8-10), and prior ineffective pharmacologic treatment for peripheral neuropathy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients apply 1 spoonful of baclofen-amitriptyline hydrochloride-ketamine gel topically to each area of pain, numbness, and/or tingling on the feet and/or hands twice daily for 4 weeks. - Arm II: Patients apply 1 spoonful of placebo gel topically to each area of pain, numbness, and/or tingling on the feet and/or hands twice daily for 4 weeks. Some patients in both arms may choose to continue on the active gel or, if on placebo, begin the active gel for an additional 8 weeks off study. Patients complete health, pain, mood, and quality of life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study. Patients also record adverse symptoms weekly in a Symptom Experience Diary.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of cancer Received or currently receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy including, but not limited to, taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel or docetaxel); platinumbased compounds (e.g., carboplatin, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin); vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine or vinblastine); or other neurotoxic chemotherapy agents (e.g., bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide) Must have pain or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy attributable to chemotherapy for ≥ 1 month Neuropathy is limited to either hands and/or feet where gel can be applied Neuropathic pain score of ≥ 4 out of 10 on the numbness/tingling/pain numeric analogue scale No preexisting or history of peripheral neuropathy due to any cause other than chemotherapy (e.g., diabetes, alcohol, toxin, heredity) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 02 Life expectancy ≥ 4 months Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal Not pregnant or nursing No ability to bear children defined by 1 of the criteria: Menopausal (12 months and no menstrual period if natural menopause) Underwent a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy Permanent surgical sterilization (tubal ligation) Fertile patients must use effective contraception Able to complete questionnaires independently or with assistance Able to sign informed consent and understand the nature of a placebocontrolled trial No history of an allergic reaction to baclofen, amitriptyline hydrochloride, and/or ketamine No diagnosis of any New York Heart Association class IIV congestive heart failure No diagnosis of coronary artery disease including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, within the past 5 years No other medical condition that, in the opinion of the treating physician or allied health professional, would make this clinical trial unreasonably hazardous for the patient No skin abnormalities at the intended application sites (hands and feet) of study gel (i.e., skin breakdown) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics More than 30 days since prior anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or other neuropathic pain medication (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topical lidocaine patch or gel, capsaicin cream, or amifostine) Patients treated with any of these agents for peripheral neuropathy for ≤ 1 week during the past 30 days are eligible provided they are no longer taking the agent More than 5 years since prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft Prior heart valve replacement surgery allowed provided patient has fully recovered from the surgery No concurrent use of study agents other than as specified in the trial</criteria>
