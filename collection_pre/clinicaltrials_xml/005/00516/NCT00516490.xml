	<brief_summary>A single dose GnRH agonist administration in the luteal phase of assisted reproduction cycles was reported to increase pregnancy and birth rates. This study was done to evaluate the reproducibility of previous findings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GnRH Agonist Administration in the Luteal Phase of ICSI-ET Cycles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GnRH agonist administration in the luteal phase was reported to beneficially affect clinical outcome of ICSI-ET cycles. This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effect of a single dose GnRH agonist administered in the luteal phase on the outcome of ICSI - ET cycles stimulated with the long GnRH agonist protocol. Women undergoing embryo transfer following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with a long GnRH agonist protocol were included. In addition to routine luteal phase support with progesterone women were randomized to receive a single dose of GnRH agonist or placebo on the sixth day after ICSI.Ongoing pregnancy rate was the primary outcome measure.</detailed_description>
