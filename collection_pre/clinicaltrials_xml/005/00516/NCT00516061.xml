	<brief_summary>Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) appears to play a central role in the process leading to peritoneal angiogenesis and increased level of VEGF may contribute to high peritoneal small-solute transport rate (PSTR) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients in adult. In children, lymphatic absorption of solute is greater than adult. VEGF-C is related to lymphogenesis, but its role in peritoneal solute transport rate is not known. In this study, we evaluated possible relationship between dialysate VEGF and VEGF-C levels and PSTR in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship of Peritoneal Solute Transport Rate With VEGF in Children Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There was significant correlation between dialysate VEGF165 and VEGF-C levels and significant correlation was noted between dialysate VEGF165 and PSTR. Interestingly, dialysate VEGF-C levels had significant correlation with PSTR. High PSTR seems to be related to elevated VEGF-C and VEGF.</detailed_description>
