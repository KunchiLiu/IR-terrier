Hypersensitivity to chlorine or quinolones. 11. Need for any additional concomitant systemic antibacterial agent other than the study drug(s). 12. Concomitant glucocorticoid doses (&gt; 5mg prednisone a day or equivalent). 13. Adjuvant therapy with hyperbaric oxygen or topical formulations containing growth factors, antimicrobials or enzymatic debriders. 14. A history of diseases of immune function (HIV, chronic granulomatous disease). 15. Any medical condition that, in the investigator´s opinion, will require dose modification of Levofloxacin to less than 750 mg a day. 16.
