	<brief_summary>Adults admitted to intensive care units are at risk for a variety of complications. Infections due to the fungus called candida are of particular concern. The study will test the possibility that caspofungin, a new therapy for fungal infections, can successfully reduce the rate of candida infections in subjects at risk. It will also test if caspofungin is useful in treating subjects for this disease when diagnosed using a new blood test that is performed twice weekly, permitting earlier diagnosis than current practice standards.</brief_summary>
