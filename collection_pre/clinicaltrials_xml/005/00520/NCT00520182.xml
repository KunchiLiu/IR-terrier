	<brief_summary>Obese patients with type 2 diabetes often fail to loose weight and thus do not succeed in improving their sugar and lipid profiles and remain at high risk for diabetes complications The study enrolled 259 obese diabetic patients attending HMO clinics in central Israel. Over a 6 month period the participants met with a dietitian every fortnight and attended group lectures every 2 months. The objective of this intervention was to compare three dietary intervention along with close monitoring of the patients by dietitians, regarding blood lipid and sugar balance as well as weight loss. The three diets are the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet from 2003; a diet containing low glycemic index carbohydrate otherwise similar to the ADA diet; and a low glycemic index diet with more fat than the other 2 diets with high proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Patients were individually randomized to receive one of the three diets. Among the measures obtained every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter are weight, fasting insulin and glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood and urine chemistry profiles and lipid profile.</brief_summary>
