	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate influence of atorvastin on the repolarisation phase of cardiomyocytes. If there is any, it could be a part of positive "non-lipid" effect of statins in therapy of ischaemic heart disease. Study hypothesis: atorvastin will decrease heterogeneity of repolarisation of cardiomyocytes in comparison with placebo</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Influence of Atorvastatin on the Repolarisation Phase of Cardiomyocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The group will consist of 40 healthy volunteers. The study will be mono-centric. The repolarisation phase of cardiomyocytes will be evaluated using long - term 12-lead digital ECG monitoring. There will be 3 single ECG recordings - randomly after 20 mg of atorvastin, 80 mg of atorvastatin and placebo, respectively.</detailed_description>
