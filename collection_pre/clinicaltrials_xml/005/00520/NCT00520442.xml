	<detailed_description>A clinical trial comparing ibuprofen and acetaminophen with codeine for children after discharge from the emergency department. We hypothesize that Ibuprofen will provide 20% more effective analgesia compared to acetaminophen with codeine in children with uncomplicated forearm fractures. A random table will be used to generate an assignment of the participants to either ibuprofen or acetaminophen with codeine. Assessment of the child's pain severity, pain medication use, functional limitations and parental satisfaction will allow for identification of a difference in the management of pain in the first 72 hours after a forearm fracture. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze demographic data.</detailed_description>
