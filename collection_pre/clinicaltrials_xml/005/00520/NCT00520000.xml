	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, the best way to give, and the best dose of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given once weekly for 3 weeks when administered with carboplatin given once every 4 weeks. - Determine the MTD of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given once every 3 weeks when administered with carboplatin given once every 3 weeks. - Determine the MTD of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given in weeks 1 and 2 when administered with carboplatin given once every 3 weeks. - Evaluate sequence-dependent effects on toxicity and pharmacokinetics in the combination of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin. Secondary - Explore the antitumor activity of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given once weekly or once every 3 weeks. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm III: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arms I and II undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.</detailed_description>
