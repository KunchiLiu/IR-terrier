	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test whether increasing the total intake of antioxidants to middle-aged smoking men increases the antioxidant defence, reduces oxidative damage, and improves biomarkers for oxidative stress. The secondary objectives is to test whether this strategy improves other cardiovascular risk markers including platelet function, lipid levels, inflammation, and markers of endothelial damage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oslo Antioxidant Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study men smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily will be invited to participate. We will only include individuals with high cardiovascular risk (men rather than women, smokers rather than nonsmokers, middle-aged to elderly rather than young individuals), in order to recruit people with presumed high oxidative stress who might be most likely to show an effect and benefit from our intervention. at the time of inclusion, participants will be randomized to three groups; control group, kiwi group or phytochemical group. The kiwi group will consume three kiwis a day, whereas the phytochemical group will consume an array of antioxidant-rich food stuffs. The intervention period is eight weeks. Blood samples will be collected before and after the intervention period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men aged 4575 years Daily smoker of a minimum of 5 cigarettes a day BMI &lt;35 kg/m2 (because of difficulties that may be experienced by morbidly obese individuals in following the diet) Stable weight range of 4 kg or less during the previous 12 weeks Any symptomatic CVD (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, CABG, PCI, CHF, NYHA class IIIIV) Diabetes type I or type II taking drugs for diabetes Following a vegetarian diet or nearvegetarian diet currently Allergy to nuts, kiwi fruits, chocolate, strawberries or tomatoes Clinical disorders including gastrointestinal disease impairing compliance with dietary recommendations History of serious or unstable medical or psychiatric disorder Current use of or need of lipid lowering drug treatment, aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), according to assessment of the primary clinical investigator. Any "over the counter" headache/ pain or cold remedies taken during the study must not contain aspirin or aspirin like drugs such as ibuprofen. These are classed as and will interfere with platelet function, making them unresponsive for a period of 1014 days. Paracetamol, however, can be taken as an alternative if required History of alcohol/or drug abuse Participation in a drug trial during the previous 30 days Use of drugs (Xenical, Reductil), nutritional supplements or herbs for weight loss within the 4 weeks prior to visit 2 or participation in an active weight reduction program Use of single vitamin or other antioxidants (must be stopped 4 weeks prior to visit 2) Individuals judged by the clinical investigator to be unable to follow instructions and procedures of the study.</criteria>
