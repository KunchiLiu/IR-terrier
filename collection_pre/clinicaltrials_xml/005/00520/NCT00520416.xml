	<brief_summary>Endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) requires a contrast agent to identify the vascular anatomy and placement of the stent graft. Iodine contrast has traditionally been used, but has the potential to harm the kidneys. Another contrast agent is carbon dioxide gas. It has been proven safe to use, but the quality of the images it creates needs to be compared to iodine contrast. Patients in this study undergo the endovascular AAA repair as they normally, with the iodine contrast. At the end of surgery carbon dioxide gas contrast is given as an extra step. The images will be later evaluated.</brief_summary>
