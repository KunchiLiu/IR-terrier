	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Vivaglobin in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with primary immunodeficiency (PID) over a 25-week observation period. The purpose is to investigate whether PUPs will respond to subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) treatment with adequate trough levels without first receiving immunoglobulins by the intravenous route by demonstrating that 100 mg immunoglobulin G/kg body weight (IgG/kg bw) administered on 5 consecutive days (i.e. resulting in a total dose of 500 mg IgG/kg bw) results in an IgG increase to ≥ 5 g/L on Day 12 after initiation of SCIG therapy.</brief_summary>
