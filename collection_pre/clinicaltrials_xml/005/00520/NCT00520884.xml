	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see if giving women a hormone called "ghrelin" will increase levels of growth hormone in the blood and increase appetite. Ghrelin is a naturally occurring hormone that is produced mostly by the stomach and causes secretion of another hormone called growth hormone. It also increases short-term appetite and may lower the amount of inflammation in the body. Some people lose their appetite as they age and have unintentional weight loss. This may be caused by a break in the communication between the stomach and the brain. We are particularly interested in seeing if there is a difference in the effects of ghrelin in older women who have lost weight recently without wanting to and those who have not.</brief_summary>
