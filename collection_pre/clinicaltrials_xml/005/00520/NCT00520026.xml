	<brief_title>Suicide Prevention by Lithium - the Lithium Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that there is a significantly increased risk of suicide related mortality in patients with a positive history of suicide attempts. This study is the first prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center trial focussing on the proposed suicide preventive effects of lithium in patients with suicidal behavior but not suffering from bipolar disorder or recurrent major depressive disorder. Patients with a recent history of a suicide attempt are treated with lithium or placebo during a 12 month-period. The hypothesis is that lithium treatment will lead to a 50 % reduction of suicidal behavior.</detailed_description>
