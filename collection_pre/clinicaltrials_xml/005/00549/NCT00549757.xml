	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether, in patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing disease of the heart and the circulatory system and/or the kidney, aliskiren at a target dose of 300 mg once daily (compared to placebo), on top of conventional treatment, reduces death and disease caused by the heart, the circulatory system and the kidney. AMENDMENT 4 RATIONALE (MARCH 2012) : Protocol amendment 4 served to address the data monitoring committee recommendation dated 14 Dec 2011 to discontinue study treatment in all participating patients. It also addressed the subsequent Health Authorities request to implement a 12 month safety follow-up period (actual duration was 9 months in average) post study drug discontinuation.</brief_summary>
