	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study (TOTXVI) is to compare the clinical benefit, the pharmacokinetics, and the pharmacodynamics of polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEG) asparaginase given in higher dose (HD PEG) versus those of PEG-asparaginase given in conventional dose (CD PEG) during the continuation phase. This study has several secondary objectives: Therapeutic Objectives: To estimate the event-free survival and overall survival of children with ALL who are treated with risk-directed therapy. To study whether intensifying induction, including fractionated cyclophosphamide and thioguanine, in patients with day 15 MRD &gt; 5%, will result in improved leukemia cytoreduction in this subgroup compared to TOTXV. To assess whether intensification of central nervous system (CNS)-directed intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy will improve outcome in patients at high risk of CNS relapse. Exploratory Pharmacologic Objectives: To identify pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictors for treatment-related outcomes in the context of the systemic therapy used in the protocol. To compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PEG-asparaginase given in higher dose (3,500 or 3,000 units/m2) versus those of PEG-asparaginase given in conventional dose (2,500 units/m2) in the continuation phase. Exploratory Biologic Objectives: To determine the prognostic value of levels of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood at day 8 of remission induction. To validate new markers and methods for MRD detection. To genotype natural killer (NK) cell receptors and measure their expressions at diagnosis and before reinduction, and to associate these features with treatment outcome. To identify new prognostic factors by applying new technologies to study patient material (e.g., stored plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and normal and leukemic cells). Exploratory Neuroimaging Objectives: To use quantitative MR measures (Diffusion Tensor Imaging and high resolution volumetric imaging) to assess differences in myelin and cortical thickness development in patients treated for ALL relative to healthy controls matched for age and gender. To assess the impact of folate pathway genetic polymorphisms on myelin and cortical thickness development and neurocognitive performance. To assess the impact of frontal-parietal lobe myelin and cortical thickness development on neurocognitive performance in attention, working memory, fluency, visual-spatial reasoning and processing speed.</brief_summary>

Vincristine2 mg/m2 IV push (max 2 mg), Day 1 (0.05mg/kg for patients &lt; 1 year or &lt; 10 kg). PEG-ASP 2,500 vs 3,500 units/m2 IV randomization (until week 30) Dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase will be given regardless of blood counts, provided that the patient is clinically well. Cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate will be held if WBC &lt;1000/mm3 or ANC &lt;300/mm3. Mercaptopurine and methotrexate will be reduced for WBC &lt; 1500/mm3, or if WBC and ANC do not increase by at least 2 folds a week after the start date of dexamethasone pulse. Doses of cyclophosphamide and cytarabine may need to be reduced if patient misses 25% of chemotherapy and if the low counts deem to be related to this combination. The same treatment (weeks 30-37) will be repeated for a total of 5 times, until week 69 (see Section 5.5.3 for intrathecal therapy). After week 69, all patients will receive daily mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate interrupted with pulses of dexamethasone, vincristine, and mercaptopurine every 4 weeks. The dose of dexamethasone will be decreased to 6 mg/m2 between week 69 and week 101, after which only mercaptopurine and methotrexate will be given. Intrathecal treatment will be given every 8 weeks only to patients at risk of CNS relapse after week 49 and will be discontinued after week 97. Continuation therapy will be discontinued after 120 weeks. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (for patients who meet the criteria of high-risk ALL are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). However, if the option is declined by the patients or guardians, or the procedure is deemed unsuitable by the attending physician and the principal investigator, the patient will remain on study and continue to receive chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
