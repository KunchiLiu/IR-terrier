	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether a standardized Pilates exercise program can effectively strengthen pelvic floor muscles when compared with conventional pelvic muscle rehabilitation. Urinary incontinence is a widespread problem that affects 10-40% of all ambulatory women and pelvic floor muscle training is an effective treatment for this problem. However, its efficacy is proportionate to the effort expended. Even among women who are diligent with pelvic muscle rehabilitation, long term follow-up reveals that benefits are lost in the absence of maintenance exercises. While this intervention is effective, recent studies demonstrate that long term adherence to treatment is low. As compliance appears to be a prerequisite to achieving sustained benefit, finding a method of pelvic muscle strengthening that better lends itself to long term commitment could prove beneficial. The currently popular exercise program, known as Pilates (named after founder, Joseph Pilates) consists of a series of low impact, flexibility and muscle toning exercises. The philosophy centers around developing core strength which includes strengthening the pelvic floor. Its use has been described in the US since the 1920s.4 Five million Americans currently participate, as opposed to five thousand ten years ago.5 Given its mainstream popularity, Pilates would be an appealing as a therapeutic modality for women experiencing pelvic muscle weakness. Currently, there are no studies that assess the efficacy of Pilates in increasing pelvic muscle strength.</brief_summary>
