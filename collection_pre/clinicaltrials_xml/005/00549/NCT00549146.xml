	<brief_summary>Relatively little information is available about the effects of salmeterol/fluticasone combination and fluticasone alone in COPD patients with a partial reversible pulmonary obstruction. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of salmeterol/fluticasone combination with fluticasone alone delivered via Diskus/ACCUHALER inhaler in subjects with COPD on lung function over a 1 year period.</brief_summary>
