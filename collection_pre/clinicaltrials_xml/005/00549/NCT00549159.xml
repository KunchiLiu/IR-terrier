	<criteria>Willingness and adequate mental capacity to sign written, informed consent Willingness to adhere to study plan regarding control visits and recording of PBLAC &gt; 30 years old Premenopausal as determined by FSH ≤30 Agree not to use hormonal contraception or any other intervention for bleeding during study Suitable for local and/or general anesthesia A minimum PBLAC score of ≥ 150 for three months prior to study enrollment; OR PBLAC score 150 for one month for women who 1) had at least 3 (documented) prior months of failed medical therapy; 2) had a contraindication to medical therapy; or 3) refused medical therapy Uterine cavity sound measurement ≥ 4 cm and ≤ 10 cm. Presence of bacteriaemia, sepsis, or other active systemic infection Active pelvic inflammatory disease Clotting defects or bleeding disorders Unwillingness to use a nonhormonal birth control postablation Desire for future fertility Abnormal cavity as confirmed by hysteroscopy, transvaginal ultrasound or HSG e.g. large fibroids, septum etc. Small submucosal fibroids defined as &lt; 2 cm are in this context not considered abnormal. Any condition leading to possible uterine wall weakness with total wall thickness &lt; 15 mm e.g. at c.section, postmyomectomy scars etc. In case of uniform uterine wall the wall thickness at the fundus should be measured. Premalignant or malignant uterine condition within the last five years as confirmed by histology Pregnancy Cervical length &gt; 6 cm. Uterine cavity &gt;30 ml defined as balloon can be filled with 30ml glucose solution without reaching the target pressure of 240 mmHg. (These patients may still be treated as planned but will be withdrawn from the study and their data will be analysed separately. The patients will be recorded as screening failures). Previous ablation or subtotal hysterectomy</criteria>
