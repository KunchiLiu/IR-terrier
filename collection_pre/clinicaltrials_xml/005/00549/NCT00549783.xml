	<brief_summary>This is a study to investigate if patients who have had a stroke and suffer from spasticity might benefit from being given BOTOX® in addition to the normal Standard Care. Spasticity is characterized by stiffness or frequent cramps accompanied by pain and abnormal movements and can prevent the carrying out of everyday tasks such as walking and getting dressed. BOTOX® is a neurotoxin, which is used to prevent the contraction of muscle fibre and has been shown to reduce spasticity significantly. Patients will be enrolled in this study at about 33 locations in Europe and Canada. Study participation will last for about 1 year.</brief_summary>
