	<brief_summary>This study used two doses of rivastigmine transdermal patch (5 cm^2, 10 cm^2) to establish the feasibility of 2 switch schedules (with transdermal patch one-step dose titration or without dose titration) from rivastigmine capsules (3 mg bid (bis in die, twice a day), 4,5 mg bid, 6 mg bid) to rivastigmine transdermal patch and to assess safety, tolerability, convenience, and caregivers preferences of rivastigmine transdermal patch versus capsules.</brief_summary>

A medical or neurological condition other that AD that could explain the patients dementia (eg, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's Disease, abnormal thyroid function test, B12 or folate deficiency, posttraumatic conditions, syphilis) Current diagnosis of an active skin lesion/disorder that would prevent accurate assessment of the adhesion and potential skin irritation of the patch (e.g., atopic dermatitis, wounded or scratched skin in the area of the patch application) History of allergy to topical products containing vitamin E Taken any of the following substances prior to randomization: succinylcholinetype muscle relaxants during the previous 2 weeks an investigational drug during the previous 4 weeks Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to the study.</criteria>
