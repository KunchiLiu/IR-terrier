	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information about genetic changes in patients with lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast may help doctors learn more about the disease and find better methods of treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the genetics of women with lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetics of Women With Lobular Carcinoma in Situ of the Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Identify inherited variation that predisposes women to develop lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the breast. - Identify the frequency of these variants and determine the effect they have on tumor risk. - Determine how worthwhile it would be to test for these variants in the clinical setting so that those at higher risk could be identified, counseled, and screened. Secondary - Analysis of genetic changes within LCIS with the aim of identifying cases of LCIS which may progress to invasive cancer. OUTLINE: Patients and control participants undergo blood collection. DNA is extracted from blood samples and used to genotype at selected polymorphisms, compare allele frequencies (used to associate alleles with disease) using a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen. Archival tumor samples (if available) from patients are used for DNA-, RNA-, or protein-based analyses. All participants complete a questionnaire about family history, a brief medical history, and provide epidemiological data to a genetic counselor. Participants identified to be at risk for known hereditary predisposition to cancer will be referred to a clinical genetics service. Individual results of this study are not disclosed to participants. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 participants (1,000 patients and 1,000 matched controls) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
