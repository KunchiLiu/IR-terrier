	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine if there are any alterations in serotonin levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and if this is associated with increased constipation. OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to beginning of planned postoperative chemotherapy, after 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy, and at the 3-month surveillance visit. Patients also complete a bowel function questionnaire at these time points.</detailed_description>
