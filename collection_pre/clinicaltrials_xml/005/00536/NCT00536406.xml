	<brief_title>Evaluating a Behavioral Activities Treatment Program for Depressed Nursing Home Residents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a common mental disorder that affects nearly half of all older people living in nursing homes. Depression can severely impact people's lives, causing them to often feel sad and hopeless, as well as affect people's sleep patterns, concentration, and energy levels. In addition, nursing homes are often understaffed and very busy, making it difficult for older people with depression to receive a proper diagnosis and adequate treatment. Recent studies have shown that an increase in pleasurable activities among residents in nursing homes can improve symptoms of depression. The purpose of this study is to determine whether symptoms of depression can be reduced by increasing opportunities for nursing home residents to engage in pleasant events and build better relationships with nursing home staff members. Participating nursing homes will be randomly assigned to have their residents receive behavioral activity treatment (BE-ACTIV) or treatment as usual for 12 weeks. Potential participating nursing home residents will complete two brief tests regarding memory, attention, and symptoms of depression. An hour-long interview will then be conducted during which eligible participating residents will discuss their symptoms of depression, rate their health and level of functioning, and assess the quality of their relationship with a staff member. Residents receiving BE-ACTIV will meet with a therapist for weekly 30-minute sessions for 10 weeks. During these sessions, residents will discuss their activity participation and any pleasant events that they recently experienced. Therapists and nursing home activities staff will work together to incorporate more activities of interest into each resident's schedule. Residents of nursing homes assigned to receive treatment as usual will be asked to rate their mood once a week for 10 weeks. Researchers will observe each resident, regardless of treatment group, for 5-minute intervals at various times during the study to assess mood and activity levels. All participating residents will undergo a second interview after 10 weeks to discuss any changes or improvements in mood, symptoms of depression, activity level, or their relationship with staff members. All participating residents will be assessed after 3 months and again after 6 months post-treatment to determine whether the BE-ACTIV program was successful in improving symptoms of depression.</detailed_description>
