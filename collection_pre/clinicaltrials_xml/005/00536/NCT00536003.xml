	<brief_summary>The administration of vaginal progesterone, in addition to standard tocolysis, will decrease the risk of delivering prematurely and of recurrent preterm labor. We also hypothesize that the reduction in preterm delivery will be associated with a decrease in infant mortality and morbidity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaginal Progesterone to Prevent Preterm Delivery in Women With Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal aim is to demonstrate that progesterone reduces preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation. Secondary aims are to show that progesterone 1) reduces preterm birth before 32 and before 34 weeks of gestation 2) reduces the number and duration of recurring episodes of preterm labor and 3) reduces infant mortality and morbidity.</detailed_description>
