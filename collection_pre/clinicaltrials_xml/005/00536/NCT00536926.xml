	<brief_summary>In an investigation should be evaluated in contrast to a control group with standard post-treatment therapy (using home spirometry) after lung transplantation if transfer of home spirometry recordings to the transplant center via cell phones will lead to less complications, cost savings and bigger constancy of therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telecommunication Via Cell Phones During Post-Operative Treatment After Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Home spirometry is used as a standard of care in lung transplant recipients in many centers worldwide. In case of deteriorating lung function response until therapy depends on patients efforts to reach the transplant center and the contactability of the transplant center. Therefore transfer of home spirometry recordings to the transplant center via cell phones will lead to less complications, cost savings and bigger constancy of therapy compared to the home spirometry alone.</detailed_description>
