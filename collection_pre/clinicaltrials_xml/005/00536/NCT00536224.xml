	<brief_title>Chest Pain Observation Unit Risk Reduction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasingly, emergency department patients for whom a non-ischemic etiology of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) symptoms cannot be identified undergo further evaluation to rule out myocardial ischemia and appraisal of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in chest pain observation units (CPOUs). CPOU admission may represent a "teachable moment," but there has been little research on the effectiveness of brief, practical interventions for cardiovascular risk reduction in this population, despite the fact that the vast majority of these patients have at least one modifiable CRF and many do not receive regular primary care follow-up. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention initiated in the CPOU has a significant impact upon health attitudes (readiness to change) and cardiovascular risk-related behaviors (diet, exercise, and smoking). Based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), the intervention is designed to provide patients with tailored information on their cardiovascular risk, to negotiate goals for change, and to build problem-solving skills. All participants who are admitted to the CPOU for evaluation of ACS symptoms will be randomized to brief intervention (face-to-face counseling in the CPOU, coupled with telephone counseling at 4 weeks) or to minimal intervention (booklet with general information on CRFs) after a negative initial troponin measurement. We will conduct a baseline survey and follow-up telephone interviews at 2- and 6-month to assess stage of change and CRF-related behaviors. Linear mixed models and logistic regression (with generalized estimating equations) will be used to compare continuous and dichotomous behavioral outcomes across treatment arms, respectively. The proposed trial will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering brief interventions for cardiovascular risk reduction in the CPOU setting, will provide insight into mechanisms of behavior change in these patients, and will guide the development of future case management interventions.</detailed_description>
