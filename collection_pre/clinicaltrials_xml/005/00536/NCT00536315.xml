	<brief_title>Tracheal Mechanics During Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to obtain new information about the pressures required to collapse the trachea in patients with and without obstructive pulmonary disease and to describe the relationship between pressures and airflow obstruction. This information will provide normative data not currently available and would establish whether tracheal collapse is due to tracheomalacia. The data may lead to better ways of predicting if a patient would benefit from procedures to prevent tracheal collapse.</detailed_description>
