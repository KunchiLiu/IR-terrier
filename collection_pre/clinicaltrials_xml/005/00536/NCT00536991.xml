	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of calcitriol when given in combination with ketoconazole and therapeutic hydrocortisone and to see how well it works in treating patients with prostate cancer. Calcitriol may help prostate cancer cells become more like normal cells and grow and spread more slowly. Ketoconazole and therapeutic hydrocortisone may help calcitriol work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving calcitriol together with ketoconazole and therapeutic hydrocortisone may be a better treatment for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol in Combination With Ketoconazole and Therapeutic Hydrocortisone in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral calcitriol daily x 3 consecutive days a week in combination with oral ketoconazole (400 mg thrice daily [TID]) + oral hydrocortisone (20 mg AM, 10 mg PM) in men with androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC). (Phase I) II. To estimate the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the phase II dose of oral calcitriol with and without ketoconazole (400 mg TID). II. Describe any objective tumor responses to the combination of oral calcitriol and ketoconazole and hydrocortisone among patients with measurable disease using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. III. Determine toxicities and tolerability of oral calcitriol combination with daily oral ketoconazole and hydrocortisone. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of calcitriol followed by a phase II study. PHASE I: Patients receive calcitriol orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. Patients also receive ketoconazole PO TID on days 1-24 and therapeutic hydrocortisone PO twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PHASE II: Patients receive calcitriol and therapeutic hydrocortisone as in phase I. Patients also receive ketoconazole PO TID on days 4-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma consistent clinically with androgen independent prostate cancer Measurable disease with elevated PSA or evaluable disease (PSA elevation will constitute evaluable disease) =&lt;

patients who have previously received ketoconazole + glucocorticoids will be eligible for this trial Patients who have received antiandrogens or progestational agents as therapy for prostate cancer must discontinue therapy and demonstrate a rising PSA &gt;= 28 days following discontinuation (antiandrogen withdrawal AAW) (&gt;= 42 days for bicalutamide or nilutamide); patients who receive megestrol acetate as therapy for "hot flashes" at a dose of =&lt; 40 mg per day may continue this therapy during this trial; the dose of the megestrol acetate should not be changed during protocol treatment; patients undergoing androgen deprivation using LHRH analogues must continue such agents or undergo orchiectomy to maintain castrate levels of testosterone Patients must have prostate cancer that is advanced or recurrent and for which standard curative or reliable palliative therapies do not exist or are no longer effective Patients should not have received any chemotherapy or investigational agents for at least 4 weeks before entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status =&lt;
