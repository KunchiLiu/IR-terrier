	<brief_summary>A cholesterol/lipid profile screening project of high risk patients with hyperlipidaemia (secondary prevention) who already receive cholesterol-lowering therapy. Lipid profile and rate of patients who are treated to target (which is &lt;100mg/dl for patients with high risk and &lt;70mg/dl for patients at very high risk) are screened (hospital-based specialists). The doctors therapy decisions after the screening and possible reasons for these decisions will be documented. Our aim is to evaluate dosing habits, to evaluate how many patients are treated to their LDL-C target and to underline the importance of treating patients to their cholesterol targets.</brief_summary>
