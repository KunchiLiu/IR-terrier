	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of hypertonic lactate solution, compared to Ringer's Lactate as fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability in post-coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) patients. Patients who were eligible received either hypertonic lactate solution or Ringer's Lactate post-CABG in the ICU when fluid resuscitation was needed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of hypertonic lactate solution, compared to Ringer's Lactate as fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability in post-coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) patients. Patients who were eligible received either hypertonic lactate solution or Ringer's Lactate post-CABG observed in the first 12 hours in the ICU when fluid resuscitation was needed.</detailed_description>
