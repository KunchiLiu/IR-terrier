	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this research project is to determine whether the incorporation of food products containing medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil in a weight-loss program results in a different degree of weight-loss and total and regional fat mass loss than the incorporation of extra light olive oil. The secondary goals are to test whether there are differences in in metabolic risk profile changes between the 2 diets. We hypothesize that men and women who consumed MCT oil as part of their weight loss program will lose more weight and body fat than those who consume olive oil in their weight loss diet.</brief_summary>
