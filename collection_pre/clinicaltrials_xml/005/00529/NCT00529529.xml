	<brief_summary>This study was designed to assess the safety of indacaterol (300 µg and 600 µg (2 x 300 μg capsules) once daily [od]), compared with salmeterol (50 μg twice a day [b.i.d.]), over 26 weeks, in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male and female patients aged ≥ 12 years (or ≥ 18 years depending upon regulatory and/or Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board [IRB/IEC/REB] approval) who have signed an informed consent form. 2. Patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma, diagnosed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines (Updated 2006) and who additionally meet the following criteria: Patients who have used treatment with a bronchodilator, either regularly or ondemand, and who had used a daily dose of at least 100 μg beclomethasone dipropionate (or equivalent) for at least 1 month prior to screening. Patients whose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is ≥ 50% of the predicted normal value. Patients with documented (in the previous 6 months) or who demonstrate (prior to randomization) a ≥ 12% and at least 200 ml increase in FEV1, after inhaling 200 μg salbutamol. 1. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women and women of childbearing potential UNLESS they meet prespecified definitions of postmenopausal or are using prespecified acceptable methods of contraception. 2. Patients who have used tobacco products within the 12 month period prior to screening, or who have a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years. 3. Patients who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as diagnosed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (2006). 4. Patients who have had emergency room treatment for an acute asthma attack in the 6 weeks prior to screening or who have been hospitalized for an acute asthma attack in the 6 months prior to screening, or at any time between screening and Week 1. 5. Patients with diabetes Type I or those with uncontrolled diabetes Type II including patients with a history of blood glucose levels consistently outside the normal range or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) &gt; 8.0% measured at screening. 6. Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator or the responsible Novartis personnel, have a clinically significant condition or a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality that might compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with evaluation, or preclude completion of the study. 7. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome, or whose QTc interval (Bazett's formula) is prolonged to &gt; 450 ms (males) or &gt; 470 ms (females). 8. Certain medications for asthma and allied conditions such as longacting bronchodilators must not be used prior to screening and for a prespecified minimum washout period.
