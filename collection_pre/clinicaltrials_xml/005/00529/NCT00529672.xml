	<brief_summary>For more than 100 years, surgery has been the standard of care of varicose veins of the legs. The down side of surgery is that it requires anesthesia, leaves scars, and has a relatively high recurrence rate in the long term (up to 40%). In the last decade, several new techniques have become available but they have not yet been compared to surgery. This trail will evaluate the effectiveness, patients` perspective and cost effectiveness of surgery and non-invasive techniques such as ultrasound guided sclerotherapy with foam and endovenous laser therapy.</brief_summary>
