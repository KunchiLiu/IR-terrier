	<brief_title>RTA 402 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is a synthetic triterpenoid that has demonstrated significant in vivo single agent anti-cancer activity. This is an open-label phase I dose-escalation study of Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) administered orally for the first 21 days of a 28-day cycle.</detailed_description>
