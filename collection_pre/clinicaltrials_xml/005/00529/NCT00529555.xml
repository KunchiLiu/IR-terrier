	<brief_summary>Periodontal disease (commonly called gum disease) is generally treated by deep cleaning of the root surfaces of the teeth. This is also called scaling and root planing. Placing a topical antibiotic into the periodontal pocket at the time of scaling and root planing may help reduce pocket depth and thus help the periodontal disease. Periocline (minocycline HCl) 2.1% gel is a topical antibiotic approved in a number of countries for this use, and is now being tested in the US.</brief_summary>
