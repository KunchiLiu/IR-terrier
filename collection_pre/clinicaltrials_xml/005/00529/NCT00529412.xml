	<brief_title>Bioresorbable Membrane to Reduce Postoperative Small Bowel Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with gastric cancer who were scheduled to undergo gastrectomy were randomly assigned to a sodium hyaluronate-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm) group or to a control group. Before closing the abdominal incision, two sheets of Seprafilm membrane were applied to the surface of the small intestine under the middle abdominal wound in the Seprafilm group. The primary end point was the incidence of bowel obstruction. Secondary end points were intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality.</detailed_description>
