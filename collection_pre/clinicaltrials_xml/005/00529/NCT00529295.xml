	<brief_title>Titrated Oral Compared With Vaginal Misoprostol for Labor Induction at Term</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral misoprostol absorption is more rapid and possible more predictable, with a peak serum concentration following oral administration of 34 minutes and a half-life of 20-40 minutes. Peak serum concentration for vaginal administration is 60-80 minutes, this level being sustained for up to four hours. Although the direct local effect of vaginal administration on cervical ripening may be advantageous, the shorter half-life of oral delivery may be beneficial in the event of uterine hyperstimulation.In order to avoid uterine hyperstimulation, it appears reasonable to suggest that oral misoprostol should be administered in small, frequent doses, titrated against the uterine response.</detailed_description>
