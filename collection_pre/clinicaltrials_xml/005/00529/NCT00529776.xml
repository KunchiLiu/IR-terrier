	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients may be prevented by continuous lateral rotation therapy (CLRT) using specially designed, motor driven beds. Patients are randomized to CLRT or supine position if mechanically ventilated and not suffering from pneumonia or ARDS within 48 hours after intubation. Prophylaxis of VAP is standardized in both groups. Primary endpoint is incidence of VAP, secondary endpoints are length of ventilation, length of stay and mortality.</brief_summary>
