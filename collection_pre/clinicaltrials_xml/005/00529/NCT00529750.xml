	<brief_summary>Primary: - To evaluate the impact of irbesartan on endothelial function in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. Secondary: - To evaluate the oxidative stress status in patients with hypertension with metabolic syndrome. - To correlate the oxidative stress status with endothelial function in these patients. - To evaluate the effect of irbesartan on the oxidative stress stage in patients with metabolic syndrome and to correlate it with the effect on endothelial function . - To correlate the change in endothelial function and oxidative stress stage with the change of arterial pressure levels.</brief_summary>
