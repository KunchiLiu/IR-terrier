	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with multiple injections of GAD-Alum will preserve the body's own (endogenous) insulin production in patients who have been recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Recombinant Human Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase on the Progression of Type 1 Diabetes in New Onset Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system (the part of the body which helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin (islet cells found in the pancreas called islet cells). As these cells are destroyed, the body's ability to produce insulin decreases. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is one of the major autoantigens (a protein that the immune system is reacting to) involved in the autoimmune process underlying T1DM. GAD-Alum is Recombinant human (rhGAD65) and is used as an antigen-specific immune modulator. Previous studies have shown that it may slow or prevent autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells by introducing "immune tolerance". By administering excess autoantigen, the body may stop its attack on its own cells that produce insulin. If the immune system's attack can be halted in a patient with recent onset T1DM, than residual insulin secretion may be maintained. This may be beneficial in decreasing acute and long-term diabetic complications as well as improving glucose control.</detailed_description>
