	<brief_title>Treatment of Depersonalization Disorder With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a research trial of an outpatient, non-medication, non-invasive investigational treatment called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS applies a magnetic field to the brain for a brief period of time. TMS is a procedure that involves 30 minute-long daily sessions every weekday for a series of weeks. The investigators are testing whether TMS can treat Depersonalization Disorder (DPD). This is an open-label study. All patients will receive active treatment. DPD symptoms will be monitored through weekly self-report questionnaires as well clinical ratings with a doctor.</detailed_description>
