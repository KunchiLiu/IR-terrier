	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Ferriprox™ (Deferiprone) Oral Solution in Iron Overloaded Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-centre, open label, single treatment, uncontrolled study. A total of 100 iron-overloaded pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent anemia will be enrolled in the study.Eligible patients will receive Ferriprox (deferiprone) oral solution, 100 mg/mL, at a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg body weight or 100 mg/kg body weight, divided in three (3) doses, for 24 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who are ≤ 10 years of age. Patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of transfusiondependent anemia, other than BlackfanDiamond anemia, and have chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy. Patients who are in a chronic transfusion program, and who have received at least eight (8) red blood cell transfusions per year for a minimum of one year. Patients who are iron overloaded as assessed by serum ferritin concentration greater than 1000 µg/L. Patients who have a diagnosis of BlackfanDiamond anemia. Patients who have experienced neutropenia/agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.5 x 109/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50.0 x 109/L). Patients who have had previous treatment with Ferriprox and presented serious adverse reaction or intolerance requiring withdrawal of Ferriprox. Patients with evidence of abnormal liver function (ALT level &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal; entry may be delayed until values return to normal). Patients with evidence of renal failure, characterized by serum creatinine level &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal; entry may be delayed until values return to normal.</criteria>
