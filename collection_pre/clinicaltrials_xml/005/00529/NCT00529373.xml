	<brief_summary>The purpose of the event-driven base study is to determine the safety and efficacy, especially fracture-risk reduction, of odanacatib in postmenopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis. In a placebo-controlled extension of the base study, participants continue to receive the same blinded study medication for a total of up to 5 years of blinded study medication combined between the base study and the extension. After all participants receive at least 5 years of blinded study medication, they will be invited to enroll into a second extension study in which they will receive open-label odanacatib for an additional 5 years.</brief_summary>
