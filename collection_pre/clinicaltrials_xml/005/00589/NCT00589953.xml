	<brief_summary>The highest risk for perinatal brain injury occurs among extremely premature infants who weigh less than 1250 grams at birth. Such perinatal brain injury is currently irreversible, associated with neurodevelopmental disability, and without adequate treatment modalities. Research in recent years suggest in both animal and human studies that erythropoietin (Epo) may have significant neuroprotective effects. Given the historical safe medical profile of Epo when used for anemia of prematurity but the likely need for a greater dosage regimen for activation of neuroprotective pathways against neonatal brain injury, we therefore propose this phase II study of high-dose Epo in very low birth weight infants for the prevention and/or attenuation of prematurity-related cerebral hemorrhagic-ischemic injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Erythropoietin in Extremely Premature Infants to Prevent/Attenuate Brain Injury: A Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible extremely premature infants will be enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial from the neonatal intensive care unit at Morristown Memorial Hospital (Morristown, New Jersey). Subjects will be enrolled within the first 24 hours of life and randomly assigned to receive Epo or saline vehicle placebo. Standard NICU care will be provided to all subjects. Serial exams, CBC-d, reticulocyte counts, serum Epo levels, serial HUS, and head MRI will be collected at established time points during the study period. At 18 to 22 months corrected age, subjects will undergo a neurodevelopmental evaluation assessing for cerebral palsy, Bayley Scores of Infant Development-II (BSID-II) Mental Development Index (MDI), BSID-II Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), bilateral hearing aid use, and visual impairment.</detailed_description>
