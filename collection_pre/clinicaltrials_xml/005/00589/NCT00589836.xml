	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about the twisting or wringing motion of the heartbeat called torsion which can be seen on ultrasound. This study will help figure out if there is a difference in the how a heart twists at rest and with exercise in people with normal hearts compared to people with HCM (abnormally thickened heart muscle). Volunteers will have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) while lying on a bed both at rest and while peddling a wheel located at at the foot of the bed. The patients will take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours total and the study will be complete after this procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Left Ventricular Torsion by Echocardiography Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Left ventricular myocardial torsion (myocardial wringing motion) will be investigated by the use of tissue Doppler echocardiography in both normal and HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) patients. The objective of this study is to characterize the myocardial torsional behavior in normal and in HCM patients both at rest and while undergoing moderate physiological exercise. After a routine echocardiographic study, tissue Doppler echocardiogram will be performed before and during supine bicycle exercise. Stress EchoTM Bed with ergometer (supine bicycle) is used during exercise testing. Standard electrocardiogram and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the exercise testing. This procedure will take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours and will not involve any follow-up.</detailed_description>
