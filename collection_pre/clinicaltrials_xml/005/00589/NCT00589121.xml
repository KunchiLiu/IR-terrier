	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Image-guided radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a lower dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well image-guided radiation therapy works in treating patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma of the shoulder, arm, hip, or leg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Image-Guided Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Shoulder, Arm, Hip, or Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the effect of reduced radiation volume using image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on lymphedema ≥ grade 2, subcutaneous fibrosis, and joint stiffness at 2 years in patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity. Secondary - To estimate the rates of other grade 3-5 adverse events as measured by Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0. - To determine the pattern of first failure, including local failure (in-field, marginal, and outside-field failure), regional failure, distant failure, and death without disease progression. - To estimate the rates of local failure, local-regional failure, distant failure, distant disease-free survival, disease-free survival, overall survival, and second primary tumor. - To estimate the rate of wound complications. - To correlate the degree of late radiation morbidity (defined as any lymphedema, subcutaneous fibrosis, or joint stiffness) at 2 years with scores on the clinical measure, Musculoskeletal Tumor Rating Scale (MTRS). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. - Neoadjuvant radiotherapy: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (group 1 closed to accrual as of 01/08/10). - Group 1 (closed to accrual as of 01/08/10): Patients undergo 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated therapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 4½-5 weeks. Patients also receive up to 6 courses of neoadjuvant, adjuvant, concurrent, or interdigitated chemotherapy. - Group 2: Patients undergo 3D-CRT or IMRT once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. - Surgery: At 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor. Patients with positive tumor margins (residual tumor) undergo intraoperative radiotherapy boost or proceed to adjuvant radiotherapy within 2 weeks after surgery. - Adjuvant radiotherapy: Patients undergo either external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once daily for 8 fractions or brachytherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
