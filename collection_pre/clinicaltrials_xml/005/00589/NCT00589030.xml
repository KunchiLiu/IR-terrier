	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. PURPOSE: To provide expanded access and study the side effects of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yttrium Y 90 Radiolabeled Glass Beads in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) to eligible patients with primary cancer to the liver and who are not surgical resection candidates. - Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere® treatment. - Enter treatment experience into a liver database. Secondary - Determine the tumor response rates in patients receiving this treatment. OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study. Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) via percutaneous hepatic arterial infusion. Patients may be retreated between 30-90 days after the initial infusion. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days and then annually thereafter for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
