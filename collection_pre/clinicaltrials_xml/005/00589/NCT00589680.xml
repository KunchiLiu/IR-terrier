	<brief_summary>At this time, Saint Mary's Medical Center is currently in the process of implementing a standardized diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol. The first main goal of this project will be to evaluate patient outcomes to determine the effects of treating patients without a standardized protocol and to establish a baseline on how patients are being treating with DKA. The final goal of the project will be to compare outcomes of those patients not placed on the protocol to those that were treated using SMMC newly implemented DKA protocol. The overall goal of this project is to determine the benefit of an institutional DKA protocol.</brief_summary>
