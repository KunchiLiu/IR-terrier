	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without carboplatin in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving paclitaxel together with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide to see how well it works compared to giving paclitaxel together with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin in treating women with locally advanced breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide With Or Without Carboplatin in Treating Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate tumor pathological complete response rate after neoadjuvant paclitaxel with vs without carboplatin followed by cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with basal-type subtype primary breast cancer. Secondary - To evaluate the clinical and pathological overall response rate. - To evaluate safety and toxicity. - To evaluate disease-free survival and overall survival. - To correlate low BRCA1 expression (protein and mRNA), p53 mutation, positive CK5/6, positive CK 14, basal-like gene expression profile, and response to carboplatin-based treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical stage (T2-3 vs T4). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (standard therapy): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 1-12. Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (experimental therapy): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 15 to 20 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. All patients will then undergo surgical resection of the tumor. Patients undergo biopsy for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, and molecular endpoints (CK 5/6, CK14, p53, BRCA, and EGFR) by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, protein expression, and gene expression profiling. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
