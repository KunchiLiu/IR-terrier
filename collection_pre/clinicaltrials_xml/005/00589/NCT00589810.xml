	<brief_title>Whole Genome Association Study to Identify and Validate Genes for Restenosis: CardioGene Validation Proposal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, Dr. Santhi K. Ganesh and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health have completed a genetic association study, entitled the CardioGene Study, using 100,000 SNPs spanning the entire human genome in subjects with restenosis after percutaneous intervention using bare metallic stents (Ganesh SK, 2004). In this replication study at the Cleveland Clinic, we seek to collaborate to validate findings of the CardioGene Study in an independent cohort of patients who have undergone bare metallic stenting. This study will examine samples and clinical data collected of subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization who meet study criteria, selected from the GeneBank. In the Genebank repository, subjects are informed their samples may be used indefinitely for study and consent to having their data/samples shared with other investigators at the Cleveland Clinic or other collaborating institutions. No information that might identify subjects is shared with collaborating investigators and samples will be shared in a de-identified manner, using assigned study numbers.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Coronary Restenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age &gt;18 with informed consent for participation in Genetics Research BMS placed in a de novo(previously untreated by any type of PCI) lesion within a native coronary artery (not within a bypass graft) lesion Outcome data available at 12 months For both cases and controls: Age less than 18 No informed consent for Genetic Research BMS placed in a bypass graft. Radiation to the same lesion treated with bare metal stent at the time of index stenting (continued on next page) A drugeluting stent within or overlapping the target lesion BMS placed at the time index stenting. Participation in a cardiovascular study at any time between index stenting procedure and day 365 post stenting or until TVR, which ever occurs first, which meets one or more of the following: Placebo vs an active drug being studied against restenosis rates, atheroma volume or thrombosis, in which unblinding information is not available and the study results are unknown or the active drug is shown to have a positive effect. Placebo vs active drug known to have an effect on restenosis rates, atheroma volume or thrombosis in which unblinding information is not available. Blinded randomized studies involving two classes of drug in which the results are unknown or the results of the study show superiority to one of the treatment arms and unblinding information is not available. For controls only: in addition to the exclusions above: any prior history of TVR(TRRS) positive stress test or cath with &gt; or equal to 50% stenosis of target lesion within one year of index bare metal stenting. Subjects reported to be deceased in the Interventional Registry or through chart abstraction without negative cath results or negative stress test results between 5 months and 13 months post index procedure.</criteria>
