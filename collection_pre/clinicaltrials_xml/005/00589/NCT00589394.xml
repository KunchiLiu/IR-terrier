	<brief_summary>The lack of clear guidelines and studies addressing the proper response to the pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax ®) has hampered our ability to diagnosis and care for our immunodeficiency patients. Should an age matched normal response range to the Pneumovax ® be established, it would have a profound impact in the diagnosis, safety and care of immunodeficiency patients. Moreover, characterizing the B cell compartments response to the Pneumovax ® may better delineate the mechanism of protective immunity from Pneumovax ® and provide an additional tool for the diagnosis and care for immunodeficiency patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ability to respond to a polysaccharide vaccine antigen is an integral part of evaluating a patient with immunodeficiency. The pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax ®) remains the only readily available and the most widely used unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine. Although the pneumococcal vaccine is widely used test the immune systems response to a polysaccharide antigen, no clear guidelines or studies exist to what is considered a proper response to the Pneumovax ®. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory B cells are thought to play an important role in protection against pneumococcal disease. It is not known to what extent the ability of B cells to be activated in response to pneumococcal vaccination contributes to protective immunity. To address these issues, the following two specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1. Assess Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to pneumococcus pre- and post-pneumococcal immunization in healthy controls Specific Aim 2. Analysis of B cell subsets in blood of healthy controls pre-and post-pneumococcal immunization to identify changes in memory B cell, class switched and activated B cells.</detailed_description>
