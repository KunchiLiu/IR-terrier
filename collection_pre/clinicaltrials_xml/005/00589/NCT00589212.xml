	<brief_summary>This study has been designed to compile information on the efficacy of the GliaSite RTS combined with radiosurgery in the treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GliaSite 1-3 Mets Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data relevant to the evaluation the effectiveness of the GliaSite RTS for a resected dominant brain metastases will be collected. The GliaSite RTS is a radionuclide applicator and liquid radionuclide (Iotrex) designed to deliver intracavitary radiation therapy for resected brain tumors. In this case, it will irradiate the resected margins. Brain metastases not surgically removed will be then treated with radiosurgery</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have 13 newly diagnosed supratentorial metastatic brain lesions with at least one being dominant and eligible for surgical resection as visualized on enhanced MRI scan Have histological evidence of metastatic carcinoma on intraoperative pathology (frozen section) or final pathology report Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &gt;=70 Have systemic disease which is judged to be stable and has been staged within the last 6 weeks Have a life expectancy of &gt;= 6 month, based upon extent of systemic disease Be at least 18 years of age Give informed consent (or have legal representative give informed consent) Be receiving or have plans to receive conventional or investigational systemic agents for the metastatic brain tumor. Be receiving or have plans to receive external beam radiation therapy to the brain. Have received prior conventional or investigational systemic agents, including the use of Gliadel Wafers or Temodar, for the treatment of the brain metastasis. Be pregnant or breastfeeding. Have uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, evidence of uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmia. Have other serious concurrent infection or other medical illness which would jeopardize the ability of the patient to safely undergo resection and brachytherapy. Have histology of lymphoma or smallcell lung cancer.</criteria>
