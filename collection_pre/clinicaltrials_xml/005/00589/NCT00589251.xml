	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the equivalency of the skin test reactivity to penicilloate prepared by our new method of penicilloate preparation versus our old method of penicilloate preparation. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the significance of the different diastereoisomers of penicilloate on skin test reactivity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the equivalency of the skin test reactivity to penicilloate prepared by our new method of penicilloate preparation versus our old method of penicilloate preparation. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the significance of the different diastereoisomers of penicilloate on skin test reactivity. Five (5) adult subjects without a history of penicillin allergy and fifteen (15) adult subjects with a history of penicillin allergy and previous positive penicillin skin test to the minor determinant (penicilloate) and/or major determinant (penicilloyl) will be enrolled into the study. Each subject will be skin tested with our current penicillin skin test which includes penicilloate conducted in the Division of Allergic Diseases will be compared the skin test of our penicilloate prepared by our newer method along with the different diastereoisomers of penicilloic acid on the same day and time. The adult subjects without a history of penicillin allergy will serve as our control.</detailed_description>
