	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy for malignant gliomas. The approach used an adenoviral vector (disabled virus) engineered to express the Herpes thymidine kinase gene (aglatimagene besadenovec, AdV-tk), followed by an antiherpetic prodrug, valacyclovir. The AdV-tk vector was injected into the resection bed after standard tumor surgery and valacyclovir pills were taken for 14 days. Standard radiation and chemotherapy were administered which have been shown to work cooperatively with AdV-tk + prodrug to kill tumor cells. The hypothesis is that this combination therapy can be safely delivered and will lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) and anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2a Study of AdV-tk With Standard Radiation Therapy for Malignant Glioma (BrTK02)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients had resectable or partially resectable malignant glioma and received injection of AdV-tk into remaining tumor or tumor bed after resection. Pathologic confirmation of malignant glioma must be made prior to AdV-tk injection; if this was not possible, the injection was not performed and the subject was no longer eligible for the study. The oral prodrug, valacyclovir, started 1-3 days after AdV-tk injection and continued for 14 days. Standard radiotherapy began on average 7 days after AdV-tk injection for the up-front course. Patients received temozolomide as per standard of care after completion of prodrug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have presumed resectable or partially resectable malignant glioma based on clinical and radiologic evaluation (pathologic confirmation of malignant glioma must be made at the time of surgery if not previously determined). Patients who have previously received AdVtk + prodrug on this study may receive an additional AdVtk + prodrug course at recurrence if eligibility criteria are still met. Tumor must be accessible for injection and must not be located in the brainstem, midbrain, contained within the ventricular system, or located in an infratentorial location. Must be planning to undergo standard radiation therapy. Performance status KPS 70 or more. SGOT (AST) &lt; 3x upper limit of normal. Serum creatinine &lt; 2mg/dl and calculated creatinine clearance &gt;10ml/min. Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 and WBC &gt; 3000/mm3. Patients of reproductive age must agree to use a medically accepted form of birth control while on the study. Must give study specific informed consent prior to enrollment. For readministration, patients must be reconsented. Must be able to tolerate MRI scan procedure Active liver disease including cirrhosis or hepatitis Patients on immunosuppressive drugs (with exception of corticosteroid) Known HIV+ patients. Acute infections (viral, bacterial or fungal infections requiring therapy). Pregnant or breast feeding patients. Female patients of childbearing age must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week of beginning therapy. Evidence of metastatic disease or other malignancy (except squamous or basal cell skin cancers). Other serious comorbid illness or compromised organ function. May not receive chemotherapy until valacyclovir completed May not receive other investigational antitumor agents within 30 days prior to study entry or during active participation in the study (defined as from AdVtk injection until tumor progression).</criteria>
