	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To evaluate the results of Paclitaxel and pelvic radiation in pelvic confined papillary serous carcinoma of the endometrium for both local control and overall survival. - To evaluate the toxicity of Paclitaxel and pelvic radiation. - To collect and evaluate patients' quality of life/symptom assessment data.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Paclitaxel is designed to block the mechanisms of cell division in cancer cells, which may cause them to die. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin treatment. You will have radiation treatment to your pelvis (hip area) every day (Monday - Friday) for a total of 25 treatments. Each treatment should take about 20 minutes to complete. After the radiation treatment, you will receive a type of radiation called a "vaginal cuff boost." The vaginal cuff boost involves a small device being inserted into the vagina to treat the back of the vagina with a high dose of radiation. The applicator is similar to placing a large tampon in the vagina. This internal treatment takes about 30 minutes for each treatment. This is separate from the external radiation treatments that are given. While you are receiving radiation treatment, and then afterwards, you will also receive chemotherapy with paclitaxel. During the radiation period, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 1 hour, on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Starting 4-6 weeks after radiation treatment is finished, you will receive paclitaxel at a larger dose, given over 3 hours each time, once every 21 days (3 weeks). You will receive up to 4 "cycles" of chemotherapy, each cycle lasting 21 days. You will be given certain drugs about 30 minutes before your chemotherapy treatments to help control possible side effects, like allergic reactions. These drugs include dexamethasone, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and cimetidine. You will have several tests performed throughout the study. Before each cycle of chemotherapy and one month after the last cycle of chemotherapy is given, quality of life and symptom assessment forms will be completed. These questionnaires should only take about 15 minutes to complete. While you are on chemotherapy treatment, you will have tests performed before each chemotherapy treatment. This will involve blood (about 1 tablespoon) drawn for routine tests, and a review of your symptoms by the study staff. Once you are off study treatment, you will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits. These visits will occur every 3 months for 1 year, then every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, then once a year after that. At these visits, you will have a physical and pelvic exam performed, along with blood (about 1 tablespoon) drawn for routine tests. Chest x-rays will usually be done once a year and any other diagnostic exams will only be done if your doctor thinks they are needed. This is an investigational study. There are no standard treatments for this type of endometrial cancer, but radiation and chemotherapy are common treatments. This combination of chemotherapy and radiation is considered experimental. Up to 49 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 44 participants will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
