	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety &amp; Performance of the Xpert(TM) Stent in Treating Below-the-knee Lesions in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Intervention for Chronic CLI.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities affects roughly 25 million Americans annually. The diabetic population is particularly prone to the most severe clinical problems associated with PAD and the amputation rate amongst such patients is elevated five-fold. It has been shown that patients who undergo amputation for PAD/CLI have a much higher mortality rate in the months that follow. Despite medical advances in the fields of pharmacology and wound care, the vast majority of patients who present with CLI will ultimately require amputation in the absence of improved blood flow. Recently, much attention has been directed towards less invasive endovascular solutions for treating patients with CLI. This study will evaluate approximately 140 subjects with Rutherford Class IV-VI PAD in a multi-center study in order to accurately estimate limb salvage rates for this treatment.</detailed_description>
