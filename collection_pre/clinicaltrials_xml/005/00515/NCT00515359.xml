	<criteria>Age 1 month to 18 years Receiving a brain or spine MRI with propofol sedation Deemed safe to undergo sedation with propofol based on a presedation examination Patient judged not to require any premedication with any other medication except nasal decongestants or anticholinergic medications Patient below or above set age limits. Patient requires MRI studies on other body areas. Patient requires premedication with a sedative or tranquilizer Patient requires additional medications during sedation to complete the procedure. Propofol is being used as a rescue sedative to complete the procedure. Propofol is being used as a rescue sedative to complete a procedure that was initiated by another sedative. Patients who develop complications that require termination of the imaging procedure will not be included in the dose or recovery time calculations, but the complication will be counted as such in their respective group and study will be reported as nondiagnostic.
