	<brief_summary>The outcome of this trial will reveal the possibilities of the retinal implant to improve the situation of patients with hereditary retinal blindness caused by degenerations of the outer retina. This pilot study will give important information on safety and efficacy of sub-retinal implants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although the design of the chip with a possible resolution of up to 1500 image points has the potential of providing object recognition, the quality of the image transmitted in this first human application cannot be foreseen. On the other hand clinical experience teaches us that even bare light recognition improves mobility of patients because of the ability to localize bright light sources such as windows or lamps.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hereditary retinal degeneration of the outer retinal layers with the retinal vessels still being perfused and pigments of mild to moderate density Blindness (at least monocular) or visual functions not appropriate for navigation/orientation Period of appropriate visual functions &gt; 12 years / lifetime Visual acuity ≥ 0,05 in earlier life Electrically Evoked Phosphenes provide evidence of innerretinal function. willing and able to give written informed consent Any other ophthalmologic disease with relevant effect upon visual function (e.g. glaucoma, optic neuropathy, trauma, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment) Systemic disease that might imply considerable risk with regard to the surgical intervention and anesthesia (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, severe metabolic diseases) Neurological and/or psychiatric diseases (e.g. M. Parkinson, epilepsy, depression ) Retina detected as too thin (&lt; 100 µm) to expect required restfunctionality as shown via Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Women who are pregnant or nursing, or women of childbearing potential who are not willing to use a medically acceptable means of birth control for the duration of the study, or women unwilling to perform a pregnancy test before entering the study Participation in another clinical trial within the past 30 days</criteria>
