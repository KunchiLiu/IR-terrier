	<brief_summary>Breathing retraining supervised by a physiotherapist will result in improvements in the quality of life and asthma control of patients treated for asthma in the community with symptoms suggestive of dysfunctional breathing. To investigate the effects of breathing retraining on clinical and physiological parameters of asthma control, to identify the characteristics of patients who benefit, to perform a health economic evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GPIAG and Leicester Asthma and Dysfunctional Breathing (GLAD) Study: a Randomised Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: - To assess the effect of breathing retraining on asthma-related health status, asthma control and objective indices of asthma severity (bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR), sputum eosinophilia and nitric oxide production) in patients with symptomatic asthma. - To compare the relationship between symptoms of dysfunctional breathing (Nijmegen Questionnaire screening score), changes in asthma-related health status and other parameters resulting from breathing retraining - To explore the relationship between dysfunctional breathing, baseline asthma symptoms, treatment and asthma-related quality of life. - To estimate the cost effectiveness of the breathing retraining intervention</detailed_description>
