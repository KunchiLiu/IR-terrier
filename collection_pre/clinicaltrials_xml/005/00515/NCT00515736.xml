	<brief_summary>Critically ill patients are generally exposed to an increased oxidative stress, which is proportional to the severity of their condition. Endogenous antioxidant (AOX) defenses are depleted particularly in those patients with intense inflammatory response. The hypothesis tested is that early I:V: administration of a combination of AOX micronutrient supplements (Se, Zn, Vit C, Vit E, Vit B1) would improve clinical outcome in selected critically ill patients, by reinforcing the endogenous AOX defenses and reducing organ failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center trial. Patients admitted to ICU after complicated cardiac surgery, major trauma with or without brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and predicted by the clinicians to require &gt;48 hours of ICU treatment. Supplements: provided IV for 5 days</detailed_description>
