	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to improve understanding of the sensory qualities of patients who have pain caused by cancer therapy. This information will add to the understanding of what causes this pain and may lead to better management of the pain. The specific goal is to define the sensory capacity of patients in their area of pain as a consequence of cancer therapy compared to another body area without pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Participation: Participants will be contacted either before their initiation of chemotherapy or following their referral to pain management service for neuropathic cancer treatment-related pain. The sensory tests will take about 1 hour to complete. These tests will seek to find the threshold (a measure of sensitivity) at which you perceive stimuli, such as touch, coolness, warmth, hot/cold feeling and pinprick. You will be asked to rate the intensity of each of these stimuli that you perceive to be painful. You will also be asked to rate the intensity of stimuli that are at a fixed intensity above the pain threshold for most people. Your skin temperature using a radiometer, a scan of your fingers and/or toes, grooved peg board, a timed task to place pegs in slots, and pain scale rating will be collected. Each part of the sensory test are optional and will be collected when possible. You may either be tested at repeated intervals throughout your chemotherapy or at later follow-up dates to check the length of symptoms. Length of Study: Your participation will be complete once you have completed all the sensory testing. This is an investigational study. A total of 450 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Since moderate pain, albeit brief, will be induced, this feasibility project will be limited to consenting adults, 18 years old or older, in which there is also a well established QST database. 2. The subjects must be able to understand the nature of the study and have signed consent. 3. The patients must either: a) have pain that has developed as a consequence of cancer therapy with either vinca alkaloids, taxanes, bortezomib, thalidomide, platinumbased compounds or ionizing irradiation. OR b) have no pain that has developed as a consequence of cancer therapy, and are just entering chemotherapy with taxanes, vinka alkaloids, bortezomib, thalidomide, or platinumbased compounds 4. (For Healthy Controls) Willing to participate and have signed an informed consent. 1. Patients who refuse to participate or who are determined incapable of completing the research. 2. (For Healthy Controls) Receiving anticoagulants, immunosuppressed or diabetic.</criteria>
