	<brief_title>Testosterone Replacement in Men With Non-Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of testosterone replacement on time to disease progression and time to clinical cancer progression. The secondary objectives are to describe the effect of testosterone replacement on patient-reported quality of life (FACT-P, FACT-fatigue and specific measures from the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC): Sexual and Hormonal Assessments), and hand-grip strength; to describe changes in total testosterone, free testosterone, and PSA levels; to explore AR levels in circulating tumor cells as a marker of treatment benefit.</detailed_description>
