	<brief_summary>One-lung ventilation; organ protection; volatile anesthetics One-lung ventilation has become a common procedure for thoracoscopic surgery. Two hypothesis will be tested in this study: 1. Are inflammatory mediators increased in the re-ventilated lung after short-period pulmonary collapse? 2. Does Sevoflurane influence the production of inflammatory mediators in the re-inflated lung? Therefore, this study will elucidate the potential protective effect of a volatile anaesthetic (sevoflurane) on the production of inflammatory mediators by the respiratory compartment of the lung, i.e. the alveolar epithelium. - Trial with immunomodulatory product / biological</brief_summary>
