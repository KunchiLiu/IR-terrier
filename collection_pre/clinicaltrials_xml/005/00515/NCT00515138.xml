	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide for patients with relapsed or primary refractory aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell, mantle cell, follicular grade III, transformed lymphoma). Subjects will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 at each bortezomib dose level, starting at 1 mg/m(2), and escalating to 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7 mg/m(2). Bortezomib will be given on days 1 (prior to rituximab) and 4, rituximab 375 mg/m(2)/day on days 2, 3, and 4 of a 21-day cycle. They will also receive filgrastim on days 6-13 or pegfilgrastim on day 6.</brief_summary>
