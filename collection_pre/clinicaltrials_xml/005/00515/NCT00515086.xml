	<brief_title>Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter, open label, randomized study of RAD001 dosed daily in patients with recurrent GBM. The study was conducted with 2 parallel groups of patients. Group 1 was designed to study the biological effects of RAD001 in patients scheduled to undergo salvage surgical resection, and Group 2 was to enroll patients who were not scheduled for surgery. Patients in Group 1 were randomly assigned to one of three pre-surgery treatment groups (0, 5 or 10 mg/day RAD001 for 7 days). All patients in Group 2 were to receive a fixed daily dose of 10 mg/day oral RAD001.</detailed_description>
