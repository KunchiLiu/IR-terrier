	<brief_summary>People with atopic dermatitis (AD), or eczema, are susceptible to skin infections and inflammations. Some individuals with AD develop a condition known as eczema herpeticum (EH) following exposure to the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The purpose of this study is to identify the genetic determinants that lead people with AD to develop EH and similar conditions caused by other viruses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Genetic Determinants of Eczema Herpeticum and Other Viral Infections in Individuals With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections. However, people with AD do not all develop the same infections. For example, some people with AD who receive the smallpox vaccine develop a life-threatening condition known as eczema vaccinatum (EV). This study focuses on individuals with AD who also have a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH+), a condition similar to EV. It is unlikely that the differences in the development of skin infections are due to differences in viral exposure, and instead due to differences in each individual's response to viruses. The purpose of this study is to determine the genetic pathways which are responsible for the development of viral skin infections in people with AD. Participants in this study will also be enrolled in the ADVN Biomarker Registry Study. There will be only one clinical visit for this study at which blood and/or skin samples may be collected. The samples will then have high-throughput genotyping to define genetic markers in individuals susceptible to viral infections.</detailed_description>
