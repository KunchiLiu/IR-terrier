	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: The CAT-8015 immunotoxin can bind tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. This may be effective treatment for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that has not responded to chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy. PURPOSE: Phase 1 dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CAT-8015 immunotoxin in treating patients who have Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and do not respond to treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Confirmed diagnosis of Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma Measurable disease Evidence of CD22positive malignancy by the following criteria, &gt; 30% of malignant cells from a disease site CD22+ by FACS analysis or, &gt; 15% of malignant cells from a disease site must react with antiCD22 by immunohistochemistry Patients with indolent subtypes of CD22+ Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma, including, but not limited to mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, are eligible if stage IIIIV. Patients must have failed at least two or more courses of prior standard chemotherapy and/or biologic therapy (e.g. Rituxan). Patients with progressive mantle cell lymphoma may be eligible if they have failed one prior standard therapeutic regimen. PATIENTS CHARACTERISTICS Performance Status ECOG 02 Life Expectancy Life expectancy of less than 6 months, as assessed by the principal investigator Other Patients with other cancers who meet eligibility criteria and have less than 5 years of disease free survival will be considered on a casebycase basis Must be able to understand and sign informed consent Female and male patients must agree to use an approved method of contraception during the study History of bone marrow transplant Documented and ongoing central nervous system involvement with their malignant disease (history of CNS involvement is not an exclusion criterion) Pregnant or breastfeeding females Patients whose plasma contains either a significant level of antibody to CAT8015 as measured by ELISA, or antibody that neutralizes the binding of CAT8015 to CD22 as measured by a competition ELISA. HIV positive serology (due to increased risk of severe infection and unknown interaction of CAT8015 with antiretroviral drugs) Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness including but not limited to: infections requiring systemic antibiotics, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Hepatic function: serum transaminases (either ALT or AST) or bilirubin ≥ Grade 2, unless bilirubin is due to Gilbert's disease Renal function: Serum creatinine clearance ≤ 60mL/min as estimated by CockroftGault formula Hematologic function: The ANC &lt; 1000/cmm, or platelet count &lt;50,000/cmm, if these cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to underlying disease (i.e. potentially reversible with antineoplastic therapy). A patient will not be excluded because of pancytopenia ≥ Grade 3, or erythropoietin dependence, if it is due to disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies Baseline coagulopathy &gt; Grade 3 unless due to anticoagulant therapy. Pulmonary function: Patients with &lt; 50% of predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or &lt;50% of predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), corrected for hemoglobin concentration and alveolar volume. Note: Patient with no prior history of pulmonary illness are not required to have PFTs. FEV1 will be assessed after bronchodilator therapy. Recent prior therapy: Cytotoxic chemotherapy, corticosteroids (except stable doses of prednisone), whole body electron beam radiation therapy, hormonal, biologic or other standard or any investigational therapy of the malignancy for 3 weeks prior to entry into the trial Less than or equal &lt; 3 months prior monoclonal antibody therapy (i.e. rituximab) Patients who are receiving or have received radiation therapy less than 3 weeks prior to study entry will be not be excluded providing the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the patient has measurable disease outside the radiation port Any history of prior pseudomonasexotoxin immunotoxin (PE) administration.</criteria>
