	<brief_title>Tai Chi Mind-Body Therapy for Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common, complex chronic condition marked by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, functional impairment, disability, and psychological distress that affects 6-10 million people in the United States (US). There are currently no satisfactory pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for FM. New cost-effective strategies that reduce musculoskeletal pain and improve emotional and physical functioning as well as quality of life in people with FM are urgently needed. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese discipline with both physical and mental components that appears to benefit a variety of chronic conditions. The physical component provides exercise that is consistent with that recommended for FM (muscle conditioning and aerobic cardiovascular exercise), while the mental component has the potential to improve psychological well-being. These effects are especially pertinent for the treatment of individuals with FM. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi for fibromyalgia. We plan to enroll 60 patients with fibromyalgia over a two year period. Participants are randomized to either a Tai Chi program or an attention control intervention. Assessments are performed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. This study will provide preliminary data on the potential acceptability and safety of Tai Chi for FM and will help guide the design of a future large-scale study of the efficacy of this alternative therapy.</detailed_description>
