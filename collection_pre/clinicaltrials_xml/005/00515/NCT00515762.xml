	<detailed_description>Persistent alopecia following adjuvant docetaxel for breast cancer is a side-effect that has been recently described. Docetaxel is toxic to skin and skin annexes and can produce nail toxicity and persistent alopecia. Nail toxicity has been successfully prevented by means of hypothermic gloves and slippers (Elasto-gel, Southwest Technologies, Inc, North Kansas City, MO). This pilot trial explores the capacity of a cooling cap (Elasto-gel) to prevent persistent alopecia in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant docetaxel regimens.</detailed_description>
