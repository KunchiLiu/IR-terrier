	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to characterize patients' course of recovery in the year following the initial surgery for unstable intertrochanteric hip fractures treated with the InterTAN intramedullary hip screw device. This will be done by collecting patient outcome measures of health related quality of life and functional status including return to normal gait. Secondary objectives are to document any adverse events associated with the procedure, and to analyze differences in recovery due to differences in age, gender, co-morbidities, nutrition, residence and ambulation status, and use of mobility aids.</brief_summary>
