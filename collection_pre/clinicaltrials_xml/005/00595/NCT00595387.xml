	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Treating Depression in People With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is a chronic debilitating disorder with recurrent depressive and/or manic mood episodes. Although episodes of mania are often considered the most distinguishing feature of bipolar disorder, recurrent episodes of depression make up the most functionally debilitating aspect for many individuals with BP-I. Symptoms of depressive episodes include depressed mood, lack of interest, decreased energy, low self-esteem, trouble sleeping, and change in appetite. Mood stabilizers are usually the first line of treatment for patients with bipolar disorder who are in a depressive episode, but previous research has shown that these treatments fail to bring most patients to sustained remission. As an adjunct to medication, a psychosocial treatment known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be a promising treatment for improving depressive symptoms and for long-term stabilization in individuals with BP-I. This study will compare the effectiveness of CBT versus supportive psychotherapy in decreasing depression in people with BP-I. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study will also assess the impact of episodic memory impairment in people with BP-I on the success of CBT treatment. Participation in this single-blind study will last about 9 months and will include 22 study visits. There will be four pretreatment visits, during which participants will undergo a variety of tests and procedures, including interviews and questionnaires about depression and anxiety; tests on memory, attention, reaction time, and reading; and an MRI scan. Following completion of the initial assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to receive CBT or supportive psychotherapy. Participants in both groups will attend eighteen 1-hour treatment sessions over 5 months. Participants attending CBT sessions will learn specific thought processing and behavioral exercises to help reduce depressive symptoms. Participants attending psychosocial therapy sessions will learn about signs and symptoms related to depression and will be provided support in coping with their depression. All participants will be asked to complete Mood and Memory Questionnaires before and after the first seven treatment sessions. Psychological evaluations will occur after Visits 8 and 18 of treatment and will involve the completion of questionnaires. Participants in both groups will attend a follow-up visit to evaluate tic symptoms, anxiety, and mood 4 months after the final treatment session.</detailed_description>
