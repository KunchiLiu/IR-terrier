	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to estimate the sensitivity of the HMP test in identifying visual field functional defects in subjects with CNV secondary to AMD, and differentiate them from intermediate AMD subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensitivity and Specificity of the Home Macular Perimeter (HMP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a one encounter visit in which patients are enrolled and complete the study on the same day. This will allow recruiting and testing of patients with CNV which is a dynamic disease that is most often treated on that same day. Following enrollment, patients will go through an examiner supervised tutorial followed by a self-performed HMP examination. In addition patient will undergo an Amsler grid examination, biomicroscopy, color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. The HMP output shall be a test result that can be within or outside normal limits. Inherent to the test are reliability criteria which help to determine if the patient performed the test reliably. These consist of false positive and false negative errors. All criteria for normal limits and reliable performance are set prior to study initiation. The outcome measures for the study are the sensitivity in identifying visual functional defects in patients with CNV.</detailed_description>
