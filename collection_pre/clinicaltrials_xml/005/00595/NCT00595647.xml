	<brief_summary>Prospective multicenter controlled randomized trial to compare the safety and efficacy of drug eluting vs. bare metal stents in percutaneous coronary interventions of saphenous vein grafts. Hypothesis: Survival and outcome will be significantly better in patients receiving DES than in patients receiving BMS regarding both short-term and long-term outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Test the Efficacy and Safety of Drug Eluting vs. Bare-Metal Stents for Saphenous Vein Graft Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question: What is the effect of the paclitaxel eluting TAXUS® Liberté® stent compared with the bare-metal Liberté® stent (both Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) in saphenous vein graft (SVG) percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) when used in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, e.g., abciximab (ReoPro®, Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, IN), and a distal filter system? Design: Prospective, multicenter, controlled randomized trial. Subjects: Inclusion criteria: Patients undergoing SVG PCI with a target vessel reference diameter ≤ 5.5 mm (visual estimate); documented silent ischemia, stable angina pectoris Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class I to IV, or acute coronary syndrome. Exclusion criteria: Previous stent implantation anywhere in the target SVG; concomitant native vessel PCI; SVG age &lt;6 months; arterial grafts; oral anticoagulation; platelet count &lt;100x109/L or &gt;700x109/L; any major non-cardiac condition with a life expectancy &lt;12 months; known allergies against the components tested; white blood cell count &lt;3000 cell/mm3; enrolled in other study; no consent; patients unlikely to comply to the study treatment and the follow-up visits. Recruitment: Consecutive sample of all patients who qualify Variables: Predictor: Randomization will be single-blinded 1:1 to the TAXUS® Liberté® vs. the Liberté® stent (both Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA). In all patients, a distal filter system will be used during PCI. The use of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, e.g., abciximab (ReoPro®, Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, IN), will be strongly recommended (bolus prior to PCI and 12 h infusion post PCI). Outcome: Primary: MACE after 12 months. MACE will be defined as the composite of cardiac death (all deaths not clearly non-cardiac), non-fatal myocardial infarction, and TVR. Secondary: Non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death at 30 days and 6, 12, 36, and 60 months; MACE at 30 days and 6, 36, and 60 months; quality of life; individual components of the primary endpoint; non-cardiac death; major bleeding, defined as need for surgery, need for blood transfusions, and cerebral hemorrhage during antiplatelet therapy; minor bleeding, defined as a drop in hematocrit of &gt;2 mg/dL.</detailed_description>
