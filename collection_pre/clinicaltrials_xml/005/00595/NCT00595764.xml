	<brief_title>Counseling for Primary Care Office-based Buprenorphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the need for drug counseling aimed at reducing illicit drug use and increasing buprenorphine/naloxone adherence, the proposed study compares manual-guided Physician Management (PM) and PM combined with on-site manual-guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in a 24 week randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine/naloxone in a heterogeneous population of opioid dependent patients (N=140) in a primary care clinic. PM, consistent with federal regulations, is designed to reflect usual care by primary care physicians and includes referral to ancillary services. CBT will be provided by skilled psychologists in weekly sessions for the first 12 weeks and focuses on reducing illicit drug use and increasing buprenorphine/naloxone adherence. The study will test the hypothesis that that the addition of CBT to PM will lead to decreased illicit drug use, durable effects after counseling has been discontinued, improved buprenorphine/naloxone adherence and will demonstrate incremental cost-effectiveness in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance in primary care. Primary outcome measures include reductions in illicit opioid use and abstinence achievement, as assessed by weekly urine toxicology testing and self report. Secondary outcome measures include retention in treatment, reductions in cocaine use and HIV risk, decreased criminal activity and improved health and employment status. Utilization and costs of services, spillover effects in the PCC, and patient and staff perceptions of benefits and problems associated with primary care agonist maintenance treatment will also be evaluated. The results of this study will help define the role of professional evidence-based drug counseling in expanding access to treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone.</detailed_description>
