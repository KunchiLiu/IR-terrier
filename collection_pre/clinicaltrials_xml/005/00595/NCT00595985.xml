	<brief_title>Sorafenib as a Second Line Treatment in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to now, although FU based, cisplatin based and taxane based regimen, and ECF regimen have been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, there is no standard regimen for patients with A/MGC as second line treatment. Based on the promising results of sorafenib in primary hepatic carcinoma and renal cancer, we design this clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, time to progression and overall survival of sorafenib for A/MGC patients as a second line treatment.</detailed_description>
