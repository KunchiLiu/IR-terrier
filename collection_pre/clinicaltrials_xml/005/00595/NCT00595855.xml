	<brief_summary>Patients affected by medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma will be randomised to either a non penetrating procedure (deep sclerectomy) or conventional trabeculectomy. The longterm efficacy (i.e. IOP w/out therapy) and safety (i.e. visual acuity, visual field stability and co-morbidities) will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Deep Sclerectomy and Trabeculectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective 7-year randomised investigator -masked clinical trial 79 eyes (79 patients) enrolled randomised to surgery by PEX and previous pilocarpine use Deep sclerectomy n = 41 Trabeculectomy n = 38 Estimated DS : TE success = 1:3 10% attrition ; power = 90%, alpha = 5% Methods and evaluation of outcomes: 1. IOP: average of the two highest readings of the IOP phasing (6 readings) 2. VA: LogMAR (ETDRS chart) 3. Lens: LOCSII (slit lamp classification), worsening = one step progression confirmed at two visits study visits: every 4 months</detailed_description>
