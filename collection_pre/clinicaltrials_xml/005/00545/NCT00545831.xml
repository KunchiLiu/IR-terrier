	<brief_summary>Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is a validated technique for patients with various intestinal disease leading to chronic malabsorption or obstruction, whatever the aetiology. Intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) is the more frequent complication of patients with HPN and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Moreover, CRBSI often recur after a first treatment of the catheter with a combination of an antibiotic lock on the catheter and systemic intravenous antibiotics. In more than 50 % of the cases, another CRBSI will occur in a median delay of 5 months. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a taurolidine lock secondary prophylaxis on CRBSI recurrence in HPN patients. Study population is separated in 2 groups, the first one receiving the Taurolock and the second one receiving a placebo. This is a randomized double-blind six-month study.</brief_summary>
