	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will assess the impact of bone marker feedback (BMF), using serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) and communication of results at 3 months, on adherence to once monthly ibandronate (150 milligrams [mg] per oral [po]) in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis supported by patient-relationship program (PRP). Participants will be randomized either to receive BMF or no BMF; both groups will be supported by PRP. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.</brief_summary>
