	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if OsseoSpeed™ implant 6 mm long is effective for rehabilitation of edentulism and if so, how it compares with OsseoSpeed™ implant 11 mm long. The primary hypothesis is that the alteration in bone level is equal in patients randomized to 6 mm as to patients randomized to 11 mm implants.</brief_summary>
