	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of two CellCept-containing treatment regimens in de novo liver transplant patients. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups, to receive either CellCept (at a starting dose of 3g/day po, adjusted according to exposure) standard dose tacrolimus and corticosteroids (10-15 mg/kg i.v. on day 0), or fixed dose CellCept 2g/day po, standard dose tacrolimus and corticosteroids (10-15mg/kg i.v. on day 0, then reducing from 20mg to 5mg over 6 months, and discontinuing after 6 months). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
