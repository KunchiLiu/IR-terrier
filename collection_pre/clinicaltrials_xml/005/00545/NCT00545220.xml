	<brief_summary>Vision loss can result in feelings of frustration, helplessness, anxiety, depression, and anger, which compromise a person's activities of everyday living. While emotional distress may resolve in some persons without intervention, unmanaged and persistent distress places the person at risk for continued decrements in health status and the potential development of more severe conditions (i.e., depression, poor health outcomes). Persons with low vision will be recruited and randomly assigned to either an innovative, problem-solving training (PST) intervention group designed specifically for persons with low vision or a sham intervention/control group. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline prior to intervention and at 3 month follow-up, 7 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up, and 24 month follow-up by a research interviewer masked to participants' randomization. This project will: (1) demonstrate how specified physical and emotional outcomes of persons with low vision change across time, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of a PST intervention that will be delivered to persons with low vision; and (3) identify persons with low vision who are at risk for adverse emotional and health outcomes.</brief_summary>
