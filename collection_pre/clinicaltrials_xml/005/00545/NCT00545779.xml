	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess participant preference for monthly Bonviva, versus daily or weekly alendronate or risedronate, in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Participants currently on a daily or weekly regimen of bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate or risedronate) will answer a questionnaire to identify participants who may benefit from a monthly Bonviva regimen. Eligible participants will then discontinue their present bisphosphonate treatment, and switch to monthly Bonviva 150mg per oral (po). At the beginning and end of Bonviva treatment, all participants will complete an Osteoporosis Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
