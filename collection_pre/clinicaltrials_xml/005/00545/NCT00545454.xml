	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the reduction of systemic inflammation as measured by serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). The secondary objectives are: - to assess the reduction of systemic inflammation as measured changes in acute phase protein, serum amyloid A (SAA) and cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and clinical American College of Rheumatology response rate, and morning stiffness duration; - to assess the effect on pain relief within first 14 days; - to obtain evidence of the safety and tolerability of SSR150106; - to document trough plasma levels of SSR150106 and its first metabolite.</brief_summary>
