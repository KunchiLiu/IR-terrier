	<brief_summary>This single-arm study will assess the long-term maintenance of hemoglobin levels, safety, and tolerability of once-monthly intravenous administration of Mircera in hemodialysis participants with chronic renal anemia. Those currently receiving darbepoetin alfa, epoetin alfa, or epoetin beta maintenance treatment will receive intravenous Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200, or 360 micrograms (mcg) per month (based on the erythropoiesis stimulating agent [ESA] dose administered on Week -1). Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the country-specific target range (11 to 13 grams per deciliter [g/dL] for Switzerland and 10 to 12 g/dL for Austria).</brief_summary>
