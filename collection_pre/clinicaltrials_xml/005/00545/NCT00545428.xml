	<brief_title>Mastoid Bone Autograft for Dorsal Nasal Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION: Several grafts and/or implants have been used for dorsal augmentation. In some cases, especially the traumatic, non-caucasian, and multi-operated ones, the amount of augmentation is higher than the usually available from septal and auricular conchal autografts. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of mastoid bone autograft for dorsal nasal augmentation in rhinoplasty. DESIGN: A prospective study of 15 consecutive patients submitted to dorsal nasal augmentation with mastoid bone, during a 2-year period. SETTING: One major academic medical center.</detailed_description>
