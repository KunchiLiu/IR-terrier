	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine if an education program of the medical teams can help implementation of of NPO (nothing-per-os)orders in children before anesthesia for ambulatory medical interventions under anesthesia and decrease unnecessary long fasting. We shall ask parents of such children to fill in a questionnaire regarding pre-anesthesia fasting and regular eating and drinking habits. Thereafter, all medical teams involved with the administration of NPO orders will receive an educational program to explain and implement the NPO orders as are recommended by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. We will examine if the educational program was successful in reducing unnecessary long period of fasting, and if such a program is not associated with increased rate of delay of cases.</brief_summary>
