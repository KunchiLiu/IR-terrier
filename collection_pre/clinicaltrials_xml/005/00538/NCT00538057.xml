	<brief_summary>A combination of the corticosteroid GW685698X and the long-acting ß2-agonist GW642444M is being developed for once daily administration for the maintenance treatment of asthma and COPD. GW642444M and GW685698X will be simultaneously co-administered from a single device and compared with GW642444M and GW685698X administered separately in order to determine whether co-administration affects the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetics of either compound.</brief_summary>
