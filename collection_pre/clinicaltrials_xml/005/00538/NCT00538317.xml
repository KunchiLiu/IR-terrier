	<brief_summary>In patients with acute myocardial infarction who are managed in the prehospital setting, and who will treated with primary angioplasty, we evaluate the benefit of an early administration of tirofiban, a powerful GPIIbIIIa inhibitors. Patients are randomised to early administration in the ambulance or administration in the cathlab. The primary endpoint is TIMI 2-3 flow in the first coronary opacification of the culprit artery.</brief_summary>
