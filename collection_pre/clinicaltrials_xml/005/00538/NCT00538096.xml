Patients with documented evidence of culture positive sepsis or active infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy must complete a full course of antibiotic treatment with no clinical or laboratory evidence of bacterial infection at least 2 weeks prior to starting therapy with MEDI538. Vaccination (either preventive or therapeutic for infectious disease or cancer) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study drug; Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1 or HIV2), chronic infection with hepatitis B or C, or acute infection with hepatitis A; History of primary immunodeficiency; History of serious, chronic autoimmune disease, eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis; Elective surgery planned during the study period through 30 days after discontinuation of MEDI538; Autologous stem cell transplantation within 26 weeks prior to study entry; Allogenic stem cell transplantation or any other solid organ transplant; Cancer chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to study entry; Radiotherapy within 6 weeks prior to study entry; Receipt of any investigational agent within 12 weeks prior to initiation of study drug; Treatment with rituximab within 12 weeks prior to study entry; Prior treatment with alemtuzumab; Regular dose of systemic corticosteroids during the 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug or anticipated need of corticosteroids exceeding prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent during the trial, or any other systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry; Any contraindication to chronic anticoagulation with lowmolecular weight heparin (LMWH); Inability for safe placement and prolonged use (at least 8 weeks) of a central venous catheter; Contraindication to any of the protocolspecified concomitant medications (methylprednisolone, antacids, or antihistamines) during this study; Presence of human antimurine antibodies or known hypersensitivity to immunoglobulins; Pregnancy (sexually active females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of the first dose of the study drug, prior to dosing) or nursing; Evidence of any uncontrolled systemic disease (other than Bcell NHL), any finding upon physical examination or history of any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, may compromise the safety of the patient in the study or confound the analysis of the study; or Inability to meet social environment requirements for outpatient therapy (see Section 3.3.4.4).</criteria>
