	<brief_summary>Since influenza vaccines are administered every year because of the frequent change in their antigenic composition, the safety and immunogenicity profile of GSK Biologicals' influenza vaccine GSK576389A will be re-evaluated after repeated vaccine administration. In this study, the subjects previously enrolled in study 107973 will receive a dose with the 2007-2008 season's formulations of Fluarix or GSK576389A. Only subjects who were previously enrolled in study 107973 (NCT00386113) are eligible for participation in this study.</brief_summary>
