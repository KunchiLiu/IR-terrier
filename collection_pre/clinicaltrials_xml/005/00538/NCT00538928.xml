	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized study will be performed investigating the effects of a pumpless extracorporeal interventional lung assist [iLA] on the implementation of a lung-protective ventilatory strategy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200. The duration of ventilation, intensive care and hospital stay and in-hospital mortality will be investigated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation group: Implantation of the iLA - adaptation of the ventilation strategy, explantation of the iLA after corresponding improvement (see treatment plan for details) - weaning from the ventilation and extubation according to specified criteria. Control group: Ventilation strategy based on the concept of lung-protective ventilation without extracorporeal support, weaning from the ventilation and extubation according to specified criteria (see treatment plan for details).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The trial subjects are patients aged 18 years or older who have developed severe ARDS. Following the AmericanEuropean Consensus Conference on ARDS, severe ARDS is defined as an oxygenation index (PaO2/FIO2) &lt; 200 mmHg. These parameters must be present for a duration of at least 2 hours. age &lt; 18 years decompensated heart insufficiency acute coronary syndrome severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease advanced tumour conditions with life expectancy &lt; 6 months chronic dialysis treatment lung transplant patients proven Heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) morbid obesity (BMI &gt;) 40 Child Class B and C cirrhosis of the liver, acute fulminant hepatic failure severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease (pAVK III IV), absence of limb doppler pulse brain injury (GCS &lt; 9 + CT pathology)</criteria>
