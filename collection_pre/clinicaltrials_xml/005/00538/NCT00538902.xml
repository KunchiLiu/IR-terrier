	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Adalimumab in Adult Chinese Rheumatoid Arthritis Subjects Treated With Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multi-center, Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind (DB), parallel group, placebo controlled, safety and efficacy study in adult Chinese RA subjects. The duration of the study was approximately 116 weeks. This included a 4-week (28 days) Screening period, a 12-week Double-Blind (DB) period, a 90-week Open-Label (OL) Period, and a 10-week (70 days) Follow-up period. The 70-day Safety Follow-up period was initiated after the last dose of study medication. During the DB period, 302 Chinese subjects with RA and concomitantly treated with MTX were enrolled at 11 clinical sites located throughout China. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups in a 2:2:1 ratio: 80 mg adalimumab, 40 mg adalimumab, or placebo. From Week 0 to Week 10, subjects received blinded study drug. Subjects who successfully participated and completed Week 12 of the DB portion of the study participated in the OL period. All subjects in the OL period received adalimumab 40 mg. Throughout the study, the study drug was administered subcutaneously (SC) every other week (eow). Subjects that completed the Week 24 visit, prior to the approval of Protocol Amendment 1, had 70 days from the last dose of study drug to re-enter the study. The Investigator confirmed that the subject did not develop any of the exclusion criteria and completed the procedures defined by the OL Screening visit. Results through Week 24 of this study were presented in the regulatory dossier for the marketing authorization application of Humira in China, fulfilling the requirement for clinical data in Chinese patients. However, in order to continue to provide treatment to patients who responded well to adalimumab, subjects had the option to continue in the OL extension of this study until Week 92.</detailed_description>
