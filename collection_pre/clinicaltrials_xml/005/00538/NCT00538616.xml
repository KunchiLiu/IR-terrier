	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate brain injury when two different drugs (propofol and precedex) are used to sedate patients who need a neurologic exam.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Precedex Versus Propofol-Awakening for Reducing Brain Injury Expansion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that a neurologic exam performed when the subject has continuous infusion of precedex will result in less brain injury (where the lactate/pyruvate ratio indicates injury) then when a neurologic exam is performed on subjects receiving propofol, because that exam requires that the propofol infusion be stopped.</detailed_description>
