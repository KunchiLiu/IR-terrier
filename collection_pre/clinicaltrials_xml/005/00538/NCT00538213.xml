	<brief_summary>Since influenza vaccines are administered every year because of the frequent change in their antigenic composition, the safety and immunogenicity profile of GSK Biologicals' influenza vaccine GSK576389A will be re-evaluated after repeated vaccine administration. In this study, the subjects previously enrolled in study 104887 will receive a dose with the 2007-2008 season's formulations of Fluarix or GSK576389A. Only subjects who were previously enrolled in study 104887 are eligible for participation in this study.</brief_summary>

Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days prior to vaccination, or planned use during the study period. Administration of other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrolment in this study. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol up to 21 days after vaccination. Planned administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccines during the entire study period. Vaccination against influenza since January 2007 with the Northern Hemisphere 2007/2008 influenza vaccine or 2006/2007 influenza vaccine. History of confirmed influenza infection since the date of previous vaccination. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the administration of the study vaccine. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, ≥0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.) Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). History of hypersensitivity to a previous dose of influenza vaccine. History of allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s) Acute (active) clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by clinical evaluation (medical history and medical history directed physical examination) or preexisting laboratory screening tests. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever. All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness, i.e. Axillary temperature &lt;37.5°C / Oral temperature of &lt;37.5°C). Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first administration of the study vaccine or planned administration during the study.
