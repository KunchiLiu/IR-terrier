	<brief_summary>This trial will study three doses of reslizumab versus placebo in children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EE). The objectives of the trial will be to study the effectiveness of reslizumab in improving the clinical signs and symptoms and reducing esophageal eosinophils as well as assessing the safety profile compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
