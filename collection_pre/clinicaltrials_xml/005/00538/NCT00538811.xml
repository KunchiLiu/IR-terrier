	<brief_summary>When administered simultaneously, interferon-alpha 2b + interferon-gamma result in dramatic antiviral synergy.Ribavirin has shown to enhance interferon-gamma levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon-alpha. Enhancement of immune responses, especially those related to type-1 T helper cell activity, may contribute to better efficacy in combining ribavirin with IFN-alpha for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a triple regimen, a combination treatment with Interferon gamma, Interferon alfa-2b plus Ribavirin in patients who have not previously responded to interferon alpha in combination of ribavirin.</brief_summary>
