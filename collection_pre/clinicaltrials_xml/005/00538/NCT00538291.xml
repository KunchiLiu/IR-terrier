	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cetuximab together with capecitabine may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with capecitabine work in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Failed Irinotecan Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab and capecitabine that progressed on prior fluoropyrimidine-containing therapy comprising irinotecan with or without oxaliplatin. Secondary - To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - To determine the tolerance to therapy in these patients. - To assess biological correlates of response in available tissue biopsies and blood samples. OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for expression of genes correlated with fluoropyrimidine responsiveness via quantitation RT-PCR; degree of expression of EGFR via immunohistochemistry; and expression pattern analysis via gene expression profiling and polymorphism. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
