	<brief_summary>Having a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and being treated with certain of the newer antipsychotics are risk factors for development of diabetes. Subjects with these risk factors plus obesity and/or family history of diabetes who agree to study participation will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test. If the oral glucose tolerance test demonstrates that the subject is pre-diabetic (elevated glucose levels, but below the diabetic range), he/she will have his/her insulin resistance level measured, prior to random assignment to either stay on current antipsychotic medication or switch to ziprasidone. Insulin resistance will be measured again after four months. The primary hypothesis is that insulin resistance will decrease in those switched to ziprasidone relative to those continuing on their same antipsychotic medication.</brief_summary>
