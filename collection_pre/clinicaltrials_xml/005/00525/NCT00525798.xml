	<criteria>Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, ambulatory, in general good health, not receiving medication that affects bone metabolism, and free from any underlying condition, other than osteoporosis, that may result in abnormal bone metabolism. BMD Tscore below 4.0 (based on absolute values g/cm2 as given in the protocol) at one or more of the measured sites More than 2 prevalent vertebral fractures (Genant et al, 15). If BMD is lower than 2.5 Tscore at one or more of the measured sites, the participants will be excluded from the study, if they have a severe vertebral fracture (Genant et al, 15). Evidence of any clinical osteoporotic fracture and/or if they have a history of a clinical osteoporotic fracture (excluding wrist fractures) BMD Tscore &gt; 1.5 in all of the following regions: Lumbar spine, femoral neck or total hip.
