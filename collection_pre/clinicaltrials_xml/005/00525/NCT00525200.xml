	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis: PANCHO is a prospective randomized, predictive marker study, evaluating the interaction between the potential predictive marker 'p53 genotype' and response to induction chemotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer considered resectable. 170 patients with measurable disease will be enrolled in this study. After testing the marker genotype (two genotypes: p53 normal or p53 mutant) patients will be stratified according to histological subtype only (adeno- or squamous cell carcinoma) and will be randomly assigned to receive 3 cycles of either 5-fluorouracil (5FU)/cisplatin or docetaxel monotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy. All patients will be rendered to subsequent surgery in order to assess both clinical and pathohistological response.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PANCHO will test the hypothesis that p53 genotype is predictive for response to chemotherapy. The study uses the marker by treatment interaction design. In this design, we assume that the status of the marker splits the whole population into two distinct groups (p53 normal versus p53 mutant). Patients in each marker group are randomly assigned to two different treatments, and planned statistical analysis is to test whether one treatment is superior to the other within each marker group separately. The marker information but not the treatment is blinded to the patient and the investigators.</detailed_description>
