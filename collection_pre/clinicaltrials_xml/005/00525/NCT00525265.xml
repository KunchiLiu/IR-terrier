	<criteria>1. Subjects with cardiac edema receiving diuretic treatments 7 days prior to the start of treatment. 2. Subjects able to receive a daily regular dosage of furosemide at 40mg to 80mg from the observation period until the endoftreatment examination. 3. CHF patients with lower limb edema, jugular venous distention, or pulmonary congestion due to extracellular volume expansion. 4. Male or female subjects between the age of 20 and 85, inclusive. 5.
