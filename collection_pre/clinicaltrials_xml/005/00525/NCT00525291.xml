	<brief_summary>The efficacy of biofeedback and/or low frequency electrical stimulation for the treatment of anal incontinence has not been proven. First, large well-designed clinical trials are missing. Second, only few patients reach therapeutically relevant intensities with low frequency stimulation. In this study, a novel therapeutic concept, termed triple target treatment (3T) was evaluated. 3T combines stimulation with amplitude modulated middle frequency (AM-MF), electromyography (EMG)-triggered stimulation and EMG-biofeedback. 3T was compared with EMG-biofeedback alone after a nine month treatment period. Methods In this parallel-group randomised multicenter study with blinded observer we enrolled 158 patients with anal incontinence. Primary endpoints were changes from baseline to nine months in the Cleveland Clinic Score (CCS) and the St. Mark's score (Vaizey score).</brief_summary>
