	<brief_title>INSTEAD Trial: INvestigation of STEnt Grafts in Patients With Type B Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients older than 18 years with type B aortic dissection as diagnosed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography are randomized to either a thoracic aortic endoprosthesis and antihypertensive treatment, called "stent grafting," or a tailored antihypertensive treatment, called "medical treatment." Only patients in a clinically stable condition and without spontaneous thrombosis of the false lumen after 14 days of the index dissection are considered eligible for study inclusion. Primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome variables include conversion to stent and/or surgery, induced thrombosis of the false lumen, cardiovascular morbidity, aortic expansion (&gt;5 mm/y of maximum diameter including true and false lumina), quality of life, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. The study design calls for 136 patients to be randomized and monitored for 24 months.</detailed_description>
