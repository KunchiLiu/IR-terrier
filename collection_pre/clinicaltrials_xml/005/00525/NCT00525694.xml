	<brief_summary>This will be a clinical test to determine if any carbohydrate or a gluconeogenic precursor added to a zero calorie product might be important to consider in the management of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. This research trial will evaluate the effect of three different solutions on blood glucose level. One solution is plain water, the second a standard high glucose (sugar) solution used typically in diabetes testing, and the third a low calorie drink (Zero Coke). Based on a prior study evaluating a diet for effective weight loss, we observed that patients who drank large volumes of diet soda did not lose weight as readily as those who did not drink diet soda. Therefore, we propose to examine the actual effect of one diet soda (Zero Coke) on the body's glucose level and compare it to water and a high glucose solution. All participants in this study must have 3 Glucose tolerance evaluations - one with each solution: water, high glucose, and Zero Coke.</brief_summary>
