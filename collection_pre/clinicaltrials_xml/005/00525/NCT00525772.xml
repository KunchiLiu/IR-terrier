	<brief_title>Effect of Ciclesonide on Exercise Induced Bronchoconstriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study the effects of 4 doses of ciclesonide on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, bronchial responsiveness to mannitol, sputum parameters and other parameters of asthma control in asthmatic patients. The primary aim was to evaluate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as a method of determining the dose and time responses of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The secondary aims were to evaluate the dose and time responses of sputum parameters and responsiveness to mannitol to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore to explore the relationship(s) between exercise induced bronchoconstriction, sputum parameters and mannitol responsiveness.</detailed_description>
