	<criteria>Patients with with hypercholesterolaemia and CHD or a CHD risk equivalent, clinical evidence of atherosclerosis or a Framingham 10year CHD risk score of &gt;20 Patients will need to sign an informed consent before any visit procedures can be performed, including procedures for the optional genetic research and biomarker studies. Patients must be 18 years or older and will be asked to stop taking any current cholesterollowering medications. Dietary counselling will be provided which will include an overview of the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC) diet the patients will be asked to follow Use of lipid lowering drugs and other prohibited concomitant medications. History of statininduced myopathy, or serious hypersensitivity reaction to other HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins), including rosuvastatin, simvastatin and/or a history of hypersensitivity to any components of ezetimibe. Patients considered to be unstable by their physician after the following events: a myocardial infarction, recent episode of unstable angina, myocardial revascularisation [percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or another revascularisation procedure] or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke and patients awaiting a planned myocardial revascularisation</criteria>
