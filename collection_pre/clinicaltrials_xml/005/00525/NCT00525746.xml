	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to identify biologic and lifestyle factors that may increase a person's risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome after treatment for a previous cancer (treatment-related AML/MDS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Epidemiology of Therapy-related Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic Syndrome (AML/MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this study, you will be asked to take part in a personal or mail interview. During the interview, you will be asked questions about your demographics (age, sex, etc.), any chemicals you may have been exposed to, your medical history, family history of cancer, your diet, and your smoking and alcohol use histories. It should take around 50 minutes to complete the interview. Treatment information from your medical records at M. D. Anderson will also be collected. You will be asked to provide a saliva sample or have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for special tests. These tests will look for biologic factors associated with treatment-related AML/MDS. Your participation in this study will be over once the interview has been completed and blood or saliva have been collected. This is an investigational study. Up to 600 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
