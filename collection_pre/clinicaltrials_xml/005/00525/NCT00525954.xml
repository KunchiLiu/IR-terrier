	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted at up to 25 U.S. centers and will be a double-blind randomized parallel group placebo controlled study among subjects with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo tablets or one of 2 orally active doses of A-002. The duration of study drug therapy will be 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PLASMA 2 Trial: Examination of Once Daily (QD) Dosing of A-002 In Subjects With Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A-002 represents a novel therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). Through the inhibition of activity A-002 may provide multifunctional activity directed against key facets of the disease process, namely a) inflammation, b) atherogenic lipid profiles and c) the atherosclerotic process. Non-clinical and clinical data from recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of early and aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. Recent clinical studies have provided a strong association between levels and cardiovascular event risk. The proposed Phase 2 clinical pharmacology study (Study No. AN-CVD-2222) will examine the effects of 2 different doses of A-002 compared with placebo, on enzyme levels and activity after 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the effect of treatment on inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein [CRP]), lipid levels and lipoprotein subclasses and other soluble biomarkers (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, TNF, MCP-1 etc) will also be assessed.</detailed_description>

Stable medical condition, will be compliant and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol Subjects must NOT meet any of the following exclusion criteria: 1. Planned coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) 2. Acute or chronic heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification as functional Class III or Class IV 3. Hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) if troponin &gt;0.1 ng/mL in the preceding 6 weeks 4. Hospitalization for STsegment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the preceding 12 weeks 5. Subjects with chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), inflammatory bowel disease, recent (12 weeks) systemic or localized infection (the latter requiring clinical intervention), or major surgery 6. hsCRP ≥15 mg/L repeated on at least 2 occasions &gt;24 hours apart due to noncardiovascular systemic inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid disease) 7. Subjects enrolled in another experimental (interventional) protocol within the past 30 days prior to Screening or prior experience with A002. 8. Subjects treated for cancer within the previous 5 years except for skin basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, with measures other than a minor, complete surgical excision (e.g., chemotherapy), or radiation therapy 9. Subjects who have received immunosuppressant therapy within 30 days prior to entry 10. Subjects who have received antitumor necrosis factor (for example, infliximab) therapy within 6 months prior to entry 11. The presence of severe liver disease with cirrhosis, recent active hepatitis, active chronic hepatitis, ALT or AST &gt;3 x upper limit of normal, biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin &gt;2 x upper limit of normal) 12. Active cholecystitis, gall bladder symptoms, or potential hepatobiliary abnormalities 13. The presence of moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;60 mL/min or creatinine &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal), nephrotic syndrome, or subjects undergoing dialysis 14.

Females who are nursing, pregnant, or intend to become pregnant during the time of the study, or subjects who have a positive serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 (if the subject is a female of childbearing potential). Women of childbearing potential must also use a reliable method of birth control during the study and for 1 month following completion of therapy. A reliable method for this study is defined as one of the following: oral or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), contraceptive implants, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, a doublebarrier method (diaphragm with spermicidal foam or jelly, or a condom). 16. Subjects who have a history of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year of study entry 17. Subject living too far from participating center or unable to return for followup visits 18. Subjects who in the opinion of the Investigator are a poor medical or psychiatric risk for therapy with an investigational drug, are unreliable, or have an incomplete understanding of the study which may affect their ability to take drugs as prescribed or comply with instructions 19. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection 20. Treatment with any systemic corticosteroid within the 30day period prior to study entry or the use of inhaled steroids within the 14day period prior to study entry</criteria>
