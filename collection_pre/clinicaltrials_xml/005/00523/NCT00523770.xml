	<brief_summary>GSK Biologicals is working on the development of a vaccine to protect elderly people from pneumococcal infection. For the future studies in that project, it would be useful to have some easy non invasive tests to detect infection by the bacteria. Some tests on urine are already on the market but need to be improved in the laboratory. For that purpose, some urine samples from healthy subjects aged 65 years or above and who have not suffered from pneumonia nor have been administered pneumococcal vaccination in the past 3 months are needed. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007</brief_summary>
