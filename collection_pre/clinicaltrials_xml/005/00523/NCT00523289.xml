	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if bupivacaine (75% levobupivacaine plus 25% racemic bupivacaine) with vasoconstrictor is effective and safety as ropivacaine in brachial plexus block for orthopedic surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Safety Research: Bupivacaine With Vasoconstrictor Versus Ropivacaine in Brachial Plexus Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intoxication by Bupivacaine is considered life threatening. Currently the most safety local anesthetic in substitution to bupivacaine is ropivacaine, however in Brasil there is a bupivacaine mixture of 75% levobupivacaine plus 25% racemic bupivacaine. The research design is: Patients involved: 48; age: 18 to 40 years old; both sex; ASA I and II. Surgery: elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery. Anesthesia technique: brachial plexus block. Primary endpoint: cardiovascular safety; analysis by continuous Holter. Secondary endpoint: anesthetic and analgesic efficacy.</detailed_description>
