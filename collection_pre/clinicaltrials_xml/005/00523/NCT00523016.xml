	<brief_summary>Acupuncture has been used with good results for many years at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Lyndhurst Centre (Toronto, ON, Canada), Parkwood Hospital (London, ON, Canada) and GF Strong Rehabilitation Institute (Vancouver, BC, Canada) to reduce burning pain in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI). This multi-centre RCT will test an acupuncture protocol for treatment of burning pain in 40 people with burning pain in SCI, using a sham acupuncture protocol as the control. Objectives of Study: 1. To determine the feasibility of conducting a real acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture trial in a multi-centre study using the Lyndhurst Central Neuropathic Pain Acupuncture Protocol (LCCNPAP). This will inform a larger study which will directly evaluate the effect of the LCCNPAP on pain and Quality of Life (QOL) in individuals with SCI. 2. To determine which outcome measures are most responsive and the amount of change that could be expected, with respect to pain and QOL, for the larger study. 3. To obtain preliminary data to determine subject numbers for future studies evaluating the effect of the acupuncture protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture Treatment to Reduce Burning Pain in Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 individuals with SCI below-level neuropathic pain who are at least 6 weeks post-injury will be recruited at the three study sites. Subjects will be randomized into either the experimental or control group using a random number table as they enter the study to determine whether they will undergo the real acupuncture treatment or sham treatment. A total of 13 treatments will be administered over a maximum of 4 consecutive weeks with an ideal treatment frequency as follows: 5 times per week during weeks one and two; and 3 times per week during week three. Following all sessions, whether LCCNPAP group or sham, any adverse events such as nausea, fainting, bleeding etc., will be recorded on an adverse effects sheet for each subject. Baseline arterial blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored at four points during each treatment session for both groups.</detailed_description>
