	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of Gemcitabine, Capecitabine, and Bevacizumab in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- to determine the objective response rate and estimate the time to progression of combination gemcitabine, capecitabine, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer; - to determine survival of combination gemcitabine, capecitabine, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic cell renal cell cancer; - to determine the toxicity of combination gemcitabine, capecitabine, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer; - to collect baseline serum and plasma samples for exploration of possible prognostic and predictive markers</detailed_description>
