	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate of lymphomatous meningitis or leukemic meningitis to DepoCyt. The safety of DepoCyt, the number of people who respond well to the study drug, and the response of symptoms to the study drug will also be determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DepoCyt for Active Lymphomatous or Leukemic Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DepoCyt is a sustained-release formulation of the chemotherapy drug, cytarabine (Ara-C), which is used for the treatment of patients with lymphomatous or leukemic meningitis, a complication of lymphoma/leukemia that is characterized by the spread of cancer to the central nervous system. DepoCyt is introduced into the spinal fluid, through a needle inserted into the spinal canal or through a reservoir placed under the scalp by a neurosurgeon. DepoCyt will be given every two weeks i.e. week 1 and week 3 initially. After the second dose, a lumbar puncture will be done to check the spinal fluid for cancer cells. If there has been a good response, DepoCyt will be given every 14 days for 6 doses i.e., weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and then every 28 days for six doses i.e., weeks 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, and 39. Blood tests and lumbar punctures will be done throughout the study.</detailed_description>
