	<brief_summary>Because drugs used to treat TB can reduce the amount of the anti-HIV drugs that reach the sites where the virus is located, this study is designed to see whether it is necessary to use higher doses of antiviral (anti-HIV) drugs while patients are receiving therapy with rifampin, one of the drugs commonly used to treat TB. Participants will be assigned to one of 4 arms (see below) and will be followed during the time when they are receiving both treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Best Dose of Antivirals in Patients With Both TB and HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, randomized study with 4 arms: 1.) Standard dose and 2.) high dose nevirapine; and 3.) standard dose and 4.) high dose efavirenz. Subjects in all 4 arms will also receive 2 nucleoside analog drugs. Patients will have routine monitoring for the treatment of TB and HIV, as well as some additional blood samples to follow the virus in the blood and to determine the effect of the TB therapy on the amounts of anti-HIV drugs that are in the body.</detailed_description>
