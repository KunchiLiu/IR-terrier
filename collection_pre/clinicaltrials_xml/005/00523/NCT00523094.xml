	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to estimate the accuracy of the pre-operative VRI quantitative results versus the gold standard pre-operative perfusion scan. The secondary objective is to assess the correlation of the predicted post-operative lung function with the observed post-operative lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) in patients who underwent surgical resection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibration Response Imaging (VRI) in Patients That Are Candidates for Undergoing Pulmonary Operation Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre lung operation candidates for procedures such as lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), lung resection, bullectomy and lung transplant are frequently evaluated for differential lung function by a semi quantitative lung scintigraphy. VRI may offer the same differential lung function information for the physician without the risks, time and patient discomfort of lung scintigraphy in the treating physician office. Moreover, VRI may provide a safe, quick and simple method to measure "split function" in lung cancer patients who are candidates for lung surgery. Thus eliminating the safety and complexity issue related with the current ventilation perfusion "split function" methods. In addition the VRI may aid in achieving the goal of developing strategies to reduce risk and maximize the number of patients that can benefit from surgical therapy.</detailed_description>
