	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of treatment with valsartan + amlodipine to a target systolic blood pressure (SBP)&lt;130 mmHg compared to the Joint National Commission on the Treatment of Hypertension 7 recommended target SBP of &lt;140 mmHg on the intrinsic diastolic properties of the myocardium in patients with hypertension and echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 45 years or older Male and female patients are eligible. Female patients must be postmenopausal for one year, surgically sterile, or using effective contraceptive methods such as a double barrier method with spermicide, an intrauterine device, or hormonal contraceptives. Postmenopausal women on a stable dose of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for at least three (3) months prior to the screening visit are eligible for the study. Uncontrolled systolic hypertension on a maximum of two (2) antihypertensive medications at the time of screening. Echocardiographic ejection fraction â‰¥50% and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Provide written informed consent to participate in the study prior to any screening or study procedures Have the ability to communicate well and comply with all study requirements Severe hypertension defined as a MSSBP &gt;200 mmHg and/or MSDBP &gt;120 mmHg. History of a secondary cause of hypertension including but not limited to: coarctation of the aorta, hyperaldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, Cushing's disease, pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, etc. Ejection fraction &lt;50 % History of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or unstable angina pectoris within 6 months of screening Presence of clinically significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation/flutter) History of congestive heart failure History of diabetes mellitus History of renal impairment with serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL at screening, history of dialysis, or history of nephritic syndrome Antihypertensive therapy with three (3) or more medications at the time of screening Active and/or treated malignancy of any organ system within twelve (12) months of enrollment, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/ml) Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they meet the following definition of postmenopausal: 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt;40 mIU/m or 6 weeks post surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy OR are using one or more of the following acceptable methods of contraception: barrier method with spermicidal agent, an intrauterine device, hormonal contraceptives, or total abstinence at the discretion of the investigator in cases where the age, career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation of the patient ensures compliance. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of any drug including, but not limited to, any of the following: history of major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, bowel resection, gastric bypass, gastric stapling, or gastric banding, currently active, or active inflammatory bowel syndrome within 12 months prior to Visit 1, currently active gastritis, ulcers, or gastrointestinal/rectal bleeding, or urinary tract obstruction regarded as clinically meaningful by the investigator Pancreatic injury, pancreatitis or evidence of impaired pancreatic function/injury within 12 months prior to Visit 1 Any serum AST or ALT elevation two (2) times the upper limit of normal Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
