	<brief_title>A Comparison of Lorazepam and Diazepam in the Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the frequent use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, studies comparing the efficacy of long and short half-life benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal have shown mixed results. Due to the conflicting nature of published reports, clinicians have no clear indication as to which type of agent is preferable. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two commonly accepted medications in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, diazepam and lorazepam, which are long and short half-life benzodiazepines, respectively.</detailed_description>
