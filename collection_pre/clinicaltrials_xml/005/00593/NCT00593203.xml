	<brief_summary>The Molecular Neurosurgical Tissue Bank will function as a tissue or specimen repository for biopsy specimens from patients (both adult and pediatric) undergoing brain surgery and brain procedures. Leftover tissue removed during the course of brain surgery will be collected and stored in neurosurgical laboratories for use in medical research that might be currently ongoing or for future research. In addition, blood and cerebral spinal fluid samples will also be collected and stored. Leftover cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be collected during standard of care procedures (lumbar punctures or ventricular drains) that take place at time of diagnosis, completion of therapy and relapse of disease or during neurosurgery. Blood will be drawn at time of routine lab draws required during the surgery or procedure.</brief_summary>
