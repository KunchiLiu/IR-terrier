	<brief_summary>Differences in determining bone density scores have been found when comparing different bone density machines. Reducing differences between machines will improve diagnostic agreement for patients measured at different clinics. This study will test if this difference exists between the Norland Excel, such as the one at Wildwood Clinic, and the GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy at the UW Osteoporosis Clinical Research Center.</brief_summary>
