	<criteria>Subject is informed and given ample time and opportunity to think about his/her participation in this trial and has given his/her written informed consent. Subject is willing and able to comply with all trial requirements. Subject is male or female, aged≥ 18 years. Subject is Korean. Subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr Stage IIV) as defined by the cardinal sign, bradykinesia, and at least 1 of the following: resting tremor, rigidity, or impairment of postural reflexes. Subject is not satisfactorily controlled on a total daily dose of ropinirole from 3mg to 12mg, inclusive. If the subject is receiving levodopa, either shortacting or sustainedrelease (in combination with benserazide or carbidopa), the total daily dose must be stable for 28 days prior to the Baseline Visit and must remain stable for the Treatment Period. If the subject is receiving an anticholinergic agent (eg, benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, parsitan, procyclidine, biperiden), a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor (eg, selegiline), a COMT inhibitor (eg, entacapone), or an Nmethyldaspartate (NMDA)antagonist (eg, amantadine), he/she must have been on a stable dose for at least 28 days prior to the Baseline Visit and must be maintained on that dose for the Treatment Period Subjects are not permitted to enroll in the trial if any of the following criteria are met: Subject has previously participated in a trial with rotigotine. Subject has participated in another trial of an investigational drug within 28 days prior to the Baseline Visit or is currently participating in another trial of an investigational drug. Subject has atypical Parkinsonian syndrome(s), including druginduced Parkinsonian syndrome(s). Subject has dementia, active psychosis, or hallucinations (not due to antiparkinsonian medication). Subject is receiving therapy with 1 of the following drugs either concurrently or within 28 days prior to Baseline Visit: alphamethyl dopa, metoclopramide, reserpine, neuroleptics (except specific atypical neuroleptics: olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) inhibitors, methylphenidate, or amphetamine. Subject is currently receiving central nervous system (CNS) active therapy (eg, sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics), unless the dose has been stable for at least 28 days prior to the Baseline Visit and is likely to remain stable for the duration of the trial. Subject has a history of seizures or stroke within 1 year, has had a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) within 12 months prior to enrollment, or a history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to enrollment. Presence of clinically relevant hepatic dysfunction. Presence of clinically relevant renal dysfunction. Evidence of clinically relevant cardiovascular disorders. Subject has a QTcB interval of ≥ 500ms at Pretreatment or Baseline (repeated measurements within 1 hour). Subject has a history of symptomatic (not asymptomatic) orthostatic hypotension in the 6 months prior to Baseline. Subject has a history of significant skin hypersensitivity to adhesive or other transdermals or recent unresolved contact dermatitis. Subject has malignant neoplastic disease requiring therapy within 12 months prior to enrollment. Subject has a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within the last 6 months. Subject has taken herbal medicine therapy within the last 2 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit. Subject has clinically significant laboratory results that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for entry into the trial. Subject is pregnant or nursing, or is of childbearing potential but (i) not surgically sterile or (ii) not using adequate birth control methods (including at least 1 barrier method), or (iii) not sexually abstinent or (iv) not at least 2 years postmenopausal. Subject has evidence of an impulse control disorder according to the Jay Modified Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (mMIDI) at Pretreatment (Visit 1). Subject has any other clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition that would, in the judgment of the investigator, interfere with the subject's ability to participate in this trial.</criteria>
