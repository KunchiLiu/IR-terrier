	<brief_summary>Pregnant women have limited knowledge regarding influenza, its implications during pregnancy, and recommendations for vaccination during pregnancy. The researchers plan to distribute an information pamphlet to women in a prenatal clinic, offer the vaccine during prenatal visits, and then give a questionnaire on the postpartum floor assessing knowledge. The researchers hypothesize that with education intervention, knowledge scores on the questionnaire will be higher than those from last year, when no education was provided.</brief_summary>
