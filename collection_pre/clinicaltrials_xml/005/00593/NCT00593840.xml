	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if reducing or eliminating radiation treatment to one or both sides of the neck where there is no evidence of cancer can help spare the side effects of radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. In this study, we plan to reduce the amount of radiation treatment received to healthy tissue</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Evaluating Elimination of Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will prospectively test whether this method of volume reduction can be implemented without a change in the historical institutional locoregional control rate achieved with intensity modulated postoperative radiation therapy (IMPORT). Quality of life measurements via validated instruments will be incorporated to establish correlation of volume reduction with QOL.</detailed_description>
