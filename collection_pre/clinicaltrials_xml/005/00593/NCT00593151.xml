	<brief_summary>The purposes of the PLUS study were to confirm the safety and tolerability of two doses of LocteronTM (320 ug and 640 ug) dosed over four weeks in patients who had failed prior anti-HCV therapies (Panels A and B), and then to continue to study the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the same two doses of LocteronTM (320 ug and 640 ug) in treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV patients when Locteron dosed over 12 weeks (Panel C). All subjects were also to receive oral daily weight-based ribavirin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety, Tolerability, and Anti-Viral Effect of Locteron Compared to PEG-Intron in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Panels A and B of the PLUS study were designed to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and viral kinetics over four weeks of two doses of Locteron™ (230 ug and 640 ug) given every two weeks in comparison with PegIntron® given weekly in treatment-experienced subjects with chronic hepatitis C of any genotype who were co-administered weight-based oral ribavirin. The two cohorts of 16 subjects each in Panels A and B consisted of subjects who had failed prior interferon therapy. In Panel A, 8 subjects were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 320 μg Locteron™ and 8 subjects were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 1.5 ug/kg PegIntron®. In Panel B, 8 subjects were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 640 μg Locteron™ and 8 subjects were randomized to and completed 4 weeks of treatment with 1.5 ug/kg PegIntron®. When the results of Panel A and Panel B were known, conduct of Panel C for 12 weeks in treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype-1 HCV was considered unnecessary and cancelled, and an entirely new study was begun instead.</detailed_description>
