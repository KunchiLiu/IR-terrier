	<brief_title>Study of the Pathogenesis and Molecular Mechanism of "YURE" in Internal Intractable Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood stasis and blood heat are two pathogens in the theory system of Chinese Medicine, which can cause many diseases independently. But in internal intractable diseases, such as viral hepatitis, stroke, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever, blood stasis and blood heat always accompany with each other. So the hypothesis is raised that blood stasis with heat (YURE) is a compound pathogen and key pathogenesis in internal intractable diseases. This study was aimed to verify the role that the compound pathogen played in hemorrhagic stroke and to observe the progress of the key pathogenesis. A randomized and controlled trial would be conducted in five hospitals, where 300 hospitalized patients with hemorrhagic stroke in the acute phase would receive different intervention with basic modern medicine treatment or Chinese herbs formula combined with the former. The Chinese herbs formula, which was designed under the guidance of the theory system of Chinese Medicine, was supposed to cool blood heat and dissolve blood stasis. Clinical efficacy and safety would be evaluated after the 21-days intervention.</detailed_description>
