	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to assess patient accessibility, interest and response in order to design an adequately powered study to compare brief, group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for weight loss to usual care in non-demented patients above the age of 18 years old who are currently taking atypical antipsychotic medications. This pilot study is necessary, with current limitations of data in this area, to design an adequately powered study to address the difficulties managing metabolic syndrome risk factors in patients on antipsychotics.</brief_summary>
