	<brief_summary>Sixty patients with mild-to-moderate PAD (ABI 0.4-0.9) and hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;200 mg/dl) already treated with statins will be imaged at baseline and randomized to Lovaza and placebo for 12 months. MR imaging will be repeated at the end of the 12-month period. We hypothesize that treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with PAD with Lovaza will reduce atherosclerotic plaque volume in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) by 2% over 1 year compared to placebo. Secondary aims will be to show improved plaque characteristics (thickened fibrous cap, reduced lipid-rich necrotic core, improved exercise calf muscle perfusion using first-pass contrast enhanced MRI and improved exercise treadmill performance with Lovaza compared to matching placebo.</brief_summary>
