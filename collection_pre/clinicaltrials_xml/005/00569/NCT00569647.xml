	<brief_summary>Children with burns often require repeated reconstructive surgeries. These children tend to develop high levels of anxiety before coming to the operating room. Preoperative sedation, while somewhat effective in relieving this anxiety, has a number of side effects. The researchers hypothesized that preoperative anxiety could be effectively reduced by the utilization of a device which induces a relaxing hypnotic state through emmersion in a virtual reality environment.</brief_summary>
