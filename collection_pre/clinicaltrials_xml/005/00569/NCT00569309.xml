	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving vaccine therapy after an autologous stem cell transplant may kill any cancer cells that remain after transplant. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant for high-risk lymphoma or multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Reconstitution After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transpl for High-Risk Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess immune reconstitution as measured by response to pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine, NK-cell activity against autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines, and cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus tetramer responses in patients who have undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for high-risk lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Secondary - Assess the absolute number of circulating regulatory T-cells and the function of these cells as measured by their expression of TGFβ and interleukin-10 (IL-10). - Evaluate the effect of conditioning therapy on quality of life, including functional status, fatigue, and depression, in these patients. - Correlate quality of life with inflammatory cytokine production of peripheral blood monocytes at specified time points. - Provide baseline immune reconstitution and quality of life pilot data for comparison in future post-transplant immunotherapy trials. OUTLINE: Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine intramuscularly once in weeks 9, 17, and 25 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative and immunological studies. Quality of life (QOL) is assessed periodically using the QOL short form (SF-36, 4-week version), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI-30).</detailed_description>
