	<brief_summary>Approximately 30 adults will participate in this study at the International Diabetes Center (IDC). The IDC is the only site conducting this study. Length of participation can range from two to three months which will include four to seven clinic visits. The purpose of this study is to use a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system to determine the characteristics of glucose control and patterns of food intake before exenatide is started, during the start and adjustment of exenatide and during exenatide treatment. The long-term purpose of this study is to determine to what extent continuous glucose monitoring improves or alters clinical decision making for patients treated with exenatide. And, the study will also compare CGM to conventional self-monitored blood glucose methods. The study will also compare subjects' changes, if any, in nutrient intake such as energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate during the course of the study through interpretation/analysis of self-reported food intake.</brief_summary>
