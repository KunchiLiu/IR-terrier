	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if a nurse managed, protocol driven, disease management process for diabetes results in improved attainment of therapeutic goals for diabetes compared to usual care. It is hypothesized that implementation of the disease management process will improve the percentage of diabetic individuals attaining all three therapeutic targets (HgbA1C&lt;8.0%, LDL&lt;100mg/dl, and BP&lt;130/80mmHG) by 10% compared to usual care.</brief_summary>
