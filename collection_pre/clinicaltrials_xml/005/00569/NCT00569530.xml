	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of late doses of Infasurf with inhaled nitric oxide will interact to improve the surfactant function and thus the respiratory status and outcome of treated infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Late Surfactant to Prevent BPD: A Pilot Study in Ventilated Preterm Neonates Receiving Inhaled Nitric Oxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surfactant dysfunction my contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in persistently ventilated preterm infants. We conducted a multi-center, randomized, blinded pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of late administration of surfactant (Calfactant - high in protein B) in combination with prolonged inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants &lt; 1000 grams birthweight (BW). Calfactant is one of several types of exogenous surfactant. Calfactant has the highest % of surfactant protein B of the different types.</detailed_description>
