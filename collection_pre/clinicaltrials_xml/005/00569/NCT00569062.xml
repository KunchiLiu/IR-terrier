	<brief_summary>GW856553 is a novel compound, currently in development for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and other indications. GW856553 inhibits a protein which is responsible for the production of some pro-inflammatory molecules, called cytokines. Increased blood levels of these molecules were seen in populations of MDD patients and this was more apparent in subjects with severe symptoms, psychomotor retardation and loss of energy. Aim of the present study is to assess whether GW856553, by inactivating this protein, is able to suppress the production of the cytokines, and ultimately relieving depression symptoms. In this study GW856553 or placebo is given to MDD patients 7.5md twice daily for 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
