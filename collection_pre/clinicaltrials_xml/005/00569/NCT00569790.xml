Neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3 4. Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 5. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL 6. AST and ALT ≤100 U/L (&lt;200 U/L in patients with liver metastasis) 7. Serum creatinine ≤1.2 mg/dL 8. Creatinine clearance estimate by the CockcroftGault method &gt;50 mL/min (reduce initial dosage by one step if ≥50 but &lt;80 mL/min) 8. Able to take capsules orally. 9. No electrocardiographic abnormalities within 28 days before enrollment that would clinically preclude the execution of the study, as judged by the investigator. 10. Voluntary written informed consent. 1. Serious drug hypersensitivity or a history of drug allergy 2. Active double cancer 3. Active infections (e.g., patients with pyrexia of 38℃ or higher) 4. History of gastrointestinal perforation, intestinal tract paralysis, or ileus within 1 year. 5. Uncontrolled hypertension 6. Serious complications (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, heart failure, renal failure, hepatic failure, or poorly controlled diabetes) 7. Moderate or severe ascites or pleural effusion requiring treatment 8. Watery diarrhea 9. Treatment with flucytosine or atazanavir sulfate 10. Metastasis to the CNS 11. Pregnant women, possibly pregnant women, women wishing to become pregnant, and nursing mothers. Men who are currently attempting to conceive children. 12. Severe mental disorder 13. Continuous treatment with steroids 14. Urine dipstick for proteinuria should be &lt;2+ 15. Patient with a past history of thrombosis, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism 16. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or clinically significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks 17. Longterm daily treatment with aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) 18. History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding 19. Judged ineligible for participation in the study by the investigator for safety reasons.</criteria>
