	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying giving octreotide acetate together with recombinant interferon alfa-2b to see how well it works compared with giving octreotide acetate together with bevacizumab in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced, high-risk neuroendocrine tumor. Octreotide acetate and recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving octreotide acetate together with recombinant interferon alfa-2b is more effective than giving octreotide acetate together with bevacizumab in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Octreotide Acetate and Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b or Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced, High-Risk Neuroendocrine Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare central review-based progression-free survival in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide (octreotide acetate) plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon (recombinant interferon alfa-2b). II. To compare overall survival, time to treatment failure and traditionally reported progression-free survival in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon. III. To compare objective response (confirmed and unconfirmed CR and PR) in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon. IV. To compare the toxicity profile of patients treated with these two regimens. V. To assess the prognostic and predictive value of VEGF expression in relation to progression-free survival and treatment effect. VI. To compare response of 5HIAA, chromogranin A and neuronspecific enolase among patients with elevated levels at baseline between patients treated with octreotide plus interferon versus octreotide plus bevacizumab. VII. To assess and compare the prognostic and predictive value of the combination of In-111 pentetreotide somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and CT vs. CT in relation to progression-free survival (PFS). VIII. To assess and compare the prognostic and predictive value of the combination of SRS and CT vs. CT in relation to overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to site of disease (small bowel vs cecum vs appendix vs other site), disease progression after initial diagnosis (yes or no), histologic grade (low vs intermediate [atypical]), and prior octreotide acetate therapy within the past 2 months (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive depot octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive octreotide acetate IM as in arm I on day 1 and recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19. Treatment in both arms repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2-6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
