	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) antagonist, etanercept, on the early clinical course of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). PMR is a common inflammatory disease with an unknown etiology that is characterized by aching, tender, and stiff proximal muscle. Some evidence suggests that TNF plays a central role in the pathophysiology of PMR. The preferred treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) is adequate for most patients, but a subset of patients have a more prolonged, relapsing disease course. These patients require treatment with GCs for 1 to 2 years. GC related adverse events are frequent during treatment.</brief_summary>
