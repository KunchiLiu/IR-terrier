	<brief_summary>Recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines recommend prophylactic ICD implantation in most patients with coronary heart disease and LVEF &lt; 40%. Current Canadian guidelines recommend ICDs for primary prophylaxis in CAD patients with LVEF &lt; 30% (Class I recommendation). There are very sparse data to recommend ICD implantation in patients with EF between 30 and 40 %. This study will randomize patients with CHD and an EF between 30 and 40% to ICD therapy vs. No ICD therapy. The primary outcome is mortality and the study is powered as a non-inferiority trial to test the hypothesis that mortality in patients with no ICD is not more than 1% greater (absolute yearly increase) than patients receiving an ICD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>documented chronic coronary heart disease (prior MI and/or angiographically documented CAD), &gt; 40 days post the most recent MI; LVEF &lt; 40% (by MUGA) and NYHA functional class II or III at time of assessment OR LVEF ≤ 35 % (by MUGA) and NYHA functional class I, II or III at time of assessment Judged to have a reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 year, as well as receiving optimum, guideline recommended therapy for coronary artery disease and heart failure (or demonstrated intolerance or contraindications to such therapy). Age ≥ 18 years; no upper age limitation. Prior cardiac arrest, sustained VT or VF, or unexplained syncope. Attempted VT / VF induction at electrophysiological study. Need for a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. Enrollment in another interventional trial.</criteria>
