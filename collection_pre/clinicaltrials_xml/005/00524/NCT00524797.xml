	<brief_summary>Myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression) is the most important toxic side effect of the majority of chemotherapeutic agents and typically is the dose limiting factor. Death occurring after chemotherapy usually results either from infection related to drug induced leucopenia or from bleeding related to thrombocytopenia. Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) are widely used in the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia. The same Erythropoetines are used in the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia. Both treatments are expensive and have several side effects. In our previous stud (1) we found a special kind of honey: Life-Mel Honey to reduce the incidence of chemotherapy induced pancytopenia and improving quality of life. The aim of the recent planed study is to provide prophylactic and protective treatment against neutropenia reducing the need for secondary CSF administration in patients receiving chemotherapy along with a natural and non expensive honey: Profonycia. This honey which is expressed in Kibutz Shamir in Upper Galliee seems promising and easy for administration: given 5 gr/day per os for 7 days from the administration of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
