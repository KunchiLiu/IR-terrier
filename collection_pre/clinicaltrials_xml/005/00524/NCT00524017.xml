	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block abnormal cell growth in different ways. Some block the ability of abnormal cells to grow and spread. Others find abnormal cells and help kill them or carry cell-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well cetuximab works in treating patients with precancerous lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Precancerous Lesions of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the histologic response rate in patients with high-risk, premalignant lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract treated with cetuximab. Secondary - To determine the clinical response rate in these patients. - To determine if patterns of EGFR component expression are altered in these patients. - To determine the change in status of genetic alterations, including loss of heterozygosity, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by lesion type (diffuse dysplasia vs recurrent dysplasia vs dysplastic lesions with 3p or 9p loss of heterozygosity [LOH]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I (treatment): Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (control): Patients receive regular follow-up care. Patients have the option of receiving cetuximab after completion of the study. In both arms, patients with persistent or recurrent high-grade dysplasia or dysplastic lesions with 3p or 9p LOH undergo surgical resection, if feasible, after week 8. Tumor biopsy samples are obtained at baseline* and after week 8 for histologic and biomarker correlative studies. Tissue samples are analyzed by histopathology to determine histologic changes in post-treatment lesions and by IHC to measure expression and activation of EGFR signaling pathway components. LOH studies are also performed. NOTE: *Paraffin-embedded tissue from the original diagnostic biopsy may be used for baseline assessment, if the diagnostic biopsy was performed within 3 months prior to study entry. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at approximately 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years as per routine standard of care.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed highrisk, premalignant lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract, meeting one of the following criteria: Unresectable, diffuse highgrade dysplasia, defined as moderate or severe dysplasia that is not assessable by physical examination and/or that cannot be excised by standard surgical techniques previously treated HNSCC with persistent or recurrent high grade dysplasia with no evidence of head and neck malignancy for three months prior to enrollment or who have successfully completed therapy for head and neck malignancy more than 3 months prior to enrollment. Dysplastic lesions with 3p or 9p loss of heterozygosity Disease location amenable to endoscopic biopsy in an outpatient clinical setting or operative biopsy within the routine scheduling and practice of clinical care No medical contraindication to biopsy of the target lesion Pathology must be reviewed by the Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Pathology PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 01 ANC &gt; 1,000/mm³ Platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm³ Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months after completion of study therapy No concurrent illness likely to preclude study therapy or surgical resection Patients with a history of a curatively treated malignancy are eligible provided they are diseasefree and have a survival prognosis that exceeds 5 years No evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease Patients with chronic, stable radiographic changes who are asymptomatic are eligible No history or radiological evidence of pulmonary fibrosis No acute myocardial infarction within the past 3 months No uncontrolled angina, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure No evidence of other severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) No evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that would preclude study participation No known severe hypersensitivity to cetuximab or any of its excipients No prior hypersensitivity reaction to chimerized or murine monoclonal antibody therapy No severe abnormality of the cornea PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics Recovered from prior oncologic or other major surgery or biopsy More than 30 days since prior nonapproved or investigational drugs No prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery for the premalignant lesions No prior EGFRtargeted agents (e.g., cetuximab, gefitinib, or erlotinib)</criteria>
