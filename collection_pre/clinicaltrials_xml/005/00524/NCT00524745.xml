	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that Gardasil速 vaccine, when given to girls 11-13 years of age according to 1 of 3 alternative 3-dose schedules (0, 3, 9 months; 0, 6, 12 months; or 0, 12, 24 months), results in anti-HPV type 16 and anti-HPV type 18 responses 28 days post-dose 3 that are similar to those obtained when the vaccine is given on the standard 3-dose schedule of 0, 2, 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: To test the hypothesis that Gardasil速 vaccine, when administered to girls 11-13 years of age according to 1 of 3 alternative 3-dose schedules (0,3,9 months; 0,6,12 months; or 0,12,24 months), results in anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 responses 28 days post-dose 3 that are similar to those obtained when the vaccine is administered on the standard 3-dose schedule of 0,2,6 months. Secondary objectives: 1. To test the hypothesis that Gardasil速 vaccine, when administered to girls 11-13 years of age according to 1 of 3 alternative 3-dose schedules (0,3,9 months; 0,6,12 months; or 0,12,24 months), results in anti-HPV 6 and anti-HPV 11 responses 28 days post-dose 3 that are similar to those obtained when the vaccine is administered on the standard 3-dose schedule of 0,2,6 months. 2. To describe the safety profile of the administration of Gardasil速 according to each of the four schedules by assessing: (i) immediate reactogenicity (reactions within 30 minutes after each injection); (ii) solicited (local reactogenicity and fever) and unsolicited events occurring during the first 7 days following each vaccination; (iii) serious adverse events occurring up to one month following the last dose of vaccine; (iv) deaths or adverse events occurring at any time determined to be vaccination-related.</detailed_description>
