	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if being treated with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv) 800/100 mg daily is as effective as being treated with DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily, in early antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced patients when given along with selected optimized background regimen (OBR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Compare Effectiveness and Safety of Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/Rtv) 800mg/100mg Once Daily Versus DRV/Rtv 600mg/100mg Twice Daily in Early Treatment-Experienced HIV-1 Infected Patients (ODIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study in which 590 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either DRV/rtv 800/100 mg daily or DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily along with the selected OBR. An OBR will consist of at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) selected by the investigator. The study will include a 4 week screening period, 48-weeks of treatment period and 4-weeks of follow-up. The study will also consists of extension phase after Week 48: in regions where DRV is not yet commercially available or reimbursed by the health care system, patients who complete the 48 weeks of treatment with DRV/rtv and who continue to benefit from this treatment, will have the opportunity to continue DRV treatment as a 600 mg twice daily dosage until DRV is reimbursed and available via the public and/or private health care system or until its development is discontinued. Safety evaluation will consists of adverse events (including specific toxicities), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, physical and skin examination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with documented human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV1) infection Patients with a viral load greater than 1,000 HIV1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL Stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen for at least 12 weeks at screening In the investigator's opinion, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are not a valid treatment option, because of the patient's antiretroviral (ARV) treatment history, ARV resistance testing, medicationtaking behavior, safety and tolerability concerns, or other patientrelated factors Prescreening or/and screening plasma HIV1 RNA greater than 1,000 copies/mL on HAART regimen at screening Presence of any currently active conditions that fit the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Stage 4, with the following exceptions: stable cutaneous kaposi's sarcoma (ie, no internal organ involvement other than oral lesions) that is unlikely to require any form of systemic therapy during the study time period, wasting syndrome Patients for whom an investigational ARV is part of the current regimen, with the following exceptions if applicable (depending on local regulatory approval): tenofovir, emtricitabine Previous or current use of enfuvirtide (ENF), tipranavir and/or DRV Life expectancy of less than 12 months Pregnant or breastfeeding females Any active clinically significant disease (eg, tuberculosis [TB], cardiac dysfunction, pancreatitis, acute viral infections) or findings during screening of medical history or physical examination that, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the patient's safety or outcome of the study</criteria>
