	<brief_summary>Tuberculous (TB) pleurisy can cause clinical symptoms and pleural fibrosis with resultant residual pleural thickening (RPT). Therapeutic thoracentesis or initial complete drainage in addition to anti-TB drugs have been tried to rapidly relieve dyspnea caused by effusion and to decrease the occurrence of RPT. However, contradictory results are reported without clear reasons. The researchers' hypothesis is that, in addition to anti-TB medications, early effective evacuation of inflammatory exudates with or without fibrinolytic agents may hasten resolution of pleural effusion, reduce the occurrence of RPT and finally improve long-term functional outcome in patients with TB pleurisy.</brief_summary>
