	<brief_title>How to Improve Diagnosis in Infective Endocarditis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite progress in surgical and medical treatment, infective endocarditis is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. The variable clinical presentation of IE makes the diagnosis a clinical challenge. Procalcitonin is a precursor from the hormone calcitonin and also a marker of systemic bacterial infections. The purpose of this study is: - to investigate the diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and sedimentation rate (SR) when IE is suspected. - to investigate if a retrospectively generated clinical model suitable for exclusion of IE can be confirmed prospectively.</detailed_description>
