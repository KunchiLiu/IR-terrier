	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be randomized into one of two groups. Group A will be administered insulin using the hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp to normalize blood glucose levels intra-operatively. Group B will be administered insulin at the standard of care levels established by the participating institution. Patients will be followed at 10 days, 15 days and one year post-operatively.</brief_summary>
