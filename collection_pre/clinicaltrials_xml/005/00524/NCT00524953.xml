	<brief_summary>The primary goal of thos study is to assess safety of Ultraviolet (UV) Phototherapy for the Prevention of Graft versus Host Disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Phase I - Clinical trial). Following allogeneic BMT, patients will be placed on standard GVHD preventive therapy (cyclosporine). Secondary goals - - monitoring immune system recovery - the influence of stem cells origin on therapy and/orGVHD prevention - the influence of UV-c treatment on survival clinical data and samples will be collected, during UV-c therapy, 100 days after discharge &amp; 6 months after discharge - to examine the long-term effect of UV-c treatment on the patient's GVHD status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment will be given with a portable, easy to operate device named "EUMATRON". this device contains a UV- lamp. 250 cc of blood from a peripheric vein is going through the device into a bottle with Low dose Heparin and returning to patient's body. procedure takes ~20 minutes.</detailed_description>
