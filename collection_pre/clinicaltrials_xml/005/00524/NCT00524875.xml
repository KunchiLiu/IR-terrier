	<brief_title>Effect of Intravitreal Bevacizumab on Early Post-Vitrectomy Hemorrhage in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in the age range of 20-64 years. Pars plana vitrectomy may be indicated for the management of advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Early post-vitrectomy hemorrhage in diabetic patients is relatively common; it occurs in 29% -75% of patients in the first month after surgery. This may cause delayed visual rehabilitation and detection of surgical complications such as retinal break or detachment. Preliminary reports such as case series reported by Spaide RF, et al showed beneficial effect of bevacizumab in proliferative diabetic retinopathy complicated by vitreous hemorrhage.</detailed_description>
