	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of rhIL-11 when given subcutaneously in adults with type 1 von Willebrand disease undergoing elective surgery or major dental procedure. Efficacy will be measured by estimated blood loss, and frequency and severity of bleeding and transfusion requirement during and after surgery. Safety will be measured by the frequency of adverse events, including fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, fluid retention, or edema.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, single-center Phase II trial of Neumega (rhIL-11) in adults with type 1 VWD undergoing elective surgery or major dental procedure. It is anticipated that 10 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will enroll and complete the study. The specific objectives are to determine the efficacy and safety or rhIL-11 during and after elective surgery, and to determine the mechanism of the hemostatic response of rhIL-11.</detailed_description>
