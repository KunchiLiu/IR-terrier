	<brief_summary>The objectives of this multinational study are to assess the clinical outcomes of patients with Acinetobacter bloodstream infection and to further assess the predictors of mortality in this patient population. We also aim to characterize the molecular epidemiology of this remarkable organism in an attempt to further understand its transmission dynamics on a global level and to determine whether increased pathogenicity is geographically dependent.</brief_summary>
