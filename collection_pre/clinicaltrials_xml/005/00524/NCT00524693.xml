	<brief_summary>There is evidence of inflammatory mechanisms in RSV bronchiolitis with increased cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LT). Recently, specific cys-LT receptor antagonists - montelukast (Singulair©) approved for use in infants as granule sachets, have become available. We evaluated the effect of Singulair© on clinical progress and on cytokine profiles in the acute phase of RSV bronchiolitis.</brief_summary>
