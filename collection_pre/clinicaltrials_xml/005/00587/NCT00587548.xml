	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find a different way to identify the ureters during an abdominal operation. During some operations, the operating physician must identify where the ureters are to prevent injury to them. Typically, the surgeon calls the urologist to thread a small scope with a camera into the urethra (where the urine comes out) to place a wire into each of the two ureters to locate them. Instead of this procedure, we will inject a small amount of a radioactive chemical dye (TC99-DTPA)through a vein in your arm. The ureters can then be detected by a hand held probe called the 'gamma probe.' The TC99-DTPA dye passes through the body and is excreted through the urine. The goal of this study is that this probe will alert the physician when it placed directly over the ureters since the TC99-DTPA dye will highlight the ureters as the flow of urine goes through them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Gamma Probe Localization of the Ureter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population includes those that are undergoing an elective, open, abdominal surgery. The patient will receive, on average, 4.5mCi of Technetium labeled diethylene-triamine-penta acetate (DTPA) prior to the time of ureteral localization. The Neoprobe 2000 gamma probe will be placed on the field in sterile fashion in a manner similar to that which is performed during a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy. The surgery will continue until the surgical team feels the time is appropriate for each ureter to be identified. At this point, the surgical team will use the gamma probe to localize the ureter and the attending physician will note either, "yes" or, "no" to their feeling is that they have correctly identified or did not identify each ureter. The surgical team will know that the ureter has been correctly identified when gentle manipulation of the tissue with forceps produces a "vermicular contraction" of the tubular structure suspected to be the ureter. No other tissue and/or structure produces this classic type of contraction. Background gamma counts, gamma counts over the ureter, and time between Tc-DTPA injection and ureteral localization will be recorded for each ureter sought. If the ureter cannot be localized with this technique, and the surgical team feels that it is imperative that the ureters be identified, then the attending surgeon may request a urologist to place stents in the standard, usual fashion.</detailed_description>
