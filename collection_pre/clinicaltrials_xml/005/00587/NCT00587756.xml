	<brief_summary>Two-stage hepatectomy with or without portal vein embolization allows to treat multiple bilobar metastases expanding surgical indications for these patients. However, it has some related drawbacks: two operations are needed, and some patients do not complete the treatment strategy for disease progression. Using experience gained from our ultrasound guided resection policy we explored the safety and effectiveness of one-stage surgical procedures in patients otherwise recommended for the two-stage approach.</brief_summary>
