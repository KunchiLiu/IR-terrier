	<brief_title>Cyrotherapy vs. APC in GAVE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Watermelon stomach (WS) is endoscopically recognized by characteristic stripes of angioectasias involving primarily the antrum, and causes transfusion-dependent anemia in the majority of patients. Current endoscopic treatment options, including argon plasma coagulation (APC) Endoscopic cryotherapy is a novel technique that has the potential to safely and more effectively treat WS by virtue of its mechanism of injury and mode of application.</detailed_description>
