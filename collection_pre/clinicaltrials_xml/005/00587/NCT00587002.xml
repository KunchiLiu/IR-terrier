	<brief_summary>The broad objective is to advance our understanding of both in vivo anatomical and functional changes that are present in the coronary arteries in women who have an acute coronary syndrome. Specific focus will be placed on the age of the women as there may be distinct differences in younger women (&lt; 50 years) given the marked increase in mortality in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differences in Epicardial Plaque and Microvascular Function in Women With an Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of the current study is that plaque erosion and microvascular dysfunction are key features responsible for the increased peri-MI mortality in young women. In order to test this hypothesis the following specific aims are proposed using a special intravascular ultrasound technique called virtual histology and microvascular function (effect of intracoronary adenosine on coronary blood flow) in patients coming to the cardiac catheterization laboratory with an acute MI: 1. To determine if plaque rupture or plaque erosion is more prevalent in young women (&lt;50 years) compared with older women (≥ 50 years) and men in the development of an acute MI 2. To determine if inflammatory mediators of plaque rupture are higher in older women and men with an acute MI compared with younger women 3. To determine if microvascular function is abnormal in young women undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization with an acute MI compared to older women and men 4. To determine if alterations exist in the number and function of EPCs in young women (&lt;50 years) compared with older women (≥ 50 years) and men who have had an acute MI and to determine the association with microvascular function</detailed_description>
