	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of BCell Leukemia (CLL, PLL, or SLL) Measurable Disease Disease characteristics: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (SLL) are eligible if they have failed 2 or more prior courses of standard chemo and/or biologic therapy (e.g. Rituxan)_ and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) will be eligible if they have failed at least one prior standard chemotherapeutic regimen. Medical indications for treatment include progressive diseaserelated symptoms, progressive cytopenias due to marrow involvement, progressive or painful splenomegaly or adenopathy, rapidly increasing lymphocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia and increased frequency of infections. ECOG performance status of 02 Patients with other cancers who meet eligibility criteria and have had less than 5 yrs. of diseasefree survival will be considered on a casebycase basis Life expectancy of greater than 6 mos., as assessed by the principal investigator Must be able to understand and sign the informed consent Must be at least 18 years old Female and Male patients agree to use an approved method of contraception during the study History of allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Documented and ongoing central nervous system involvement with their malignant disease (history of CNS involvement is not an exclusion criterion.) Pregnant or breastfeeding females Patients who plasma contains either a significant level of antibody to CAT8015 as measured by ELISA, or antibody that neutralizes the binding of CAT8015 to CD22 as measured by a competition ELISA. HIV positive serology (due to increased risk of severe infection and unknown interaction of CAT8015 with antiretroviral drugs) Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness including but not limited to: infections requiring systemic antibiotics, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Hepatic function:Serum transaminases (either ALT or AST) or direct bilirubin greater than or equal to Grade 2, unless bilirubin is due to Gilbert's disease Renal function: Serum creatinine clearance is less than or equal to 60 mL/min as estimated by CockcroftGault formula Hematologic function: The ANC less than 1000/cmm, or platelet count less than 50,000/cmm, if these cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to underlying disease (i.e., potentially reversible with antineoplastic therapy). A patient will not be excluded because of pancytopenia greater than or equal to Grade 3, or erythropoietin dependence, if it is due to disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies. Baseline coagulopathy greater than or equal to grade 3 unless due to anticoagulant therapy Pulmonary function: Patients with less than 50% of predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or less than 50% of predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) corrected for hemoglobin concentration and alveolar volume. Note: Patients with no prior history of pulmonary illness are not required to have PFTs. FEV1 will be assessed after bronchodilator therapy. Recent prior therapy: Cytotoxic chemotherapy, corticosteroids (except stable doses of prednisone), whole body electron beam radiation therapy, hormonal, biologic or other standard or any investigational therapy of the malignancy for 3 three wks. prior to entry into the trial. Less than or equal to 1 mos. prior monoclonal antibody therapy (i.e. rituximab) Patients who are receiving or have received radiation therapy less than 3 weeks prior to study entry will not be excluded providing the volume of the bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the patient has measureable disease outside the radiation port.
