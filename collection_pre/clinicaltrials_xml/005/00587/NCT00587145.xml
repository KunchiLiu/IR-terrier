	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, single center, and a single arm phase II study to evaluate the clinical response and safety of perioperative S-1 plus docetaxel. Perioperative chemotherapy is composed of 3 cycles of preoperative S-1/docetaxel and 3 cycles of postoperative S-1/docetaxel.Chemotherapy regimen: - S-1 80 mg/m2/day every 12-h p.o. on days 1(evening)-15 (morning) - Docetaxel 35 mg/m2 mixed in d5w 250 ml iv over 60-min on days 1 and 8</brief_summary>
