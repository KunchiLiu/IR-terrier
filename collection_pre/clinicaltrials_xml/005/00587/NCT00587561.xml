	<brief_summary>The term social cognition refers to how social information is processed. Individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder have been shown to have significant deficits in social cognition. Moreover, it has been speculated that these deficits may in turn have a negative impact on their overall functioning. Behavioral interventions targeting social cognition are just beginning to emerge, and there is a need to evaluate their efficacy. Objectives: This is a small trial evaluating the efficacy of social cognition interaction training (SCIT) an experimental behavioral treatment for improving social cognition in schizophrenia. Research Design and Methodology: Approximately 48 participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will be randomized into one of two conditions: 1) a 20 to 24 session manualized social cognition interaction training group (SCIT), or 2) wait-list control. Pre-and post-group therapy assessments of symptoms, social cognition, basic cognition, and community function will be conducted. Data obtained from this study will allow us to determine the efficacy of SCIT training in improving symptom, cognitive, and functional measures.</brief_summary>
