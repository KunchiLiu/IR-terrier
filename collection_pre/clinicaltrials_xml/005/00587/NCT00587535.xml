	<brief_title>Evaluation of a New MR Pulse Sequence to Quantify Liver Iron Concentration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quantification of liver iron requires liver biopsy and histological assessment. New rapid MR techniques allow determination of liver relaxation times that can be altered with increasing iron deposition. The purpose of this study is to compare the results obtained with MRI to liver biopsy and iron quantification in patients undergoing liver biopsy in the setting of hemochromatosis.</detailed_description>
