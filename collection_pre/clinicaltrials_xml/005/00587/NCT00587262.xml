	<brief_summary>Insertion of electrode array in scala vestibuli, rather than the preferred location within scala tympani, leads to loss of native hearing in those patients with isolated high-frequency hearing loss undergoing cochlear implantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scalar Localization Cochlear Electrode Array Using 64 Slice CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim to determine the surgical placement in patients with high frequency who had long electrode array insertions because they did not meet audiometric criteria for short array devices. From this basis we will be able to determine if suboptimal insertion (e.g., in the scala vestibuli) leads to loss of low-frequency hearing in these patients. We also will look at the possibilities of using this data in predicting outcomes, modifying implant design, and perfecting surgical technique.</detailed_description>
