	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study of T Cell Vaccine in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principle of TCV is similar to that of traditional microbial vaccination where attenuated infectious agents are used to stimulate protective immune responses. Because pathogentic autoreactive T cells are viewed as pathogens in T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, they can be used, as a vaccine to prevent and treat the diseases in which they are able to induce.</detailed_description>
