	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Reslizumab to Treat Poorly Controlled Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Primary: To demonstrate the ability of reslizumab to improve asthma control in subjects with active asthma and eosinophilic airway inflammation. Secondary: - To study the ability of reslizumab to reduce induced sputum eosinophil (EOS) counts in subjects with asthma. - To study the ability of reslizumab to reduce the number of eosinophilic clinical asthma exacerbations (CAE) in subjects with asthma. A CAE is defined as a ≥ 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; absolute value) from the baseline value or a requirement for emergency treatment of asthma, hospital admission for asthma or treatment with three or more days of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for asthma worsening. - To assess the safety and tolerability of reslizumab in subjects with asthma.</detailed_description>
