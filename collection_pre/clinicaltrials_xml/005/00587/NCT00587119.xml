	<brief_title>Oral Budesonide in the Treatment of Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and Overlap Features of Autoimmune Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pilot Study of Budesonide for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with overlap features of Autoimmune Hepatitis Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease of unknown cause that may result in inflammation and destruction of the bile ducts inside the liver. Over time, cirrhosis and complications of liver failure may develop. Although treatment with ursodiol has been association with a reduction in liver enzymes (blood tests) and a reduction in the progression of the disease, some patients do not respond to ursodiol therapy. Patients with overlap features of Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) appear to be at higher risk of developing complications of disease even when on ursodiol. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and safety of Budesonide in PBC with overlap features of AIH. Budesonide has unique effects on the immune system that may be helpful in the treatment of the disease. Eligible participants will include those patients with a diagnosis of PBC with overlap features of AIH and in whom liver enzymes have not sufficiently improved with ursodiol therapy (the alkaline phosphatase is not less than twice upper normal). At entry all patients will have a history and physical examination, blood tests, bone densitometry and complete quality of life questionnaires. Patients will be prescribed Budesonide 9 mg to take daily for one year in addition to the ursodiol. The medication can be taken with or without food. Blood tests and symptoms diaries will be completed every 3 months. Patients will be contacted by phone to assess tolerance of the medication and any new health problems. At one year, patients will return for a history and physical and repeat blood tests and bone densitometry. Possible side-effects include bone mass loss (bone thinning), diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, joint pains, dizziness, headaches, weight gain and Cushing's syndrome. Other side-effects are possible. The medication and the tests will be billed to the patient or patient's insurance.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic cholestatic liver disease for greater than 6 months with alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal. Positive AMA titer 1:40 or AMA &gt; 1.0 U. Liver histology in the past (available for review) with features consistent with or diagnostic of PBC Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or cholangiography of the biliary tree which excludes biliary obstruction. The diagnosis of AIH necessary for evaluation of PBCAIH overlap syndrome will be based on the revised International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAHG) Scoring System. Patients with other serious coexistent conditions such as preexisting advanced malignancy or severe cardiopulmonary disease which would be expected to limit their expectancy to less than three years. Patients unable to provide informed consent. Treatment with methotrexate, corticosteroids, azathioprine, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, penicillamine, colchicine or chenodeoxycholic acid in the preceding three months. Anticipated need for transplantation in one year (Mayo survival model &lt;80% oneyear survival without transplant). Liver biopsy revealing stage IV disease. Evidence of portal hypertension such as esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. Known history of portal vein thrombosis. Evidence of osteoporosis. Serum bilirubin &gt;4 mg/dl. Age less than 21 years of age or greater than 75 years of age. Pregnancy. Breastfeeding. Active drug or alcohol use. Findings highly suggestive of liver disease of other etiology such as chronic alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, 1antitrypsin deficiency, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or sclerosing cholangitis. Serum creatinine over 2.0 mg/dl. History of documented active peptic ulcer disease in preceding year.</criteria>
