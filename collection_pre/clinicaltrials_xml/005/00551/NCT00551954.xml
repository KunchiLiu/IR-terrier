	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction (ED) has been suggested as a possible causal link between postprandial hyperglycemia and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recent trials demonstrated a reduction of cardiovascular events by treatment with the alpha glucosidase inhibitor acarbose - a drug which mainly reduces postprandial glucose excursions. We were interested whether patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes showed postprandial ED and if so whether acarbose was able to improve this condition.</brief_summary>
