	<brief_summary>In the treatment of glaucoma, trabeculectomy surgery provides a drainage system for the eye and allows for the lowering of the pressure inside the eye. The flow through the surgically created fistula determines the intraocular pressure. Titrating suture tightness is important to achieving the desired post-operative intraocular pressure. This process is not straightforward and intraocular pressures are often too high or too low post-operatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of an Anterior Chamber Infusion System on Trabeculectomy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of an anterior chamber infusion system to deliver fluid into the eye during trabeculectomy surgery may be of benefit in this process and may have other benefits as well which may result in better outcomes. Thus, the hypothesis of this study is that the use of an anterior chamber infusion system improves success of trabeculectomy surgery.</detailed_description>
