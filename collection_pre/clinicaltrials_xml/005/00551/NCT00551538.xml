	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if twice-daily Lispro low mixture (75/25) will result in lower post prandial blood glucose readings versus once-daily glargine plus oral diabetic medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>24 Hour Plasma Glucose Profiles Comparing Lispro Mix 75/25 vs. Glargine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a twice daily insulin regimen consisting of insulin lispro (mix 75/25)plus OAMs will result in a lower 2 hour postprandial plasma glucose, averaged across the morning and evening meals, compared with once daily insulin glargine plus OAMs at bedtime following 12 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have type 2 diabetes Have inadequate overall glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 7.0% and less than or equal to 12.0%) at or within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 Have used: single or multiple OAMs for at least 3 months immediately prior to entering the study, including metformin, sulfonylurea, meglitinides (repaglinide, nateglinide), or alpha glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol); or insulin (once or twice daily) for at least 3 months immediately prior to entering the study; or a combination of the above. Are greater than or equal to 21 and less than 80 years of age As determined by the investigator, are capable and willing to: comply with their prescribed diet and medication regimen, perform self blood glucose monitoring, use the patient diary as required for this protocol, participate in two 24 hour inpatient assessments Have used a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) during the 3 months prior to entry into the study Are currently treated with a meglitinide without sulfonylurea Have a known allergy or intolerance to insulin lispro mix 75/25, insulin glargine, or metformin Have plasma creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (for males) or greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL (for females) for patients who will be treated with metformin or; greater than 2 mg/dL for patients treated with other OAMs, as determined by a local laboratory Have received chronic (lasting longer than 2 weeks), systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical and inhaled preparations) within 4 weeks immediately prior to Visit 1</criteria>
