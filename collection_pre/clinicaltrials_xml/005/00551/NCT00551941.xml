	<brief_summary>The researchers propose a prospective, randomised partially-blinded study to investigate the clinical and radiological outcome, effect on quality of life and socio-economic impact of non-union of diaphysary tibial fractures treated with BMP-7 in adjunct to fresh frozen allograft, in comparison to treatment with allograft together with DBM (demineralised bone matrix).</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Tibial Fractures</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Diaphysary tibial nonunions will be included (9 months after first surgery) Major surgery includes exchange nailing, bone grafting, internal fixation, amputation and softtissue coverage procedures, such as delayed primary closure and free flaps Surgery is classified as minor for removal of external fixator pins for local infection and removal of a static locking screw from intramedullary nails, a procedure known as dynamization ASA 1 and ASA 2 Gap length/bone contact detected (15 cm): largest cortical gap in any radiographic incidence Subject or legal guardian is willing and able to understand, sign and date the study specific Patient Informed Consent, which has been approved by the Institutional Review Board Agrees to participate in postoperative evaluations and required rehabilitation regimen Patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or collagen Gap more than 5 cm Immature skeleton Known autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis/polymyositis Active infection on unhealed site or active systemic infection Nonhealing resulting from pathological fractures, tumours or metabolic bone diseases Presence of tumour in vicinity of nonunion Patients receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunosuppressant treatment or excessive steroids Patients with severely compromised soft tissue coverage or vascularisation at the nonunion site, sufficient to impair bone healing Patients with congenital nonunion Pregnancy and lactation Nonunion of multiple bones interfering with walking Patients with neuromuscular diseases or conditions interfering normal weight bearing Patients who, judged by the surgeon, are candidates for just internal fixation alone</criteria>
