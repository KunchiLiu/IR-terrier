	<brief_summary>CRx-102 is a synergistic combination drug candidate containing the cardiovascular drug dipyridamole and a very low dose of the glucocorticoid prednisolone. CRx-102 is believed to work through a novel mechanism of action in which dipyridamole selectively amplifies the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of the glucocorticoid without replicating the dose-dependent adverse effects. CRx-102 has been associated with clinical benefit in proof of concept studies in subjects with hand Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). In this trial, CRx-102 will be given to subjects with active RA as an add-on therapy to existing stable doses of Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide or azathioprine. MTX in combination with other DMARDs (e.g., sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine) will be permitted to reflect the current standard of care practices within rheumatology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study to Evaluate CRx-102 vs. Each of Its Components to Treat Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was discontinued before the enrollment objective was met. Preliminary review of the efficacy dataset revealed that the efficacy dataset was not robust enough to support an extensive formal efficacy analysis as described in the SAP. Therefore, only the CRP values over time and the percent change in C-reactive protein (CRP) values in the As-Treated population were calculated.</detailed_description>
