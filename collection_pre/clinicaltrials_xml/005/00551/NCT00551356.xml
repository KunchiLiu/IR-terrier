	<brief_summary>In patients with type 2 diabetes who have not been on insulin therapy before the study will achieve better glycemic control by the treatment regiment consisting of two times daily insulin lispro mix 25 than by the treatment regiment with consisting of one time daily injection of insulin glargine. Improved glycemic control will be compared by the fasting plasma glucose and blood glucose excursions 2 hours after breakfast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lispro Mix 25 vs. Glargine in Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to investigate which type of insulin regimen is the best way to achieve best glycemic control in early type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 with a duration of diabetes between 1 and 10 years without previous insulin therapy will be randomized on insulin lispro mix 25 or insulin glargine therapy. Glycemic control will be compared by the between treatment difference in fasting plasma glucose and 2h postprandial blood glucose excursions (preprandial -postprandial excursions) after breakfast.</detailed_description>
