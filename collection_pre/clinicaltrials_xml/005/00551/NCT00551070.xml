	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well selumetinib works in treating patients with recurrent low-grade ovarian cancer. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib in Treating Woman With Recurrent Low-Grade Ovarian Cancer or Peritoneum Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the tumor response rate of patients on AZD6244 (selumetinib) (NSC #748727). II. To examine the acute toxicity of AZD6244 (NSC #748727) during the first course of treatment using CTCAE version 3.0. III. To define the pharmacokinetic profile for AZD6244, 100 mg administered orally twice daily. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the toxicity of AZD6244 (NSC #748727) using the 21 major categories of the CTCAE version 3.0. II. To examine the dose and number of courses of AZD6244 (NSC #748727) given. III. To estimate the progression free survival, and overall survival of women receiving AZD6244 (NSC #748727). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine DNA isolation with sequencing of braf, and ras mutation analysis and to explore their relationship with tumor response with AZD6244 (NSC #748727). II. To examine protein levels of p-ERK/ERKERK and explore their relationship with tumor response in patients treated with AZD6244 (NSC #748727). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice a day on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative and pharmacokinetic studies and to analyze selumetinib peak concentrations and the corresponding peak time values. Previously collected archived tumor tissue samples are obtained to determine protein levels of p-ERK/ERKERK, DNA isolation and sequencing of BRAF and ras mutation analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then once a year for 5 years.</detailed_description>
