	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue near the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether treatment with radiotherapy involving a high biological dose with limited treatment volume (using stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] techniques) achieves acceptable primary tumor control (i.e., ≥ 90% at 2 years) in patients with resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - Determine whether treatment with radiotherapy involving a high biological dose with limited treatment volume (using SBRT techniques) achieves acceptable treatment-related toxicity. - Estimate the disease-free survival and the overall survival rate at 2 years. - Observe patterns of failure in the first 2 years. - Assess the level of comorbidity burden on morbidity and efficacy. - Determine if blood markers prior to, during the course of treatment (between the second and the last dose of SBRT), and at the first follow-up after SBRT predict 2-year primary tumor control and predict for grade ≥ 2 treatment-related toxicities OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy over 14 days. Patients with disease progression undergo surgical resection as salvage local therapy. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer, including any of the following primary tumor types: Squamous cell carcinoma Adenocarcinoma Large cell carcinoma Large cell neuroendocrine tumor Nonsmall cell carcinoma not otherwise specified No pure type bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma Stage I or II disease based on 1 of the following combinations of primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM) staging: T1, N0, M0 T2 (≤ 5 cm), N0, M0 T3 (≤ 5 cm), N0, M0 (chest wall primary tumors only) No T2 or T3 primary tumors &gt; 5 cm or T3 primary tumors involving the central chest and structures of the mediastinum No primary tumor of any Tstage within or touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree, defined as a volume of 2 cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree (carina, right and left main bronchi, right and left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius bronchus, right middle lobe bronchus, lingular bronchus, or right and left lower lobe bronchi) Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes ≤ 1 cm AND no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scan will be considered N0 Patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT scan OR abnormal PET scan (including suspicious but nondiagnostic uptake) will still be eligible if directed tissue biopsies of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer No direct evidence of regional or distant metastases after appropriate staging studies Considered a reasonable candidate for surgical resection of the primary tumor, according to the following criteria: Primary tumor predicted to be technically resectable with a high likelihood of negative surgical margins (as determined by a qualified thoracic surgeon) Baseline forced expiratory volume (FEV)_1 &gt; 35% predicted Postoperative predicted FEV_1 &gt; 30% predicted Diffusion capacity &gt; 35% predicted No hypoxemia (e.g., partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of ≤ 60 mm Hg) and/or hypercapnia (e.g., partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) &gt; 50 mm Hg) at baseline No severe pulmonary hypertension No severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease No severe chronic heart disease Pleural effusion, if present, must be deemed too small to tap under CT scan guidance and must not be evident on chest xray Pleural effusion that appears on chest xray will be allowed only after thoracotomy or other invasive procedure PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Zubrod performance status 01 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,800/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (transfusion allowed) Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception No synchronous primary or other invasive malignancy within the past 3 years other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ cancer No active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection No weight loss &gt; 5% for any reason within the past 3 months PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior radiotherapy for lung cancer Prior radiotherapy as part of treatment for head and neck cancer, breast cancer, or other nonlung cancer is allowed provided there will not be significant overlap with the stereotactic body radiotherapy fields No prior chemotherapy or surgical resection for this lung cancer No other concurrent local or regional antineoplastic therapy (including standard fractionated radiotherapy, nonapproved systemic therapy, and surgery), except at disease progression</criteria>
