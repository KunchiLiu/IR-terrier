	<brief_title>Validation Study Using the GeneSearch BLN Assay to Test Sentinel Lymph Nodes From Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the GeneSearchâ„¢ BLN Assay in patient samples by comparing its performance to that of the current methods -- permanent section Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining with IHC. Additional marker testing using probes associated with nodal metastases may be used in the assay performance calculations. The observed performance measures will be compared to those obtained in the larger U.S. registration trial to show that there are no differences in the assay's performance.</detailed_description>
