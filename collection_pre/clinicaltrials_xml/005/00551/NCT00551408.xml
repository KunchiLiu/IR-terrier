	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction ultimately represents an imbalance between the magnitude of injury and the capacity for repair. Current evidence established that endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) participate in several models of vascular disease as acute coronary syndromes, stroke, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, etc. However EPC in the setting of PAH is less well established. The target of this study is to demonstrate if the number of EPC is increased in a mexican population of patients with PAH.</brief_summary>
