	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 4 different formulations of the HR5I vaccine (Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, diphtheria, tetanus, 5-component acellular pertussis, and inactivated poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3). The primary hypothesis is that at least 1 of the 4 formulations of HR5I administered as a primary series at 2, 3, and 4 months of age will be acceptable (similar to targeted rates) with respect to Postdose 3 antibody responses to all antigens.</brief_summary>
