	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of the HR5I vaccine (Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, diphtheria, tetanus, 5-component acellular pertussis, and inactivated poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3). The primary hypothesis is that at least 1 of the 3 formulations of HR5I administered as a primary series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age will be acceptable (similar to targeted rates) with respect to Postdose 3 antibody responses to all antigens.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomized into 4 arms: AR51 (12, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 12 mcg of polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) conjugated to tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) and 10 mcg of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) PR51 (3, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 3 mcg of polyribosylribitol phosphate conjugated to the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitides (PRP-OMPC) and 10 mcg of HBsAg PR51 (6, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 6 mcg of PRP-OMPC and 10 mcg of HBsAg PENTACEL™ + RECOMBIVAX HB™: open-label control group receiving PENTACEL™ (licensed vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and invasive disease due to Haemophilus influenzae type b) and RECOMBIVAX HB™ (licensed vaccine for hepatitis)</detailed_description>
