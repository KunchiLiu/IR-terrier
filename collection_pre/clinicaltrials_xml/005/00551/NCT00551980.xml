	<brief_title>The Efficacy of a Cognitive and Physical Intervention to Reduce Head and Muscle Pain in a Working Community</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many studies were performed to assess the efficacy of non invasive physical interventions in the treatment of different types of headache and cervical pain. However the evidence on their effectiveness is still limited and the results of recent studies are conflicting. In a previous non-randomized-controlled study in which the cognitive and physical programme was applied to a consistent number of office workers, a significant reduction of frequency of pain in the head and neck areas and of analgesic drug consumption was obtained. The present study was designed to confirm the data in a much more extensive working population and applying a randomised design. The primary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of a workplace cognitive and physical programme (Intervention), in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head and neck area in a large working community using a randomized design.The Intervention consists of brief shoulder and neck exercises to be performed several times a day, a relaxation exercise and instructions of how to reduce parafunction and hyperfunction of the craniofacial and cervical muscles during the day. Secondary objectives: To confirm the effectiveness of the Intervention, in reducing the intensity of pain involving the head and neck area in a large working community using a randomized design. To confirm the reduction in analgesic drugs consumption after the Intervention in a large working community using a randomized design. To evaluate the persistence of the effectiveness of the Intervention after 12 months in a large working community using a randomized design. Comparison(s): Group of employees that will receive a cognitive/physical programme (Intervention), compared to a similar group of employees that will not receive the Intervention (Controls); (frequency of headache and neck and shoulder pain).</detailed_description>
