	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Versus Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy for Vaginal Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LscASC) has been demonstrated to yield comparable success rates to abdominal sacrocolpopexy (93-99%) for the surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse, it has not been widely adopted due to the increased operating time and steep learning curves associated with laparoscopic suturing and knot-tying. For these reasons, robotic systems have been advocated for this technique. The objective of this study is to conduct a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial of robotic assisted versus traditional LscASC in the treatment of patients with apical vaginal prolapse stages II-IV (prolapse from 1 cm proximal to the hymen to all points distal). This is a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Robotic assisted LscASC will be performed using the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in a similar manner as that described above for conventional laparoscopy. Data points recorded during the procedure will include: operating room time of entry and exit, time from incision to closure and time taken for the suturing aspect of the case. From this information, the operating room costs and anesthesia costs, i.e., the amount that a provider must pay for goods or services, will be calculated. Estimated blood loss, perioperative and post-operative complications, and number of days in the hospital will be studied as will cost-effectiveness and impact on HRQOL</detailed_description>
