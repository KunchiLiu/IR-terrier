	<criteria>Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Patient is 65 years old or younger at the time of signing the informed consent Female patient is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable double method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βHCG) pregnancy test both 24 hours prior to beginning of therapy and then at 4 weeks intervals in women with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles during study treatment for subjects of childbearing potential Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or abstinence) during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy. Patient was diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on standard criteria (9), and has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, greater than 1 g/dL of IgG MProtein and greater than 0.5 g/dL of IgA MProtein) and, where applicable, urine lightchain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours; measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CTScan); bone marrow plasma cells&gt;10%. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%. Patient has a lifeexpectancy &gt; 6 months Patient has not active infectious hepatitis type B or C, and has HIV negative test Patients must have an ejection fraction by ECHO or MUGA &gt; 50% performed within 60 days prior to registration Patients must have adequate pulmonary function studies &gt; 50% of predicted on mechanical aspects (FEV1, FVC, etc) and diffusion capacity (DLCO) &gt; 50% of predicted. Patients unable to complete pulmonary function tests because of myelomarelated chest pain, must have a high resolution CT scan of the chest and must also have acceptable arterial blood gases defined as P02 greater than 70. Patient has the following laboratory values within 14 days before Baseline (day 1 of the Cycle 1): Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L without transfusion support within 7 days before the test. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L without the use of growth factors. Corrected serum calcium ≤ 14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L). Aspartate transaminase (AST): ≤ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alanine transaminase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 x the ULN. Total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x the ULN. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance: ≥ 30 mL/minute Patient has a baseline bone marrow sample available for cytogenetics, that will be processed and eventually centralized within each country. Previous treatment with antimyeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid; &lt; to the equivalent of dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days). Any serious medical condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at an unacceptable risk if he or she participates in this study or confounds the experimental ability to interpret data from the study. Pregnant or lactating females. Prior history of malignancies, other than multiple myeloma, unless the subject has been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years. Exceptions include the following: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin, Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, Carcinoma in situ of the cervix, Carcinoma in situ of the breast, Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b) Neuropathy of ≥ grade 2 severity. Patients previously diagnosed as bearing deep venous thrombosis or arterial thromboembolic event within the latest 12 months, or bearing a clear indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or bearing a high risk of bleeding complications are ineligible for the substudy protocol.</criteria>
