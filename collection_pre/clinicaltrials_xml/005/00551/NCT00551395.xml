	<brief_title>Timing of Treatment Completion in Staged Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT): Early vs. Late Completion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SLT therapy is used as an IOP lowering agent in patients with glaucoma. It is unknown whether the timing of a 2-staged approach to the laser therapy will result in better IOP lowering effect. This study will evaluate the timing (early vs. late completion of SLT therapy) and determined the IOP lowering effect following the interventions. Arm 1: Early Completion SLT 180 degrees of SLT on Day 1, 180 degrees of SLT on the other 180 degrees on Day 2 Arm 2: Late Completion SLT 180 degrees of SLT on Day 1, 180 degrees of SLT on the other 180 degrees at the 1 month follow up visit. Primary Outcome: IOP (mmHg).</detailed_description>
