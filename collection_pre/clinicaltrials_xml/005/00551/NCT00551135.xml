The subject will be available for a visit within 72 hours of the day of surgery if not admitted the night before for baseline assessments before taking any study medication, and then to receive study medication prior to the day before surgery. The subject is expected and agrees to remain at the hospital (or intermediate care facility) for a minimum of 3 hours following surgery. Subjects with non elective or emergency surgery (must have the surgery no matter what), or hernia with incarceration (the trapping of abdominal contents within the hernia itself).
