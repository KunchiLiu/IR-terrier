	<brief_summary>The study is designed to define the underlying vascular abnormalities present in patients with diastolic heart failure and test the effect of a therapy aimed at vascular abnormalities. This study is designed to investigate the effects of therapy with atorvastatin in subjects with diastolic heart failure to improve abnormalities of vascular and myocardial structure and function, with particular emphasis on arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Forty subjects will be given either drug (atorvastatin 40 mg) or placebo in a randomized fashion once daily for six months. Using echocardiography, tonometry, and flow mediated dilation of conduit arteries and arterioles, baseline cardiovascular anatomy and physiology will be defined. Subjects that enroll in the study will be required to come in for 5 study visits. The initial visit is a screening visit; subject consent is obtained and an echocardiogram is performed as well as blood tests. At the randomization visit (4-14 days following screening), the subject will be provided with drug or placebo in a blinded fashion.Also at this visit, subjects will be asked to do a 6 minute walk, QOL questionnaire, and vascular function testing. There will be follow-up study visits at 1 and 3 months following randomization. At each follow-up visit a medical history, pill count and brief physical examination will be performed, a repeat QOL questionnaire administered, and blood tests to assess safety of the statin therapy. At 6 months, the final study visit will occur. At this visit a full history and detailed physical examination will be performed. Repeat echocardiogram, 6 minute walk test, QOL questionnaire, and vascular function examinations will be performed.</detailed_description>
