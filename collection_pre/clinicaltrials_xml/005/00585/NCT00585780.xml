	<brief_summary>To test the preliminary efficacy of 16.0 mg of Prazosin daily versus placebo in treatment seeking alcohol dependent individuals. This proposal is a laboratory and treatment outcome study to examine the effects of Prazosin on brief exposure to stress, drug cues and neutral situations on alcohol and drug craving, mood and neurobiological reactivity in a sample of cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individuals. Prazosin will be beneficial for reduction in stress and drug cue induced craving and related arousal. In a sample of 120 alcohol dependent men and women, we propose to examine (a) differences in measures of cocaine craving, emotion state, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation, physiological arousal and plasma catecholamine response to stress imagery and to drug cue imagery as compared to neutral imagery; (b) reduction in alcohol abstinence symptoms; and (c) improvement in alcohol treatment outcomes as measured by increasing abstinence, reduction in alcohol use, increased treatment attendance and decreased relapse risk.</brief_summary>
