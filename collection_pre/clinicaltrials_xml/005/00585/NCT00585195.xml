	<brief_summary>PF-02341066 may work in cancer by blocking the cell growth, migration and invasion of tumor cells. PF-02341066 is a new class of drugs called c-Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This compound is also an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (called ALK) tyrosine kinase and ROS receptor tyrosine kinases. This research study is the first time PF-02341066 will be given to people. PF-02341066 is taken by mouth daily.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced malignancies (except leukemias), histologically proven at diagnosis; Histologically confirmed advanced malignancies that are known to be sensitive to PF03241066 inhibition, e.g. ALK, cMET and ROS Solid tumors must have measurable disease (Recommended Phase 2 Dose Cohort patients with nonmeasurable disease may enter on a casebycase basis); not required for DDI substudies. Adequate blood cell counts, kidney function, liver function and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1 (for the Recommended Phase 2 Cohort, a ECOG score of 2 may be allowed on a casebycase basis) Major surgery, radiation therapy or anticancer therapy within 2 to 4 weeks of starting study treatment, depending on the patient cohort Prior stem cell transplant except of patients with neuroblastoma, lymphoma or myeloma Active or unstable cardiac disease or heart attack within 3 months of starting study treatment</criteria>
