	<brief_summary>The Wisconsin Brain Donor Program (WBDP) stores brain and other tissues/samples (e.g. blood and CSF) from deceased individuals who have participated in longitudinal research studies, as well as other select participants. These individuals have donated their tissues in order to aid scientific research. Through the collection of central and peripheral nervous tissues as well as (in select cases) skeletal muscle tissue, the WBDP strives to advance the knowledge of diseases of memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Brain donations are needed from healthy individuals, as well as those affected by diseases of the nervous system.</brief_summary>
