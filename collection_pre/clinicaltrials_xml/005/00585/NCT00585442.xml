	<brief_summary>The cardiovascular effects of vitamin D therapy (in humans) have been documented only in patients with known vitamin D deficiency or hyperparathyroidism (a surrogate marker of inadequate vitamin D activity). It is unknown whether the cardiovascular benefits of vitamin D therapy extend beyond these patients to the general hypertensive population. We propose to directly measure the effect of vitamin D therapy on plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC), renin transcription (in mononuclear leukocytes), and blood pressure in hypertensive (but otherwise healthy) patients in a randomized, controlled, experimental trial. This will be the first study to assess vitamin D receptor (VDR) biological (PRA, PRC, renin mRNA, and polymorphisms) and hypertensive activity in patients without vitamin D deficiency. We hypothesize that vitamin D inhibition of renin transcription will produce significant reductions in PRA, PRC, renin transcription, inflammatory cytokines, SBP, and DBP, with potential variation by VDR genotype. Such a result may prove to be significant in the treatment of hypertension, as even modest blood pressure reductions (5 mmHg) are associated with a 14% reduction in mortality due to stroke, a 9% reduction in mortality due to CHD, and a 7% overall reduction in all-cause mortality.</brief_summary>
