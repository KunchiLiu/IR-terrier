	<brief_summary>A non-invasive urinary test that detects kidney injuries in liver transplant (LT) candidates would be useful for monitoring of kidney damage. Particularly, the ability to predict irreversibility of such renal damage or progressive nature of renal disease in LT candidates would be of importance to determine the need for dual kidney-liver transplantation (KLT) versus LT alone. We will correlate kidney histology with cytokine/chemokine profile expression in the urine as a potentially useful noninvasive diagnostic tool.</brief_summary>
