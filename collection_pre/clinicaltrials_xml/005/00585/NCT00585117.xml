	<brief_summary>Hypoxia is a key factor in malignant progression of a neoplasm. It is our aim to explore the basis for quantitative in vivo tumor imaging by Cu-61 diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)PET imaging as a surrogate of tissue hypoxia. We hypothesize that the hypoxia levels are predictive of the tumor response to therapy. Patients will have 2 CU-ATSM PET scans done and the goal is to show spatially stable tracer distributions that correlate with tumor hypoxia. This study will serve as a pilot study for a PO1 submission</brief_summary>
