	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that mechanical efficiency as measured by pressure-volume loop assessment should improve during short-term treatment with intravenous levosimendan. Levosimendan (SimdaxTM, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) is a calcium sensitizer which has been shown to have beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). Levosimendan is a new calcium sensitizer that binds to troponin C. This agent is approved in Europe for treatment of heart failure patients. In the United States, this agent is currently under phase III investigation for intravenous treatment of patients with acutely decompensated HF who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. Levosimendan has been studied in these patients with acute HF and is considered experimental in the United States for this population.</brief_summary>
