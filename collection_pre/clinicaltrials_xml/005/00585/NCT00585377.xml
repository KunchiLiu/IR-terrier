	<brief_title>Bevacizumab (Avastin®) + Erlotinib as First-line Therapy for Stage IIIB/IV or Recurrent, Non-squamous Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of Bevacizumab and Erlotinib show encouraging activity for patients with previously treated, non-small-cell lung cancer. In a phase I/II study of erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with nonsquamous stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with one or more prior chemotherapy exposures, a recommended phase II dose was established at erlotinib 150 mg/day orally plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days (13) Forty patients were treated at the recommended Phase II dose. The median age was 59 years (range, 36 to 72 years), 21 were female, 30 had adenocarcinoma histology, nine were never-smokers, and 22 had &gt; or = two prior regimens (three patients had &gt; or = four prior regimens). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate rash, diarrhea, and proteinuria. No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified. Eight patients (20.0%; 95% CI, 7.6% to 32.4%) had partial responses and 26 (65.0%; 95% CI, 50.2% to 79.8%) had stable disease as their best response. The median overall survival for the 34 patients treated at the phase II dose was 12.6 months, with progression-free survival of 6.2 months. These data compare favorably with conventional chemotherapy in the salvage setting for NCSLC where the response rates are &lt; 10% and median survivals are 6-8 months (14-16). In an attempt to improve the therapeutic index for initial therapy of metastatic NSCLC, the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib is being proposed as first-line treatment in place of conventional chemotherapy. The regimen will be beneficial if toxicity is reduced and efficacy is unchanged or if efficacy is improved. Since this regimen causes no hair loss, minimal nausea and no cytopenia, which nearly eliminated the risks of infections and bleeding, the combination of targeted agents appears to be better tolerated than conventional chemotherapy. Efficacy may also be improved since its activity in the salvage setting when patients are less likely to respond to any treatment rivals that of conventional chemotherapy in the untreated setting. In addition, erlotinib alone in the untreated setting can yield results that are not dissimilar from chemotherapy under similar conditions. Hence, it is hypothesized that the combination of erlotinib plus bevacizumab can produce superior results with less toxicity. This trial is intended to provide pilot data for a future randomized trial of this combination of targeted agents versus conventional chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.</detailed_description>
