	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ramelteon (Rozeremâ„¢) as an add-on treatment for sleep problems in patients with bipolar disorder. This study will determine whether or not the addition of ramelteon to ongoing medication(s) for bipolar disorder is useful in improving sleep.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Add-On Ramelteon in Bipolar I Disorder With Clinically Significant Sleep Disturbance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single site, 8-week trial of add-on ramelteon in outpatient adults (18-65 years old, inclusive) with lifetime bipolar I disorder, with mild to moderate manic symptoms, and currently experiencing a clinically significant sleep disturbance. Approximately 60 subjects will be screened to obtain 30 subjects who enroll in the 8-week trial. Subjects will be randomized to ramelteon or placebo in a double-blind manner as add-on to current treatment. Any other psychotropic medications that the subject is taking at the initiation of participation in this protocol should be continued unchanged throughout the course of this study, except in instances in which these medications require dose reduction for management of side effects. Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed weekly, and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.</detailed_description>

Subjects with a current DSMIVTR Axis I diagnosis of delirium, dementia, amnesia, or other cognitive disorders; a DSMIVTR diagnosis of a substance dependence disorder within the past 6 months; or, a lifetime DSMIVTR psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder). 4. Subjects with serious general medical illnesses including hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, or hematologic disease as determined by the clinical judgment of the investigator. 5. Subjects with hypo or hyperthyroidism unless stabilized on thyroid replacement for &gt; 3 months. 6. Subjects with a clinically significant abnormality in their prestudy physical exam, vital signs, EKG, or laboratory studies. 7. Subjects who are allergic to or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to ramelteon. 8. Subjects who are taking medications that interact with ramelteon (e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, rifampin). 9. Females who are pregnant or nursing. 10.
