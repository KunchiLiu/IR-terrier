	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine if high doses of radiation using proton beam can be given safely with low and acceptable side effects. This study will also gather data to determine the ability of the proton beam to eradicate prostate cancer. Proton beam radiation is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal tissue than a regular radiation beam.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Beam Radiation Therapy for Early Stage Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Radiation therapy to the pelvis and prostate will be given once a day, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday), for 8 weeks. Each treatment takes about 10-20 minutes. - Participants will be seen once a week for the entire 8 weeks by their study doctor to monitor and record any side effects. At the end of radiation therapy, participants will have a history and physical examination. Follow-up visits with the study doctor will be done at weeks 13 and 26 and then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually to year five.</detailed_description>
