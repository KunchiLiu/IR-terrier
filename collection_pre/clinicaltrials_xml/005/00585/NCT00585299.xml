	<brief_summary>To assess whether reversal of fatty liver by moderate weight loss (8% of body weight) will lead to improvements in insulin sensitivity, which will be associated with changes in both glucose status and lipid profiles, in obese children and adolescents with fatty liver who have normal glucose or pre-diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Weight Loss on Hepatic and Muscle Lipid Content and on Insulin Sensitivity on Obese Adolescents With NAFLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will have two groups: one group that eats a moderate calorie, low-fat diet and is weighed regularly (every other week for 16 weeks) and the other who receives traditional diet therapy and returns in 16 weeks. Both groups will undergo procedures that test glucose tolerance and measure liver and muscle fat content before and after study period.</detailed_description>
