	<brief_summary>Dermatologists have for many years treated vascular lesions by a variety of modalities including cryosurgery, electrotherapy, dermabrasion and radiation. It has been hypothesized that simultaneous delivery of these two wavelengths may provide safer, and in some cases more effective, vascular lesion removal. The Tandem laser is capable of emitting multiple cryogen spurts intermittently with multiple 532/1064 nm laser pulses.This mode may reduce malformed blood vessels with a low incidence of long-term side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Vascular Lesions With a Tandem 532/1064 nm Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher can determine the blanching of vascular lesions after Tandem laser with multiple 532/1064 nm laser pulses treatment. The researcher will select one to four test sites spots for laser treatment. will be Different laser parameters can be used for each test site. The research will evaluate of the test sites at 6-12 weeks for bruising and blanching. Parameters of the test area with the greatest degree of blanching without adverse effects will be utilized for further treatment. If no test area is determined to have blanching without adverse effects, further test sites may be performed.</detailed_description>
