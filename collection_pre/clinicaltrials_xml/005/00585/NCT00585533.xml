	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate Tarceva in a selected population of patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are anticipated to have a relatively good (indolent) prognosis based on clinical criteria. It is anticipated that selection will enrich for tumor characteristic that are likely to be benefited by EGFR inhibitor treatment (survival greater than 90 days). The goal of this strategy is to provide a less toxic, oral treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC that will not interfere with patients receiving chemotherapy at some point in the future and may prolong the time to chemotherapy related progression. Patients will remain on study until disease progresses, a decline in performance status, if patient cannot tolerate the side effects or develops symptoms requiring conventional chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
