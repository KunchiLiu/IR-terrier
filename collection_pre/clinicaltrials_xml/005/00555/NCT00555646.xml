	<brief_summary>This is an open label, single center, controlled study with each subject's two treatment plaque areas assigned by the investigator 1:1 to (a) PH-10 with ambient light exposure and (b) PH-10 with 544 nm LED light illumination at 10 J/cm2. A third plaque area will receive no treatment and serve as a control. Subjects with at least three distinct, stable study plaque areas will receive the experimental therapy to two treatment plaque areas twice a week (2-5 days apart) for the lesser of 12 weeks or until remission is observed in the treatment plaque areas. If remission is observed in a treatment plaque area then treatment of that area will be discontinued and the area assessed weekly. A third plaque area (control plaque area) will receive no drug or light treatment and serve as an internal control. Primary efficacy will be assessed 12 weeks after initial PH-10 treatment. Subjects will be followed for a total of 16 weeks to allow assessment of Durability of Response of treated lesions and comprehensive follow-up of adverse events.</brief_summary>

All study plaque areas must be on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms, soles, scalp, and facial or intertriginous sites). Fitzpatrick skin type IVI. Ability to understand and sign the informed consent document. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are pregnant, attempting to conceive, or nursing an infant. Subjects who have received PUVA or UVB light therapy or systemic antipsoriatic therapy within 4 weeks of study treatment (two weeks for methotrexate). Subjects who have received topical antipsoriatic therapy (including corticosteroids, tar, anthralin, or Vitamin D analogs) to the study plaque areas within 2 weeks of study treatment. Subjects who have received any photosensitizing or phototoxic drug within 4 weeks of study treatment. Subjects who have received any approved biologic drug therapy for psoriasis within 3 months or 5 halflives of study treatment. Subjects who have participated in a clinical research study within 4 weeks of study treatment. Subjects with a history of porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus or xeroderma pigmentosum. Subjects with clinical conditions that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, may pose a health risk to the subject by being involved in the study or detrimentally affect regular followup of the subject.</criteria>
