	<brief_title>Effect of Gabapentin on Idiopathic Subjective Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation. It can be subjective or objective. . Despite numerous researches,no effective treatment for people who suffer from tinnitus has yet been stablished. As there are many evidences suggesting that loss of inhibition in the central nervous system may be responsible for many aspects of auditory dysfunction,including tinnitus; and as Gabapentin (Neurontin), a gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue, is an effective medication in conditions where inhibition in the CNS is impaired; we guess that Gabapentin might be useful for treating idiopathic subjective tinnitus.</detailed_description>
