	<criteria>Diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma as defined by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWGURC). Phase 1: Relapsed or relapsed/refractory myeloma after at least 1 previous treatments and with a life expectancy of more than 3 months. Phase 2: Measurable (as defined by IMWGURC) disease after at least 1 previous treatment. History of allogeneic stem cell transplant. Phase 2 only: Prior bortezomib therapy will only be allowed if there was a demonstrated positive response, and disease progression occurred off therapy. Must have not experienced significant blood level changes, e.g. very low platelets, while on previous bortezomib therapy Prior radiation therapy to &gt; 25% of the bone marrow (whole pelvis is 25%).</criteria>
