	<brief_summary>Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transendocardial injection using the Cordis Biosense NogaStarTM Mapping Catheter with the Biosense MyostarTM Left Ventricular Injection Catheter of 25 M, 75 M, and 150 M allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) in subjects with AMI. SecondaryObjective The secondary objectives are to explore functional efficacy for subsequent study design, as well as late-term dose related tolerance, by: - Evaluating the effect of allogeneic MPCs on exploratory efficacy endpoints related to cardiac function on Days 90, 180, and 1 year - Evaluating the change from baseline in the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and the New York Heart Association Classification at 30 days, 3 and 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years - Evaluating follow-up safety through Day 360 - Providing preliminary data to support dose selection for future studies</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age 18 years or older. 2. An STelevation MI (STEMI) within 2 to 10 days of study enrollment. The STEMI must be documented by ECG with STsegment elevation &gt;1 mm in at least 2 contiguous precordial leads or in at least 2 adjacent limb leads. If there is a history of a previous AMI prior to the qualifying MI, then there must be a documented EF ≥ 50% by 2D echocardiogram within 12 months of enrollment. 3. Successful percutaneous revascularization with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)3 flow of the infarctrelated artery. 4. A baseline 2D echocardiogram with EF ≥ 30 and ≤ 50% following PCI. 5. Creatinine level ≤ 1.5mg/dL within 24 hours of study procedure. 6. Hematocrit ≥ 30% within 24 hours of study procedure. 7. White Blood Cell count &lt; 20k/mm3 within 24 hours of study procedure. 8. Platelet count ≥ 100k/mm3 within 24 hours of study procedure. 9. INR ≤ 1.7 within 24 hours of study procedure. 10. Total bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL, albumin &gt;2.8 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase(AST) ≤ 2.5x the upper limit of normal, gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal. 11. If the subject or partner is of childbearing potential, he or she must be willing to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening and for a period of at least 16 weeks after surgery. 12. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 2 weeks of enrollment) and a negative serum or urine pregnancy test on the day of cell implantation. 13. Willing and able to understand, sign, and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF). 14. Must be willing to return for required followup visits. 15. Must be able to follow postoperative management program. 1. Subject is hemodynamically unstable at Day 5 postAMI as demonstrated by any of the following: 1. Killip Class 4 indicative of cardiogenic shock. 2. Requirement of intraaortic balloon pump or IV inotropic support for the maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure ≥ 60 mmHg. 2. Sustained ventricular tachycardia as demonstrated by QRS complexes wider than 120 msec, lasting &gt;30 secs, and &gt;100 bpm occurring &gt;48 hours following PCI without any identifiable, reversible cause (ie, electrolyte imbalance). 3. Further revascularization planned for the next 30 days. 4. Chronic atrial fibrillation. 5. A wall thickness in the target region &lt;8 mm as determined by 2D echocardiography(the target region is defined at the time of NOGA® mapping). 6. An LV thrombus. 7. Severe peripheral vascular disease precluding femoral artery access as determined at time of original catheterization. 8. Aortic stenosis as determined as valve area less than 1 cm2 that prohibits catheter access to the LV. 9. Echocardiographic evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy indicating heart muscle thickness &gt;15 mm. 10. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 11. Serum glucose level ≥ 400 mg/dl within 24 hours of study procedure 12. Serum glucose level 300400 mg/dl and presence of urine ketones within 24 hours of study procedure. 13. Claustrophobic, or with medical conditions or contradictions that impede performing baseline MRI study. 14. An active uncontrolled infection. 15. A prosthetic aortic valve. 16. Presence of ≥ 20% antiHLA antibody titers and/or having antibody specificities to donor HLA antigens. 17. A current or prior history within the last 3 years of neoplasm (excluding basal cell) and/or any active neoplasm within the last 24 months. 18. A known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), murine and/or bovine products. 19. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. 20. Imprisoned at the time of enrollment. 21. A treatment and/or an uncompleted followup treatment of any investigational therapy within 6 months before implantation surgery and intent to participate in any other investigational drug or cell therapy study during the 3year followup period of this study. 22. Active participation in other research therapy for cardiovascular repair/regeneration. 23. A prior recipient of stem precursor cell therapy for cardiac repair. 24. Any medical condition that would affect the investigator's ability to evaluate the subject's condition or could compromise the subject's safety. 25. Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would prohibit the subject from participating in the study.</criteria>
