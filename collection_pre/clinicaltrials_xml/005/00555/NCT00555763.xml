	<brief_summary>The classic Goldmann applanation tonometer has been further developed. The applanation principle has been retained, while the internal force transmission and the pressure gauging have been optimized, and the display of results digitized. The purpose of the study is to compare the standard Goldmann applanation tonometer AT900 with the new version of the device, and to test the reliability and reproducibility of measurements, as well as its safety.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The classic Goldmann applanation tonometer has been further developed. The applanation principle has been retained, while the internal force transmission and the pressure gauging have been optimized, and the display of results digitized. The purpose of the study is to compare the standard Goldmann applanation tonometer AT900 with the new version of the device, and to test the reliability and reproducibility of measurements, as well as its safety. Patients at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bern, will be included after informed consent. The study has been approved by the local ethical committee. Routine ophthalmologic examination will be performed and inclusion criteria evaluated. Measurements will be taken with the two tonometers in random order. Prior to pressure measurement, central corneal thickness will be measured with a non-contact method (Optical Low Coherence Reflectometry, OLCR pachymeter, Haag-Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland).</detailed_description>
