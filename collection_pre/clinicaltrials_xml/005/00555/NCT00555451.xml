	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of HE3286 when administered daily for 28 days to obese adult subjects and to assess potential activity of HE3286 to decrease insulin resistance. An open-label cohort of 6 patients with type II diabetes mellitus will be treated at 10 mg (5 mg BID).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Potential Activity of HE3286 in Obese Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HE3286 has a potentially new mechanism of action that may improve the current therapeutic options available to patients with metabolic disorders, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In preclinical experiments, HE3286 has shown to have anti-inflammatory activity associated with corticosteroids but without the side effects known with corticosteroid use, such as immune suppression and bone loss. HE3286 has demonstrated glucose-lowering and insulin-enhancing effects in several preclinical mouse and rat models of insulin resistance. In these experiments, HE3286 lowered blood glucose levels and prevented progression of hyperglycemia and HE3286 appeared to enhance insulin sensitivity.</detailed_description>
