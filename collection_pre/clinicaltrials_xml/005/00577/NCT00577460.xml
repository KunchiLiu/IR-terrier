	<brief_summary>The general aim of this study is to obtain long-term safety and tolerability data on pramipexole extended release (ER), in daily doses from 0.375mg to 4.5mg once daily (qd), in patients who have previously completed a pramipexole double-blind study in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) (248.525 trial).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Completion of the doubleblind trial 248.525 2. Male or female patient with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), with a Modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 to 4 at ontime, and a concomitant treatment with standard or controlled release LDopa+, or a combination of LDopa+ and entacapone. 3. Patient willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures. In particular the patient should be able to recognise the offtime and ontime periods during waking hours and the patient (or a family member or a guardian) should be able to record them accurately in the patient diary. 4. Signed informed consent obtained before any study procedures are carried out (in accordance with International Conference of Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICHGCP) guidelines and local legislation). Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients prematurely withdrawn from the doubleblind trial 248.525 2. Atypical parkinsonian syndromes due to drugs, metabolic disorders, encephalitis or degenerative diseases 3. Any psychiatric disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)IV criteria that could prevent compliance or completion of the study and/or put the patient at risk if he/she takes part in the study 4. History of psychosis, except history of drug induced hallucinations 5. History of deep brain stimulation 6. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities at baseline 7. Clinically significant hypotension and/or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline 8. Malignant melanoma or history of previously treated malignant melanoma 9. Any other clinically significant disease, whether treated or not, that could put the patient at risk or could prevent compliance or completion of the study 10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding 11. Sexually active female of childbearing potential not using a medically approved method of birth control 12. Serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) (SGPT)), alkaline phosphatase (AP) or bilirubin &gt; 2 upper limit normal (ULN) at baseline 13. Patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min at baseline 14. Any medication with central dopaminergic antagonist activity within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit 15. Any of the following drugs within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit: methylphenidate, cinnarizine, amphetamines 16. Flunarizine within 3 months prior to baseline 17. Known hypersensitivity to pramipexole or its excipients 18. Drug abuse, according to investigators judgement, within 2 years prior to baseline 19. Participation in investigational drug studies other than the trial 248.525, or use of other investigational drugs within one month or five times the halflife of the investigational drug (whichever is longer) prior to baseline</criteria>
