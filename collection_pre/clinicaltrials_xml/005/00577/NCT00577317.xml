	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying Flexitouch® home maintenance therapy to see how well it works compared with standard home maintenance therapy in treating patients with lower-extremity lymphedema caused by treatment for cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, or endometrial cancer. Flexitouch® home maintenance therapy may lessen lower-extremity lymphedema caused by treatment for gynecologic cancer. It is not yet known whether the Flexitouch® system is more effective than standard home maintenance therapy in treating lymphedema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flexitouch® Home Maintenance Therapy or Standard Home Maintenance Therapy in Treating Patients With Lower-Extremity Lymphedema Caused by Treatment for Cervical Cancer, Vulvar Cancer, or Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Compare the effectiveness of the Flexitouch® System to standard home lymphedema therapy (Manual Lymphatic Drainage) in the management of lower-extremity lymphedema in women with a history of cervical, vulvar, or endometrial cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I. Compare the quality of life (QOL) and functional status between patients using the Flexitouch® System and those following standard home lymphedema treatment (Manual Lymphatic Drainage) programs in the management of lower-extremity lymphedema OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to site of cancer (cervical vs vulvar vs endometrial) and stage of lymphedema at diagnosis. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive standard home maintenance therapy and perform self-manual lymphatic drainage once daily for 60 minutes for 24 weeks. ARM II: Patients receive Flexitouch® home maintenance therapy once daily for 60 minutes for 24 weeks. Clinical staff measure patients' lower limb (both) volumes and patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and at completion of study treatment.</detailed_description>
