	<brief_summary>Heart failure is a disorder in which the heart does not pump blood adequately. This can lead to several serious problems, including reduced blood flow throughout the body, congestion of blood in the veins and lungs, and fluid accumulation in various organs and limbs. Diuretics are often used to address the problem of fluid accumulation, but the optimal dose and the amount of time over which to administer each dose are unclear. This study will compare high and low doses of diuretics administered over longer and shorter periods of time to determine the safest and most effective combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining Optimal Dose and Duration of Diuretic Treatment in People With Acute Heart Failure (The DOSE-AHF Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a common disorder in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the rest of the body. Heart failure symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling, and fatigue. Standard treatment for the swelling associated with heart failure includes the use of diuretic medications, such as furosemide, which cause urination and the removal of excess fluids in the body. Although furosemide has been used to treat heart failure patients for many years, it is still unclear how much of the drug to use, and over what time period the drug should be given. This study will evaluate whether furosemide treatment is safer and more effective when the drug is given in high doses versus low doses and in two to three separate doses versus one continuous infusion. Participants in this study will begin study procedures within the first 24 hours of their hospital admission for heart failure. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following four treatments: high dose furosemide via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion and placebo every 12 hours via IV bolus; low dose furosemide via continuous IV infusion and placebo every 12 hours via IV bolus; high dose furosemide every 12 hours via IV bolus and placebo via continuous IV infusion; and low dose furosemide every 12 hours via IV bolus and placebo via continuous IV infusion. Each participant will receive treatment for the first 72 hours of his or her hospital stay. Participants will answer questionnaires and undergo physical examinations and blood tests during the first 96 hours of hospitalization and again before hospital discharge or on Day 7, if that occurs first. Participants will be asked to return to their doctors 60 days following hospital discharge to evaluate their responses to treatment.</detailed_description>
