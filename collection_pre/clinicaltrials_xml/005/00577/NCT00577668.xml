	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of the Combination of Melphalan, Bortezomib, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (MEL-VTD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous transplant is now considered a standard treatment for many patients with multiple myeloma. An autologous transplant is a procedure in which stem cells are removed from a patient and then given back to the patient following intensive treatment. Doctors remove healthy stem cells from a patient's circulating blood system and store them before the patient receives high-dose chemotherapy. The stem cells are then returned to the patient, where they can produce new blood cells to replace cells destroyed by the treatment. The drug usually used before transplant is melphalan alone in 1 or 2 high doses. In past studies conducted at UAMS, researchers have shown that a chemotherapy treatment regimen called "VTD" is effective in patients with multiple myeloma who have failed previous treatments. VTD is a combination of drugs consisting of VelcadeTM (also known as bortezomib), Thalidomide, and Dexamethasone. In this study, researchers want to find out if using the VTD regimen, along with higher doses melphalan, in subjects who have relapsed or progressed after previous transplant(s) can be given safely to subjects who have failed previous transplant(s).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History of histologically documented MM with relapsed or progressive disease after either scheduled tandem or one autologous transplantation. Patient has measurable disease in which to capture response. Performance status of 2 as per Zubroid scale, unless PS of 34 based solely on bone pain. Patients must have a platelet count 75,000/μL, and an ANC of at least 1,000/μL. Patients must have adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL. Patients must have adequate hepatic function defined as serum transaminases and direct bilirubin &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy documented within one week of registration. Women of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. Male or female adults of at least 18 years of age. Patients must have signed an IRBapproved written informed consent form and demonstrate willingness to meet followup schedule and study procedure obligations. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy received within the previous 2 weeks. Significant neurotoxicity, defined as grade &gt; 2 neurotoxicity per NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (See Appendix). Platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3, or ANC &lt; 1,000/μl. Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction as noted by bilirubin or AST &gt; 3 times the upper normal limit or clinically significant concurrent hepatitis. New York Hospital Association (NYHA) Class III or Class IV heart failure. Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. Uncontrolled, active infection requiring IV antibiotics. Patients with a history of treatment for clinically significant ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. Poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other serious or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol. Pregnant or potential for pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test at screening, and will be required to use a medically approved contraceptive method. Breastfeeding women may not participate.</criteria>
