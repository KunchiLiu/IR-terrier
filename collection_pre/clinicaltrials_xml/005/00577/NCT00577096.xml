	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of Epoetin alfa therapy (short term versus long term) with and without a home-based individualized exercise program that incorporated aerobic and strength resistance training for patients being treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral bloodstem cell transplantation (PBSC T) for multiple myeloma. The endpoints for the study included the number of attempts at and total number of days of stem cell collection, number of RBC and platelet transfusions during the transplantation period, time-to-recovery after transplantation, and response to intensive therapy for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
