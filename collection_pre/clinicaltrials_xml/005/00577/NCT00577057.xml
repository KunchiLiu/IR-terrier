	<brief_summary>The objectives of this clinical study are threefold: 1. To compare the benefits in cancer control and survival obtained from adding induction-concurrent chemotherapy to radiation with those from adding concurrent-adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation. 2. To test whether replacing fluorouracil with Xeloda in combining with cisplatin (PF or PX, respectively) in the chemotherapy plan will maintain or improve further the chemotherapy benefits while reducing the duration of hospital stay. 3. To see if accelerated fractionation radiotherapy can improve the outcome of patients as compared with conventional fractionation radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
