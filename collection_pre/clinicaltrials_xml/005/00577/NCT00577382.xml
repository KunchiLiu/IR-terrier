	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective Sunitinib works in treating acral lentiginous and mucosal melanoma which has spread beyond the local region. Suninitib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor and acts as a c-kit inhibitor drug. It is believed to work by blocking signals on certain cancer cells which allow the malignant cells to multiply and spread due to a change in the genetic make up of the cancer cell.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the proportion of participants with metastatic mucosal or acral/lentiginous melanoma who are alive and without disease progression at two months after beginning treatment with sunitinib. - To determine the best overall response rate. Secondary - To determine the time to progression and overall survival. - To correlate c-kit mutational status with response to therapy. - To evaluate the use of FDG-PET scanning in determining early biologic response to therapy. - To assess amplification of c-kit status through quantitative PCR and/or FISH and other related molecular pathway targets.</detailed_description>
