	<brief_summary>For the main goal - the accuracy of calprotectin for the diagnosis of IBD - calprotectin levels will be compared between patients with and without a diagnosis of IBD and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy will be determined. For the secondary aim - the correlation between calprotectin levels and disease activity - in patients with IBD selected from this cohort, we will determine the association between calprotectin levels and clinical IBD score, serological markers (WBC, Hgb, Platelets, ESR, CRP, Albumin), endoscopic (disease score, pathological activity) and radiological features (bowel wall thickening, enhancement, edema, mesenteric inflammation).</brief_summary>
