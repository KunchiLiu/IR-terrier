	<brief_summary>The CABANA pilot study is designed to test the hypothesis that the treatment strategy of percutaneous left atrial catheter ablation for the purpose of the elimination of atrial fibrillation (AF) is superior to current state-of-the-art therapy with either rate control or anti-arrhythmic drugs for reducing AF recurrences at 1 year follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ablation vs Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation - Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need for this trial arises out of 1) the rapidly increasing number of pts &gt; 60 years of age with AF accompanied by symptoms and morbidity, 2) the failure of anti-arrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm and reduce mortality, 3) the rapidly increasing application of radio-frequency catheter ablation without appropriate evidence-based validation, and 4) the expanding impact of AF on health care costs.</detailed_description>
