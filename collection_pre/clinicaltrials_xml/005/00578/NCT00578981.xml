	<brief_summary>To develop a decision aid to support the decision to use (or not use) bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporotic fractures, and to assess the impact of the decision aid on start and six month adherence to bisphosphonates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osteoporosis Choice Decision Aid for Use of Bisphosphonates in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bisphosphonates can reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis. However, many patients may not start and adhere to bisphosphonates, consequently losing independence, quality, and length of life. We hypothesize that a decision aid that efficiently improves patient education and communication with their provider about fracture risk, and about using bisphosphonates to reduce that risk, will improve the quality of treatment decisions. We anticipate that patients will become more involved in the decision-making process and decisions will be more consistent with patients' values and health care goals. We expect this will lead to increased bisphosphonate start and adherence and improved patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
