	<brief_title>A Clinical Investigation of the Oxford® Meniscal Unicompartmental Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objective To provide a prospective 2-year post-operative evaluation of complications and 9-year long-term survivorship analysis of patients implanted with the Oxford™ Meniscal Unicompartmental Knee System at multiple sites in the United States. Study Design The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized post approval study. There are two phases to this study: 1. A complications study where patients will be followed for at least 2 years to record all complications that may occur, and 2. A survival study that will record at yearly intervals out to 9 years whether or not the device is still in place or if it has been removed for any reason. Phase 1 requires clinical follow-up (0-2 year) and patients will be evaluated at pre-defined intervals up to 2 years post-operative. Information gathered in phase 1 includes all adverse events and survival data. Phase 2 (3-9 year) only gathers survival data through patient directed mailing and/or phone call.</detailed_description>
