	<brief_summary>Treatment with lucinactant, a peptide-containing synthetic lung surfactant, will be evaluated in young children with acute respiratory failure who require mechanical ventilation (life support), to determine if it is safe and if treatment with lucinactant will reduce the number of days a child needs mechanical ventilation (life support).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lucinactant for Treatment of Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in Children up to Two Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determine the safety and tolerability of administration of a peptide-containing synthetic lung surfactant, lucinactant, in children up to two years of age and assess whether treatment with lucinactant can decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation in young children.</detailed_description>
