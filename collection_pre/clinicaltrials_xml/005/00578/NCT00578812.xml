	<brief_summary>The PCM Cervical Disc was studied in a prospective, multicenter, randomized FDA-approved investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical trial conducted in the United States to evaluate longitudinal outcomes over 2 years comparatively between the PCM Cervical Disc and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with allograft and plate. Patients with adjacent or non-adjacent prior fusion were allowed. A total of 416 patients with a degenerated cervical disc at one level from C3-C4 to C7-T1 were enrolled in the clinical trial and 403 were treated. Patients were randomly assigned to be treated either with the PCM Cervical Disc or ACDF.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PCM Cervical Disc was studied in a prospective, multicenter, randomized FDA-approved investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical trial conducted in the United States to evaluate longitudinal outcomes over 2 years comparatively between the PCM Cervical Disc and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with allograft and plate. Patients with adjacent or non-adjacent prior fusion were allowed. A total of 416 patients with a degenerated cervical disc at one level from C3-C4 to C7-T1 were enrolled in the clinical trial and 403 were treated. Patients were randomly assigned to be treated either with the PCM Cervical Disc or ACDF. Patients were evaluated before surgery, during the operation, immediately after surgery, and then at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months, and yearly after surgery. The patients were recommended to have a physical therapy program for non-impact exercises and active range of motion exercises after surgery. Patients were also instructed to avoid repetitive cervical flexion and extension bending and lateral bending and rotation for 6 weeks following surgery. The safety of the PCM Cervical Disc was assessed by comparing the adverse events, any additional surgical procedures, and the neurological outcomes to those in the ACDF control group. The effectiveness of the PCM Cervical Disc was assessed by evaluating patients' pain and function outcomes using a standard questionnaire, the Neck Disability Index (NDI), the severity of neck and arm pain based on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessment, quality of life using a standard questionnaire, the Short Form-36 (SF-36), as well as a patient satisfaction questionnaire compared to the ACDF control group. In addition, the patients were evaluated using radiographic evaluations, including spinal range of motion, spinal disc height, device displacement or migration, spinal fusion status, and heterotopic ossification (abnormal bone formation). The primary endpoint of the IDE trial was a composite measure termed "overall success," which was evaluated at 24 months postoperatively, and was defined as at least 20% improvement in neck disability index (NDI) from preoperative score; absence of reoperation, revision, or removal; maintenance or improvement in neurological status; and absence of radiographic or major complications during the 24-month follow-up period. On October 26, 2012, the FDA granted Premarket Approval (PMA) for the PCM Cervical Disc. PCM Cervical Disc is indicated for use in skeletally mature patients for reconstruction of a degenerated cervical disc at one level from C3-C4 to C6-C7 following single-level discectomy for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit), with or without neck pain, or myelopathy due to a single-level abnormality localized to the disc space, and manifested by at least one of the following conditions confirmed by radiographic imaging (CT, MRI, X-rays): herniated nucleus pulposus, spondylosis (defined by the presence of osteophytes), and/or visible loss of disc height as compared to adjacent levels.</detailed_description>
