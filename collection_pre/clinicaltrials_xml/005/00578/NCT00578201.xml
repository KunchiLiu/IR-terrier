	<brief_title>FOLFOX-Cetuximab-radiotherapy for the Treatment of Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody which can block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread Cetuximab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drug used in chemotherapy such as oxaliplatin leucovorin and Fluorouracil work in different way to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them form dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy X rays to kill tumor cells. Giving cetuximab could improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and may make the tumor smaller This phase II trial is studying the effects of oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil-when given together with Cetuximab and radiation therapy and radiation therapy to see how they work in treating patients with stage III esophageal cancer.</detailed_description>
