	<brief_summary>The Genitourinary Oncology/Urology Services at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) participates in research for the control, treatment, and cure of cancer. The purpose of this study is to collect normal and cancerous tissues, in addition to blood, and other body fluid samples from men with prostate cancer or prostatic disease. These samples may be stored for future use or used immediately by researchers who study prostate cancer and try to find better ways to diagnose, prevent, and treat it. We will look for genetic changes and protein markers on these cells. We hope to learn more about what makes some people get prostate cancer, why some cancers are more aggressive than others, and why some cancers respond to or resist different treatments. We may also try to grow the tumor cells in the lab. We may find a new treatment for prostate cancer based on this research.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The therapeutics program for advanced prostate cancer is based on the hypothesis that the factors contributing to and associated with progression change as the disease evolves. To categorize these changes we now consider the disease as a series of states. 1 The states represent points where an intervention might be considered to prevent cancer from developing, to eliminate established disease, or to delay progression. The states also represent clinically significant milestones that can be used to assess treatment effects.</detailed_description>
