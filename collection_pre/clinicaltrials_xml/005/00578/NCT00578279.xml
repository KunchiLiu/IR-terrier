	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data after endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) in patients with locally advanced or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Hypotheses: 1. Increased amounts of alcohol used in EUS-CPN is safe and more efficacious in improving pain relief in patients with locally advanced or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 2. Effective pain relief obtained from EUS-CPN will be related to better quality of life (QOL)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A total of 20 consecutive subjects with locally advanced or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (stage II to IV) with pain (abdominal and/or back). Subjects with known or suspected unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be recruited for this study, as a diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often made during the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedure. Subjects must have documented disease by computed tomography (CT), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or EUS. Subjects undergoing EUS for pancreatic cancer staging. Subjects undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery are eligible for study entry beginning 5 days after the operation if they have not had an intraoperative celiac plexus neurolysis. No evidence of dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the giving and understanding of informed consent, and no evidence of psychiatric risk that would preclude adequate compliance with this protocol. Subjects must not have a coagulopathy (platelet &lt;50,000, INR&gt;1.5, or bleeding disorder, or on blood thinners) Subjects with platelets below 50,000 will not be eligible to participate in this study due to the risk of bleeding. Patients will be asked to discontinue use of nonsteroidals for 5 days prior to the procedure. Patients on plavix will be asked to discontinue use for 7 days prior to the procedure if they are clinically able to do so. Patients on coumadin or lovenox will also need to discontinue use prior to the procedure, but decisions regarding their management will be made on an individual basis as per our usual standards of care. Subjects must provide signed written informed consent. A baseline pain score is not required, however, subjects must be having pain that is requiring a stable dose of pain medication for control of pain. Subjects will be excluded if they have undergone a celiac plexus neurolysis (endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical). Presence of an implanted epidural or intrathecal analgesic therapy. Subjects with psychiatric illness that affects their ability to assess quality of life or compliance with the protocol. Subjects with uncorrectable coagulopathy Subjects with an allergy to bupivacaine or alcohol. Presence of an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta, celiac trunk, or superior mesenteric artery.</criteria>
