	<brief_title>Low Field Magnetic Stimulation in Mood Disorders Using the LFMS Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves a screening visit with the study physician and a treatment visit. Participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires about their mood during both visits. The treatment visit will involve use of the LFMS device. Participants will place the top of their head inside the device for approximately 20 minutes. Participants will receive either the actual treatment or a sham treatment and will not know which they receive. This device produces weak electromagnetic fields. There is no discomfort or even sensation caused by the device. The device has been declared to be a "non-significant risk device" by the FDA, and there are no known risks associated with its use.</detailed_description>
