	<brief_title>Trial of Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Elective Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery: Oral and Systemic Versus Systemic Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who undergo elective colorectal surgery is now accepted universally. But the rout of administration should be systematic, oral, or both is controversial. Furthermore, although many trails have been performed, no trial limited to laparoscopic surgery is performed. We compare 2 approaches - oral and systemic versus systemic antibiotic prophylaxis - in limited to elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery.</detailed_description>
