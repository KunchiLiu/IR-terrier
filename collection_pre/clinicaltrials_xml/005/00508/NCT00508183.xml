	<brief_title>Types of Fixation in Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Research Question; What is the difference in disease specific quality of life between patients who undergo a repair of the rotator cuff with arthroscopic technique using single-row fixation, versus double-row fixation, as measured by the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC)at one year post op?</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients who have failed standard nonsurgical management of their rotator cuff tear, and who would benefit from a surgical repair of the cuff. Imaging and intraoperative findings confirming a full thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Characteristics of the cuff tear that render the cuff irrepairable. Significant shoulder comorbidities Previous surgery on affected shoulder Patients with active workers compensation claims Active joint or systemic infection Significant muscle paralysis Rotatorcuff tear arthropathy Charcots arthropathy Major medical illness Unable to speak or read English Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent</criteria>
