	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate, in 12-23 months old subjects, the non-inferiority of meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 co-administered with Infanrix hexa™, compared to each vaccine administered individually and to licensed meningococcal vaccine Meningitec™. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Co-Administration of Meningococcal Vaccine GSK134612 With Infanrix Hexa™ Versus Individual Administration of Each Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicentre study with 4 parallel groups. One group will receive GSK134612 co-administered with Infanrix hexa™, two groups will receive sequential administration of GSK134612 and Infanrix hexa™ and the final group will receive Meningitec™. For subjects in Groups B and C, three blood samples will be taken: prior to first vaccination and 1 month after each vaccination. For subjects in Groups A and D, two blood samples will be taken: prior to and 1 month after vaccination.</detailed_description>
