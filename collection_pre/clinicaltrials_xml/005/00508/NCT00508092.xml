	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether the use of local anesthetic to numb the nerves that run deeper in the abdominal wall gives better post operative pain control than just infiltrating local anesthetic to the wound edges.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Nerve Blockade and Local Infiltration Anesthesia in Appendectomy - A Blinded Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local anesthetic is often administered during an operation to reduce post operative wound pain. Whilst this is frequently done during an appendectomy there is currently no evidence to suggest whether there is any benefit to the patient to injecting the local anesthetic deeper to block the nerves supplying abdominal wall sensation, compared to using it just in the skin around the wound. Comparison: Post operative pain scores following appendectomy for patients given skin infiltration of local anesthetic (pre incision), compared to patients given both preincision wound infiltration and deeper field infiltration with local anesthetic(deep to external oblique).</detailed_description>
