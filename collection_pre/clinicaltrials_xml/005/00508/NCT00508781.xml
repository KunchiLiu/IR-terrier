	<brief_title>Multiphoton Laser Scanning Microscopy in Cutaneous Optical Pathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For skin diseases, the most convincing method for diagnosis to date is surgical biopsy. However, a skin biopsy is an invasive procedure which carries the risk of tissue damage, wound infection and scar formation. To solve the inconvenience from surgical biopsy, multiphoton laser scanning microscopy is a developing, non-invasive method for observing the cutaneous anatomy and pathology. Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy is good in tissue penetration and resolution with less tissue damage. The study aims to compare surgical specimen by conventional pathology slice with the image by non-invasive multiphoton laser scanning microscopy. A good correlation in multiphoton image may serve as optical biopsy for cutaneous pathology and spare the invasive procedure of skin biopsy.</detailed_description>
