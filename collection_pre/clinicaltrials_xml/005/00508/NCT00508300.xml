	<brief_title>Epidural Analgesia (EDA) Versus Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) in Laparoscopic Colon Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allocation by individual random number generated by a computer program to either EDA or PCA for 48h after laparoscopic colonic surgery. Short, both groups are treated according to a recent Fast track protocol. Group A will preoperatively receive a mid thoracic EDA (th 8-9; naropine 0,1%) while group B will receive a PCA (morphine) postoperatively. Both EDA and PCA are removed the afternoon at day 2. Patients with a non-functioning EDA within the first 24h will be crossed over to the PCA group.</detailed_description>
