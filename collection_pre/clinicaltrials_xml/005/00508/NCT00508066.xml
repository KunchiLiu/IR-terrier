	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of continuous local anesthetic delivery on the immediate post-op recovery of patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery for congenital or idiopathic scoliosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Local Infusion of Anesthetic at the Incisional Site for Scoliosis Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constant local analgesic infusion is a relatively new modality that provides a constant supply of medication without the need for repeat injections. This method has shown encouraging results with respect to pain levels, narcotic use, faster rehabilitation and shorter hospital stay in patients undergoing laparotomies, iliac crest bone graft harvest, and sternotomies. In addition, there have not been any reported complications when used in these scenarios. We hope to confirm better pain control, less narcotic use (i.e. PCA), fewer narcotic side effects, better response to physical therapy and earlier discharge. Which may be generalized to the spinal surgery patient population as less pain and suffering and a better overall hospital course</detailed_description>
