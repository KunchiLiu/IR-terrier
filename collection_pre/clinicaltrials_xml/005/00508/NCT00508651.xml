	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of MEDI-560 at 10^5 TCID50 when administered to children 6 to &lt; 12 months of age who are HPIV3 (human parainfluenza virus type 3) seronegative at baseline and to infants 1 to &lt; 3 months of age regardless of baseline serostatus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Immunogenicity, and Shedding of MEDI-560 in Infants 1 to &lt; 12 Months of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose Phase 1/2a multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, viral shedding, immunogenicity, and genotypic and phenotypic stability of MEDI-560 in infants 1 to &lt; 12 months of age. Three doses of MEDI-560 at a dosage level of 10^5 TCID50 were administered 0, 2, and 4 months after enrollment to a 30-participant cohort of 6 to &lt; 12 month-old HPIV3 seronegative children randomized 2:1 to MEDI-560 vs placebo. A second 160-participant cohort of 1 to &lt; 3 month-old infants not screened for baseline serostatus was planned but was not opened to enrollment for reasons other than safety. Participants were followed for safety through 180 days post last dose. Nasal wash specimens were collected at screening and Days 7, 12, and 28 following each dose and during unscheduled illness visits to assess vaccine virus shedding and genotypic and phenotypic stability of any shed vaccine virus. Blood was collected at screening to determine eligibility and prior to Dose 1 for baseline serostatus. Blood for assessment of antibodies to HPIV3 was collected approximately 7 to 12 days after Dose 1 and Dose 3 and 1 month after each dose for antibodies to PIV3.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female whose age on the day of randomization falls within one of the two age cohorts: Cohort 1: 6 to &lt; 12 months (≥ 6 months of age and not yet reached their 1st year birthday); Cohort 2: 1 to &lt; 3 months (&gt; 28 days of age and not yet reached their 3rd month birthday) 2. Cohort 1 only: Participant is seronegative to HPIV3 at screening as determined by ELISA; or the legal representative is willing to provide access to data documenting that the participant was screened for another MedImmune trial after written informed consent was obtained, and that the participant is seronegative to HPIV3 within 21 days prior to randomization into MICP150 as determined by ELISA at MedImmune 3. Participant was the product of a normal full term pregnancy, defined as 3642 weeks gestation 4. Participant is in general good health 5. Participant's legal representative is available by telephone 6. Written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization (if applicable) obtained from the participant's legal representative 7. Participant's legal representative is able to understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol as judged by the investigator 8. Participant is available to complete the followup period of 180 days after the final dose of investigational product as required by the protocol 9. Participant's legal representative is willing and able to bring the subject to the study site for evaluation of respiratory illness in accordance with the protocol 1. Any fever (≥ 100.4°F [≥ 38.0°C], regardless of route) or lower respiratory illness within 7 days prior to randomization 2. Moderate or severe nasal congestion that in the investigator's opinion could prevent intranasal delivery of investigational product 3. Cohort 1 only: weight &lt; the fifth percentile for age on the day of randomization 4. Cohort 2 only: history of low birthweight (ie, &lt; 2,500 grams at birth) or weight &lt; fifth percentile for age on the day of randomization 5. Any drug therapy (chronic or other) within 7 days prior to randomization or expected receipt through the protocolspecified blood collection 28 days after each investigational product dosing, except that infrequent use of overthecounter medications such as pain relievers are permitted according to the judgment of the investigator 6. Any current or expected receipt of immunosuppressive agents including steroids (≥ 2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or its equivalent, or ≥ 20 mg/day if the participant weighs &gt;10 kg, given daily or on alternate days for ≥ 14 days); children in this category should not receive investigational product until immunosuppressive agents including corticosteroid therapy have been discontinued for ≥ 30 days; the use of topical steroids is permitted according to the judgment of the investigator 7. History of receipt of blood transfusion or expected receipt through 30 days after final investigational product dosing 8. History of receipt of immunoglobulin products or expected receipt through 30 days after final investigational product dosing 9. Receipt of any investigational drug within 60 days prior to randomization or expected receipt through 30 days after final investigational product dosing 10. Receipt of any live virus vaccine (excluding rotavirus vaccine) within 28 days prior to randomization or expected receipt within a 28day window around any dose 11. Receipt of any inactivated (eg, nonlive) vaccine or rotavirus vaccine within 14 days prior to randomization or expected receipt within a 14day window around any dose 12. Known or suspected immunodeficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus 13. Living in the same home or enrolled in the same classroom at day care with infants &lt; 24 months of age within 28 days after each dose (only one child per household may be enrolled into the study) 14. Contact with pregnant caregiver within 28 days after each dose 15. Household contact with an immunocompromised person within 28 days after each dose; the participant should also avoid close contact with immunocompromised individuals for at least 28 days after each investigational product dose 16. Household contact within 28 days after each dose with a healthcare worker who has direct patient care responsibilities or household contact within 28 days after each dose with someone who is a day care provider or preschool teacher for children &lt; 24 months of age 17. History of allergic reaction to any component of the investigational product 18. Previous medical history or evidence of an intercurrent or chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the participant 19. Known or suspected active or chronic hepatitis infection 20. History of medical diagnosis of asthma, reactive airway disease, wheezing requiring medication, bronchoconstriction or treatment with a β2 agonist (eg, albuterol), cystic fibrosis, chronic lung disease of prematurity (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia), chronic pulmonary disease, medically confirmed apnea, hospitalization for respiratory illness or mechanical ventilation 21. A family member or a household contact who is an employee of the research center or otherwise involved with the conduct of the study 22. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with investigational product evaluation</criteria>
