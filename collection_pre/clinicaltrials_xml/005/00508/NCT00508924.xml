	<brief_summary>This is a phase II multi-centre study in 140 patients undergoing elective PCI to obtain the information on dose-response of argatroban in pharmacodynamic markers and to assess the anticoagulation, safety and efficacy of argatroban in reference to unfractionated heparin, in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Safety and Effectiveness of Three Doses of Argatroban as Anticoagulant in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II multi-centre study in Europe in patients with stable coronary artery disease or troponin negative unstable angina undergoing elective PCI, to obtain the information on the safety and effects on various pharmacodynamic markers, of three doses of argatroban in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin, and to assess the results of argatroban and unfractionated heparin, both used in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin, on clinical outcomes, adequacy of anticoagulation, various pharmacodynamic markers (approximately 35 patients per group).</detailed_description>
