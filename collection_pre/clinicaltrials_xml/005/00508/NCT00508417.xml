	<brief_summary>This study, conducted by the Malaria Research and Training Center at the Faculty of Medicine in Bamako and the NIAID will measure the frequency of occurrence of malaria in infants in Bancoumana, Mali. Information from the study will help in planning trials of malaria vaccines. Healthy children from 6 weeks to 6 months of age who live in the Bancoumana health area may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood tests. Participating children are visited at home for a total of about 17 visits to see if they are well. They come to the clinic every month during the 7-month study for a clinical evaluation, including a blood sample obtained by finger prick to test for malaria. Some of the blood collected may be stored and used for research. Children who become sick with malaria are treated for the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malaria Incidence in Infants in Bancoumana, Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational study to determine the burden of malaria in rural Malian infants. Infants will be identified during a village-wide census and at Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) visits. After obtaining community consent, eligible infants' parents will be invited to bring infants to the clinic for screening. Enrolled infants will receive a baseline evaluation and monthly visits during the rainy season at which times they will receive interim evaluations and heel, toe, or finger pricks for determinations of hemoglobin, thick and thin blood films, malaria antibody titers (at first and last visit for each transmission season), and hemoglobin typing at one visit. Study subjects will also receive a weekly home visit to determine if they are well or ill. If ill or febrile at any visit, or if they present to the clinic for an unscheduled visit, subjects will receive a history and physical examination, heel, toe, or finger pricks for determinations of hemoglobin, thick and thin blood films, filter paper blood collection and an RDT for malaria. Diagnosis and treatment of malaria will be performed according to Mali National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) guidelines. Diagnosis and treatment of other conditions will be performed as determined by the treating clinician.</detailed_description>
