	<criteria>V.1. Patients V.1.1. Diseases Hematological malignancies confirmed histologically and not rapidly progressing: AML in CR; ALL in CR; CML unresponsive/intolerant to Imatinib but not in blast crisis; Other myeloproliferative disorders not in blast crisis and not with extensive myelofibrosis; MDS with &lt; 5% blasts; Multiple myeloma; CLL; NonHodgkin's lymphoma (aggressive NHL should have chemosensitive disease); Hodgkin's disease. V.1.2. Clinical situations Theoretical indication for a standard allotransplant, but not feasible because: Age &gt; 55 yrs; Unacceptable end organ performance; Patient's refusal. Indication for a standard autotransplant: perform miniallotransplantation 26 months after standard autotransplant. V.1.3. Other inclusion criteria Male or female; fertile female patients must use a reliable contraception method; Age &lt; 75 yrs. Informed consent given by patient or his/her guardian if of minor age. V.1.4. Exclusion criteria Any condition not fulfilling inclusion criteria; HIV positive; Terminal organ failure, except for renal failure (dialysis acceptable); Uncontrolled infection, arrhythmia or hypertension; Previous radiation therapy precluding the use of 2 Gy TBI; HLAidentical donor. V.2. PBSC donors V.2.1. Inclusion criteria Related to the recipient (sibling, parent or child) or unrelated; Male or female; Weight &gt; 15 Kg (because of leukapheresis); Fulfills generally accepted criteria for allogeneic PBSC donation; Informed consent given by donor or his/her guardian if of minor age, as per donor center standard procedures. V.2.2. Exclusion criteria Any condition not fulfilling inclusion criteria; HIV positive; Unable to undergo leukapheresis because of poor vein access or other reasons. V.2.3. HLA matching Related or unrelated donors who have 12 HLA mismatches, as either : One antigenic mismatch at HLAA or B or C or DRB1 or DQB1 One allelic mismatch at HLAA or B or C or DRB1 or DQB1 Two allelic mismatches at HLAA or B or C or DRB1 or DQB1 One antigenic mismatch + 1 allelic mismatch at HLAA or B or C or DRB1 or DQB1. One antigenic mismatch at DQB1 and one other antigenic mismatch at HLAA or B or C or DRB1 V.3. Cord blood unit Banked cord blood units will be used if they fulfill the following criteria: No more than 2/6 HLA mismatches (antigenic mismatch at HLAA or HLAB or allelic mismatch at HLADRB1) &gt; 2.5 x 107 TNC/kg Standard validation by FACT/Netcord criteria.</criteria>
