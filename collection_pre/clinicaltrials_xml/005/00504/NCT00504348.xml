	<criteria>Experimental treatment group 1. Diagnosis of definite or probable polymyositis or dermatomyositis by criteria of Bohan et al, or of clinicallyamyopathic dermatomyositis by the definition proposed by Sontheimer et al 2. Highresolution CT findings consistent with interstitial pneumonitis, confirmed by a radiologist. If consolidation is the only abnormal findings, the patient must have pathologically documented evidence of interstitial pneumonitis of other histological type than cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (the patient could have more than one histological type including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) 3. Meet two or more of the following criteria (must include 1) 1. Serum KL6 above the upper normal limit 2. Presence of dyspnea on exertion (grade 2 on the Magnitude of Task component of the Mahler Modified Dyspnea Index 3. PaO2 of less than 80 mmHg while breathing ambient air at rest, not accompanied by abnormal increase of PaCO2 4. Vital capacity &lt; 80% predicted, or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide &lt; 65% predicted 5. Meet at least one of the following condition over the 12week period (84 days) prior to the initiation of the study drug Decrease in either % forced vital capacity or % diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 10% or more Worsening of interstitial pneumonitis findings by chest CT, confirmed by a radiologist 4. 16 to 74 years of age Historical control group 1.

Use of corticosteroids at doses equivalent to between 0.6 to 1.0mg/kg/day of prednisolone for 14 days or longer to treat interstitial pneumonitis on or after the day when the inclusion criteria (3) was met (up to two courses of pulse IV corticosteroid therapy within the first 28 days are allowed) 5. 16 to 74 years of age Experimental treatment group 1. Use of corticosteroids at doses equivalent to or higher than prednisolone 0.6mg/kg/day within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the initiation of the study drug 2. Use of immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids within 12 weeks (84 days) prior to the initiation of the study drug 3. Could not exclude the following conditions on clinical ground: druginduced pneumonitis, occupational lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, radiationinduced lung injury 4. Presence of endstage interstitial pneumonitis as identified on the basis of a vital capacity &lt; 45% predicted, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide &lt; 30% predicted, or lung CT with predominantly honeycombing appearance 5. Presence of pancreatitis 6. Presence of diabetes mellitus with the exception of glucocorticoidinduced one that is wellcontrolled (HbA1c &lt; 6.5%) 7. Serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL or above 8. Presence of liver dysfunction (AST(GOT) or ALT (GPT) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) with the exception of the one that is considered to be due to myositis and is accompanied by the elevation of muscle enzymes above the upper limit of normal 9. Serum potassium above the upper limit of normal 10. Presence of ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia requiring treatment, congestive heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension requiring treatment 11. Presence or history of malignancy with the exception of those without relapse off treatment for 5 years or longer 12. Presence of serious active infection 13. Presence of active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection 14. History of severe drug hypersensitivity reaction 15. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or patients who intend to or whose spouses intend to conceive during the course of the study, including the followup period 16. Participation in another clinical trial or postmarketing clinical study within 26 weeks (182 days) prior to screening 17. Other medical condition which, in the investigator`s judgment, may be associated with increased risk to the subject or may interfere with study assessments or outcomes Historical control group 1. Use of immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids within 12 weeks (84 days) prior to or 2 weeks (14 days) after the corticosteroid treatment as defined by the inclusion criteria (4) is initiated 2. Could not exclude the following conditions on clinical ground: druginduced pneumonitis, occupational lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, radiationinduced lung injury 3.
