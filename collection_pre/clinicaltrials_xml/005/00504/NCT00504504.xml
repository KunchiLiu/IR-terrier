	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To determine the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of Rituximab with standard dose ABVD combination chemotherapy. ABVD combination chemotherapy consists of Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine and DTIC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab and ABVD for Hodgkin's Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before treatment starts, patients will have a physical exam. Bone marrow samples will be taken. Blood samples (4 to 8 tablespoons) will be taken before and during the study. A chest x-ray, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, and a gallium scan will be done if necessary. Patients in this study will receive rituximab by vein over 3 to 8 hours weekly for 6 weeks in a row. ABVD will be injected over 3 hours every other week for a total of 12 treatments. On the cycles where both rituximab and ABVD are given, rituximab will be given on day 1, and ABVD will be given on day 2. Response to therapy will be determined after 3 months and at the end of therapy (6 months). At the end, patients may receive radiation therapy to areas of large masses. All treatments can be given in an outpatient setting. Scans and x-rays will be repeated if needed after completion of therapy and every 3 months from then on. If tumors do not shrink after 3 months of therapy, patients will be offered a different treatment. This is an investigational study. Although ABVD is considered the standard treatment for patients with Hodgkin's disease, the combination of ABVD with rituximab is considered investigational. All drugs involved in this study are commercially available and are approved by the FDA. Up to 85 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson. This protocol is partially funded by a research grant from Genentech.</detailed_description>
