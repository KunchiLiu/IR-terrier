	<brief_summary>There is increasing evidence of the linkage of type 2 diabetes with low testosterone levels in men. Testosterone treatment has shown beneficial effects on blood sugar control and obesity in pilot studies in men with type 2 diabetes. Beneficial effects have also been seen on angina- a disease related to atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arterial blood vessels). Peripheral vascular disease is also caused by atherosclerosis. We hypothesise that testosterone will have beneficial effects on peripheral vascualr disease in men with low serum testosterone and type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
