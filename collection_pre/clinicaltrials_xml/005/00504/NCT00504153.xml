	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying dasatinib to see how well it works in treating patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed on or following two prior chemotherapy regimens and are then treated with dasatinib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with dasatinib. II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with dasatinib. III. Determine the toxicity in patients treated with dasatinib. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the incidence of somatic mutations in c-src, c-yes, fyn, lck, hck, lyn, yrk and csk in archival primary and metastatic colorectal cancer tissues from these patients and to correlate this with clinical outcome. II. Determine the incidence of total c-src and phosphorylated c-src expression in archival primary and metastatic colorectal cancer specimens from these patients, and to correlate this with clinical outcome. III. Evaluate the effect of dasatinib on serum VEGF levels. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood is collected on days 1 (prior to the first dose of dasatinib) and 15 of course 1 for measurement of VEGF pre-and post-dasatinib administration. Archived tumor tissue (tumor or core biopsy; primary or metastatic lesion) is collected for identification of the incidence of somatic mutations and polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis and for measurement of total c-src and phosphorylated src expression by immunohistochemistry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
