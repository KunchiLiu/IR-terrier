	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: SB939 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SB939 in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SB939 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the recommended phase II dose of oral SB939 in patients with solid tumors. Secondary - To determine the toxic effects of SB939 and its association with dose and pharmacokinetics. - To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of SB939. - To assess preliminary evidence of antitumor effects of SB939 in patients with measurable disease as documented by objective response. - To establish proof-of-principle for SB939 effects on histone acetylation by evaluation of histone acetylation and other biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at all dose levels. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral SB939 once daily on days 1-5 and 15-19. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Samples are analyzed for levels of SB939 via LC-MS/MS method and levels of acetylated histone 3 (AcH3), target effect, downstream consequences, and tumor response via western blot, immunohistochemistry, or ELISA methods. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
