	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if a new drug called ranibizumab is effective to treat a rare bilateral disease of the macula: type 2 idiopathic macular telangiectasia (type 2 IMT). 10 patients will receive monthly injections of the drug into one eye over a period of one year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab to Treat Type 2 Idiopathic Macular Telangiectasia (RAMA-Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 idiopathic macular telangiectasia (type 2 IMT) is a retinal disease of unknown etiology that commonly presents with a slow decrease in visual acuity, reading difficulties and metamorphopsia in the fifth to seventh decade. Diagnosis is based on fluorescein angiography which typically reveals parafoveal leakage in the late phase and may show telangiectatic capillaries in the early phase. In a subset of patients, a proliferative stage with secondary neovascularizations may develop late in the disease course. In the past, there has been no effective treatment for the disease stages without neovascularization. Recent studies in a limited number of patients with nonproliferative disease have shown promising results after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, an antagonist targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab resulted in a decrease of parafoveal leakage in fluorescein angiography and a decrease in retinal thickness. An increase in visual acuity was reported in a subset of patients. The RAMA-Trial is initiated in order to investigate the effect of a ranibizumab. The safety and tolerability of this VEGF-antagonist has been extensively studied in large cohorts of patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration. Patients with type 2 IMT will receive monthly injections over a period of one year. The above mentioned outcome measures will be assessed.</detailed_description>
