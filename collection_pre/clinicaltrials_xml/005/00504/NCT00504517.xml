	<brief_summary>We would like to better understand how different educational strategies may influence the practice of family medicine. More specifically, we are interested in participant satisfaction with the educational program, participant retainment in this career, and to see if the curricular change better prepares participants for contemporary clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preparing the Personal Physician for Practice (P4)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2004, the Future of Family Medicine report called for implementation of innovative strategies in residency education, allowing translational key insights from the national demonstration project toward new approaches to family medicine training. Taking full advantage of the P4 Project will require careful evaluation planning and implementation. A comprehensive evaluation plan for the P4 Project will be implemented by a core evaluation team that will interact with site-specific evaluators. The P4 evaluation program represents an observational case series assessment of selected residency programs. It is not an intervention trial; rather each residency program will systematically enroll cohorts of learners who will be exposed to curricular content and learning approaches that will likely be innovative and unique. In the absence of a rigorous study design, core data elements should be obtained from each program including: learner characteristics, program characteristics, and both nationally available data and targeted validated instruments that can link specific educational interventions to learners knowledge, attitudes and skills.</detailed_description>
