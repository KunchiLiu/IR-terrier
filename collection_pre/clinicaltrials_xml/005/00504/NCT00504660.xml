	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of 6-Thioguanine, Xeloda (capecitabine), and Celebrex (celecoxib) with Temodar (temozolomide) or Lomustine (CCNU) is effective in the treatment of recurrent or progressive anaplastic glioma or glioblastoma multiforme in patients who have failed previous treatments. The safety of these combination treatment will also be studied. Objectives: 1.1 To determine the efficacy, as measured by 12 month progression-free survival, of TEMOZOLOMIDE or CCNU with 6-THIOGUANINE followed by CAPECITABINE and CELECOXIB in the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or progressive anaplastic gliomas or glioblastoma multiforme. 1.2 To determine the long-term toxicity of TEMOZOLOMIDE or CCNU with 6-THIOGUANINE followed by CAPECITABINE and CELECOXIB in recurrent anaplastic glioma or glioblastoma multiforme patients treated in this manner. 1.3 To determine the clinical relevance of genetic subtyping tumors as a predictor of response to this chemotherapy and long term survival</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Capecitabine is a drug that damages the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of tumor cells and blocks the function of DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid) of tumor cells. These actions help to kill the tumor cells. Celecoxib is a drug that may help to prevent the development of some types of cancer by blocking a type of enzyme (COX-2) that is found in tumor cells. Temozolomide and CCNU are the current standard treatment for malignant brain tumors. Both drugs work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of tumor cells to kill these tumor cells. 6-Thioguanine is a drug that helps to increase the effects of Temozolomide and CCNU on tumor cells. Depending on the previous treatment you have received, you will be treated according to Arms 1, 2, or 3. If you have not received temozolomide before, you will be treated on Arm 1. If you have received temozolomide before but only during radiation therapy and not as chemotherapy afterwards and the treatment was over 6 months ago, you will be treated with temozolomide according to Arm 1. If you have not received lomustine or carmustine, you will be treated on Arm 2. If you have received Gliadel wafers at surgery greater than 6 months ago and have not been treated with lomustine or carmustine, you will be treated with CCNU according to Arm 2. Arm 3 will include glioblastoma multiforme patients who may be treated with either temozolomide or lomustine according to the above guidelines and regimens described in Arms 1 and 2. Arm 1: Treatment will begin with 6-thioguanine taken by mouth 4 times a day (every 6 hours) for 3 days in a row (Days 1-3). This will be followed by temozolomide taken by mouth at bedtime for 5 days in a row (Days 4-8). After a rest period of 6 days, capecitabine and celecoxib will be taken by mouth twice a day (12 hours apart) for 14 days (Days 14-27). Each cycle of treatment on arm 1 will be 28 days. Arm 2: Treatment will begin with 6-thioguanine taken by mouth 4 times a day (every 6 hours) for 3 days in a row (Days 1-3). This will be followed by lomustine taken by mouth at bedtime for 1 day (Day 4). After a rest period of 1 week, capecitabine and celecoxib will be taken by mouth twice a day (12 hours apart) for 14 days (Days 11-24). Each cycle of treatment on arm 2 will take 42 days. Blood tests (less than 2 teaspoons) will be repeated every 2 weeks and before each new cycle of treatment (a total of about 2 tablespoons). The neurological exam, anticonvulsant level blood tests and the stool test for blood, will be repeated before every cycle on Arms 2 and 3 (CCNU) and before every 2 cycles on Arms 1 and 3 (temozolomide). Kidney function will be evaluated from the blood tests before every other course. Patients taking anticoagulants (coumadin, warfarin) will have procedures to test the clotting ability of the blood before each cycle or more frequently if the doctor feels it is necessary. Arm 3: Glioblastoma Multiforme patients will be treated on Arm 3 which will include the drug regimen from either Arm 1 or Arm 2. Treatment on all arms will continue for 1 year as long as the tumor does not grow and any side effects are tolerable. Treatment may continue beyond one year if your doctor feels it is needed. During the study, you may not receive any other investigational drug or have any other treatment for the cancer, including surgery. This is an investigational study. All drugs used in this study are FDA approved and are commercially available. A total of 140 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital. 2. Patients with histologically proven supratentorial anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytomas anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastoma multiforme. 3. Patients must have unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI scan performed within 14 days prior to enrollment or documented recurrence by tumor resection. Patients must have received radiation therapy previously. 4. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as all the following conditions are met: a) Patients have recovered from the effects of surgery; b) Extent of residual disease (if present) has been documented by MRI performed no later than 72 hours after surgery or, if not possible, at least 4 weeks postoperative.
