	<brief_summary>A non-inferiority randomized control trial in treatment naïve HIV patients to compare virologic effect of two backbone regimens with Epzicom (lamivudine and abacavir) and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir). Both arms are treated with fixed combination of ritonavir boosted atazanavir as key drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Epzicom and Truvada for the Initial Once Daily HIV Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In treatment naïve HIV-1-infected patients, once daily combination antiretroviral therapy containing ritonavir boosted atazanavir combined with Epzicom will offer non inferior antiretroviral efficacy compared to ritonavir boosted atazanavir combined with Truvada. This non inferiority hypothesis is studied by a randomized, open label, multicenter trial over 48 weeks as the primary endpoint and long term safety of both arms are followed for 144 weeks. The primary endpoint is the antiretroviral effect over 48 weeks. The secondary endpoints are; 1. The immunologic effects from baseline at the 48th and 144th week 2. Reasons of treatment failure by 144th week 3. Adverse events and their rate of incidence by 144th week 4. Serum concentration of tenofovir in selected patients 5. Serum concentration of atazanavir in selected patients 6. Renal complication in tenofovir arm</detailed_description>
