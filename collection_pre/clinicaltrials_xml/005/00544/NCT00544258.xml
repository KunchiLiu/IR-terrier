	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate the Extent of Systemic Absorption of PEP005</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses (AK) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches or sores on the top layer of the skin which if left untreated can progress to skin cancer. Current treatments can cause scarring and hypopigmentation, be inconvenient, or require long treatment duration. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of AK lesions is thus being researched.</detailed_description>
