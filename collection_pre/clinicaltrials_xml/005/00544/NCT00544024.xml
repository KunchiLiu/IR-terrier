	<brief_title>Mefloquine Bioequivalence Among 3 Commercially Available Tablets.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for mefloquine in whole blood from Peruvian subjects with uncomplicated falciparum malaria administered Mephaquin®, Mefloquine-AC Farma, and Lariam®. The Mefloquine-AC Farma arm comprised 13 patients while the reference (Lariam) and Mephaquin arms consisted of 12 patients. Although Cmax was significantly less (p=0.04) in the Mephaquin arm (AUC0-t = 2500 ng/ml/day) relative to the reference (AUC0-t = 2820 ng/ml/day) arm, there were no significant differences in the AUC∞, tmax, and t1/2 for Mefloquine-AC Farma or Mephaquin relative to the reference. Except for the Cmax of the Mefloquine-AC Farma, the 90% confidence intervals for all parameters of both treatments were outside the specified FDA range of 80-125%. Therefore both formulations were not considered bioequivalent to the reference.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria for enrolling patients included; male or nonpregnant female ≥ 18 years of age, infection with P. falciparum alone, with a parasite density between 250 and 50,000 asexual parasites/mm3 as determined by microscopic examination of a thick blood smear, informed consent from patient, and a willingness to be hospitalized for the first 24 hours after therapy is initiated and to return for followup visits through day 56. Patients exhibiting evidence of severe malaria or with a history of an underlying chronic disease or illness that could interfere with the absorption of MQ, a history of hypersensitivity to MQ, or a history of neuropsychiatric illness or cardiac conduction problems were excluded.</criteria>
