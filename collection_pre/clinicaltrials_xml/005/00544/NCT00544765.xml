	<brief_summary>Primary objective of the study in patients without a sufficient sonographic response (i.e. iNC) to 2 cycles of TAC as preoperative treatment of operable (T&gt;/= 2cm, N0-2,M0) primary breast cancer: To determine the response rate determined by sonography (iRR = iCR+iPR) of further 4 cycles of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and of 4 cycles of vinorelbine and capecitabine (NX) (TAC vs. NX) Primary objective of the study in patients with a sufficient sonographic response (i.e. iRR = iPR or iCR) to the first 2 cycles of TAC as preoperative treatment of operable (T&gt;/=2cm, N0-2,M0) primary breast cancer: To determine the pCR rate of 6 cycles vs. 8 cycles of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC x 6 vs. TAC x 8)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel, Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Versus Vinorelbine and Capecitabine in Patients Not Sufficiently / Sufficiently Responding as Preoperative Treatment of Locally Advanced or Operable Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized phase III trial Study population I: operable (T&gt;/=2cm, N0-2,M0) primary breast cancer Study population II: locally advanced (T4 a-d, N0-3,M0) primary breast cancer patients All patients will receive 2 cycles of TAC. Thereafter - Patients sufficiently responding (iPR, iCR) will be randomized to either 4 further cycles of TAC or 6 further cycles of TAC - Patients non-sufficiently responding (iNC) will be randomized to either 4 further cycles of TAC or 4 cycles of NX: TAC: Docetaxel 75 mg/m² as a 1 hour i.v. infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with Doxorubicin 50 mg/m² as an i.v. bolus and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks NX: Vinorelbine 25 mg/m² as a 10 min i.v. infusion on days 1 and 8 repeated every 3 weeks and Capecitabine 2000 mg/m² orally in 2 daily doses on days 1-14 repeated every 3 weeks If a patient shows progressive disease during the first 2 cycles of TAC she will not be randomized and will be treated according to the discretion of the investigator. In patients with disease progression during further preoperative therapy, the treatment should be discontinued and patients should be treated by immediate surgery. In case of inoperability even after termination of chemotherapy further treatment is to the discretion of the investigator (e.g. radiotherapy). Dose reduction and/or treatment delay and treatment discontinuation are planned in case of severe hematological and/or non-hematological toxicities. After completion of chemotherapy and assessment of response, all patients should undergo surgery. Surgery should be performed 1-14 days after completion (i.e. day 21) of the last chemotherapy cycle. If the tumor is still too large for breast conservation, modified radical mastectomy is recommended. The patient can be offered autologous or heterologous reconstructive surgery. Sentinel node biopsy is allowed to be the only dissected axillary lymph node in patients with a pathological complete response and non involved sentinel node. Surgical reports will be collected and analyzed centrally. The excised breast tissue should be examined by the pathologist according to guidelines given in the appendix. Histology reports will be collected and analyzed centrally. Radiotherapy should be applied according to guidelines. Further postoperative systemic treatment is not planned except tamoxifen 20 mg p.o. daily for 5 years (starting after surgery) to patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors unless there is a contraindication for the use of tamoxifen therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained and documented according to the local regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures. Complete baseline documentation sent to SKM CRS. Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by core biopsy. Fineneedle aspiration is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not allowed. In case of bilateral cancer the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint. Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt; 2 cm in maximum diameter. The leasion has to be measurable in twodimensions by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease the extent of inflammation can be used as measurable lesion. The following tumor stages are eligible: Palpable breast tumor size of &gt; 2 cm without involvement of the skin or muscle or evidence of inflammatory disease (T23). Clinical N02. (Study population I) Primary tumor with clinical involvement of skin or muscle or clinically evidence of inflammatory breast cancer (T4 ad) or clinical N3 including supraclavicular nodes. (Study population II). In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be measured. Age &gt; 18 years. Karnofsky Performance status index &gt; 80%. Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by LVEF or shortening fraction (echocardiography or MUGA scan respectively) within 3 months prior to registration. The result must be above the normal limit of the institution. Laboratory requirements (within 14 days prior to registration): Hematology: Neutrophils &gt; 2.0 x 109/L and Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L and Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL Hepatic function: Total bilirubin &lt; 1 x UNL and ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x UNL and Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 UNL. Patients with ASAT and/or ALAT &gt; 1.5 x UNL associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x UNL are not eligible for the study. Renal function: Creatinine &lt; 175 µmol/L (2 mg/dL) Tissue block centrally available for further biological tests.

All patients must have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound, breast MRI (optional), chest Xray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan, and bone scan.
