	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving fluorouracil and cisplatin together with cetuximab and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fluorouracil and cisplatin when given together with cetuximab and radiation therapy in treating patients with esophageal cancer that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of fluorouracil and cisplatin when administered with cetuximab concurrently with esophageal radiotherapy. (Phase I) - To determine the complete histological response rate (after surgical resection). (Phase II) Secondary - To determine progression-free survival and overall survival. (Phase II) - To determine the rate of resection with negative margins (R0). (Phase II) - To determine the overall tolerance to neoadjuvant therapy. (Phase II) - To determine the postoperative morbidity and mortality. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. This is a dose-escalation study of cisplatin and fluorouracil. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 2 hours on day -7, then IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 or 2 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, 22-25, and 29-32. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks, beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery within 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 month, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
