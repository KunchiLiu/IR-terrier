	<brief_summary>Recent studies have described the role of melatonin as a sleep regulator and as an anti- oxidative neuroprotective agent in improving sleep quality and delaying cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In accordance with this data, our hypothesis is that melatonin will delay the cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and reduce the conversion rate from MCI to AD.</brief_summary>
