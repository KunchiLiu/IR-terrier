	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage IIIb with pleural/pericardial effusion or Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Progression of disease after one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. (Systemic therapies given in the adjuvant setting are counted only if the patient relapses within 6 months of the last cycle of therapy.) In addition to the one prior chemotherapeutic regimen, patients may have received erlotinib in any setting. All patients must have measurable disease. No unstable or progressive brain metastases. Patients may have received prior radiation therapy but they must have recovered from all treatmentrelated toxicities. ECOG performance status 01 Adequate hematologic function Adequate liver and renal function Ability to swallow oral medication Prior chemotherapy regimen containing docetaxel. Active secondary malignancy. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: serious uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with the study requirements. Failure to recover from toxicities related to prior therapy (e.g., surgery, radiation, chemotherapy).</criteria>
