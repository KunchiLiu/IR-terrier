	<brief_summary>Bipolar disorder is a common and often chronic and debilitating mental illness. The depressive phase of bipolar disorder contributes the largest portion of the disorder, and treatment resistant bipolar depression represents a significant public health problem. Recent research has suggested that bipolar depression is associated with elevated brain glutamate activity. We hypothesize that riluzole, a drug approved for ALS which inhibits glutamate activity, will lead to clinical improvement in patients with bipolar depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Riluzole in the Treatment of Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that riluzole will lead to significant reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Additionally, improvement in depressive symptoms will be associated with reduced glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, but not parieto-occipital cortex, both at day two and day 42.</detailed_description>
