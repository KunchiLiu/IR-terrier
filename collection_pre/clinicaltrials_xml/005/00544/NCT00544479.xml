	<brief_summary>Most pulmonologist request a routine chest-x-ray after bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopasie to exclude pneumothorax. We published a study in CHEST showing that routine chest-ray might not be necessary. We would like to conduct a propsective study to validate the results of the CHEST-study. Before and after the procedure follwing information will be collected: Age, Sex, Indication for procedure, number of biopsies and segment of biopsie, Saturation, Physical examination, Symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. If there is no aggravation of the symptoms and/or physical examination after the procedure, as compared to before, routine chest-x-ray will NOT be done. A phone will be made 24 to 48 hours following the procedure to the patient.</brief_summary>
