	<brief_summary>The Optical Coherence Tomography is a minimally-invasive diagnostic tool in both the office and operating room settings can identify sources of airway obstruction and effective surgical interventions. The researcher can use Optical Coherence Tomography to image tissues of the aero-digestive tract during surgical endoscopy in to the nose, oral cavity, larynx and ear in an outpatient clinic setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Near Infrared Optical Coherence Tomography of the Upper Aero-Digestive Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Optical Coherence Tomography imaging system has low power non-laser broad band infrared light shine onto laryngeal, esophageal, tracheal, oral, nasal and ear tissue and does not involve input of significant amounts of energy and no temperature rise occurs. The gradual development and acceptance of Optical Coherence Tomography as an imaging modality serves as an alternative to invasive tissue biopsy as a diagnostic measure. Imaging diagnosis, can implement and more convenient than tissue biopsy and can reduce procedural complications.</detailed_description>
