	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab as maintenance therapy is more effective than observation in treating patients with colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying bevacizumab to see how well it works in treating patients who have undergone first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone First-Line Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To demonstrate that time to progression (TTP) without further treatment is not inferior to TTP with maintenance therapy comprising bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and stable or responding disease after completion of standard first-line chemotherapy/bevacizumab treatment. Secondary - To evaluate the safety of bevacizumab maintenance therapy in these patients. - To assess the long-term cost implications of prolonged treatment with bevacizumab. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to best response during first-line chemotherapy/bevacizumab treatment (complete response and partial response vs stable disease), duration of first-line treatment (16-20 weeks vs 21-24 weeks), type of chemotherapy used during first-line treatment (irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine vs oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine vs fluoropyrimidine monotherapy), disease burden (one organ with metastasis vs more than one organ with metastasis), and by participating center. - Arm I (bevacizumab maintenance therapy): Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (no maintenance therapy): Patients receive no further treatment; they are monitored for disease progression. After completion of study therapy or documentation of disease progression, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer Received prior firstline chemotherapy with oral or intravenous fluoropyrimidine alone or in combination with irinotecan or oxaliplatin Chemotherapy must have been given in combination with a standard dose of bevacizumab for 1624 weeks as part of firstline treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer Stable disease, partial response, or complete response after completion of firstline treatment as documented by abdominal and thoracic CT scan, MRI, or xray within the past 21 days No clinical symptoms or history of CNS metastases No imaging required in asymptomatic patients PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: WHO performance status 01 Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L Proteinuria &lt; 2+ by urine dipstick OR urine protein ≤ 1 g by 24hour urine collection Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 12 months after completion of study therapy Must have basic health insurance with a Swiss health insurance company Patients must be compliant and in geographic proximity to allow proper staging and followup No medical reason that prohibits further bevacizumab treatment, including any of the following: Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mm Hg) or clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease Serious nonhealing wound, active peptic ulcer, or nonhealing bone fracture History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within the past 6 months History or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding No serious underlying medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, could further impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (e.g., active autoimmune disease or uncontrolled diabetes) No psychiatric disorder that would preclude patient understanding of studyrelated topics or giving informed consent PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior bevacizumab No prior antiEGFR treatment (e.g., cetuximab) during firstline therapy No anticipation of concurrent major surgery (e.g., resection) or ablation of metastases No concurrent elective major surgery No concurrent daily aspirin exceeding 325 mg/day or clopidogrel exceeding 75 mg/day Lower doses of the drugs noted above, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs with activity on platelets and gastric mucosa, or dipyridamole are allowed if given at a stable dose for ≥ 2 weeks prior to study entry No other concurrent experimental drugs or anticancer therapy</criteria>
