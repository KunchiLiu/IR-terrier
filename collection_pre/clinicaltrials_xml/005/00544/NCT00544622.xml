	<brief_summary>Background/Aim of the study: To further reduce the 6 months stroke morbidity and mortality in a high volume stroke hospital and to compare the results with national and international data. Methods: 204 consecutive stroke patients are analyzed in a prospective study in a single center teaching institution. The intervention consists of a structured therapeutic chain of 290 collaborating GPs, a standardised acute hospital proceeding overlapping with an early integrated neurovascular rehabilitation within the same institution. Primary endpoints include death and dependence at 6 months, secondary endpoints are the length of hospital stay (LOS) and the quantitative analysis of physical and psychosocial impairments. The data are directly compared with the same endpoints of the Swiss subgroup of the international stroke trial (IST).</brief_summary>
