	<brief_summary>This is an open labeled phase II single arm trial. The patients with clinical stage II and III will undergo core-needle biopsy of breast tumor for histologic diagnosis, immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor(PR), HER-2/neu and others. PET or ultrasound results will determine the positivity of lymph node metastasis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must have histologically confirmed and newly diagnosed breast cancer: nodepositive stage IIA and any stage IIB, III. PET results will determine node positivity. If PET was not utilized, sonographically positive node should be confirmed cytologically by fine needle aspiration. No prior hormonal, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is allowed. No breast operation other than biopsy to make diagnosis is allowed. Age: 18years and older, not pregnant pre, and postmenopausal women with good performance status (ECOG 01) Adequate hematopoietic function: Absolute granulocyte count ³1500/mm3, platelet ³100,000/mm3, Hemoglobin ³ 10 g/mm3 Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine £ 1.5 mg/dl Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin: £ 1.5 mg/dl, AST/ALT: £ two times normal, Alkaline phosphatase: £ two times normal Adequate cardiac function: normal or nonspecific EKG taken within 1 mo of enrollment Adequate mental function to understand and sign the consent Patients who received hormonal, chemotherapy or radiotherapy for breast cancer Patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer Patients with nodenegative stage IIA breast cancer Patients who have history of cancer other than in situ uterine cervix cancer or nonmelanotic skin cancer</criteria>
