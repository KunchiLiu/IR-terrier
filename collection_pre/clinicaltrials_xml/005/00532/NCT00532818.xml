	<brief_summary>The current standard for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer is palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin topotecan, however, the results need to be improved. Epigenetic aberrations play an important role in cancer progression by silencing growth regulatory genes and there is now evidence that inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDAC inhibition synergize the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. Objective. To determine the superiority of epigenetic therapy with hydralazine and valproate plus standard cisplatin topotecan against placebo plus cisplatin topotecan upon progression-free survival. Hypothesis. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate associated to cisplatin topotecan will increase progression-free survival from 4.6 to 7.6 months as compared with the same regimen of chemotherapy plus placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized, double-blind phase III trial. A total of 143 patients (alpha 0.5, power 0.8)with metastatic, persistent or recurrent cervical cancer without previous systemic treatment will be randomized to cisplatin topotecan + placebo or cisplatin topotecan hydralazine valproate for 6 courses every 3 weeks. Patients will receive an oral dose of hydralazine of 182mg (rapid) or 83mg (slow) according to the acetylator phenotype in a single daily dose and magnesium valproate at an oral dose of 40mg/Kg t.i.d. Both drugs in a slow-release formulation. Experimental drugs or placebo will start from seven days before day 1 of chemotherapy until the end of the sixth course.</detailed_description>
