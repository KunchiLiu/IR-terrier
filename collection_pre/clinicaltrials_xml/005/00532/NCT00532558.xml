	<brief_title>Efficacy of Lapaquistat Acetate on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Treating Subjects With Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to determine the potential of lapaquistat acetate 50 mg per day to lower LDL-C levels compared with placebo. This study is also being conducted to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of lapaquistat acetate 50 mg over a period of 12 weeks. An optional, 48-week, open-label extension will follow the 12 week, double-blind treatment period to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of lapaquistat acetate 50 mg/day.</detailed_description>
