	<brief_summary>Primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on time to progression after tamoxifen treatment in pre- or postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, we will evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on clinical benefit and response duration to tamoxifen administration in pre- or postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer and also evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on the steady state plasma concentration of tamoxifen and its metabolites</brief_summary>
