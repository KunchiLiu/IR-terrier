	<brief_summary>Treatment with peginterferon plus daily low dose (800 mg) or weight-based ribavirin (800-1400 mg) for 24 to 48 weeks has achieved 70-93% sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with genotype 2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Recently, a large randomized study has shown that patients with genotype 2 or 3 CHC have comparable SVR rates for those who received peginterferon for 24 or 48 weeks, and who received daily low dose (800 mg) or standard dose (1000-1200 mg) ribavirin. Therefore, the currently recommended treatment for these patients is 24 weeks of peginterferon plus low dose ribavirin. Because of the high response rates, several studies have shown that when these patients had rapid virologic response (RVR), defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels, at week 4 of peginterferon plus weight-based ribavirin, 12-16 weeks of treatment could have 82-94% SVR rates. However, treatment with peginterferon plus low dose ribavirin for 24 weeks showed significantly higher SVR rates than that for 16 weeks (85% versus 79%) in these patients who achieved RVR. While studies showed concordant results in SVR rates for patients with genotype 3 CHC who received peginterferon plus low dose or weight-based ribavirin for 16 or 24 weeks, the SVR rates stratified by RVR showed great differences in patients with genotype 2 CHC who received such treatment. Currently, there are no studies on the direct comparison of low dose versus weight-based ribavirin, and of 16 to 24 weeks of treatment stratified by RVR for patients with genotype 2 CHC. The investigators aimed to conduct a randomized trial to determine the optimal ribavirin dose and treatment duration of peginterferon plus ribavirin for patients with genotype 2 CHC based on RVR studies.</brief_summary>
