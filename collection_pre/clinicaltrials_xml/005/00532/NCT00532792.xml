	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A maximum of 500 eligible subjects in 10 groups will be enrolled, randomized and vaccinated in this study. Subjects will receive an intramuscular injection of either the influenza A/H5N1 (low, medium or high dose) or placebo on Day 0 and Day 21 with or without a patch. This study will be performed in two parts. In Part 1, an initial safety evaluation will be performed in 100 randomized subjects. A Safety Review Committee (SRC)will review all safety data, including laboratory values, through the Day 7 visit, and compare those data against Stopping Criteria. If the treatments are considered safe, Part 2 of the study will be initiated and a second vaccination will be administered to subjects in Part 1 on Day 21. In Part 2, the remaining 400 subjects will be randomized, treated, and will follow the same visit structure and protocol-defined requirements as subjects in Part 1, without the additional laboratory safety measurements. An SRC review will also be performed of all safety data through the Day 28 visit for subjects participating in Part 1.</brief_summary>
