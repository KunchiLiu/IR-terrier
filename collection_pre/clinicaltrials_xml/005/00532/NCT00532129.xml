	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the safety and effect on response rate of a combination of rituximab and chlorambucil in previously untreated participants with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Participants will receive 6 monthly cycles of combination treatment, followed by up to 6 cycles of chlorambucil alone. Rituximab will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle, at a dose of 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenously (IV) in Cycle 1, and 500 mg/m^2 in subsequent cycles, and chlorambucil will be administered on Days 1-7 of each cycle at a dose of 10 mg/m^2/day per oral (PO).</brief_summary>
