	<brief_summary>The ROVO study is a prospective, placebocontrolled and randomised study designed to evaluate the effect of radial optic neurotomy in central vein occlusion, versus triamcinolone acetonide. 240 patients with a visual acuity &lt; 0.5 Snellen will be randomised. Patients are treated with either RON, or a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide, or a placebo treatment - a "sham" injection of intravitreal triamcinolone. Patients will be examined regularly over a period of one year. Best corrected visual acuity for far and near, as well as clinical examinations, fluorescein- and indocyanine green angiograms, optical coherence tomography, and perimetry, are performed pre- and postoperatively.</brief_summary>
