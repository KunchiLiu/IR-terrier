	<brief_summary>Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a common dermatological disorder, manifested as scaly nodules which appear mainly on the extensor surfaces of the limbs. PN may appear secondarily to skin scratching in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, uremia, hypothyroidism etc. Nevertheless, in many cases no underlying physical disease is present. According to the literature, in fifty percent of the patients there is co-morbidity with depression, anxiety or somatoform disorders. We hypothesize that a group of these patients may benefit from antidepressant therapy.</brief_summary>
