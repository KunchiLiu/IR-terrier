	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate overall survival improvement for aflibercept + docetaxel compared to docetaxel + placebo as second line treatment for participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The secondary objectives were to compare other efficacy parameters, to assess the overall safety of the two treatment arms, to assess the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) aflibercept in this participant population and to determine immunogenicity of IV aflibercept in all participants.</brief_summary>
