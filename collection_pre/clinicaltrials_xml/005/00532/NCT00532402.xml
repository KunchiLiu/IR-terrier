	<brief_summary>This study should compare the propofol concentration in breathing gas and in plasma (before and) after lung passage. Propofol concentrations in breathing gas are continuously measured by a sensor. For comparison a discontinuous method is used. Neurophysiologic parameters for determination of depth of anesthesia are compared to the continuous measured propofol concentration in breathing gas. Study hypothesis: continuous measured propofol concentration in breathing gas correlates to propofol concentration in plasma and depth of anaesthesia.</brief_summary>
