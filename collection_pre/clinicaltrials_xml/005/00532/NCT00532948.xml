	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the maximum tolerated dose, and dose-limiting toxicities, of Xeloda administered concurrently with radiation therapy, in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic brain stem gliomas and high grade gliomas. Xeloda will be administered twice daily, at a starting dose of 500mg/m2 bid, beginning within 24 hours of the start of radiation therapy. Subsequent dose escalations will be in increments of 30%, using a standard dose escalation schema. Post-radiation therapy with Xeloda will continue after a 2 week break. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size will not exceed 30 evaluable patients.</brief_summary>
