	<brief_title>Study Assessing the Effect of Transpapillary Pancreas Duct Stent in Resection of the Pancreatic Tail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resection of the pancreatic tail is fraught with fistula or leakage of pancreatic enzymes to varying degrees between 13-64%, depending upon which definition one uses. The "downstream" control of the pancreatic duct with the help of a transpapillary stent might minimize the risk for leakage over the transected pancreas surface. Trial evaluation will be A. The pancreatic bed was drained and postoperatively the fluid was continuously collected and daily analysed for pancreatic amylase and bilirubin. Daily measurement of pancreatic enzyme content in the drain fluid, at least for 5 post operative days or as long as the patient retains the drain. X-Amylase and X-Protein as long as the patient has the external drain. B. Co-variables measured in the form of: operation time, complications in relation to diagnosis, duration of hospitalization. Patients receiving a pancreas stent are followed in order to evaluate the natural course of the pancreas stent.</detailed_description>
