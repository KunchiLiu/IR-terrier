	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the cardiovascular risk involved in the exertional exercise of marathon running. The researchers aim to investigate the beneficial effects of regular well-dosed exercise on health and compare these findings with the effects of the extreme strains of marathon running. Subclinical injuries to heart and arteries are being investigated in different groups of runners, including obese participants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Regular exercise leads to an improvement of cardiovascular risc factors in patients with coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. Aerobic exercise has anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the exertional exercise of marathon running causes an acute pro-inflammatory impulse. This may lead to myocardial injury and, in case of preexisting plaques, may result in plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction. The researchers aim to define the critical role of inflammatory markers and cardiovascular risk factors as a predictor of an increased risk for myocardial and endothelial dysfunction in marathon runners. The study groups are divided into average trained runners (40 km/week), average trained obese runners and highly trained runners (&gt; 70km/week). Training programmes are supervised by professional coaches. Individual scientific marathon contests are organized for the assessments. Diagnostic tools include measurements of pulse wave velocity and heart rate turbulence, echocardiography and, for the first time, MRI-scans pre- and post marathon running. Additionally, cardiovascular markers such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)and adiponectin are measured. Inflammatory markers include c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins and tumor necrosis factor.</detailed_description>
