	<brief_summary>GSK233705 is being developed for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This will be an open-label, dose-ascending study in 7 healthy male subjects to establish well tolerated intravenous doses and an oral dose of GSK233705. The main objective of the study is to confirm an IV and oral dose for a definitive human radiolabel metabolic study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male subjects; Between the ages of 1855 years, inclusive Body mass index within the range 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2. Nonsmokers Adequate venous access for intermittent cannulation A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject The subject is capable of giving informed consent Available to complete the study Any clinically important abnormality identified in the following: at the screening medical assessment A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, the QTc(B) of the 3 screening ECGs are not within 10% of the mean, a PR interval outside the range 90210msec or an ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg at screening. A mean heart rate outside the range of 4090 bpm at screening. History of use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months of screening or a positive cotinine test at screening. The subject has donated a unit (400ml) of blood within 60 days of screening, or, intends to donate during the study. The subject is currently taking regular (or course of) medication, whether prescribed or not, including herbal remedies such as St John's Wort. The subject has taken: prescription medications within the past 2 weeks prior to dosing, or OTC medications (except simple analgesics) within 48 hours prior to dosing, unless it is judged by the Investigator not to compromise their safety or influence the outcome of the study. The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity within a period of 3 months prior to dosing.
