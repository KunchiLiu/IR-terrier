	<brief_title>Pain Quantification and Pain Management in Interventional Radiology (IR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the IR procedure, nurses commonly ask patients to tell them what their pain level is on a 0-10 scale. For those who participate in the study, these numbers will be used to calculate average pain levels. Study participants will be asked to complete the same 0-10 pain scale during the recovery period until time of discharge or admission to the hospital. According to standard criteria when giving conscious sedation, patients will remain in a communicable state throughout the procedure and during the recovery period prior to discharge, and thus, will be able to express a pain level during these times. The same questionnaire will be given for seven days after the procedure, which will be completed on a self-addressed, stamped postcard to be mailed back to UTMDACC. The last postcard will have a couple of questions about patient satisfaction. Once the last postcard is mailed in, the patient's participation in the study is over. Each questionnaire should take less than 5 minutes to complete. This is an investigational study. About 374 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.</detailed_description>
