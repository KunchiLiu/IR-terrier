	<brief_summary>The purpose is to assess accuracy of digital retinal image interpretation by technicians and direct ophthalmoscopy by nurses for the determination of diabetic retinopathy severity and the presence of diabetic macular edema for the identification of referrals to ophthalmologists. The results of both screening methods were compared with comprehensive eye examination by ophthalmologists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema Screening by Non-Physicians With Limited Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic visual disabilities have increasingly become a global concern since a number of diabetic patients are expected to surge dramatically in the coming decade. Essential means to minimize this problem are detecting vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy early in the course of disease and timely interventions by ophthalmologists. The American Diabetes Association had issued a guideline for the detection and recommended regular comprehensive eye examination as a preferred method. However, it is not likely that there will be ophthalmologists enough to comprehensively examine the surging number of diabetic patients. Other practical screening methods, such as an interpretation of digital retinal images or direct ophthalmoscopy employed by other health care providers, for identifying the retinopathy for referral to ophthalmologists, should minimize this problem.</detailed_description>
