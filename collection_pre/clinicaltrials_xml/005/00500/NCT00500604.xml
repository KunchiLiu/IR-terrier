	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300/25mg against valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 160/25mg in reducing mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) as measured by home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) after 24 weeks compared with baseline. The secondary objectives are: - To compare the percentage of patients with normal blood pressure as measured by HBPM and at the doctor's office at weeks 16 and 24 - To compare the differences in mean Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), mean morning and evening SBP and DBP evaluated by HBPM at weeks 16 and 24 - To compare the difference in mean SBP evaluated by HBPM at week 16 - To compare the differences in mean SBP and DBP evaluated at the doctor's office at weeks 16 and 24 - To determine the incidence and severity of adverse events</brief_summary>
