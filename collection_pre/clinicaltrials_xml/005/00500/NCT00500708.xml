	<brief_summary>Heart failure (HF) affects 5 million Americans, with 500,000 new cases diagnosed and 250,000 deaths each year. The two major causes of morbidity and mortality in HF are pump failure and sudden, lethal ventricular arrhythmias, the latter of which accounts for 40-50% of HF deaths. Arrhythmias may be precipitated by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Establishing increased risk for arrhythmias before a severe life-threatening event is critically important. However, this remains a significant medical challenge. Several genetic mutations associated with rare, inherited arrhythmia disorders have been identified. The aim of this study is to identify novel genetic and other biological markers that distinguish patients at increased risk for lethal ventricular arrhythmias in a broader population.</brief_summary>
