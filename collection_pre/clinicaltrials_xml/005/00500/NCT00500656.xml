	<brief_summary>Primary Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint was the time to onset of symptom relief of the first attack in the double blind phase. H0: λ icatibant/λ tranexamic acid =1 versus H1: λ icatibant/λ tranexamic acid ≠1 Where: λ icatibant refers to the hazard rate under icatibant and λ tranexamic acid refers to the hazard rate under tranexamic acid. Secondary Outcome Measures: - Additional efficacy assessments (Time to Almost Complete Symptom Relief) - Safety and tolerability - Pharmacoeconomics</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Treatment With Icatibant for Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase III, randomised, double blind, double dummy, multicentre, controlled,parallel group study of a 30 mg s.c. formulation of icatibant for the treatment of patients with moderate to very severe symptoms of cutaneous and/or abdominal symptoms of HAE. The study consisted of two parts: controlled phase and OLE phase. For the primary endpoint, Efficacy was determined by evaluating the differences in study outcomes using a Visual Analogue Scale for patients treated with icatibant and tranexamic acid.</detailed_description>
