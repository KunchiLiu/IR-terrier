	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Subjects with a documented diagnosis of T2DM and have an HbA1c level at Visit 1 of ≥7.0% and ≤9.5% as measured by a central laboratory. Subjects with HbA1c &lt;7.5% must have a fasting fingerstick glucose ≥7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) at Week 0 prior to randomization. Subjects who are treatmentnaïve and have not taken insulin, or any oral or injectable antidiabetic medication in the past 3 months and have not taken a glucose lowering agent for ≥4 weeks at any time in the past, or Subjects who are newly diagnosed and treated with diet and exercise for a minimum of 6 weeks Subjects who are 18 to 70 years of age inclusive at the time of Screening. Females of nonchildbearing and childbearing potential are eligible to participate as follows: Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use one of the following contraception methods: intrauterine device, condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent for at least 30 days prior to the start of study medication, throughout the study and the followup visit. Note: use of oral contraceptives is not permitted. Women of nonchild bearing potential are defined as follows: females regardless of age, with functioning ovaries and who have a current documented tubal ligation [Hatcher, 2004] bilateral oophorectomy or total hysterectomy, or females who are postmenopausal). (Postmenopausal is defined as after one year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy. In addition to the above criteria, if the postmenopausal status is still questionable, a blood sample should be drawn for simultaneous measurement of follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol; values considered to confirm the postmenopausal state are respectively: FSH &gt;40 MIU/mL and estradiol &lt;40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L)). Informed Consent: a signed and dated written consent must be obtained from the subject before any procedures are performed. Metabolic Disease Diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. History of ketoacidosis which has required hospitalization. Thyroid disorder [TSH below the lower limit of the reference range (LLRR) of 0.4mIU/L or above the upper limit of the reference range (ULRR) of &gt;5.5 mIU/L at Screening]. Hypothyroidism treated with the same dose and regimen of thyroid hormone replacement for at least 3 months prior to Screening is allowed. BMI of &lt;22 or &gt;43 kg/m2. Significant weight gain or loss (as defined as &gt;5% of total body weight) in the 3 months prior to Screening. Diabetic Medication Has taken insulin or any oral or injectable antidiabetic medication ≥4 weeks at any time prior to screening. Has taken insulin or any oral or injectable antidiabetic medication within 3 months of screening. Cardiovascular Disease Recent history or presence of clinically significant acute cardiovascular disease including: 1. Documented myocardial infarction in the 6 months prior to Screening. 2. Coronary revascularization including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery either planned and/or occurred in the 6 months prior to Screening. 3. Unstable angina in the 6 months prior to Screening. 4. Clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias requiring medical therapy, or history of nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Symptomatic valvular heart disease or valvular heart disease requiring therapy other than endocarditis prophylaxis. 5. Congestive heart failure (CHF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV) requiring pharmacologic treatment. NYHA Class I may be included in accordance with the local prescribing information for pioglitazone. 6. Blood pressure (BP) &gt;150/100mmHg. If a subject is receiving permitted antihypertensive therapy, then they must be on stable dose(s) of therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. 7. Has a QTc interval (Bazett's) ≥450msec at Screening on a single ECG or an average value from 3 ECGs taken 5 minutes apart (on local reading of ECG). 8. Other clinically significant ECG abnormalities which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the interpretation of efficacy and safety data, or which otherwise contraindicates participation in a clinical trial with a new chemical entity. Fasting triglycerides ≥400mg/dL (4.56mmol/L) at Screening. If a subject is receiving permitted lipidlowering therapy, then they must be on a stable dose(s) of therapy for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening. Niacin and bile acid sequestrants are prohibited. Hepatic Disease Has a diagnosis of active hepatitis (hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody), or clinically significant hepatic enzyme elevation including: Any one of the following enzymes greater than 2 times the upper limit of the reference range (ULRR) value at Screening. alanine transaminase (ALT). aspartate transaminase (AST). alkaline phosphatase (AP). Has a total bilirubin level that is &gt;1.5 times the ULRR at Screening with the exception of suspected or confirmed Gilbert's disease. Pancreatic Disease Secondary causes of diabetes: history of chronic or acute pancreatitis Renal Disease Significant renal disease at Screening as manifested by: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60mL/min (as estimated from serum creatinine at Visit 1 and demographic data using the MDRD equation).For the MDRD equation, please refer to the study procedures manual. Proteinuria of ≥1+ by urinary dipstick Recurrent genitourinary tract infections defined as ≥2 episodes of complicated or uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in the 6 months prior to Screening A positive qualitative urinary dipstick for leukocytes, red blood cells (RBC) or nitrites at Screening. Concurrent Disease Has any concurrent condition or any clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening physical examination, laboratory tests (including blood electrolytes), electrocardiogram, including pulmonary, neurological or inflammatory diseases, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the interpretation of efficacy and safety data, or which otherwise contraindicates participation in a clinical trial with a new chemical entity History of significant comorbid diseases active in the 6 months prior to Screening (e.g., cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, gastrointestinal disease, chronic diarrhea, etc.) Has a history of malignancy within the past five years [other than superficial squamous cell carcinoma which is noninvasive on pathology or basal cell carcinoma which is successfully treated with local excision] and cervical cancer in situ treated definitively at least 6 months prior to Screening Concurrent Medication Is currently taking or has taken any of the following medications in the 8 weeks prior to Screening: 1.
