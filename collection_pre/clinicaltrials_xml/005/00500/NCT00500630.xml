	<brief_summary>The goal of this study was to clinically validate a new device for the objective outcome evaluation of adult patients undergoing shoulder surgery for glenohumeral osteoarthritis and rotator cuff disease, using the activities of daily living described in the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) as a reference. The study was set up as a clinical trial including patients over an observation period of one year and a control group of subjects. Clinical evaluations will be made at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery by two independent observers. Miniature sensors each containing three 3D gyroscopes and three 3D accelerometers will allow computing new kinematic scores. They will be compared to the regular SST, DASH, ASES and Constant scores.</brief_summary>
