	<brief_summary>The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy (chemoradiation) has improved outcomes for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck but additional improvements to treatment regimens are needed. The study is investigating if the addition of a targeted therapy (panitumumab) can improve the efficacy of chemoradiation without adding unmanageable toxicity.</brief_summary>
