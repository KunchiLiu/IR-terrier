	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The bacterial flora of the uterus during elective Cesarean sections differs from the uterine flora during non-elective Cesarean sections. We want to study whether the uterine flora can predict post-cesarean febrile morbidity and endometritis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To evaluate the uterine flora at the time of elective and non-elective cesarean sections and to study the relationship to the development of postpartum fever and/or endometritis. Methods: Eight-hundred women who will be delivered by cesarean section will be enrolled in this study. Cultures will be obtained during the surgery from the open uterine cavity after removal of the placenta. Data regarding postpartum morbidity would be collected.</detailed_description>
