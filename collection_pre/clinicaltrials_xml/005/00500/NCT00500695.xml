	<brief_summary>This project will assess the utility of a brief motivational intervention to engage smokers with schizophrenia in treatment for tobacco dependence treatment. It is hypothesized that a brief motivational intervention will be more effective in engaging smokers with schizophrenia to tobacco dependence treatment than an educational intervention. The educational intervention will increase the likelihood to reducing cigarette intake and/or attending tobacco dependence treatment by teaching subjects about the negative effects of smoking and the success of tobacco dependence treatment. The motivational intervention will increase the likelihood to reducing cigarette intake and/or attending tobacco dependence treatment by increasing subjects' motivation to change by presenting objective and personalized information regarding their smoking behaviors in a non-judgmental and supportive manner.</brief_summary>
