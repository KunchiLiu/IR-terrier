	<brief_title>Alpha-1 Coded Testing(ACT) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genetic testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is sometimes delayed despite established testing indications. All genetic tests have risks and possible benefits. The ACT study evaluates the population demographics, reasons for testing, and outcomes through a confidential testing program. Co-morbidities of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency other than lung and liver disease are being investigated. Concerns about genetic confidentiality are lessened in this study by a coded testing procedure that returns results through the mail to study participants.</detailed_description>
