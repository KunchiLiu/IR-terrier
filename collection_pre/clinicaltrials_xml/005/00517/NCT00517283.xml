	<brief_summary>As exenatide slows the rate at which materials leave the stomach, it is likely to alter the rate of intestinal absorption of oral drugs when administered within a certain timeframe relative to exenatide. In addition, the residence time within the stomach of other medication may be prolonged and data from this study will help assess the change in residence time in the presence of therapeutic doses of exenatide. This study will also evaluate the relationship between blood levels of exenatide and parameters measuring rate of stomach emptying.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with at least 1 year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects controlled by oral antidiabetic agents or diet and exercise demonstrated by a screening HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.0%. Between the body mass index (BMI) of 19 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2, inclusive. Within 4 months of the initial dose of study drug, have received a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication. Persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating exenatide. Subjects who are using drugs that significantly affect gastrointestinal motility (including acarbose, metoclopramide, and macrolide antibiotics). Subjects who intend to start new concomitant medication during the study, including overthe counter medication, apart from occasional intake of paracetamol or vitamin/mineral supplements. Antiemetic medication may be permitted at the investigator's discretion, except those that affect gastrointestinal motility. Subjects who have used insulin for more than 4 weeks within 3 months prior to screening. Blood donation of more than 500 mL in the last 3 months of screening or any blood donation within the last month.</criteria>
