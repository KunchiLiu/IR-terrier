	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease that affects an individual's ability to breathe. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil, a medication that increases blood flow to the lungs, at improving breathing function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in people with advanced IPF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sildenafil Trial of Exercise Performance in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPF is a disease in which fibrous tissue clogs the lungs. This eventually damages air sacs in the lungs and leads to widespread and permanent scarring of lung tissue. Individuals with IPF may experience breathing difficulties, cough, chest pain, and a decreased exercise capacity. Pulmonary hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs, affects half of all people with IPF. The fibrous tissue that clogs the lungs also blocks blood from flowing through the lungs effectively, reducing the amount of oxygen in the lungs. The fibrous tissue also reduces the lungs' ability to use what oxygen is available. These factors can cause breathing difficulties and may eventually lead to heart disease. Sildenafil is a medication that can increase blood supply to the lungs and reduce the heart's workload. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil at improving breathing function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in people with advanced IPF. This study will enroll people with advanced IPF. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive sildenafil or placebo three times a day for 12 weeks. Study visits will occur at baseline and Weeks 1, 6, and 12. At Week 12, participants will have the option to continue in the study for an additional 12 weeks. All participants who agree to continue in the study will receive sildenafil three times a day for the second 12 weeks. Study visits will occur at Weeks 13, 18, and 24. At all study visits, a physical exam and blood collection will occur. At selected visits, the following study procedures will occur: lung function testing; urine collection; a 6-minute walk test, which will measure the distance walked in a 6-minute period; and questionnaires to assess health status, breathing, and quality of life. Participants will record medication usage and symptoms in a daily diary. Study researchers will review medical records and the Social Security death index 5 years following the end of the study to determine the incidence of death among study participants.</detailed_description>

Participants will be prohibited from starting pulmonary rehabilitation during the study. Participants who are currently undergoing maintenance pulmonary rehabilitation at study entry will be asked to maintain their levels of rehabilitation for the duration of the study. Use of any investigational therapy as part of a clinical trial for any medical condition within 30 days of study entry Start or change in dose of treatment for IPF investigational agent (e.g., interferon gamma1b, pirfenidone, etanercept, Nacetylcysteine, any other investigational agent intended to treat IPF), corticosteroids, or cytotoxic agents within 30 days of study entry Use of certain medications. More information about this criterion can be found in the study protocol.
