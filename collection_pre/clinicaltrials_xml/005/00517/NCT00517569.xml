	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of GX-12 gene therapy combined with HAART in the HIV-1 infected patients and to investigate the efficacy with the value of plasma viral load and with CD4 counts and HIV-1 specific IFN-gamma expressed T-lymphocytes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Therapy With GX-12 in Combination With HAART for the HIV-1 Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, management of HIV infection and AIDS is mainly done by antiviral chemotherapy which inhibits reverse transcriptase or proteolytic enzyme. The HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) has indeed succeeded extraordinary in decrease of the mortality and in increase of the life expediency of AIDS patients. However, there have been some significant limitations of them (for example, treatment fatigues, the side effects, the emergency of resistant, high medical costs, etc.). Recently, there has been a number of bioresearch for immunotherapy to overcome these limitations of current medications. GX-12 is a genetic using a naked DNA with human IL-12 mutant as immune adjuvant. GX-12 is designed to vaccinate the individuals with HIV antigens, which is to result in enhancing the HIV specific immunity and to expand broadly the immune responses nonspecifically. In this study, the safety and efficacy of GX-12 will be investigated.</detailed_description>
