	<brief_summary>A relationship between IBD and spondyloarthropathy is well recognized. ASCA ( anti saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies)are considered to be a serological marker for Crohn's disease and have been studied in patients with spondyloarthropathy with conflicting results. More recently, new serological markers for IBD have been described. These markers are antibodies to certain defined glycans , and their use may permit an improved diagnosis of IBD. The aim of our study is to investigate wether these new serological markers are present in the sera of patients with spondyloarthropathy.</brief_summary>
