	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis is a highly prevalent chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cytokines are important biological mediators that regulate immune and inflammatory responses against the bacilli, witch include the acute phase response. Besides this, it becomes essential to determine markers of healing lesions, once this is currently carried out based on the clinical, radiological, and negative bacterioscopy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis is a highly prevalent chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cytokines are important biological mediators that regulate immune and inflammatory responses against the bacilli, witch include the acute phase response. Besides this, it becomes essential to determine markers of healing lesions, once this is currently carried out based on the clinical, radiological, and negative bacterioscopy. The propose of this work was to evaluate the production of IFN- γ in cell supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) culture, TNF-α, IL-10 and TGF-b in cell supernatants of monocytes (MO) culture and biochemical (total proteins, albumin, globulin, α-1-acid glycoprotein and C-reactive protein) and hematological (VHS) serum parameters before and after 3 and 6 months of therapy</detailed_description>
