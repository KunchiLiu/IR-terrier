	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis is that continuous administration of an OCP (CCOCP regimen) will result in more pain relief than a traditional 21/7 administration in primary dysmenorrhea (PD) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Administration of Oral Contraceptive, Primary Dysmenorrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well established that excess prostaglandin production in primary dysmenorrhea (PD) leads to ischemia of the uterine muscle, which consequently causes pelvic pain. A large number of drugs have been studied for pain relief in dysmenorrhea patients with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being the most effective with the overall success rate of more than 75%. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are also an established treatment for PD with the success rate of 70%. Lately, OCP's have been used continuously in patients with endometriosis and had better pain control than traditional administration of OCP.</detailed_description>
