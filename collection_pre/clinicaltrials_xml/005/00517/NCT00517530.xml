	<brief_summary>The primary objective for the phase I part of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of escalating intravenous (IV) doses of obinutuzumab given as monotherapy in participants with CD20+ (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytic) Malignant Disease, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The primary objective for the phase II part of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of one dose of obinutuzumab in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL and NHL that is, in turn, either indolent (iNHL) or aggressive (aNHL). It is an open label dose escalating study in phase I and open label in phase II, but the two doses in iNHL &amp; aNHL are randomized (to high or low dose of the same open label treatment). CLL was not randomized as only one dose level was used. Participants with a response who might gain additional benefit from being treated again in the opinion of the investigator may be enrolled in a Retreatment Period.</brief_summary>
