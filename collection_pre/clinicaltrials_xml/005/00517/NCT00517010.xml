	<brief_summary>Because a possible synergism of radiation and inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor has been shown in cancer patients and patients with wet macular degeneration, this pilot study is being conducted to determine whether treating wet macular degeneration with a combination of Lucentis and proton beam irradiation is safe. Lucentis is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor which was recently FDA approved for treatment of wet macular degeneration. It appears to be the most effective therapy thus far for wet macular degeneration among all drugs FDA approved for this condition. If no major safety issues are associated with this combination therapy, a larger study will be conducted to determine whether this combination therapy is more effective than Lucentis monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Lucentis Combined With Proton Beam Irradiation in Treating Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five subjects diagnosed with wet macular degeneration will be treated with standard of care, i.e. intravitreal Lucentis injection monthly for the first four months and as needed thereafter. Within six weeks of the first Lucentis injection, the eye will also be treated with 24 Gy of proton beam divided into two fractions. Each subject will be followed for 2 yrs with monthly examination.</detailed_description>
