	<detailed_description>This prospective, multicenter longitudinal five-year study of X-STOP PEEK implant usage in LSS patients is designed to supplement pre-market safety and effectiveness data with information on longer-term device performance in a population of patients with moderately impaired physical function at preoperative baseline (i.e., an "indicated" population) who elect to undergo X-STOP PEEK surgery. This post-approval study will enroll 240 patients at up to 8 clinical sites where all participating spine surgeons have completed a company-sponsored physician training program. The clinical sites recruited to participate in this study comprise a geographically diverse mix of academic, referral, and/or community based sites. Safety and effectiveness data will be assessed at baseline and annually through five (5) years postoperatively. Office visits will be scheduled preoperatively, and at 6 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years postoperatively. Clinical/neurological and radiographic examination will be performed during each office visit. A baseline patient history (including medication usage) will be taken, and concomitant medications will be recorded at each postoperative follow-up visit. In addition, patients will be asked to complete the following questionnaires prior to consultation with their physicians or their staff: Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and SF-36 Health Survey. At the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year office visit, patients will also be asked two questions assessing the value of surgery and the overall improvement in the quality of life postoperatively. The primary study endpoint in this study is treatment success. Secondary endpoints will include scores from the SF-36, ODI, and NRS, as well as incidence rates of adverse events, device failures, and secondary surgeries.</detailed_description>
