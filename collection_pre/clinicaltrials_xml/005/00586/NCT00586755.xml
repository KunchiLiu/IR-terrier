	<brief_summary>Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have a grave prognosis. They usually have an initial response to therapy, however progress early in the course of the disease and have very poor survival. We hypothesize that the emergence of drug resistance is responsible for this early failure of therapy and therefore intensive therapy at induction followed by high dose therapy immediately may produce a better outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Induction Therapy Followed by High Dose Chemo and BM Transplant for Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will undergo an induction regimen consisting of 1 cycle of cytarabine (3 gm/m2 Intravenously over 1 hour every 12 hours for 8 total doses) and mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2/d intravenously [IV] over 30 minutes daily on days 1, 2, and 3). This will be combined with Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody) for 6-8 weeks. If, after this one cycle, subjects have not had progression of disease as noted on physical exam or radiographic scans, they will proceed to stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide. This will be immediately followed by high dose therapy with stem cell support. Following count recovery, rituximab will be used for 8 total doses as consolidation therapy. Involved field irradiation may be given post-transplant to those with localized bulky disease as well. Day -6: Carmustine (BCNU): 15 mg/kg (or 550 mg/m2) IV over 2 hrs. Day -4: Etoposide Day -2: Cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg in 1 liter D5W over 2 hours.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have biopsy proven mantle cell lymphoma confirming mantle cell lymphoma. (Flow cytometry, and cyclin D1 or t (11;14) tests of disease site should be done if available at some time in the patient's course before this therapy) Radiologic staging studies may be performed up to 6 weeks prior to starting therapy and not be repeated if the treating physician feels it unnecessary No other prior malignancy is permitted except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been diseasefree for one year. Age &gt; or = to 18 years of age For patients who are in first remission from a prior regimen, at least 3 weeks must elapse from a prior chemotherapy and at least 1 week from radiation or antibody therapy. Significant medical and/or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the investigators, may compromise any aspect of the planned treatment. The patient cannot have been exposed to chemotherapy to treat any of these diseases (other than mantle cell lymphoma) for at least 3 years prior to entry on this protocol.</criteria>
