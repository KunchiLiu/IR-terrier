	<brief_title>SLAP Lesions; a Comparison of Conservative and Operative Treatment. A Prospective, Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of superior labral lesions is controversial. Some authors advocate labral repair, some advocate biceps tenodesis,and others again questions whether these lesions should be repaired at all. There are no randomized studies comparing operative treatment and conservative treatment(i.e. physical rehabilitation), and likewise no randomized studies comparing labral repair and biceps tenodesis. In this study;all patients who have a patient history, clinical signs of a SLAP lesion,a MRI study revealing an isolated superior labral lesion and have agreed to participate in the study, will have a diagnostic arthroscopy performed. If a SLAP lesion is diagnosed, the patients are randomized to three different groups:1) SLAP repair with suture anchors 2) Biceps tenodesis 3) Physical therapy</detailed_description>
