	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase IIIb study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity &amp; safety of GSK Biologicals' Hib-MenC vaccine (Menitorix™) when co-administered with GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV vaccine (Infanrix™ penta) &amp; Wyeth's 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar™) in preterm infants as a 3-dose primary vaccination course during the first 6 months of life (at 2, 4, 6 months of age) and of a booster dose of Menitorix™ when co-administered with GSK Biologicals' DTPa-IPV vaccine (Infanrix IPV) and Wyeth's Prevenar in the second year of life (16-18 months of age). The control is a group of full-term infants receiving the same vaccines. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary &amp; Booster Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of Menitorix Vaccine in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study is open &amp; consists of a primary &amp; a booster phase. The study has 2 treatment groups (Preterm &amp; Full-term) that will receive the same vaccinations; the Full-term group will be the active control. Four blood samples will be collected from all subjects for immunogenicity analyses; 2 in the primary phase at prior to the first vaccination and one month after the third vaccination and 2 in the booster phase at prior to booster dose and one month after booster dose.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry: Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 8 and 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. All preterm subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry: Born after a gestation period of less than or equal to 36 weeks (≤258 days). Medically stable, i.e. do not require significant medical support or ongoing management for debilitating disease and have demonstrated a clinical course of sustained recovery. All fullterm subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry: Born after a gestation period between and including 37 and 42 weeks (≥259 days and ≤294 days). Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of vaccine until the last study visit, except measlesmumpsrubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines which may be given according to local immunisation practices and except rotavirus oral vaccine which is allowed at anytime during the study after hospital discharge as per prescribing information. Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, meningococcal serogroup C and or Streptococcus pneumoniae disease, with the exception of hepatitis B vaccine or BCG vaccine given in the first month of life according to the national recommendations (although BCG and hepatitis B vaccines should have been given outside a 30day window from the first administration of study vaccines). History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and or S. pneumoniae disease. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins (with the exception of monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) and/or any blood products within one month (30 days) preceding the first dose of study vaccines. Planned administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the active phase of the study. Specific criteria for the booster part of the study (to be checked at Visit 5, study month 14): History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and or S. pneumoniae disease. Previous vaccination, except the study vaccines and hepatitis birth dose, against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and or S. pneumoniae disease. Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and/or S. pneumoniae disease.</criteria>
