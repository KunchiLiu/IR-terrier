	<brief_summary>The goal in these studies will be to assess the relative levels of the Stat4 alpha and Stat4 beta isoforms in PBMCs from patients with Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease or from control patients. We hypothesize that the beta to alpha ratio will be higher in patients with active disease and that there will be a correlation between the ratio and the severity of disease.</brief_summary>
