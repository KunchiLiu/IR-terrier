	<brief_title>Does Thiazolidinedione Therapy Improve Endothelial Function and Preserve Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite continued improvements in the outcomes of patients with cardiovascular disease, similar improvements have not been seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD constitutes one of the highest risk populations for cardiovascular disease. When the creatinine clearance is ≤ 60 ml/min the risk for cardiovascular events is greater than that of diabetes. However, few studies have focused on the prevention or treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in CKD patients. The development of endothelial dysfunction and increased inflammation appear to be critical in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The broad long-term objective of this grant proposal is to determine unique therapies to reduce endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, and thereby help to prevent cardiovascular disease and preserve renal function in patients with CKD. Thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone appear to improve endothelial function and decrease inflammation, an effect that may be present in patients with or without diabetes. To address this hypothesis the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. To determine the effects of chronic pioglitazone therapy on endothelial function in non-diabetic patients with CKD (creatinine clearance ≤ 60 ml/ min, but not on dialysis) 2. To determine the effects chronic pioglitazone therapy on inflammation and oxidative stress in non-diabetic patients with CKD 3. To determine the effects chronic pioglitazone therapy on progression of renal disease in non-diabetic patients with CKD</detailed_description>
