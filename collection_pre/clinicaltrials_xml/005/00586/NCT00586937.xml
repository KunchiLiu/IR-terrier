	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out about the quality of life of individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for lung cancer (lung cancer survivors). By quality of life, we mean how you are feeling about different aspects of your life, including your physical health, your emotional health, and your ability to carry out daily activities. We are interested in people's opinions about their quality of life, as well as the factors that affect their quality of life. Learning about quality of life will help us to develop new services for lung cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
