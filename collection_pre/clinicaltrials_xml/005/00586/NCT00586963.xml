	<brief_title>Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plan is to have 50 people take part in this study at Mayo Clinic Rochester. This research study is looking at people who have a new condition called erosive reflux esophagitis. Esophagitis is defined as mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Acid reflux, over time, can wear away or erode the lining of your esophagus. This condition is called erosive esophagitis. The treating physician may start you on prescription strength acid reducing group of medications called Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI). PPI medications can provide 24-hour relief from your painful heartburn symptoms and it can help you heal the erosions in the esophagus that acid reflux may cause.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 or older Have either mildtomoderate erosive reflux esophagitis Meet criteria for GERD symptoms. Patients already on esomeprazole therapy, have previously failed to respond to esomeprazole, or are intolerant to PPI therapy. Patients expected to travel outside of the United States during the initial 8 weeks of PPI therapy. Pregnant women will be excluded as PPI's are not thought safe for the fetus (Pregnancy Category C). Children younger than 18 years of age will be excluded. Other vulnerable populations, such as those with diminished mental acuity, will be excluded.</criteria>
