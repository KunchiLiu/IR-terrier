	<brief_summary>Vaccination is currently the most effective means of controlling influenza and preventing its complications and mortality in persons at risk. Once a year, a meeting of World Health Organization (WHO) experts takes place, leading to a recommendation on the influenza A and B strains that should be used for the production of vaccine for the coming influenza season. For the strains which do not change from the previous year, the vaccine can be formulated from the old mono bulk from the previous year. Bulks as old as 12 months may be blended to make trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) under the current Canadian and US licenses. This study is conducted to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Fluviral vaccines made with the aged bulk material compared with the new bulk material. This protocol posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sept 2007.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. Male and female adults, 18 to 60 years. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for the duration of the study. Acute disease at the time of enrollment. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition Presence of blood dyscrasias, including hemaglobinopathies and myelo or lymphoproliferative disorder. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. A history of any demyelinating disease including GuillainBarré syndrome. Presence of an active neurological disorder. Any significant disorder of coagulation that increases the risk of intramuscular injections or treatment with coumadin derivatives or heparin. Receipt of an influenza vaccine within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Administration of any vaccines within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during the study period. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the vaccination or planned use during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to consumption of eggs, and/or reactions to products containing mercury. A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination. Lactating/nursing female. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.</criteria>
