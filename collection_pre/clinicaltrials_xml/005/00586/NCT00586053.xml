	<brief_summary>It is our objective to improve the performance of CTC in the prepared colon, and to validate CTC in the unprepared colon for the detection of colorectal neoplasia. The cost-effectiveness ratio of CTC in the unprepared colon will compare favorably with other colorectal screening test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unprepped CT Colonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To improve the diagnostic performance of CTC in the prepared colon using improved spatial resolution, advanced image displays, and computer-assisted diagnosis, and to optimize diagnostic performance of CTC in the unprepared colon for colorectal polyp detection using electronic stool subtraction and computer-aided diagnostic techniques. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CTC in the unprepared colon for clinically important colorectal neoplasms (large adenomas ≥ 1 cm) and to compare such estimates with colonoscopy. To survey patient acceptance of CTC in the unprepared colon, and to assess implications for health care costs and cost-effectiveness of CTC in the unprepared colon in comparison with other approaches.</detailed_description>
