	<brief_title>Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) in Barrett's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease in which the normal squamous lining of the esophagus is replaced by specialized columnar epithelium.1 Approximately 5%-10% of patients diagnosed with BE are thought to be at risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma.2 Patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) on biopsy are at the greatest cancer riskÂ³. EMR is being performed clinically in our Barrett's Esophagus Unit on a regular basis during endoscopy for patients with Barrett's Esophagus and/or early esophageal adenocarcinoma. There are two predominant endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) techniques exist using FDA approved devices - the EMR cap method using a transparent cap/snare combination and the endoscopic variceal ligation method using a band ligator/snare combination to resect tissue.</detailed_description>
