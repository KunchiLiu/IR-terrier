	<brief_summary>The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC-CTG) has informed AstraZeneca that the BR24 Phase II/III study of cediranib at 30mg in first line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will not continue into Phase III following the planned end of Phase II efficacy and tolerability analysis by the study's Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Although evidence of clinical activity was seen, there appeared to be an imbalance in toxicity and therefore the study was considered not to have met the pre-defined criteria for automatic continuation into Phase III. As the design of Study 040 is similar to that of Study BR24, AstraZeneca has suspended recruitment into Study 040.</brief_summary>
