	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether adding a brief alcohol treatment to standard violence intervention programs for women will result in reduced drinking, reduced partner violence perpetration, and reduced partner violence victimization. We hypothesize that, relative to standard care, women receiving the additional brief alcohol intervention will have better alcohol use and partner violence outcomes.</brief_summary>
