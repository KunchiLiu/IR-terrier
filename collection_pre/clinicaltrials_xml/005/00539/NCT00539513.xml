	<brief_summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 2-3% of the population and leads to a great deal of suffering. Many patients benefit from established treatments, the mainstay of which are cognitive behavioral therapy and a group of antidepressant medications known as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, 20-30% of patients get minimal benefit from these established therapeutic strategies. New avenues of treatment are urgently needed. Existing medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder affect the neurotransmitters serotonin or dopamine; but increasing evidence suggests that functional disruptions of a different neurotransmitter, glutamate, may contribute to some cases of OCD. The researchers are therefore interested in using medications that target glutamate as novel treatment options for those OCD patients who do not benefit from established treatments. One such medication is the drug N-Acetylcysteine, whose glutamatergic antagonistic properties may be effective in reducing the glutamatergic hyperactivity that is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD and major depressive disorder (MDD). Riluzole, which is FDA approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease) is also a glutamatergic agent. There is evidence that riluzole possesses anti-depressant, anti-obsessional, and anti-anxiety properties. The modulation of glutamatergic activity is a promising new approach to the treatment of mood disorders. The researchers are therefore now recruiting patients to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of N-Acetylcysteine, added to whatever other OCD medications they are taking.</brief_summary>
