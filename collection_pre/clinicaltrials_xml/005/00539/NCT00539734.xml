	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness, is caused by an abnormal growth of the vessels beneath the retina. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is a new drug that inhibits the growth of new vessels and has recently been approved by FDA for treating this condition. This study is carried out to evaluate the changes in retinal function after an injection of ranibizumab.</brief_summary>
