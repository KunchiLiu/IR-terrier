Response to ipratropium bromide Any clinically relevant and important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or ECG (12lead or Holter). A history of breathing problems A mean QTc(B) value &gt; 450ms, the QTc(B) of the 3 screening ECGs are not within 10% of the mean, a PR interval outside the range 90210ms or an ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements at screening. A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg at screening. A mean heart rate outside the range 4090 bpm inclusive at screening. History of use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months of screening, and/or positive urine cotinine test results at screening.
