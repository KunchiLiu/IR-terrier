	<brief_summary>This is a cross-sectional study of post myocardial infarction patients which is designed to determine the prevalence of left ventricular thrombi (blood clots) using non-contrast echocardiography and to compare this with the prevalence of left ventricular thrombi using contrast echocardiography. Secondary aims of this study are (1) to identify clinical and imaging correlates of left ventricular thrombi, and (2) to compare quantitative measurements of left ventricular chamber size, function, and myocardial mass using contrast and non-contrast echocardiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Utility of Contrast Echocardiography for Detection of LV Thrombi Post ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People that experience heart attacks ("myocardial infarctions") are at increased risk for stroke, possibly due to formation of blood clots ("left ventricular thrombi"), which may break loose from the heart and travel to other organs. While echocardiography is a test commonly employed for thrombus detection, prior studies have yielded heterogeneous findings regarding prevalence and predictors. Echocardiographic contrast ("perflutren lipid microspheres") are FDA approved imaging agents that have been shown to improve thrombus detection in selected populations. However, the decision to use contrast is often predicated upon results of non-contrast echocardiography, a diagnostic strategy that hasn't been well studied. This study is designed to test whether echocardiographic contrast improves thrombus detection following myocardial infarction. Participants will undergo non-contrast and contrast echocardiography. These will be compared for identification of thrombi and assessment of cardiac size and function. Clinical features and results of other diagnostic tests will also be reviewed in order to study whether these predict thrombus risk. Participants will be contacted at regular intervals by study investigators to determine whether thrombi identified by contrast or non-contrast echocardiography predict risk for stroke or cardiac events. Findings from this study may improve detection of thrombi, thereby improving treatment for patients following myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
