	<brief_summary>There is debate as to whether long-term low-dose steroids such as prednisolone help to suppress relapses of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in patients who are in remission from their lupus nephritis. If low-dose prednisolone reduces relapses, these beneficial effects may be counter-balanced by the long-term side-effects associated with prednisolone. This pilot study will determine the feasibility of conducting a larger randomized control trial that will answer the question of whether or not long-term low-dose prednisolone (5 - 7.5 mg/day) reduces the flares of SLE in patients with previous lupus nephritis.</brief_summary>
