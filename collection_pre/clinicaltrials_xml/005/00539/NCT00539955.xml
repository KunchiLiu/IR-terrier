	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to examine whether, relative to standard care, violence and alcohol use outcomes can be improved by a brief, motivationally based adjunct alcohol treatment for men enrolled in batterer intervention programs. We hypothesize that men randomized to also receive the brief alcohol intervention will have better partner violence and alcohol use outcomes than men who are randomized to the batterer intervention program alone.</brief_summary>
