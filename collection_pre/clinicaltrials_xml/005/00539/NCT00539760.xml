This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until PK levels are determined to be below the LLQ. Men or women who are between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive. BMI within the range of 1835 kg/m2 inclusive. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form The subject has a positive prestudy urine drug/urine alcohol screen.

One drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits The subject is unwilling to abstain from alcohol consumption from 48 hr prior to dosing until discharge from the clinic, and for 48 hr prior to all other outpatient clinic visits. Smoked or used tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within the previous 6 months prior to the first dose of current study medication. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new chemical entity within 30 days or 5 halflives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication. Previous exposure to or treatment with PEGylated molecules. Use of antiTumor Necrosis Factor (antiTNF) drugs within 60 days prior to dosing. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days , or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a history of drug or other allergy (including antibiotics) which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates the subject's participation. Positive pregnancy test at Screening or on Day 1 (females only). Any clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment or examination, or ECG. Any WBC or neutrophil count outside the normal range at screening or on Day 1. History of significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal conditions that in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor, places the subject at an unacceptable risk as participant in this trial. History of any autoimmune or current inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis or any other joint disease. History of malignancy, except for surgically cured basal cell carcinoma or cured cervical carcinoma (&gt; 2 yrs prior to dosing). Currently has asthma or history of COPD. Current evidence of ongoing or acute infection. The subject has a history of repeated, chronic or opportunistic infections which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor, places the subject at an unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial. History of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or any other previous Mycobacterium infection. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen, positive Hepatitis C antibody, or HIV antibody testing result. History of a severe allergic reaction, angioedema, anaphylaxis or immunodeficiency History of elevated blood pressure or blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg at screening. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 msec. Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days of starting the study. Subject whose calculated creatinine clearance is less than 80 mL/min Liver function tests above the upper limit of normal at screening (alkaline transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) or bilirubin). Chronic liver or biliary disease, history of Gilbert's syndrome in a previous clinical study or at screening.</criteria>
