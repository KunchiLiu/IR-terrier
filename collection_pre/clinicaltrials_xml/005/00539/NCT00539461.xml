	<brief_summary>In this German non-interventional observational study 1980 patients diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) will be investigated by 990 General Practitioners across all federal states in Germany. Both moderate to severe RLS patients, with or without previous RLS treatment, suffering from RLS symptoms like a desire to move the extremities usually associated with some discomfort, motor restlessness and worsening of symptoms at rest with at least temporary relief by activity, worsening of symptoms later in the day or at night, are eligible for this study, if it is planned to initiate therapy with pramipexole or to add pramipexole to a previously given, insufficient therapy. Three visits are planned to be documented in this PMS study, one baseline visit, visit two after the end of pramipexole titration and visit three after 12 weeks of treatment. Evaluations and visits are to be carried out and documented only if part of routine medical practice. The main goal of observational studies is to determine how pramipexole treatment works when applied in actual practice and thus maximise external validity. In actual practice patients who have been excluded in the clinical registration trials of PPX in moderate to severe primary RLS (i.e. those with certain disease histories, co-morbidities and/or demographic characteristics) will be treated with PPX. Thus in addition during this observational study information on the efficacy and safety of PPX in those patients will be obtained. The objectives of this PMS study are: - To evaluate the treatment effect of pramipexole on RLS severity and general improvement as measured by IRLS and CGI-I. - To evaluate quality of life of RLS patients as measured by the Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life questionnaire (RLS-QoL). - To evaluate the safety profile of PPX in a natural study population.</brief_summary>
