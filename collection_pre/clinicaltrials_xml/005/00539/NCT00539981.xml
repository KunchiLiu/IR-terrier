	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single dose of FluBlok in terms of safety, efficacy and effectiveness in prevention of influenza and influenza-like illness and assess clinical lot-to-lot consistency in manufacturing by evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of three different lots of FluBlok in a subset of subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All currently licensed influenza vaccines in the United States are produced in embryonated hen's eggs. There are several well-recognized disadvantages to the use of eggs as the substrate for influenza vaccine. Eggs require specialized manufacturing facilities and could be difficult to scale up rapidly in response to an emerging need such as a pandemic. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high-yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and can select receptor variants that may have suboptimal immunogenicity. In addition, agricultural diseases that affect chicken flocks, and that might be an important issue in a pandemic due to an avian influenza virus strain, could easily disrupt the supply of eggs for vaccine manufacturing. Therefore, development of alternative substrates for influenza vaccine production has been identified as a high-priority objective. One potential alternative method for production of influenza vaccine is expression of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) using recombinant DNA techniques. This alternative avoids dependence on eggs and is very efficient because of the high levels of protein expression under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.</detailed_description>

Immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or used anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 36 months. Any malignancy diagnosed or treated actively during the past five (5) years, with two (2) exceptions. Subject with ANY history of lymphoproliferative disorder will be excluded. However, subjects with a history of localized nonmelanotic skin cancer may be eligible. Receipt of any other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study. Receipt of an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product or medication) within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study, or expects to receive an experimental agent during study period. Receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin or other blood product within the three months prior to study vaccination. Major psychiatric diagnosis including schizophrenia, bipolar disease or other major depression, or any diagnosis of dementia or associated concomitant medications (e.g., Aricept) used for treating dementia. Known active human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection. History of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 5 years. Not available for three or more consecutive weeks during flu surveillance period. Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or interfere with the evaluation of responses or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.</criteria>
