	<brief_summary>Prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, Follow-up at 1-, 6- and 12 months This clinical investigation is first of all designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the MAGIC EXPLORER stent system. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and 6-month patency of the bioabsorbable MAGIC EXPLORER stent in patients with stenotic or occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the infrapopliteal arteries. Secondary endpoints are the procedural success, patency at all follow-ups, late lumen loss and limb-salvage rate. Peri-procedural complications (within 24 hours) will be evaluated. Furthermore, data of the balloon catheter PLEON EXPLORER will be collected to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety.</brief_summary>
