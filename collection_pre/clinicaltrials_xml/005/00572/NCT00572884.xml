	<brief_summary>Military personnel are exposed to the insecticide permethrin when using the DOD Insect Repellent System. A urinary metabolite of permethrin that is in high abundance and is relatively stable may be an ideal biomarker of exposure to this pesticide. Monitoring such a biomarker can prevent over-exposure. The objectives are to identify the most abundant human urinary metabolite following dermal exposure; to utilize this information to develop rapid laboratory-based and field portable methods to monitor the degree of an individual's exposure to permethrin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Permethrin is applied to the forearm of the subject and remains for 8 hours. The exposed area is then washed with soap and water several times. 24 hour urine samples are collected at daily intervals for 192 hours. Blood and saliva samples are taken at pre-dose, 1, 3, 6, 9 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 192 hours. Subjects must return to the clinic daily to drop off urine collections and have blood and saliva samples taken.</detailed_description>
