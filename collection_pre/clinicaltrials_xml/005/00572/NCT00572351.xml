	<brief_summary>Healthy pre-menopausal women will be recruited in order to test the effects of red wine and white wine on blood estrogen and progesterone levels. The women will be randomized and rotated through two different treatments (red wine, white wine). Estrone and estradiol are hormones in the category of estrogens. It is known that the bodies of both men and women may convert (or aromatize) a certain amount of naturally occurring testosterone into estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors have been used to prevent this conversion, or aromatization, of testosterone into estrogen, in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer in women. This inhibition leads to a marked decrease in estrogen (estradiol and estrone) levels. Naturally occurring aromatase inhibitors include grapes, grape juice, and red, but not white wine. The aromatase inhibitory effects are attributed to wine phytochemicals and not to alcohol. Based upon this information, the investigators will monitor the estrogen levels at various phases in the menstrual cycles of women since hormone levels naturally vary throughout the menstrual cycle. Several epidemiologic studies have found that there is a correlation with moderate to high levels of alcohol consumption and breast cancer. Therefore, study participants will be asked to drink only a eight ounces of wine which should have minimal or no risk for the development of breast cancer.</brief_summary>
