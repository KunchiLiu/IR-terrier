	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is find whether the addition of statin (Atorvastatin) to dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade involving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and AT-1 angiotensin II receptor blocker leads to the reduction of proteinuria, main prognostic marker of chronic kidney disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimalization of Nephroprotection Using Atorvastatin (Sortis)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the progression of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD. However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off dialysis. Additional statin (Atorvastatin) pathway may prove to be such beneficial therapeutic concept.Given these facts additional administration of statin to combination treatment with ACEI and ARB, may provide additional renal protection. To shed more light on this issue, we performed a randomised open controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple therapy with ACEI and/orARB and statin on surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e. proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and kidney fibrosis.</detailed_description>
