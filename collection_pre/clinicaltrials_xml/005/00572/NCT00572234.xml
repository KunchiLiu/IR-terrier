	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine dependence is a significant drug use disorder in the Midwest. While a number of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments have been studied, no specific treatments for methamphetamine have been identified. This study is a collaborative pre-clinical and clinical partnership examining bupropion in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bupropion in the Treatment of Methamphetamine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly 40% of adults seeking substance use disorders (SUD) treatment in Nebraska report methamphetamine is their drug of choice. In preliminary studies examining bupropion in methamphetamine use, it was well tolerated, reduced craving for methamphetamine and reduced methamphetamine related euphoria. Investigators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln have initiated studies examining bupropion in animals and humans as a potential intervention in addictive disorders. Pre-clinical studies in the Co-Investigator's laboratory were the first to demonstrate the potential utility of bupropion as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine use disorders (MUD) while the Principal Investigator studied bupropion as a smoking cessation aid in alcoholics. The primary goal of this study is to establish an interdisciplinary and translational collaboration to test bupropion in persons in treatment for methamphetamine dependence and to inform pre-clinical studies so as to enhance their practical applicability to clinical settings. The pilot clinical study will examine the treatment effect and safety of a 12 week course of bupropion in persons with methamphetamine use disorder. Concurrently, we will examine the efficacy of bupropion on methamphetamine self-administration in animal models which better simulates clinical approaches.</detailed_description>
