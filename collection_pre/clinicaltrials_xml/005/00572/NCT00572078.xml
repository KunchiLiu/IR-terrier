	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of a solid tumor with evidence of residual, recurrent, or metastatic disease. Patients must be incurable by surgical or other standard available therapy Measurable or evaluable disease; tumor size of ≥ 2 cm on CT scan Patients may have received prior standard taxane therapy or antiVEGF therapy, but may not have progressed on both therapies. Progression on one type therapy (either taxane or antiVEGF) is allowed History or presence of central nervous system (CNS) disease (i.e., primary brain tumor, malignant seizures, CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis). Prior chemotherapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to registration. Patients must have recovered from all therapyrelated toxicities Prior biologic or immunotherapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to registration. Patients must have recovered from all therapyrelated toxicities Prior full pelvic field radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or limited field radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients must have recovered to less than or equal to grade 1 from all therapyrelated toxicities except alopecia. The site of previous radiotherapy should have evidence of progressive disease if this is the only site of evaluable disease Major surgery (i.e., laparotomy) ≤ 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Minor surgery ≤ 2 weeks prior to randomization. Insertion of a vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery in this regard. Patients must have recovered from all surgeryrelated toxicities Peripheral neuropathy with functional impairment ≥ Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade 2 neuropathy, regardless of causality Pleural effusion or ascites that causes respiratory compromise (≥ CTC grade 2 dyspnea) Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled cardiac, vascular or infectious conditions (as described in the protocol) which could compromise participation in the study Patients at risk of QT prolongation such as patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with long corrected QT (QTc) at baseline (i.e. QTc greater than 450 msec in males, and greater than 470 msec in females) will be excluded Lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology (mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case the patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is not acceptable).</criteria>
