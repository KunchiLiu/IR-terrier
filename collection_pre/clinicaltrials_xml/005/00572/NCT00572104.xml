	<brief_summary>This study will compare the ability of two types of long term (12 months) weight-bearing exercise treatments (1. high-intensity jumping and 2. weight lifting) to increase bone mass of the total body, spine and hip in physically active men with osteopenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Plyometrics to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of chronic (12 months) plyometric jump training exercise on bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone turnover in physically active males cyclists diagnosed with osteopenia below normal bone mineral density of the lumbar spine or hip.</detailed_description>
