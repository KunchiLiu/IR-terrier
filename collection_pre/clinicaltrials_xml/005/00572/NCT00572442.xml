	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to perform serial magnetocardiographs (MCG)and cardiovascular risk factor assessments on individuals with no symptoms or history of heart disease. This small sized study of MCG in healthy individuals will allow for data collection for power analysis for a larger prospective trial. Volunteers are not compensated or paid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetocardiography (MCG) in Asymptomatic Individuals - Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Magnetocardiography (MCG) has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a tool to measure the heart's magnetic field.However, it is not yet approved for the specific diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The MCG scan is entirely non-invasive, rapid and no risk, since it does not require stress provocation, radiation, or use of medication or contrast. In this study, the MCG will be used to compare the scans of normal, healthy volunteers to those which have been previously or are currently being collected in subjects with known heart disease.</detailed_description>
