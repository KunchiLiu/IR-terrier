	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to define the absorption and excretion kinetics of bilastine in man following oral administration, and to investigate the nature of the metabolites present in plasma and excreta. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of bilastine</brief_summary>

Administration of radiolabelled substances or exposure to significant radiation (eg serial xray or CT scans, barium meal etc) within the past 12 months. Any ECG abnormality at screening (including QTc intervals of &gt;430 ms). Past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, or a family history of a prolonged QT interval syndrome. Abnormal diet or substantial changes in eating habits within 30 days prior to study initiation. Treatment with any known enzyme altering agents (barbiturates, phenothiazines, cimetidine, etc.) within 2 months prior to or during the study.</criteria>
