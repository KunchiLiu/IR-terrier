	<brief_summary>Aprepitant is currently approved for prophylaxis of acute and delayed CINV for highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens, including cisplatin; however, it has not yet been studied in multiple-day chemotherapy treatment programs. This study will compare the addition of aprepitant compared to placebo administered on days 3,4,5 of chemotherapy administration for acute CINV prophylaxis with standard antiemetic prophylaxis and days 6 and 7 for delayed CINV prophylaxis in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study design.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial. Subjects will be stratified prior to randomization based on previous administration of chemotherapy. Subjects will randomize to aprepitant or placebo with their first study cycle of chemotherapy and then cross over to opposite treatment with the second study cycle. Cisplatin-based regimen for germ cell tumors containing 20mg/m2/day IV days 1 through 5, first day of chemotherapy administration is day 1. Permitted treatment regimens: Regimen 1 (BEP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Etoposide (100 mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Bleomycin 30 U/IV on days 1, 8, 15 Regimen 2 (EP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Etoposide (100 mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Regimen 3 (VIP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Ifosfamide (1200 mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 (with mesna uroprophylaxis at 100% ifosfamide dosing) Etoposide (75 mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Regimen 4 (VeIP) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Ifosfamide (1200 mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 (with mesna uroprophylaxis at 100% ifosfamide dosing) Vinblastine (0.11 mg/kg/day) IV on days 1 and 2 Regimen 5 (EC) Cisplatin (20mg/m2/day) IV on days 1 to 5 Epirubicin (90 mg/m2/day) IV on day 1 Patients are treated on study for two cycles. At the completion of protocol therapy patients will receive additional chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating investigator. If a patient requires discontinuation of one medication or more on a regimen, the patient must be discontinued from the study.
