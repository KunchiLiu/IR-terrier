	<brief_summary>MonoMax will be used for a continuous all-layer (except skin) suture to close abdominal wall after midline incision. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that the frequency of wound infection and the frequency of reoperation due to burst-abdomen after primary median laparotomy for elective surgical intervention are equal or lower than in the INSECT trial. The secondary objectives are to demonstrate that the length of postoperative hospital stay and the frequency of abdominal hernias 12 months after the surgery are equal or lower than in the INSECT trial.
