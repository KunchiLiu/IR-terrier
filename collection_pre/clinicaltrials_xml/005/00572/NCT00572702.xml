	<brief_title>Randomized,Multicentric Study to Treat Prolapse After Hysterectomy With Amreich Procedure or Total Prolift Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the last decade a substantial progress in the detailed knowledge of morphology and function of different compartments of the female pelvic floor was achieved. The obtained informations were quickly implemented in the clinical practice especially in the application of special meshes and of novel techniques of their implantation. Their success rate was evaluated only in pilot companies supported studies. We do miss randomised studies not sponsored by company comparing different surgical techniques and their impact on the quality of life (QoL); the objective estimation of those consequences is for the longlasting effect of the surgery inevitable. The new methods bring also new complications which were not yet relevantly and objectively documented. In the study we compare the techniques contemporary used - in the groups with or without mesh, in size relevant for the statistical evaluation</detailed_description>
