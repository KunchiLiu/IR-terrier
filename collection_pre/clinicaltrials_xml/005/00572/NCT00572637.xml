	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 escalating-dose study is designed to assess, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the novel proteasome inhibitor CEP 18770, given intravenously as single agent, in patients with advanced, incurable solid tumours or NHL, and to identify the recommended dose of CEP 18770 to be used in Phase 2 studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of the Proteosome Inhibitor CEP 18770 in Patients With Solid Tumours or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalating study to determine the MTD and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of CEP 18770, a novel proteasome inhibitor. The study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of CEP 18770, and assess the safety and tolerability of CEP-18770 treatment as well as any effect on tumour response whenever possible. Patients will be treated intravenously with CEP 18770 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle period. Additional cycles may be administered, up to 6, as long as patients are maintaining their performance status and appear to be receiving clinical benefit from the study. Safety data will be collected for all patients in order to determine the toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of CEP 18770. Formal assessments will be performed throughout the study including at baseline, prior to each dose of study medication every week, and 30 days following the last dose of study drug. Patients with drug-related toxicities will continue to be reviewed until resolution or stabilization of the toxicity. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters will also be assessed in each cohort of patients during cycle 1. Where applicable, tumour measurements will be documented and any observed anti-tumour activity will be evaluated. The study will follow a conventional MTD design with patients recruited in cohorts of 3 patients, with criteria to expand to 6 patients. Enrolment for each cohort will begin when the required number of patients in the prior cohort have completed one 21-day cycle of study drug treatment at the current dose level without experiencing a DLT. Once the MTD has been determined, additional 10 patients will be treated at the MTD to further explore the toxicity of this dose, and its suitability for Phase II studies.</detailed_description>
