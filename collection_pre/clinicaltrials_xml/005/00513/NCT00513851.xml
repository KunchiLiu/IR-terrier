	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of OSI-930 in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose on both once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) schedules. Patients may continue to receive OSI-930 until one of the following occurs: disease progression, adverse event requiring withdrawal, failure to recover from toxicity despite a 14-day dosing interruption, medical or ethical reasons, patient request, or patient death.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented malignancy that is now advanced and/or metastatic and refractory to established forms of therapy or for which no effective therapy exists. Age &gt;/= 18 years, ECOG PS 02, life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks Prior chemotherapy is permitted provided that a minimum of 3 weeks has elapsed. Prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is permitted. Patients must have recovered from any treatmentrelated toxicities (with some exceptions) prior to registration. Prior hormonal therapy is permitted provided it is discontinued prior to registration (with the exception of prostate cancer patients who have been on hormone therapy for at least 3 months). Prior radiation therapy is permitted provided that it did not exceed 25% of bone marrow reserve and patients have recovered from the toxic effects. A minimum of 21 days must have elapsed unless the radiotherapy was palliative and nonmyelosuppressive. ANC &gt;/= 1.5 x 10^9/L, PLT &gt;/= 100 x 10^9/L; bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN; creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 ULN Accessible for repeat dosing and followup. Patients must practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Provide written informed consent. Symptomatic brain metastases which are not stable, require steroids, are potentially lifethreatening or that have required radiation within the last 28 days. History of allergic reaction attributed to a similar compound as study drug. Significant cardiac disease unless well controlled, poorly controlled hypertension. Active or uncontrolled infections of serious illnesses or medical conditions that could interfere with participation. History of any psychiatric condition that might impair the patient's ability to provide informed consent or participate. Concurrent anticancer therapy. Use of CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors during the 14 days prior to first dose. Pregnant or breastfeeding females.</criteria>
