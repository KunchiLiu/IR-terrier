	<brief_summary>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of Lamictal (lamotrigine) to placebo in neurotic excoriation. Thirty subjects with neurotic excoriation will receive 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with Lamictal (lamotrigine) or matching placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that Lamictal (lamotrigine) will be more effective than placebo in patients with neurotic excoriation. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</brief_summary>
