	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. Eating a diet high in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, may keep cancer from forming. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the effects of dietary soy on estrogens in breast fluid, blood, and urine samples from healthy women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Soy on Estrogens in Breast Fluid, Blood, and Urine Samples From Healthy Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Examine the effects of two daily servings of soy on estrogen levels in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and serum. - Investigate cytologic patterns of epithelial breast cells obtained from NAF as a measure of proliferation in relation to soy intake. - Explore the effect of two daily servings of soy on cytochrome alterations of estrogen metabolism as expressed in the formation of urinary 2-, 16α-, and 4-hydroxy estrogen metabolites. - Compare estrogen levels in NAF and serum measured at the same time during the luteal phase. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I: Participants partake in a high soy diet consisting of 2 daily soy servings (approximately 50mg isoflavones). The choice of soy foods will include ½ cup of tofu, ¾ cup of soy milk, or ¼ cup of soy nuts. Replacement of currently consumed foods with soy foods will be encouraged. - Arm II: Participants will be asked to keep their soy intake below 3 servings per week. The participants will also receive general nutrition counseling. In both arms, intervention continues for 6 months. After 6 months, participants undergo a 1-month washout period and then cross-over to the other intervention arm. Nipple aspirate fluid, urine, and blood samples are collected periodically to measure laboratory endpoints.</detailed_description>
