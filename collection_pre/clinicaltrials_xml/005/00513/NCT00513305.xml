	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether low-dose cytarabine in combination with arsenic trioxide is more effective than low-dose cytarabine alone in achieving complete remission in elderly patients (â‰¥60 years of age) with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient has confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient is unwilling or unable to tolerate conventional induction chemotherapy. The patient has no comorbid conditions that would limit life expectancy to less than 3 months. Patient must meet specific laboratory parameters for study inclusion. The patient has had previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Previous treatment with lowdose cytarabine is not permitted. The patient has a QT interval outside of the protocolspecified range. The patient has laboratory values outside of protocolspecified ranges. The patient is concurrently treated with cytotoxic therapy, radiation, or investigational agents. The patient has uncontrolled, severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or other uncontrolled medical condition. The patient has known central nervous system involvement with AML.</criteria>
