	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of XOMA 052 in subjects with stable Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D). The study is a dose-escalation study designed to evaluate route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous), doses, and dosing regimens for future studies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria for T2D Fasting blood glucose concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) (must be measured within 35 days prior to Day 0) OR Symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., thirst, polyuria, weight loss, visual blurring) AND a casual/random plasma glucose value of ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) (must be measured within 35 days prior to Day 0) HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 12% (DCCT standard) Current T2D of duration &gt; 6 months at Screening T2D and other diseases must be stable. Stable disease is defined as disease that is judged stable by the investigator and which did not require a change in medications or dosing level on 4 or more consecutive days or 7 days in total within 35 days prior to Day 0. Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 at Screening Weight ≥ 80 lbs (36.3 kg) and ≤ 325 lbs (147.4 kg) BMI ≥ 23 and ≤ 40 kg/m2 For female subjects of childbearing age, a negative serum pregnancy test. For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use contraceptive measures adequate to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during the study. Agree not to change diet and exercise regimen during the trial Use of the following medications Antiinflammatory therapy other than aspirin ≤ 100 mg/day; Immunosuppressive treatment; Beta 2 and nonselective adrenergic blockers (Note: selective beta 1 blockers are permitted); Thiazolidinediones; Glucagonlike peptide (GLP) agonists including DPP4 inhibitors Change in medication for diabetes within 35 days prior to Day 0, defined as a change in dosing level on 4 or more consecutive days or 7 days in total Fasting Cpeptide &lt; 400 pM (&lt; 1.20 μg/L) Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL, WBC &lt; 3.0 X 103/mm3, platelet count &lt; 125 X 103/mm3, creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, AST/ALT &gt; 2 X ULN, alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2 X ULN Positive for GAD65 or IA2 autoantibodies Known HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and/or hepatitis C antibody History of malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or adequately treated, nonmetastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal antibodies History of tuberculosis, positive PPD test, active atopic disease requiring medication, or asthma Infectious disease CRP &gt; 30 mg/L, fever, or infection requiring treatment with antibiotics within 3 weeks prior to Screening; History of recurrent infection or predisposition to infection; Active leg or foot ulcer Immunodeficiency Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or breastfeeding History or symptoms of a demyelinating disease Clinically significant diabetic macular edema and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy by history or fundoscopy Receipt of a live (attenuated) vaccine within 3 months prior to Screening Major surgery within 35 days prior to Day 0 Participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 30 days prior to Screening Use of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody within 90 days prior to Screening Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the subject's safety following exposure to the study drug</criteria>
