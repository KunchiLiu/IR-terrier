	<brief_title>Evaluation of Topical Liposomal Lidocaine and Oral Sucrose for Treatment of Pain in Newborns Undergoing Venipuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the fact that modern medical practice is greatly advanced, pain is inflicted on all Canadian newborn infants in the first days and months of life from blood tests, injections and cannulations designed to prevent, diagnose or manage medical conditions. Procedural pain in newborn infants is a significant burden to infants, their parents, healthcare workers, and society at large. This study proposes a large randomized controlled trial to determine the optimal analgesic regimen for procedural pain using methods that can be easily implemented in clinical practice. We will study liposomal lidocaine cream and sucrose oral liquid, used alone, or together, to manage procedural pain. Liposomal lidocaine is a relatively new anaesthetic formulation ideally suited for young infants due to the established role of lidocaine in neonatal clinical medicine. Sucrose (sugar water) reduces pain responses and is promoted in consensus guidelines developed by pain experts. However, it is perceived by many front-line clinicians to be simply a comforting agent rather than a true analgesic. Studying liposomal lidocaine and sucrose together is important since the combination may prove superior to either agent alone, and may even prevent or abolish pain from clinical procedures.</detailed_description>
