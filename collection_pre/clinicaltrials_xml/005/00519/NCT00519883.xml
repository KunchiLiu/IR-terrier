	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, phase III trial of a 12 week exercise program, followed by a 36 week voluntary, self-directed exercise program (total 48 weeks) compared to standard supportive care. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether the exercise program is better than standard supportive care to decrease the muscle and joint aches (musculoskeletal symptoms) that result from aromatase inhibitors. Hypothesis An exercise program that includes stretching, strengthening and aerobic components may improve physical quality of life among women with musculoskeletal symptoms who are taking aromatase inhibitors.</brief_summary>
