	<brief_title>Impact of Ascorbic Acid on Post-Cardiothoracic Surgery Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial Fibrillation is a significant cause of morbidity following cardiothoracic surgery. Despite prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers and amiodarone, post-operative atrial fibrillation occurs in approximately 22% of patients. We believe that by reducing the inflammation that is caused during CTS, we can see further improvements without any negative effects on hemodynamics. Ascorbic acid, a free radical scavenger has been found to lower inflammation mediators but never in a CTS population. This study will help determine the affect of ascorbic acid on the inflammation associated with CTS.</detailed_description>
