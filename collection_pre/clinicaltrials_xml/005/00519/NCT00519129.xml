	<brief_summary>Coloscopy may be a painful procedure for the patient. This is due to a loop-formation of the coloscope. A 3D-real time imager produced by Olympus creates a real-time image of the scope while a traditional fluoroscopy device will only show instant pictures. We want to investigate whether the 3D-imager causes the patient less pain and is more time consuming than ordinary fluoroscopy</brief_summary>
