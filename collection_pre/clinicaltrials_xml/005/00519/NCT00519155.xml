	<mesh_term>Alveolar Bone Loss</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients requiring extraction of teeth with advanced intrabony periodontal defects at single rooted teeth without root concavities/furrows located in the maxilla and mandible (maxillary/mandibular premolars, maxillary incisors; presurgery probing depth ≥ 6 mm, intrasurgery defect depth ≥ 4 mm) or located the mesial or distal aspect of mandibular molar teeth without adjacent teeth (excluding defects also involving the furcation area). Teeth to be treated must be scheduled for extraction in a treatment plan established by clinicians unrelated to the study. Male and female patients, aged 18 75 years Patients must be nonsmokers Female patients must be infertile (either sterilized or postmenopausal). If a patient's menopausal status at screening is uncertain, levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) should be determined. Patients with an FSH level &gt; 25 IU/l and absence of menstrual bleeding &gt; 6 months will satisfy the definition of postmenopausal status. Patient must provide written informed consent Women of childbearing potential, pregnant or lactating women Participation in another clinical study within 30 days prior to study start Previous participation in this study Legal incompetence or restricted legal competence Alcoholism, drug dependency, smoking Acute or chronic infection at the application site Known infection with HIV, HBV, or HCV Severe allergic rhinitis which requires permanent medication Known intolerance of or hypersensitivity to ßTCP or rhGDF?5 Presence of local or systemic malignant disease or history of local or systemic malignant disease in the past 5 years. Patients requiring chemo or radiotherapy Previous or current radiotherapy of the head Chronic liver disorder (AST and/or ALT over 2 times upper limit of normal) Impaired renal function (creatinine over 1.5 times upper limit of normal) Uncontrolled insulindependent diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt; 7%) Clinically relevant symptoms of thyroid dysfunction Severe hypertension (RRdiast &gt; 110 mmHg) Clinically relevant cardiovascular disease e.g., decompensated cardiac insufficiency, hemodynamically relevant heart valve defects, or myocardial infarction during the last three months Systemic bone disease or illness having influence in bone metabolism (e.g. Osteogenesis imperfecta, Paget's disease, EhlersDanlos disease, osteomalacia, renal osteodystrophia, hyperparathyroidism) Clinically relevant blood coagulation disorder Leukopenia &lt; 3.500 leukocytes/µL Previous (within last 2 months before screening visit) or current treatment with systemic corticosteroids of more than 5 mg/day prednisone equivalent Previous or current therapy with drugs having any influence on bone metabolism such as calcitonin or parathormone (as teriparatid) within the last 6 months before screening visit, bisphosphonates or fluoride at least for 30 days within the last 12 months before screening visit Previous (within last 2 months before screening visit) or current treatment with immunosuppressant</criteria>
