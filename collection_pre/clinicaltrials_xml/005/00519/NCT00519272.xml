	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Examining the Barriers to Care for Harris County Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about what prevents women with cervical cancer from getting early and possibly curative treatment. This study consists of a series of questionnaires that ask questions about religion; coping; access to health care; physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being; understanding of health questions; control; fear; anxiety; and other health beliefs to determine why some women delay coming in for check-ups and why some women do not complete their treatments. It is thought that health beliefs influence behavior practices and that by identifying these issues, things can be done to improve the health condition and results for these patients. You will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires at 2 specific time points: The first time point will be before treatment begins and the second time point will be within a month following completion of treatment. Filling out the questionnaires should take about 45 minutes each time. You should have adequate time to complete these questionnaires during your clinic appointment. If you want to take part but are too ill to complete the questionnaires, you will be provided a pre-addressed, stamped envelope, so that you can mail them back to the study staff at your earliest convenience. This is an investigational study. This is an investigational study. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled at Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital.</detailed_description>
