	<brief_summary>The study evaluated renal graft function (based on the calculated creatinine clearance) 6 months after kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of 'reduced-dose' tacrolimus + sirolimus + corticosteroids or a regimen of 'standard-dose' tacrolimus + sirolimus + corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Standard Dose and Reduced Dose Tacrolimus With Sirolimus in Renal Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluated renal graft function (based on the calculated creatinine clearance) 6 months after kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of 'reduced-dose' tacrolimus + sirolimus + corticosteroids or a regimen of 'standard-dose' tacrolimus + sirolimus + corticosteroids. The two treatment groups were also compared with respect to the incidence of acute graft rejection at 6 months and patient and graft survival at 6 months after transplantation.</detailed_description>
