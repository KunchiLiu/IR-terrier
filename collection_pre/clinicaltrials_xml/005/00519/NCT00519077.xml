	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the activity (response rate and rate of stable disease) of Iressa administered as a single agent escalated to a dose that produces grade 2 skin toxicity in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Skin Toxicity Dosing of IRESSA (Gefitinib) in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label, multi-institution, phase II study evaluated the activity of gefitinib at individually escalated doses up to 750mg to achieve the skin toxicity grade greater than or equal to 2. Patients were started on gefitinib 250mg orally daily for 2 weeks. At 2 weeks, patients were reevaluated and given skin toxicity grade according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 (CTC 3.0). Patients with grade 2 or greater skin toxicity remained on 250 mg daily; in patients with grade 0-1 skin toxicity the dose was escalated to 500 mg daily and again to 750 mg daily on next evaluation until grade 2 or greater skin toxicity was developed. The protocol was later amended because of the reported lower efficacy of the 250 mg dose and patients were then started at 500 mg per day. There was no further dose escalation beyond 750 mg per day irrespective of the response or grade of skin toxicity. Therapy was discontinued upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or patient's withdrawal of consent. Dose interruptions were used as the first approach to managing the toxicity of the patients who experienced grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicities. Gefitinib was interrupted for up to a maximum of 14 days until the toxicities dropped to grade 1 or less. Adherence to therapy was monitored using drug diaries that were collected at each physician visit and assessed against pill counts.</detailed_description>
