	<brief_summary>This study involves research to investigate how estrogen affects women of childbearing age and its correlation to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The findings from this study might help determine how body cells, called T Cells, react to estrogen. The study will seek to determine if cells from women with Lupus, react differently from cells in persons without Lupus. We will attempt to identify genetic factors that determine the effects of estrogen on Lupus cells.</brief_summary>
