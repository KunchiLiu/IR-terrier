	<brief_title>Testing MST to Improve Adherence Among Youth With Chronic Poor Metabolic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substantial data exists to demonstrate that improving metabolic control in persons with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) can delay the onset of diabetes complications and reverse some existing complications as well. Unfortunately, those adolescents with T1DM who are at highest risk for diabetes complications are often the most resistant to hospital based care and traditional education/ supportive interventions. They are also faced with multiple barriers to improved metabolic control, which may include lack of knowledge about diabetes, family disorganization and disengagement, high levels of stress and an unhealthy lifestyle. Multisystemic Therapy (MST), a flexible and home-based therapeutic intervention originally designed for use with mental health populations, seems to be a promising approach to providing diabetic adolescents with the ability to engage in consistent and attentive illness management. The study recruited a sample of 127 adolescents in poor metabolic control and randomly assigned them to either the treatment intervention, MST plus standard medical care, or standard medical care alone. Families randomized to MST received intensive, home-based family therapy for approximately six months. Families completed data collection at baseline and then again at 7, 12 18 and 24 months after study entry.</detailed_description>
