	<brief_title>The Effect of Calcium on Fecal Fat and Energy Excretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several reports have found inverse associations between calcium intake and body weight. Few intervention studies have shown that a high calcium diet resulted in a greater body weight loss than a low calcium diet. The mechanism is not clear, but one possible explanation is reduced absorption of fat in the gut, due to formation of insoluble calcium fatty acid soaps or binding of bile acids which impairs the formation of micelles. The aim of this study is to examined if a high calcium intake from dairy products, in diets high or normal in fat content, have an effect on fecal energy and fat excretion, concentrations of substrates involved in energy metabolism and blood pressure.</detailed_description>
