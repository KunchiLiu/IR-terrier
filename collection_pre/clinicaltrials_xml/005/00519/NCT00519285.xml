	<brief_summary>Primary objective was to demonstrate overall survival improvement with aflibercept compared to placebo in patients receiving docetaxel / prednisone for metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (MAIPC). The secondary objectives were: - To assess the efficacy of aflibercept compared to placebo on other parameters such prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, cancer related pain, progression free survival (PFS), tumor-based and skeletal events and health-related quality of life (HRQL); - To assess the overall safety in both treatment arms; - To determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) aflibercept in this population; - to determine immunogenicity of IV aflibercept.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consisted in 3-week treatment cycles until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or participant's refusal of further study treatment. After disease progression, participants were to be followed every 3 months until death or the study cutoff date, whichever came first. The study cut-off date was event-driven and was defined as the date when 873 deaths had occurred.</detailed_description>
