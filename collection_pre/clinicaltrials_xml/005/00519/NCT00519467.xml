	<brief_summary>Drug resistance to a range of antimalarial treatments has become widespread in Africa, South East Asia and South America. Because the rapid spread of drug resistance threatens a public health disaster in these areas of the world and to comply with the WHO-Roll Back Malaria policy of using Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), there is a need to develop new, safe, effective and affordable ACT. Chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CDA)is a new ACT that is being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Africa.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presentation to a healthcare facility with probable uncomplicated clinical malaria Adults aged between 18 and 60 years , or children aged between 12 and 120 months Weight between 5 and 85kg Pure [on microscopic grounds] screening P. falciparum parasitaemia in children from 25,000 to 100,000ul1, or in adults from 10,000 to 100,000ul1. [The parasitaemia range for adults was originally set at 25,000 to 100,000µl1 and changed to 10,000 to 100,000µl1 in protocol amendment 3 dated 05 May 2004] Written or oral witnessed consent obtained from subject, parent or guardian Compliance with the requirements of the protocol which include a hospital stay of 4 days and 3 nights and regular blood samples by fingerprick (children) or via a cannula (adults) A negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing age on enrolment Features of severe/complicated falciparum malaria Known allergy to sulphonamides Evidence of any concomitant infection at the time of presentation (including P. ovale and P. malaria) Any other underlying disease that would compromise the diagnosis and the evaluation of the response to the study medication (including clinical symptoms of immunosuppression, tuberculosis and bacterial infection) Treatment in the 28days prior to screening with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (FANSIDAR, CELOXINE), sulfalene/pyrimethamine (METAKELFIN), mefloquinesulfadoxinepyrimethamine (FANSIMET), chloroquine* (NIVAQUINE); treatment in the 21days prior to screening with mefloquine, or 7days prior to screening with amodiaquine, halofantrine, quinine (full course), atovaquone proguanil, artemisinins, coartemether, tetracycline or clindamycin, or treatment for 5 halflives prior to screening with drugs that have a potential antimalarial activity (e.g. cotrimoxazole in the previous 60 hours) Use of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to screening Previous participation in this study A positive pregnancy test at enrolment, women of childbearing age who do not take a pregnancy test or female subjects who are breastfeeding an infant for the duration of the study</criteria>
