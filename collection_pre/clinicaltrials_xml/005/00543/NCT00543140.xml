	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long term safety of the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) in subjects with an SAGB in place. Specifically it is designed to determine the re-operation rate (band revision, band replacement and explants resulting from serious adverse device-related event {SADE}) of gastric banding at 4 and 5 year post implant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NCT00543140 (CI-06-0001) is the 2 year Safety and QOL subject follow-up study to NCT00166205 (CI-02-0006), completed on November 10, 2008. As a condition of approval, the FDA required additional subjects with long-term safety data. These subjects enrolled under protocol CI-07-0006 (NCT00813462)-5 Year Post-Approval Study With the REALIZE (TM) Adjustable Gastric Band. Protocol CI-06-0001 was amended to combine these study subjects with study subjects from CI-07-0006. NCT00543140 (CI-06-0001) will not be completed (analysis of results) until the additional subjects in NCT00813462 (CI-07-0006) complete this study since the original intent was to pool the data together from the above two studies to obtain the appropriate sample size for estimation of the re-operation rate at 4 and 5 years post implantation.</detailed_description>
