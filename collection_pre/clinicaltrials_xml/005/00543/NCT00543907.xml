	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to analyze an institution's experience with starting a subspecialized DIEP flap program and to determine whether other hospitals would benefit from instituting a similar program. Prior studies have compared the outcome from a DIEP flap program with that of TRAM flaps within the same center. Other studies have calculated the cost of a DIEP flap and its complication rate. However, no one has examined the overall effects of a subspecialized reconstruction program and its impact on a health center. In this study, we will determine if the institutionalization of a DIEP flap program has increased our center's rate of breast reconstruction, as well as evaluate its outcomes and overall financial viability.</detailed_description>
