	<brief_title>Saccharomyces Boulardii in Diarrhea Dominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder and may lead to impaired social and personal function and can diminish quality of life.While the precise pathophysiology of IBS remains to be elucidated, dysmotility and altered visceral sensory perception are currently the most popular hypothesis. There has been a suggestion that some patients with IBS may harbor bacterial overgrowth leading to low grade inflammation, immune activation, and their symptoms may be ameliorated by its eradication.Probiotics, defined as live or attenuated bacteria or micro organism that confer a significant health benefit to the host. - I. Firstly, probiotic organism exert antibacterial and antiviral effects. - II. Probiotics could alter the composition of the gut flora, either directly through augmentation of commensal or indirectly through a reduction in pathogen related inflammation or bacterial fermentation. Trial protocol: Phase 1: placebo BID (1 week),both arms Phase 2: Randomization by pharmacy, placebo vs. active drug (6 weeks) Phase 3: placebo BID (1 week), both arms -III. Probiotics have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects at mucosal surfaces by reducing mucosal inflammation, decreasing immune mediated activation of enteric motor and sensory neurons and modifying neural traffic between the gut and central nervous system. Saccharomyces Boulardii is a probiotic yeast and its role for the treatment of IBS has not been extensively investigated.</detailed_description>
