	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, which may lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin has become the standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C. While genotype 2 patients can have higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates to 80-90%, genotype 1 patients generally have low SVR rates of only 40-50%. In contrast, genotype 1 Taiwanese patients have superior SVR rates than those in Western countries. Despite the overall improved response to this combination therapy, more than 75% of patients suffer from treatment-related adverse events and the costs remain high, which make individualized therapy of paramount importance to maximize treatment response and minimize adverse events. HCV viral kinetics with interferon-based therapies have been studied recently to evaluate patient responses. Early viral kinetics shown to have favorable SVR rates, which make shorter treatment duration possible. However, different viral kinetics were found through ethnicity. Recently, a pilot study to evaluate the viral kinetics of 6 Taiwanese patients with HCV infection who received peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy has shown superior early viral kinetics to those in Caucasian patients. Based on the favorable SVR rates in treating Taiwanese patients with chronic hepatitis C, the investigators aimed to conduct a large confirmatory study to evaluate the viral kinetics and try to define the optimal treatment for these patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, which may lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [1,2] Recently, treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin has become the standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C. While genotype 2 patients can have higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates to 80-90%, genotype 1 patients generally have low SVR rates of only 40-50%. [3-5] In contrast, genotype 1 Taiwanese patients have superior SVR rates that those in Western countries. [6,7] Despite the overall improved response to this combination therapy, more than 75% of patients suffer from treatment-related adverse events and the costs remain high, [8,9] which make individualized therapy of paramount importance to maximize treatment response and minimize adverse events. HCV viral kinetics with interferon-based therapies have been studied recently to evaluate patient responses. [10-14] Early viral kinetics shown to have favorable SVR rates, which make shorter treatment duration possible. [15-18] However, different viral kinetics were found through ethnicity. [19-23] Recently, a pilot study to evaluate the viral kinetics of 6 Taiwanese patients with HCV infection who received peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy has shown superior early viral kinetics to those in Caucasian patients.
