	<brief_summary>Superiority of additional Remote Patient Monitoring in patients with CHF In comparison to usual care in terms of: - reduction of mortality rate - reduction of hospitalizations - increasement of patients' quality of life</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial assesses 710 patients over a period of at least 15 months each (2008 until 2010); all participants will continue to receive usual care from their GP. All patients will be examined at the beginning of the study and will undergo a check-up every 3 months. 355 of the patients will be randomly allocated to receive devices for Remote Patient Monitoring which will measure various parameters on a daily basis (e.g., weight, blood pressure, heart rate). The devices are mobile and can be used at home or elsewhere.</detailed_description>
