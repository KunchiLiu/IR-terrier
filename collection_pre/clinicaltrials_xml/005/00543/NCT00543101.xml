	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate patients who have achieved virologic suppression (&lt; 400 copies/mL) on any dual protease inhibitor (PI) combination, to determine whether patients can substitute both PIs with the single boosted PI darunavir given 600/100 ritonavir (RTV) twice daily (BID) and maintain comparable virologic suppression (% &lt; 50 c/mL) for 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Substitution of Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/r) for Dual-boosted Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if patients who have achieved virologic suppression (&lt; 400 copies/mL) on any dual PI combination, can substitute both PIs with the single boosted PI darunavir given 600/100 rtv bid and maintain comparable virologic suppression (% &lt; 50 c/mL) for 24 weeks. Randomized, non-blinded, multicenter, 48 week, controlled trial to assess the non-inferiority of substituting DRV/r for a dual boosted PI combination in patients with stable virologic suppression on a regimen containing a dual boosted PI combination plus at least one additional FDA-licensed antiretroviral agent from another class. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to one of the included treatment arms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or older Treatment with a stable antiretroviral regimen containing two protease inhibitors, one additional FDAlicensed agent from another class (except NNRTIs) and a boosting dosage of ritonavir (100 BID or QD) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening No plans to make any changes in HIV treatment regimen (other than those required by study) in the next 48 weeks. HIV1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml based on the most recent value done as part of routine care at least 12 weeks prior to screening; and &lt; 400 at screening Any CD4 count is allowed Written informed consent to participate Current regimen includes an NNRTI CDC Class C Illness diagnosed within 30 days of screening Lab abnormalities as defined by a standardized grading scheme based on the DAIDS table Any grade 3 or 4 toxicity with the following exceptions: Preexisting diabetes with glucose elevations ≥ grade 3 triglyceride or total cholesterol elevations ≥ grade 3 Clinical or laboratory evidence of clinically significant liver impairment/dysfunction, disease or cirrhosis Note: Individuals coinfected with chronic hepatitis B or C will be allowed to enter the trial if their condition is clinically stable. Individuals diagnosed with acute viral hepatitis at screening will not be allowed to enroll during acute phase. Active substance abuse or significant psychiatric illness that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with study compliance. Use of any investigational agents 30 days prior to screening Life expectancy &lt; 6 months in the opinion of the investigator Prior use of darunavir or known allergy to any of the components of darunavir Breast feeding Female subject of childbearing potential not using effective nonhormonal birth control methods or not willing to continue practicing these birth control methods from screening until the last trial related activity. Note: Hormonal based contraception may not be reliable when taking darunavir, therefore to be eligible for this study, women of childbearing potential who may have vaginal intercourse should either: 1. Use a double barrier method to prevent pregnancy (i.e., using a condom with either a diaphragm or cervical cap) Or 2. Use hormonal based contraceptives in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom) Or 3. Use an intra uterine device (IUD) in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom) Or 4. Be nonheterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence or have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile).</criteria>
