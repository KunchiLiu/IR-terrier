Subjects who have any other disease(s), by history, physical examination, or laboratory abnormalities (ALT or AST &gt; 2fold the upper limit of normal, bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, or creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL) or that in the investigator's opinion present undue risk to the subject or may confound the interpretation of study results must be excluded.</criteria>
