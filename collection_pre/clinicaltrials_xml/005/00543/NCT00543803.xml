	<brief_summary>This observational study is supposed to assess (under conditions of clinical practice in daily routine) whether treatment with Viramune (nevirapine) in combination with Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine) will durably suppress viral load below the limit of detection or will maintain suppression of viral replication (HIV-RNA below limit of detection) achieved under previous anti-retroviral combination therapy after switch to combination treatment of Viramune (nevirapine) and Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine).</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Emtricitabine, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Drug Combination</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria male and female adult HIV type 1 infected patients, who have either not been treated previously, whose previous combination treatment with PIs has failed, or who have to switch their previous treatment from protease inhibitors (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRT)I due to side effects or intolerability after achieving suppression of viral load below the limit of detection. Viramune (nevirapine) is indicated as part of combination therapy for the antiviral treatment of HIV1 infected patients with advanced or progressive immunodeficiency. Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine) is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV1 infected adults. Exclusion criteria Age &lt; 18 years Pregnant female patients Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Viramune (nevirapine) or Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine). Viramune (nevirapine) should not be readministered to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine. Viramune (nevirapine) should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh C) or pretreatment aspartine transaminase (ASAT) or alanine transaminase (ALAT) &gt; 5 upper limit normal (ULN) until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised &lt; 5 ULN. Viramune (nevirapine) should not be readministered in patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT &gt; 5 ULN during Viramune (nevirapine) therapy and had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of Viramune (nevirapine) Herbal preparations containing St Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking Viramune (nevirapine) due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine The available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and Viramune (nevirapine) is not recommended.</criteria>
