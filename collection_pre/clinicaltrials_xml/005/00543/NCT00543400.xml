	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using M118 as an anticoagulant in the target population of subjects with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of M118 on procedural indices including procedure success, abrupt closure, post-procedure TIMI flow, and catheter thrombus. Substudy Primary Objective The primary objective of the substudy is to characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of M118 among subjects with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective PCI.</brief_summary>
