	<brief_summary>This research project designed to diagnose sinusitis using a simple and low-cost optical tool. Healthy sinuses are typically filled with air, and show up as bright spots on the camera. Infected sinuses are filled with fluid and show up dark spots on the camera. Images of infected sinuses could be used to diagnose sinusitis, or to check if surgical treatments on the sinuses have been successful.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This device consists of a specialized flashlight that uses mostly non-visible light, and a small camera to record the light. The tool is the size and shape of spoon. The technique of shining light into the mouth, face, and sinuses is known as "transillumination" and has been used for nearly a century to aid in the diagnosis of sinusitis. The tool described in this study is a custom made device that uses light that is invisible to the eye.</detailed_description>
