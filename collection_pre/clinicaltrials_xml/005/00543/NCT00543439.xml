	<criteria>Male subjects, aged less than 6 years, with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A. A negative FVIII inhibitor titer at screening, and a medical history negative for a past FVIII inhibitor. At least 20 exposure days to any FVIII replacement product. Adequate hepatic and renal function CD4 count &gt; 400 cells/uL, and if receiving antiviral therapy must be on a stable regimen Additional criteria for subjects participating in the PK assessment: Male subjects as described immediately above except they must have a FVIII Activity of less than or equal to 1% confirmed by the central laboratory screening test Age &lt; 6 years at time of PK assessment. The subject's size is sufficient to permit PKrelated phlebotomy. The subject is able to comply with the procedures conducted during the PK assessment, including a mandatory 72hour washout period preceding the PK assessment. A history of FVIII inhibitor. Presence of a bleeding disorder in addition to hemophilia A. Treatment with any investigational drug or device within 30 days before the time of signing the informed consent form. Major or orthopedic surgery planned to occur during the course of the study. Regular (e.g., daily, every other day) use of antifibrinolytic agents or medications known to influence platelet function such as aspirin or certain nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or regular, concomitant therapy with immunomodulating drugs (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG], routine systemic corticosteroids). Known hypersensitivity to hamster protein.</criteria>
