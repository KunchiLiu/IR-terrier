	<brief_summary>Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive and negative Her2 tumours. Estimation of the 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm is 80%. The experimental arm is expected to increase the 5-year disease-free survival by 4% (up to 84%). With an alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power, 1445 patients per arm are needed. Assuming a 10% post-randomization drop-out, 3180 patients in total are needed. Before randomization, the patients will be stratified according to the center, positive nodes(0 vs. 1-3 vs. ≥4), previous chemotherapy (yes vs no) and hormonal receptors status.</brief_summary>
