	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical cure rates of two dosing regimens of iclaprim with vancomycin (every 12 hours [q12h]) in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) suspected or confirmed to be due to Gram-positive pathogens.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Suspected or confirmed acute bacterial pneumonia due to Grampositive pathogens in one of the following subgroups: hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP), i.e., pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after admission, which was not incubating at the time of admission; or ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP), i.e., pneumonia that arises more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation; or healthcareassociated pneumonia (HCAP), i.e., pneumonia diagnosed within 48 hours of hospital admission, in a patient who fulfills at least one of the following criteria: 1. hospitalization for at least two days within 90 days of the current infection, 2. residence in a nursing home or longterm care facility, 3. recipient of intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care within 30 days of the current infection Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry (APACHE) II score &lt; 8 or â‰¥ 25. Pneumonia not requiring empiric or targeted treatment effective against Grampositive pathogens. Pulmonary infection due to Grampositive organisms known to be resistant to either study medication prior to study entry.</criteria>
