	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study is to conduct a multicenter, dual country (United States and Israel), study examining the experience of patients with cancer that were considered by their physicians as having exceptional course of survival related to their specific disease state. The primary aim of the study is to develop a detailed description of patients' experience of an exceptional disease course. The secondary aim is to define the content domain for assessment and measurement of exceptional disease course in patients with cancer and identify lessons learned from these exceptional patients that can be a base for future studies to benefit others.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Exceptional Patient in Cancer Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators of this study are exploring the experience of people with cancer who are considered by their physicians as having an exceptional course of disease - people who have defied the odds and remain well despite the severity of the original diagnosis. Participation in this study is completely voluntary. Lessons learned from recorded experience(s) may be helpful to other patients and can be a basis for future studies that may benefit other patients. To participate in this important study is simple and not time consuming. You will have only one face-to-face or telephone interview with a research assistant. During the interview you will simply be asked to describe your perspective, thoughts, and behaviors that you think are related to your disease course and lessons that you think others may gain benefit from. The interview will last about one hour and will be conducted at a time that is convenient for you. If you agree to participate a research assistant will schedule a time for a recorded interview by phone or if possible at a location convenient to you. The interviews will be taped and transcribed. All recorded interviews will be retained for a minimum of 6 years.</detailed_description>
