	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of V503 in comparison to GARDASIL. The primary hypotheses tested in the study are 1) V503 administered to 16- to 26-year-old adolescents and young women is generally well-tolerated, 2) V503 reduces combined incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 31/33/45/52/58-related disease compared with GARDASIL, and 3) V503 induces non-inferior geometric mean titers for HPV Type 6/11/16/18 antibodies compared with GARDASIL.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study includes a double-blind, dose-finding evaluation of a 3-dose regimen of 3 dose formulations of V503 and GARDASIL (Base Study Part A), a double-blind, safety/efficacy evaluation of a 3-dose regimen of the V503 dose formulation selected in Part A and GARDASIL (Base Study Part B), and an open-label extension consisting of 2 substudies: an evaluation of immune memory in participants receiving a fourth vaccination with V503 (Extension Cohort 1) and an opportunity for participants who received GARDASIL in the base study to receive a 3-dose regimen of V503 (Extension Cohort 2).</detailed_description>
