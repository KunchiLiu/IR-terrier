	<brief_summary>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been established as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals has developed an HPV vaccine (580299) which targets the 2 most common oncogenic HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18), found in approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. In previous trials this vaccine has been found to be efficacious in the prevention of incident and persistent HPV-16/18 infections and associated cytological abnormalities and cervical dysplasia. In this partially-blind study, GSK Biologicals will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine using an alternative schedule and an alternative dosing when administered in healthy young females aged 9 to 25 years, as compared to the standard HPV vaccine. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007. The protocol posting has been updated following a protocol amendment.</brief_summary>

Healthy subjects as established by medical history and historyoriented clinical examination before entering into the study. Subject must be of nonchildbearing potential, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period (up to Month 24). Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (up to Month 24), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before and 30 days after the first dose of vaccine. Planned administration/administration of routine vaccines, up to 8 days before the first dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window. Pregnant or breastfeeding female. A woman planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions during the study period, up to two months after the last vaccine dose. Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period (up to Month 24). Previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine. Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment. Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Hypersensitivity to latex. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory tests.
