	<detailed_description>A.Screening / Baseline visit (V1; Day 0) After signing the informed consent form, patients' DSM-IV multiaxial examination, physical examination, vital sign, pregnancy test, BMI will be conducted. The demographics, medical history, and concomitant medication will be recorded. After evaluating all variables obtained, the eligible patients will be enrolled into study.Patients who fulfill the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be performed the laboratory tests, PANSS, EPS (AIMS &amp; BARS), menstrual function, sexual function (Arizona sexual experience scale) and prolaction. Afterwards, the treatment period will be started to add-on with first medication (7.5 or 15 mg daily by patient, which was prescribed by investigator) to current antipsychotics at this visit. Besides, drug accounting and adverse events will also be recorded at this visit. Patients are maintained on current doses of antipsychotics, and all other medicines. B.Treatment phase (V2~V3; 2~4 Week finished; 14±3~28±3 Day finished) The vital sign, physical examination, BMI, laboratory tests (at V3), PANSS, EPS (AIMS &amp; BARS), menstrual function, sexual function (Arizona sexual experience scale), and prolactin will be carried out. Concomitant medication, adverse events, and drug accounting will also be recorded at this visit. Study drug could be titrated with a flexible dose from 7.5 to 30 mg QD. All dose adjustments should be made with the approval of the investigator. C.Completion visit (V4; 8 Week Finished; 56±7 Day finished, or Early termination) The vital sign, physical examination, pregnancy test, BMI, laboratory tests, PANSS, EPS (AIMS &amp; BARS), menstrual function, sexual function (Arizona sexual experience scale), prolactin will be carried out. Concomitant medication, adverse events, and drug accounting will also be recorded at this visit.</detailed_description>
