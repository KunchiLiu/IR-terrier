	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators sought to determine whether an acoustic cardiographic assessment of heart function is equivalent to Doppler-echocardiography in patients who are treated with cardio-toxic cytostatic agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acoustic Cardiographic Assessment of Heart Function in Comparison to Doppler-echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receiving cardio-toxic cytostatic agents are examined by Doppler-echocardiography and acoustic cardiography before, during, and after the cytostatic treatment. Doppler-echocardiography measures ejection fraction, TDI, speckle tracking, and further parameters. Acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical Inc., Portland, USA) simultaneously integrates heart sounds and single-channel electrocardiography input to generate multiple parameters that correlate to established hemodynamic measures. Heart function as assessed by Doppler-echocardiography is then compared to the heart function as assessed by Audicor ECG.</detailed_description>
