	<brief_summary>Context: Cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin are stimulated during meal intake by the presence of fat in the small intestine. The sequence of events suggests that fat hydrolysis is crucial for triggering the release. Objectives: The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether CCK mediated the effect of intraduodenal (ID) fat on neurotensin secretion via CCK-1 receptors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Setting: Single center study; 34 male volunteers were studied in consecutive, randomized, double blind, crossover studies. Subjects and Methods: CCK and neurotensin release were quantified in: 1) 12 subjects receiving an ID fat infusion with or without 60 mg orlistat, an irreversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, in comparison to vehicle. 2) 12 subjects receiving ID long chain fatty acids (LCF), ID medium chain fatty acids (MCF) or ID vehicle. 3) 10 subjects receiving ID LCF with and without the CCK-1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide (DEXLOX) or ID vehicle plus IV saline (placebo). Hormone concentrations were measured by specific RIA systems.</detailed_description>
