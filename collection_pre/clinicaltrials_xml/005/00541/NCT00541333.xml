	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to investigate in eyes with dry AMD, the efficacy and safety as preventive therapy of the immunomodulatory substance named copaxone which had been proven as safe and effective agent for a neurodegenerative disease, in arresting the progression as well as the conversion of dry AMD to wet AMD. The hypothesis that the immunomodulatory agent copaxone proven for a neurodegenerative disease may work in the eye is revolutionary and may open a new avenue of preventive treatment for the disease which is the major cause of legal blindness in the industrial world</brief_summary>
