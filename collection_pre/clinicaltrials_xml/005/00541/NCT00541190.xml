	<brief_summary>The objective of this overall project is to develop a new aerosol-based technique for quantifying liquid absorption in the airways of subjects with cystic fibrosis(CF) that can be used to help develop new therapies. In CF, mutations in the CF gene result in dysfunction of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) ion channel on the cells that line the airway epithelium, causing improper fluxes of ions such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The so called "low volume" hypothesis of CF pathogenesis contends that abnormal absorption of ions from the airways causes excessive absorption of liquid, resulting in an airway surface liquid layer that is dehydrated and difficult to clear. Here we are measuring the absorption rate of a radiolabeled small molecule (DTPA) from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and healthy controls. We hypothesize that the molecule will absorb more quickly in cystic fibrosis patients. Further studies will be performed to determine if DTPA absorption is related to liquid absorption in the airways.</brief_summary>
