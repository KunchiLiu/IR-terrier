	<brief_summary>We are doing this study to find out if extra medicine is needed to avoid the chance of nausea sometimes linked to narcotic pain medicine (for example, morphine, dilaudid, fentanyl). Some doctors always give medicine to prevent the possible side effect of nausea, while others do not. We are looking to see if this extra medicine is helpful in preventing nausea. The goal is to screen all patients with pain and enroll enough subjects to reach our goal of 164 evaluable study participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Narcotic-Induced Nausea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to one of two study groups. They will then be asked to rate their pain and nausea on a line graph. If the patient is a female of child bearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be done per standard of care. After this, an IV catheter will be placed in a vein in the patients arm. Pain medicine will be given through this IV per the doctor's order. With this medicine, patients will be given 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) of either Sodium Chloride (salt water) or Phenergan mixed with Sodium Chloride (salt water). Phenergan is a medication typically used to help with nausea and is a common ingredient in prescription cough medicine. After this is finished, patients will be asked to rate their pain and nausea in 30 minutes, and again 1, 2, and 4 hours later. If the doctor decides the patient is able to be discharged from the emergency room before the 4 hours are up, they will be asked to rate your pain and nausea again before going home, and the study will be stopped at that time.</detailed_description>
