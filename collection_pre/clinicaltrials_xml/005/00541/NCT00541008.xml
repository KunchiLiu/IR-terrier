	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works as first-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic papillary renal cell (kidney) cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib malate. Secondary - To evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients. - To determine time-to-event variables of overall survival, time to disease progression, time to response, and duration of response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once a day on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then periodically thereafter.</detailed_description>
