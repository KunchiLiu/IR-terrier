	<brief_summary>Triplane and Juvenile Tillaux fractures of the ankle are well known in adolescent pediatric population. It is widely accepted, that optimal treatment for displaced fractures is close or open reduction and fixation with screws under general anesthesia and under intraoperative fluoroscopy control. Usually a small degree of displacement (up to 2mm) is expected to be healed without any sequences. Until now, no evidence of ankle function and pain after skeletal maturity or long follow-up was published. More than that, no comparative study between operative and no operative treatment of mild and borderline displaced fractures were published. The purpose of this study is to evaluate functional and radiographic results of operatively and conservatively treated patients after they reach skeletal maturity.</brief_summary>
