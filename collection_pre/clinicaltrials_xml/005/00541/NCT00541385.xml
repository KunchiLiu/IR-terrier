	<brief_summary>- The primary objective of this clinical study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the fixed combination of pyronaridine artesunate granule formulation (60:20 mg; paediatric PYRAMAX®) by showing a PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological cure rate of more than 90%. - Treatment success or failures will be classified according to WHO Guidelines 2005</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyronaridine Artesunate 3:1 Granule Formulation vs. Coartem© Crushed Tablets in P. Falciparum Malaria Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need for safe and efficacious anti-malarial treatments for infants and children is huge given that they are the major group affected by acute uncomplicated malaria. There are relatively few paediatric formulations of artemisinin combination therapies. In addition to the tablet formulation of pyronaridine artesunate (PA) (PYRAMAX), Shin Poong Pharm Co is developing a paediatric dosing form presented as a granule formulation, packed in appropriate aluminium sachets each containing 60mg pyronaridine tetraphosphate and 20mg artesunate. This Phase III study is designed to demonstrate that the efficacy of PA granule formulation, as assessed in terms of PCR-corrected APCR, is above 90% and subsequently to compare (non-inferiority) the efficacy and safety of PA granule formulation to Coartem® crushed tablets in infants and children.</detailed_description>

Presence of significant anaemia, as defined by Hb &lt; 8 g/dL. 6. Presence of febrile conditions caused by diseases other than malaria. 7. Known history of hypersensitivity, allergic or adverse reactions to pyronaridine, lumefantrine or artesunate or other artemisinins. 8.
