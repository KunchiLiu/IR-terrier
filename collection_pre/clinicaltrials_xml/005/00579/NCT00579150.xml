	<brief_summary>This is an observational, prospective cohort study describing pregnancy outcomes in women with pre-existing (prior to pregnancy) type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to any formulation of exenatide during pregnancy. The pregnancy registry will compare the occurrence of the pregnancy outcomes of interest with those collected from a prospective group of women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to one or more antidiabetic medications other than exenatide during pregnancy. Insulin exposures are acceptable in both groups but must be in addition to one or more other antidiabetic medications in the non-exenatide group. The primary study objective is to evaluate the percentage of major birth defects (i.e., those that caused significant functional or cosmetic impairment, required surgery, or were life-limiting) following use of exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes compared to the percentage of major birth defects following use of one or more antidiabetic medications other than exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The secondary objectives of the Exenatide Pregnancy Registry are to evaluate the percentage of other adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth) and any potential impact of exenatide use during breastfeeding among pregnancies or births in women who used exenatide for pre-existing type 2 diabetes: This study is being conducted in the United States (US). Enrollment in the Registry is voluntary. The Exenatide Pregnancy Registry is sponsored by AstraZeneca and is managed by INC Research, LLC. The scientific conduct and analysis of the Registry is overseen by a Registry Review Committee (RRC) consisting of experts in maternal and fetal medicine, teratology/genetics, epidemiology, type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and/or pediatrics.</brief_summary>
