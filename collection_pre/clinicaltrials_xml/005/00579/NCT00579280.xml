	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of quetiapine SR monotherapy and divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in comparison to placebo in the treatment of ambulatory bipolar disorder with co-morbid lifetime panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and current at least moderately severe anxiety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quetiapine SR and Divalproex Sodium ER in the Treatment of Anxiety in Bipolar Disorder With Panic Disorder and/or GAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of quetiapine SR monotherapy compared to divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and current diagnosis at least moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized to obtain 90 subjects who complete the 8-week trial (30 completers per treatment group). This calculation is based on drop out rates in a similar patient population carried out by this group of collaborators. Subjects will be randomized to quetiapine SR or divalproex sodium ER or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. No concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn lorazepam during the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, prn zolpidem and zaleplon for the management of insomnia and benztropine for the management of EPS. Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.</detailed_description>

Subjects with a current DSMIV TR Axis I diagnosis of delirium, dementia, amnesia, or other cognitive disorders; a DSMIV TR diagnosis of a substance dependence disorder within the past six months; a lifetime DSMIV TR psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) Subjects with serious general medical illnesses including hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurological, or hematological disease as determined by the clinical judgment of the clinical investigator. Subjects with hypoor hyperthyroidism unless stabilized on thyroid replacement &gt; 3 months Subjects with a clinically significant abnormality in their prestudy physical exam, vital signs, EKG, or laboratory tests Subjects who are allergic to or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to either of the active study medications Women who are pregnant or nursing Subjects who have received an experimental drug or used an experimental device within 30 days Subjects who have a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome A patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) fulfilling one of the following criteria: Unstable DM defined as enrollment glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) &gt;8.5% Admitted to hospital for treatment of DM or DM related illness within the past 12 weeks Not under physician care for DM Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not indicated that the patient's DM is controlled Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not approved the patient's participation in the study Has not been on the same dose of oral hypoglycemic drug(s) and/or diet for the 4 weeks before randomization. For thiazolidinediones (glitazones) this period should not be less than 8 weeks before randomization Taking insulin whose daily dose on one occasion in the past 4 weeks has been more than 10% above or below their mean dose in the preceding 4 weeks Note: If a patient with DM meets one of these criteria, the patient is to be excluded even if the treating physician believes that the patient is stable and can participate in the study</criteria>
