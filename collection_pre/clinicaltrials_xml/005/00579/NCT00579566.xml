	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study normal and sarcoma cells. To study these cells we need to have human tissue. You will be having or have already had a procedure to remove tissue. We would like to use some of this tissue. We will use it for laboratory studies on the diagnosis,behavior and treatment of sarcoma. We will perform an extensive analysis of your samples. We will only use extra tissue left over after all needed testing has been done or remove an additional small amount of tissue if you are having a biopsy. We will also take blood samples before and/or after your procedure to measure biochemical factors that may help us predict the behavior of sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Biochemical and Molecular Determinants for Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this protocol, we plan to identify specific markers from biochemical, proteomic, epigenetic and molecular genetic analyses that predict clinical outcome, responsiveness to therapy and might serve as promising therapeutic targets in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients with known or suspected sarcoma who will have or have had tissue removed for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Patients will be entered without preference for any particular racial/ethnic group or gender. Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, irradiation, immunotherapy or surgical therapy. Tissue specimens must be large enough in quantity to allow routine pathologic analysis, with the research laboratory specimen removed from the residual specimen, which would otherwise be discarded. Optimal tissue amounts for snap freeze: Core biopsy 2 tissue cores Incisional biopsy 0.5 to 1.5 grams Resected sarcoma specimen 1.0 to 50 grams depending on size of specimen Normal fat or muscle tissue 0.5 to 4.0 grams (if available from resected sarcoma specimen) Optimal tissue amounts for RNA later Core biopsy 2 tissue cores Incisional biopsy 30 mg (three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cubes) Resected sarcoma specimen 30 mg (three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cubes) Normal fat or muscle tissue 30 mg (three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cube None</criteria>
