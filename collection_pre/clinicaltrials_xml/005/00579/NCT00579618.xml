	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about the roles of genes in cancers. Genes are short pieces of DNA which determine the inherited characteristics that distinguish one individual from another. This study will look at how some genes might raise or lower the chance some people may develop cancer. The sample collection will help generate the materials needed for this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascertainment of Saliva or Blood Samples For Genetic Epidemiology Studies of Cancer and Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a protocol to obtain saliva or blood samples from non-cancer affected volunteers aged 60 years or older, without a history of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer. These samples will be used in a genomic approach to elucidate novel pathways of cancer predisposition.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible subjects must be noncancer affected volunteers of either gender who are 60 years of age or older at the time of saliva/blood donation. Subjects will selfidentify religion and country of origin of grandparents. Volunteers will have (by self report) no history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. It is recognized that there may be some errors in self report, however, the literature reports a very low error rate for self reported disease reporting for cancer as assessed by interview. Subjects with mental impairment will be excluded from this study.</criteria>
