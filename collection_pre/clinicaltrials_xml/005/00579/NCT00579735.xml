	<brief_summary>Patients who received breast MRI will be evaluated for a variety of indications including : # each indication : 1) known cancer staging for local exent, 2)high risk, 3)high suspicion clinical finding, 4)questionable mammo finding, 5)silicone leak The number of incidental lesions not detected by any other method that were subsequently subjected to biopsy with the following BIRADS categories 3−# reasons for bx 4−# 5−# Of the lesions detected % of each BIRADS category were postive histologies−ductal, lobular, DCIS, etc. and negative (fibrosis, hyperplasia, etc.) Criteria for classification: morphology, dynamics, clinical significance will be evaluated and a predictive value established.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients who received breast MRI will be evaluated for a variety of indications including ? # each indication : 1) known cancer staging for local exent, 2)high risk, 3)high suspicion clinical finding, 4)questionable mammo finding, 5)silicone leak The number of incidental lesions not detected by any other method that were subsequently subjected to biopsy with the following BIRADS categories 3−# reasons for bx 4−# 5−# Of the lesions detected % of each BIRADS category were postive histologies−ductal, lobular, DCIS, etc. and negative (fibrosis, hyperplasia, etc.) Criteria for classification: morphology, dynamics, clinical significance will be evaluated and a predictive value established. This study is limited to retrospective chart review with the only foreseeable risk being that of disclosure of PHI. To minimize this risk, data collection forms will be identified by subject ID number. A master list of these ID numbers linked to subject medical record number will be maintained in the investigator's file and kept in a secure location accessible only to the study team for purposes of verification of data and validation of results. The medical record number will not be recorded on any other form containing subject PHI. The only foreseeable breach of confidentiality would be for the security of the investigator's files to be compromised</detailed_description>
