	<brief_title>Quality Of Life in Patients With Malignant Biliary Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) may arise in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, primary gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or metastatic disease to the liver or portal lymph nodes. MBO is often accompanied by significant symptoms that may result in impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQL), including pruritus, fever, nutritional deficits, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. Approaches to the relief of MBO include surgical bypass and/or resection, percutaneous drainage with or without biliary stenting, or endoscopic stenting. The non surgical procedures may be done prior to attempted curative resection or for palliation in individuals with unresectable or recurrent disease.</detailed_description>
