	<brief_title>Adolescent Survivors of Cancer or Similar Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study proposes to explore cancer-risk behaviors and future behavioral intentions among adolescent cancer survivors (i.e., 14-19 years old) and compare them to their "healthy" peers using population-based normative data. Additionally, it seeks to determine the significant theory-driven covariates related to adolescent survivors' health behaviors, which will aid in the design of future behavioral interventions.</detailed_description>
