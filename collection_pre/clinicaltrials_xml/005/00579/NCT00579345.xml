	<brief_summary>The study primarily aims to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of influenza vaccines (cell culture derived seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (cTIV) or influenza virus vaccine (egg-derived seasonal trivalent, thiomersal free; eTIV_a)) when administered alone and when administered concomitantly with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PV) in elderly subjects. The study also aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity (subset) of annual vaccination with either cTIV or eTIV_a in adults and elderly subjects.</brief_summary>
