	<brief_title>Study of Erythropoietin to Treat Anemia Complicating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development of anemia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is now taken as a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. Preliminary data from patients investigated in our department indicate a negative correlation between anemia severity and 6-minute walking distance. Our working hypothesis is that hemoglobin level correction by erythropoietin therapy will improve the effort capacity of patients with COPD and anemia. Our objective is to conduct a pilot study of the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa. The study will include about 15 patients with COPD recruited at three pulmonology centers based on two selection criteria: COPD stage II or III or IV according to GOLD criteria and hemoglobin level less than 12 g/dL. Effort capacity will be evaluated chiefly by performing a 6-minute walking test and by measuring VO2 at maximum exertion on a bicycle ergometer with increasing loads. Darbepoetin alfa will be given for 2 months. If the hemoglobin increase is less than 1 g/dL after 1 month, the dosage will be increased by 25%. Effort parameters will be measured at baseline and after 1 and 2 months of treatment. Among secondary objectives, we will evaluate functional ergospirometric parameters and laboratory tests for inflammation. Total study duration will not exceed 18 months.</detailed_description>
