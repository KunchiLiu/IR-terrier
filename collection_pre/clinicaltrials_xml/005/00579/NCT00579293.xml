	<brief_title>Development of a Computer Assisted Survivor Screening For Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine feasibility of using the Computer Assisted Survivor Screening (CASS) as a routine screening measure for the survivor population. Specifically, to determine patient acceptance, time to completion, and burden associated with the CASS. To examine the potential utility of the CASS as a routine screening measure in the survivor population. To validate the CASS against the SCL-90-R screening measure. Calculate the sensitivity,specificity, positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic agreement and ROC curve of the CASS compared to the SCL-90. Determine the optimal cut-off scores to optimize agreement between the CASS and the SCL-90.</detailed_description>
