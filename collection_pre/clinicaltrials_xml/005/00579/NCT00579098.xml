	<brief_summary>To investigate whether statin therapy utilizing the drug Lipitor (atorvastatin) might be effective in preventing short-and long-term atrial fibrillation (AF) following a left atrial ablation procedure. We further hypothesize this reduction will result from diminished peri-procedural inflammation, which will be reflected in lower C-Reactive Protein (CRP) values in the blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Statins Following a Left Atrial Catheter Ablation Procedure to Prevent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although pharmacologic therapy is the traditional mainstay of therapy for AF, curative therapy has recently become possible. There is growing evidence that inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. CRP, a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation, is increased in patients with AF compared with patients in sinus rhythm. Elevated CRP levels are associated with increased likelihood of new onset AF and with recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion. Clinical and basic laboratory evidence suggests that, in addition to being potent lipid-lowering agents, statins may also have anti-inflammatory properties and protective effect against AF. 125 eligible patients with AF, undergoing left atrial ablation, will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily 80 mg of atorvastatin or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 3 months after their ablation procedure. Patients will have baseline lipids, CRP, endothelial function tests and Quality of Life (QoL) surveys compared with testing at 3 months post ablation.</detailed_description>
