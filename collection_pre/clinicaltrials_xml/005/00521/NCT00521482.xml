	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensive dose temozolomide treatment alone in parallel to a combination with thalidomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma after standard therapy. In the treatment arm A of the study it will be investigated whether or not continuous dosing of temozolomide may overcome alkylator resistance in patients with glioblastoma who progress on the 5/28 day dosing regimen. For treatment arm B it is postulated that the combination of thalidomide and temozolomide is effective with respect to time to progression and progression-free survival due to the fact that temozolomide and thalidomide have different mechanisms of action.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide vs. Temozolomide and Thalidomide Treatment in Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Primary objectives: To determine the proportion of patients with progression- free survival after 6 months of intensive dose temozolomide treatment alone or in combination with thalidomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme after standard therapy. - Secondary objectives: To assess the effects on tumor growth. To determine the time to disease progression. To determine the proportion of patients with progression- free survival. To assess the safety of intensive dose temozolomide treatment alone or in combination with thalidomide. - Explorative evaluations: To assess health related Quality of Life. To assess cognitive functioning. To compare the two treatment arms in terms of efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>
