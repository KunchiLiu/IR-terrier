	<brief_title>Preoperative Octreotide Treatment of Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After a baseline evaluation, patients are randomized separately for each study center in blocks of four directly to transsphenoidal surgery or to 6-month preoperative treatment with octreotide. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects in the pretreatment group, octreotide is initiated at a dose of 50 µg sc three times a day for the 1st week and 100 µg sc three times a day for the 2nd week. From the 3rd week on, the patients receive octreotide LAR (Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) 20 mg im every 28th day for 6 months. Patients receive transsphenoidal surgery within 28 d of the last injection. If surgery are delayed, an extra octreotide LAR injection is given before surgery.</detailed_description>
