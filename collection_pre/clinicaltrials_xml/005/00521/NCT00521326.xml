	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of acquisition of coronary blood flow velocity signals over the whole length of the LAD with transthoracic pulsed Doppler, and to evaluate the diagnostic power of the transthoracic Doppler analysis package for detecting and estimating the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Finally we hope to optimize the currently available analysis package on the basis of the comparison of the Doppler with the angiographic stenosis results and evaluation.</brief_summary>
