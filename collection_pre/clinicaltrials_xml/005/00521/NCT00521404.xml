	<brief_summary>Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of CS-1008 when given with gemcitabine to subjects with previously untreated and unresectable (unable to be surgically removed) or metastatic (spread to other areas beyond the pancreas) pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label Study of CS1008 for Subjects With Untreated and Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of CS-1008 administered in combination with gemcitabine to chemotherapy naive subjects with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer, based on the progression-free survival rate at 16 weeks. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the efficacy of CS-1008 administered in combination with gemcitabine on overall progression-free survival rate, objective response rate, duration of response and overall survival. - To determine the pharmacokinetics of C-1008 and gemcitabine - To study potential biomarkers of CS-1008 activity - To evaluate the safety profile of CS-1008 when administered in combination with gemcitabine to chemotherapy naive subjects with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
