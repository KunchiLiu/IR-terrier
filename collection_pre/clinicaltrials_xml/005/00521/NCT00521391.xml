	<brief_title>Physical Activity as an Aid for Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective is to determine whether a tailored physical activity intervention involving moderate-intensity exercise is an added value to a standard smoking cessation intervention in term of likelihood of smoking abstinence. The secondary objectives are 1) to determine whether this tailored physical activity intervention prevents weight gain, reduces withdrawal symptoms, stress and improve mood and self-confidence in quitting; 2) to assess the effect of this tailored physical activity intervention on body composition and leptin concentration. We assess this intervention in a randomized controlled trial of 600 sedentary adults regular smokers recruited from the community allocated into one of the two groups (intervention group vs. control group) during a 10-week period and 3 follow-up visits (6 and 12 months follow-up). All subjects (intervention and control groups) participate in a smoking cessation program composed of a pharmacological treatment (including nicotine replacement therapy) and counseling. The intervention group attend the 10-week physical activity program blending moderate-intensity exercise (Swiss nationwide implemented program entitled "Allez Hop!") and lifestyle physical activity and the control group a 10-week health education program to ensure equal contact condition.</detailed_description>
