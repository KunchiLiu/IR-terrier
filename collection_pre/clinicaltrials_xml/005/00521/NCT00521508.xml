	<brief_summary>Along structural IgA abnormalities, hyperproduction of IgA is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of primary IgA nephropathy. CD4+CD25+Fox3P regulatory T cells are instrumental in suppressing adaptative immune responses, including B cells production of immunoglobulins. We, the researchers at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saine Etienne, will test the hypothesis that IgA production in patients with IgA nephropathy is dysregulated because of a quantitative and/or qualitative defect of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.</brief_summary>
