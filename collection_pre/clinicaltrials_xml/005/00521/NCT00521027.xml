	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the VERSAJET™ device with conventional surgical procedures (performed with a scalpel) in the debridement (removal of unhealthy tissue) of lower limb ulcers. It is hypothesised that the time taken to debride lower limb ulcers will be quicker with the VERSAJET™ device than with conventional surgical procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing VERSAJET With Conventional Surgical Procedures in the Removal of Unhealthy Tissue From Lower Limb Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is prospective, comparative clinical evaluation to investigate whether there is a reduction in the skin-to-skin time of the first surgical debridement with VERSAJET™, compared to conventional debridement techniques. Skin-to-skin time is defined as the time of incision to the end time of debridement (wound ready for dressing application). Conventional debridement is defined as scalpel plus pulse lavage. The purpose of this comparison is to demonstrate the resource savings which VERSAJET™ may provide in terms of operating room (OR) and personnel time, in addition to the potential to reduce the procedure, and possibly anaesthetic, time for the patient. It is envisaged that this information, combined with the costs associated with the procedure, will also provide valuable economic data to help justify the use of VERSAJET™ from a financial perspective and support the future commercial success of the device.</detailed_description>
