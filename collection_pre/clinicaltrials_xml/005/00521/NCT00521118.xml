	<brief_title>Second Curettage in Treating Patients With Persistent Non-Metastatic Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the response to second curettage in patients with persistent, non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Secondary - To evaluate if response to a second curettage is independent of the tumor burden as measured by the quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assay at study entry. - To evaluate if response to a second curettage is independent of the depth of myometrial invasion as measured sonographically following the initial curettage but prior to study entry (when persistent disease is first diagnosed). - To estimate the frequency of complications related to a second curettage, specifically infection of the fallopian tubes or ovaries, hemorrhage associated with curettage, or operative injury to the uterus. - To estimate the frequency of a change in the uterine histology between the first and second curettage. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo a second curettage rather than standard treatment (immediate chemotherapy). Patients whose disease has transformed into choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor, or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (histologically diagnosed at the second curettage) are removed from the study. All other patients undergo weekly beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing beginning 14 days after the second curettage and continuing until the beta-hCG level is normal. Patients then undergo further beta-HCG testing weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 5 months. If the level does not regress to normal, or rises, or if metastatic disease is identified, the patient is removed from the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) (complete or partial hydatidiform mole) No histologically confirmed choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) on the first curettage Persistent, lowrisk disease (based on FIGO/WHO 2002 staging and risk scoring criteria), as defined by 1 of the following criteria: Less than 10% decline in betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, based on four consecutive measurements over a 3week period (plateau) Greater than 20% rise in betahCG levels, based on three consecutive measurements over a 2week period BetahCG level remains elevated above normal for ≥ 6 months WHO risk score ≤ 6 Must have a clinically significant elevated betahCG level BetahCG &gt; 20 miu/mL Nonmetastatic disease No evidence of metastatic disease beyond the uterus by pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasound, and chest xray No previously treated, persistent or recurrent GTN (same gestation) that have been treated with chemotherapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: GOG performance status 01 Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 6 months after completion of study therapy No other invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior cancer treatment that would preclude study treatment No more than 1 prior curettage for current disease No prior hysterectomy No chemotherapy during the study curettage followup period until surgical response has been completely determined</criteria>
