	<brief_title>Surgically Induced Astigmatism of Temporal Versus Nasal Clear Corneal Phacoemulsification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a clinical trial, consecutive eyes with senile cataract underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of a 6.0 mm foldable hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens through a 3.2 mm horizontal clear cornea incision at 180 degrees (temporal incision in right eyes, nasal incision in left eyes). Keratometric astigmatism was measured preoperatively and one and four weeks and 6 months after surgery. Surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) was calculated by the vector analysis method using the Holladay-Cravy-Koch formula. Patients with history of diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disorders, steroid use, previous ocular surgery, with the rule astigmatism &gt;1D, pseudoexfoliation and any corneal pathology were excluded.</detailed_description>
