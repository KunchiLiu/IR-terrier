	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that a therapeutic platelet transfusion strategy (i.e. platelet transfusion only in case of bleeding) needs minimally a quarter less of transfusions compared to the standard prophylactic transfusion strategy (i.e. platelet transfusion without any sign of bleeding when the platelet count is below 10.000/ÂµL). With the experimental transfusion strategy transfusions could be safely reduced when the study hypothesis can be proven. This is the first prospective randomized study on this topic.</brief_summary>
