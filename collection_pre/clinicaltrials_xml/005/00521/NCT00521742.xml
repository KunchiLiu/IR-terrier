	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pioglitazone Compared to Glyburide in Treating Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Mild Cardiac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is a chronic disease involving multiple metabolic defects that include inadequate insulin activity and resultant hyperglycemia. Individuals' differing genetic predisposition, level of physical activity, and age all contribute to variations in the onset and severity of type 2 diabetes. However, progression of this disease typically follows a characteristic pattern that begins as a reduced sensitivity of hepatic and peripheral-tissues to circulating insulin (ie, insulin resistance). The body's decreasing ability to produce adequate insulin to overcome insulin resistance (ie, insulin deficiency due to beta-cell insufficiency) results in impaired glucose tolerance and ultimately overt diabetes. In the United States, an estimated 17 million people have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes occurring in approximately 90% to 95% of cases. The goal of treating type 2 diabetes is to control blood glucose and thereby prevent long-term complications. Adequate glycemic control is paramount in attempting to avert chronic complications, including blindness, renal dysfunction and resultant dialysis or renal transplantation, neuropathy, and nontraumatic amputations. Intensive glucose management in the early stages of diabetes may help forestall complications. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. Glyburide, is an oral antidiabetic agent of the sulfonylurea class. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of pioglitazone versus glyburide when administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild cardiac disease Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 1 year and 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
