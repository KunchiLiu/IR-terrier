	<brief_title>Effects of Chocolate on Coronary Vasomotion in Patients After Heart Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dark chocolate contains a high amount of flavonoids. Flavonoids hold the possibilities to improve oxidative stress and hence the possibility to improve endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion, which is a powerful surrogate for clinical prognosis. Coronary atherosclerosis is promoted by impaired endothelial function and increased platelet activation. High oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant defenses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, in particular in transplanted hearts. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the ingestion of a flavonoid-rich dark chocolate compared to flavonoid-free placebo chocolate will improve coronary vasomotion in heart transplanted patients.</detailed_description>
