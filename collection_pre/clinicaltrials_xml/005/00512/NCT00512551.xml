	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if the expression of certain genes is linked with the response of cervical cancer to radiation. Researchers will study a large number of genes located in tumor material to learn this information.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients in this study are already scheduled to begin radiation therapy. Researchers will get tumor cells by taking two biopsies of the cervix. The first biopsy of the cervical tumor will be done before any treatment is given. The second biopsy will be performed about 48 hours after the radiation treatment has begun. They will then study the cells in the lab with a new technique for studying gene expression called DNA array, as well as HPV analysis, quantification of apoptosis levels, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and storage of tissue for future research.. The patterns of gene expression in the biopsies will be compared with the success of radiation treatments. Some of the material will also be stored and used in the future for other research projects. This is an investigational study. A total of 18 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.</detailed_description>
