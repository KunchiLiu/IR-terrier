	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors for placement of permanent pacemakers soon after cardiac surgery. We will measure the following to see what influence, if any, they have on predicting the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. 1. Type of cardiac surgery 2. Gender of patient 3. Patient's age 4. Preoperative heart rhythm and rate 5. Duration on cardiopulmonary bypass 6. Immediate post cardiopulmonary bypass heart rhythm and rate. 7. All heart rhythms and rates identified in the postoperative period prior to permanent pacemaker implantation. 8. Underlying heart rhythm and rates when permanent pacemaker is placed. 9. Ejection fraction before surgery 10. Ejection fraction immediately post-cardiopulmonary bypass</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors for placement of permanent pacemakers soon after cardiac surgery. We will measure the following to see what influence, if any, they have on predicting the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. Through investigation into the co-morbidities, diagnoses, or histories associated with an endpoint permanent pacemaker placement, it is possible that we will garner a better idea of who will require PPP.</detailed_description>
