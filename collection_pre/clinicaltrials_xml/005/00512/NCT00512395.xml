	<brief_summary>Epidural anaesthesia in open surgery is a effective method for analgesia and has a positive effect on postoperative resolution of ileus. In laparoscopic surgery, the role of epidural surgery is not established. This prospective observational trial evaluates the effect of epidural analgesia in patients undergoing elective, laparoscopic colorectal surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Epidural Analgesia in Elective Laparoscopic Colorectal Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients with elective, laparoscopic colorectal resection between November 2004 and January 2007 were included in the trial. The decision for epidural analgesia was made by the anaesthetist and the patient. Contraindications were previous back surgery, coagulopathy, severe spondylarthrosis and refusal by the patient as contraindications. Primary outcome was subjective feeling postoperatively, assessed with a VAS for pain and cramps and amount of analgesics used. Secondary outcomes were duration of postoperative bowel dismotility (first flatus, first defecation, first solid food intake) and general and specific morbidity.</detailed_description>
