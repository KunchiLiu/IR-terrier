No prior therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (exception: prephase treatment with corticosteroids and vincaalkaloids for a maximum of seven days may not preclude trial participation if clinically indicated and all staging examinations have been performed; all forms of prior radiotherapy preclude trial participation) 4.

Patient's lack of accountability, inability to appreciate the nature, meaning and consequences of the trial and to formulate his/her own wishes correspondingly 11. Non compliance: Refusal of blood products during treatment, epilepsy, drug dependency, change of residence abroad, prior cerebral injury or similar circumstances which appear to make protocol treatment or longterm followup impossible 12.
