	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Anti-Adhesion Product (AAP) in preventing or reducing post-operative adhesion formation and re-formation in a subject population having abdominal surgery and being left with a rectal stump and a temporary stoma from a first procedure and scheduled for a laparoscopy/ laparotomy as a second procedure in the normal treatment of the subjects' disease. In both study groups, surgical measures to prevent adhesions were taken, e.g. using minimum traumatizing surgical technique, using powder-free gloves. In the investigational product group, AAP was applied to the rectal stump and the incision line while no specific additional treatment was applied in the control group. The surgeon assessed preexisting adhesions during the first surgery. Newly developed and re-formed adhesions were evaluated during the second surgery by a surgeon or assistant who did not know the result of randomization. The safety of the study drug was also monitored.</brief_summary>
