	<brief_summary>New technology allows non-invasive monitoring of brain oxygenation (Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy). However, there are no large series of normal values in various adult age groups. We hypothesised that baseline values in patients breathing room air are lower in old patients than in younger subjects and that younger patients respond increase their brain oxygenation more in response to supplemental oxygen.</brief_summary>
