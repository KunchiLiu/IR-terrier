	<brief_summary>Post-operative radio-chemotherapy decrease the recurrence risk of gastric cancer(N Engl J Med 2001). However the chemotherapy regimen (5 fluorouracil IV bolus) used was toxic and suboptimal. We propose to evaluate in adjuvant situation an active and well tolerate chemotherapy regimen (FOLFIRI)in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. During the radiotherapy we will use 5 FU continue infusion as previously reported. The global design of adjuvant treatment will be four FOLFIRI courses, radiotherapy (45 Gy)with 5FU IV continue then four FOLFIRI.</brief_summary>
