	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes of Three Different Percutaneous Revascularization Strategies for the Treatment of Lifestyle Limiting Claudication: A Retrospective Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endovascular revascularization of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) has become one of the most commonly performed endovascular procedures.The ability to offer the patient an alternative to surgical revascularization, limited by significant morbidity and mortality, with a same-day outpatient percutaneous procedure underlies the popularity of the endovascular approach. Although surgical bypass of the SFA remains the gold standard for revascularization, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.Comparative data between cryoplasty, angioplasty or stenting of the SFA will ultimately be required to provide more robust evidence of the efficacy of each mode of therapy.This registry is designed to determine the efficacy of three different percutaneous revascularization strategies (Cryoplasty vs. Stent Placement vs. Atherectomy) in the treatment of lifestyle limiting lower extremity claudication.</detailed_description>
