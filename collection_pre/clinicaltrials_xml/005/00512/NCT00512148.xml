	<brief_summary>Subjects with neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal cord injury that is refractory to medical treatment and requires augmentation cystoplasty will be enrolled. The hypothesis is that augmentation cystoplasty using an autologous neo-bladder construct will reduce maximum detrusor pressure.</brief_summary>
