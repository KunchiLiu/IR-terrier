	<brief_title>Apligraf Versus Standard Therapy in the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulceration of the diabetic foot is a result of multiple problems including repetitive stress on a neuropathic or insensate area that is often associated with an underlying bony prominence. By healing diabetic foot ulcers quickly the risks of infection, osteomyelitis (infeciton of the bone) and limb loss can be reduced. This study will evaluate the ability of Apligraf to heal diabetic foot ulcers that have been present for at least 2 weeks and are between 1 - 16 cm2 in area. Patients will be randomized to either (50:50 chance) treatment with Apligraf or a saline moistened dressing regimen (standard therapy). All patients will receive standard cares for the ulcers which includes debridement, orthotics and off-loading throughout the treatment period.</detailed_description>
