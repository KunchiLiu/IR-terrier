	<brief_summary>Dairy products continue to be an important source of calcium, providing over half the calcium intake for most individuals. Educational interventions promoting adequate calcium intake with tools estimating dietary calcium that can be easily utilized by consumers would be a valuable asset to promoting skeletal health. Validation of these tools against standard dietary assessment methods enhances their utility. The Dairy Council of California has developed two dietary calcium questionnaires, one electronic and one in print, using known dietary sources of calcium including frequency of consumption and portion size. For these questionnaires to be effective in clinical and research settings they must be a valid measurement of dietary calcium intake. To measure the validity of the dietary calcium questionnaires one hundred seventy three women will complete the two dietary calcium questionnaires and one 3-day food record. The dietary calcium questionnaires will be validated against this established method of dietary intake measurement. The objective of this study is to validate two dietary calcium questionnaires that can be used in clinical and research settings against an established method of dietary intake measurement. It is hypothesized that both dietary calcium questionnaires will be a valid measurement of dietary calcium intake in women.</brief_summary>
