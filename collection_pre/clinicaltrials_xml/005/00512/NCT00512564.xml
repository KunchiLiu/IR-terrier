	<brief_summary>Iron overload is well study in Thalassemia patients and it's not only related to blood transfusions, since intestinal iron absorption is also increased in those patients. Sickle cell patients didn't developed significant clinical symptoms and signs of iron overload in spite frequent transfusions. The purpose of this study is to assess the iron overload in Sickle cell anemia and Sickle cell Thalassemia patients using clinical parameters and laboratory studies including Non Transferrin Binding Iron, Labile Iron and Hepcidin, in order to determine the cardiac and liver iron.</brief_summary>
