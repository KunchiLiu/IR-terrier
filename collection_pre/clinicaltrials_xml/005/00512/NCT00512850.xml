	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain substances to keep cancer from forming. The use of folic acid may prevent colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well folic acid works compared with a placebo in preventing colorectal polyps in patients who have had previous colorectal polyps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folic Acid in Preventing Colorectal Polyps in Patients With Previous Colorectal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine if folic acid supplementation lowers the adenoma recurrence rate. Secondary - Determine the number of adenomas per patient and the size and histology of the adenoma. - Assess the interaction between folic acid and alcohol, methionine, and aspirin intake. - Assess the interaction between folic acid and pretrial and midtrial folate levels. - Assess other complementary biomarkers such as DNA methylation and blood folate level as risk factors for polyp recurrence. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral folic acid once daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. At least 1 year after beginning treatment, patients are sent a blood collection kit in order to measure plasma vitamin B12 levels, to measure folate to assess compliance.</detailed_description>
