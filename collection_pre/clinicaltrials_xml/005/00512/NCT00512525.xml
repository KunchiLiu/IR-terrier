	<brief_title>Ghrelin Decreases Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study is initiated in order to assess the impact of acute ghrelin administration on insulin resistance measured by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Second, as free fatty acid is the predominant substrate during fasting, we aim to asses the effects of ghrelin on local and systemic lipolysis.</detailed_description>
