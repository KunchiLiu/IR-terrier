	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this pilot study is to describe the angiographic prevalence and pattern of internal pudendal artery (and associated inflow vessel) atherosclerosis in patients with erectile dysfunction who are non-responsive to PDE-5 inhibitors (i.e., Viagra) who are referred for clinically-indicated cardiac catheterization.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim of this study is to determine if the deep penile arteries can be seen angiographically from the iliac arteries to delineate penile vasculature. Significant obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the deep penile arteries may be present in impotent males. The etiology of erectile dysfunction is multifactorial and may involve vascular disease, endocrine disorders, neurologic disease, prescription medications, psychological issues and/or trauma in any given patient. Vascular disease in patients with erectile dysfunction may be due to trauma, congenital anomalies, or atherosclerosis.</detailed_description>
