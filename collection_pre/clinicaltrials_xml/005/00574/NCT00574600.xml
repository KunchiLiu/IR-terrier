	<brief_title>Safety of and Immune Response to Two HIV Vaccines: SAAVI DNA-C2 Boosted With SAAVIMVA-C, in HIV-Negative Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through development and utilization of a safe and effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. Due to the high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa, the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are evaluating two subtype C HIV vaccines, SAAVI DNA-C2 and SAAVI MVA-C through this study . These two vaccines will be used together in a prime-boost regimen. The SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine is a multigene DNA vaccine consisting of two DNA plasmids in equal amounts that express an HIV-1 subtype C polyprotein comprising of Gag-Reverse Transcriptase-Tat-Nef and an HIV-1 subtype C truncated Env. SAAVI MVA-C is a recombinant MVA vaccine expressing the same immunogens as the SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine. MVA is a highly attenuated vaccinia virus. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an experimental DNA HIV vaccine, SAAVI DNA C2, followed by boosting with an experimental recombinant MVA HIV vaccine, SAAVI MVA-C, in HIV uninfected adults. Participants will actively participate in this study for 12 months and will then be contacted and asked questions about their health once annually for 3 years following initial study injection. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the SAAVI prime-boost preventive vaccine regimen or placebo. Vaccination with the SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine will occur at Months 0, 1, and 2; boost vaccinations with the SAAVI MVA-C vaccine will occur at Months 4 and 5. Additional study visits will occur at Weeks 2, 6, 10, 16, 18, and 20 and Days 147, 154, 273, and 364. Study procedures include physical exams, blood and urine collection, HIV testing, an electrocardiogram, and questionnaire. Some blood collected from participants will be stored and used in future research. Risk-reduction counseling will be conducted at all study visits.</detailed_description>
