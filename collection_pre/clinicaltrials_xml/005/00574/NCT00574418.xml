	<brief_title>Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine fibroids are the most common neoplasms of the female pelvis. These benign tumors are generally oval in shape and often highly vascular. On MR imaging exams, uterine fibroids are easily identifiable. They occur in 20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a variety of problems generally described as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid. We are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the uterus will shrink the benign tumors.</detailed_description>
