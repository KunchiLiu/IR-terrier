	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that radiofrequency ablation after single-insertion image guided vacuum assisted biopsy (IVEB) can be used to achieve negative margins in small unicentric breast cancers (≤1.5 cm).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Removal and Margin Ablation for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using the Mammotome Breast Biopsy System (IVEB) in conjunction with MRI to predict extent of disease, ultrasound to direct removal of the tumor, touch preparation cytology for diagnosis, and ablation of margins using radiofrequency ablation (RFA), we propose to develop a comprehensive system for same-day diagnosis and treatment of patients with small breast lesions.</detailed_description>
