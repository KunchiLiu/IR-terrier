	<brief_title>Daratumumab (HuMaxÂ®-CD38) Safety Study in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is conducted in two parts. In part I, participants are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels. Participant safety and efficacy during part I will determine the doses used for Part II. In part II participants will be enrolled into one of two sequential treatment arms using two of the doses defined in part 1 of the study. Part II was 5 cohorts, 3 with 8 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and 2 with 16 mg/kg. Part I and all but the last cohort in Part II were dosed with Phase 1/ 2 drug product. The last cohort in Part II was dosed with Phase 3 drug product. Both Part I and Part II are open-label/unmasked.</detailed_description>
