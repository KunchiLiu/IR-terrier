	<brief_summary>Mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic®) is a newly developed enteric-coated tablet version of mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®) which is currently used as therapy for the prevention of transplant rejection. Myfortic® was developed to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability of Cellcept®. The new enteric-coated, Myfortic® is presently FDA approved for the prevention of acute kidney rejection only. There is no clinical data of its use in heart transplant patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (Myfortic®) in Heart Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-labeled, prospective, non-randomized pilot-phase study of the enteric-coated, Myfortic® versus the non enteric-coated, Cellcept® in patients who are within 5 years of having undergone heart transplant surgery who are currently taking Cellcept®. After the initial screening, 20 patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and report symptoms of gastrointestinal side-effects while taking Cellcept will be switched to Myfortic. All 20 patients will be followed closely over a period of 6 months following enrollment. Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy will continue in all patients per standard treatment protocol.</detailed_description>
