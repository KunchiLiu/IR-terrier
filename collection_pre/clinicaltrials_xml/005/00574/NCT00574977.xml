	<brief_title>Safety Study of Modified Vaccinia Virus to Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, single dose, dose-escalation trial in subjects with melanoma, breast cancer, or head and neck squamous cell cancer, liver, colorectal or pancreatic adenocarinoma. The intratumoral subjects will be stratified into 2 groups. Group A includes those who have been vaccinated with vaccinia virus. A history of vaccination and a scar at vaccination site is required. Group B subjects will include those who have not been vaccinated. It is expected that the toxicity profile will be quite different between those who have been vaccinated previously with vaccinia virus and therefore subjects will be stratified separately in this Phase I trial. All subjects who have refractory tumors will receive treatment at one of five dose levels in a single dose sequential dose-escalating design. Eligible subjects will receive 1 treatment of vvDD-CDSR. A dose can be divided between 1-3 lesions. The sum total of the maximal diameters of the lesion(s) to be injected must be &lt; 10cm. Once the MTD and/or MFD has been defined in the vaccinated I.T. arm described above, additional subject may be enrolled at one dose level lower than the MTD/MFD and the I.V. infusion phase may begin. Patients enrolled in the IV infusion arm will receive a single administration of vvDD-CDSR at one of three dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating design.</detailed_description>
