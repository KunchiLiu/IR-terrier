	<brief_summary>In an observational multi-centre study (CHALLENGE), the effects were assessed of starting treatment with low doses of rosuvastatin in statin naive patients with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or diabetes (DM), on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement. Also proportional changes in LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and the ratio TC/HDL-C were studied.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients eligible for the study were highrisk patients with a documented history of CHD, PVD, cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease, DM II or DM I with microalbuminuria. LDLC had to be &gt; 2.5 mmol/l and the patient did not use any cholesterol lowering medication during the last 3 months preceding inclusion. The specialist made the decision to start treatment with rosuvastatin irrespective of study participation. Patient approved to place anonymous results at the disposal of AstraZeneca Exclusion criteria included patients familiar with muscular pain, myopathy or liver function disorders (inclusive elevation of serum transaminases), patients with familial dyslipideamia like familial hypercholesterolaemia and familial combined hyperlipid</criteria>
