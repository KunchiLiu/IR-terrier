	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: AMG 706 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well AMG 706 works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMG 706 in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the activity of AMG 706, in terms of the frequency of patients with progression-free survival for at least 6 months after initiating therapy or with an objective tumor response, in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Secondary - To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v3.0. - To characterize the distribution of the progression-free and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral AMG 706 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma Recurrent or persistent disease Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT scan Must have at least one "target lesion" that can be used to assess response, as defined by RECIST criteria Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented OR a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistent disease ≥ 90 days following completion of radiotherapy Must have received one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound for management of primary disease Initial treatment may have included highdose therapy, consolidation therapy, or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment One additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease allowed Patients must have a platinumfree interval of &lt; 12 months, have progressed during platinumbased therapy, or have persistent disease after a platinumbased therapy Ineligible for a higher priority GOG protocol No pleural effusion or ascites causing grade 2 or greater dyspnea No history of uncontrolled CNS metastases Patients with a history of CNS metastases must have their disease controlled by radiotherapy and/or surgery; have at least two imaging scans following treatment (that were no less than 30 days apart) showing no progression of any lesions and no new lesions; and be clinically stable off corticosteroids for ≥ 14 days prior to study randomization PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: GOG performance status (PS) 02* NOTE: *Patients who have received 2 prior regimen must have a GOG PS of 02 and patients who have received 2 prior regimens must have a GOG PS of 01 ANC ≥ 1,500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Urine protein &lt;

3 years ago, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease No prior noncytotoxic chemotherapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease No prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis other than for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer Prior radiotherapy for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin allowed provided it was completed &gt; 3 years ago, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease No concurrent coumadintype anticoagulants, including warfarin, at doses &gt; 1 mg/day Concurrent low molecular weight heparin or low dose warfarin (i.e., ≤ 1 mg daily) for prophylaxis against central venous catheter thrombosis is allowed No other concurrent investigational or antineoplastic agents</criteria>
