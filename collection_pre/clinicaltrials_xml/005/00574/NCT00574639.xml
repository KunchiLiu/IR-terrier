	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the way by which Alprazolam (Xanax) an anti-anxiety drug affects specialized molecules in your brain called GABA (A) receptors that alter your body's ability to defend itself from low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). We hypothesize that prior activation of GABA (A) receptors may result in blunting of counterregulatory responses during subsequent hypoglycemia and exercise.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Dysfunction Question 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal of this project is to identify treatments and approaches that will allow patients with diabetes to enjoy all the benefits of good glycemic control without the damaging limitations of severe hypoglycemia. The specific aim of this study is to determine if gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA A) receptors plays a role in the development of exercise associated autonomic dysfunction in type 1 diabetes and healthy man.</detailed_description>
