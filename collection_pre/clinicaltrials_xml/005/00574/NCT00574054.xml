	<brief_title>Far Infrared Radiation Treatment of Dementia and Other Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia is the progressive decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the brain beyond what might be expected from normal aging. Particularly affected areas include memory, attention, language, and problem solving. Especially in the later stages of the condition, affected persons may be disoriented in place and in person (not knowing who they are). The prevalence of dementia is rising as the global life expectancy is rising. Particularly in Western countries, there is increasing concern about the economic impact that dementia will have in future, older populaces. It is a disease that is strongly associated with age; 1% of those aged 60-65, 6% of those aged 75-79, and 45% of those aged 95 or older suffer from the disease. We are postulating that the use of far infrared radiation on the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the viscera will have a positive effect on treating dementia and other neurological illnesses.</detailed_description>
