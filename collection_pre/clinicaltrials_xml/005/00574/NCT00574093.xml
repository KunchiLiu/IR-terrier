	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the effect of Visudyne® combination therapy (Visudyne® [verteporfin for injection] and Lucentis™) on visual acuity outcomes. Study results will be submitted for publication to provide data that may help physicians refine the clinical management of patients with CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Lucentis (Ranibizumab) and Visudyne (Verteporfin) Combination Therapy in Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single arm study. Patients will be administered Lucentis™ on Day 1, at Months 1 and 2, and then as needed at intervals of at least 30 days through Month 11 based on the retreatment criteria algorithm. These patients will also be administered Visudyne® only on Day 3. Consenting patients will participate in the Screening Period to evaluate study eligibility. Patient eligibility assessments will include BCVA, contrast sensibility, speed reading and VFQ-25, a standard ophthalmic examination, OCT, color fundus photography, Fluorescein Angiography (FA), Green Indocyanine Angiography, Microperimetry and multifocal ERG. BCVA and mean central retinal thickness measured by OCT will be repeated at every follow up visit. Fluorescein Angiography (FA), Green Indocyanine Angiography, contrast sensibility and speed reading mean retinal sensitivity measured by microperimetry will repeated at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 month. Color fundus photography at month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month. Multifocal ERG will repeated at month 3 and 12 month. VFQ-25 will repeated at month 3 and 12. The patient will receive ranibizumab monthly unless the BCVA got worse than 5 letters from the baseline BCVA and / or mean central retinal thickness evaluated with OCT increased less than 100 µm compared to month 2 visit (last date treatment). The repetition of the dose of ranibizumab should not begin before the thirtieth day following the end of the previous treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>50 years or older male or female patients of any race with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD (all types of lesion). The total area of CNV encompassed within the lesion must be &gt;50% of the total lesion area. The total lesion area must have the greatest linear dimension ≤5400 microns (9 MPS Disc Areas). BCVA letter score in the study eye should be between 73 and 24 (approximately 20/40 to 20/320 Snellen Equivalent) using an ETDRS chart measured at 4 meters distance.
