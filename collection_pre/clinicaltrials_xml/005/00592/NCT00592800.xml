	<brief_title>Understanding Probability in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept of patients making decisions with respect to their health care is well accepted in adult medicine but, the value and importance of decision making in the care of children is not recognized. The major objection raised against allowing children to express their opinions concerning outcomes is that children do not understand probability. One way of assessing children's ability to understand probability is to test their mathematical knowledge using tests focused on probability and percentage. We have designed a set of questionnaires with 10 questions each, taken from the US Department of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). They are divided into 3 different groups (4th, 8th, and 12th grade), based on grade-level. We have also obtained the average percentage of correct-incorrect answers given to these questions by students nationwide, and the scoring system used to assess the student's proficiency level. In this preliminary study we intend to present this set of 10 mathematical questions to children and to one of their parents.</detailed_description>
