	<brief_title>Screening Protocol for Adults With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To address the needs of the large number of adults who contact the Adult ADHD Program at Massachusetts General Hospital annually, we have sought approval for several research studies aimed at evaluating critical components of the needs of this population. Potential participants for those studies present with a widely varied set of complaints not always discernable in a telephone screening interview. This state of affairs often makes it difficult to ask subjects to sign a specific protocol's consent form without obtaining additional clinical information. Because of this, we have potential subjects consent to undergo an in-depth clinical assessment that will allow them to be screened by a clinician for eligibility to a diverse clinical research program available to them.</detailed_description>
