	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine if the administration of a higher dose would decrease the chance of tumor recurrence, compared to the risk of tumor recurrence with a lower dose. Most of the treatment will be given protons, but participants may receive a small portion of treatment with x-rays, because less radiation is given to the skin with x-rays. This study uses two slightly different doses of radiation It is not clear at this time which of the dose levels is better.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants will be assigned to a dose level by random chance, like flipping a coin. - A treatment plan will be determined by a treatment planning CT scan and will either involve 40-44 treatments or 37-40 treatments.</detailed_description>
