	<brief_summary>At present, there are no therapeutic agents that can minimize severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and its effects on long-term brain function. The aim of this study is to determine whether the human brain is able to use medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) and/or their metabolites as an alternative fuel source during acute hypoglycemia in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). The hypothesis is that medium chain fatty acids will provide a rapidly absorbed, non-carbohydrate fuel that will improve cognitive performance during episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Medium Chain Fatty Acids on Cognitive Function During Acute Hypoglycemia in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve subjects between the ages of 18 years and 55 years who have had Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus for more than five years and have had tight control of their diabetes as determined by screening blood work will be invited to participate. Each study subject will undergo two hypoglycemic clamp studies (a procedure where the blood sugar is closely regulated with intravenous insulin and glucose.) In these hypoglycemic clamp studies, cognitive testing will be performed during 90 minutes of normal blood glucose followed by 90 minutes of hypoglycemia. During the hypoglycemic period, either the MCFA or a placebo will be administered. Each subject will experience both conditions. The order in which the MCFA is given will be randomized.</detailed_description>
