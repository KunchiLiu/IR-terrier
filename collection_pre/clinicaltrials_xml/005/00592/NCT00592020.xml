	<brief_summary>Today the minimal invasive access is used for a lot of different operations. This technique takes the advantage of less postoperative pain, better cosmetic results, and a lower surgical complication rate (e.g. hernia, wound infection). Especially patients under immunosuppressive therapy could benefit from this technique. First results in minimally invasive kidney transplantation indicate that it may be performed quickly and safely. Benefits are expectable on postoperative pain, recovery, and surgical complications. Another retrospective study showed lower rates of hernia, abdominal wall relaxations, and a better postoperative cosmetic. The aim of this study is to compare the classic hockey stick incision with a minimal invasive incision in a randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
