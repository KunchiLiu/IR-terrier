	<brief_summary>A new approach to HIV prevention currently being studied includes the use of microbicides, substances that kill microbes. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an oral, FDA-approved, anti-HIV drug, and tenofovir gel is an experimental microbicide. The purpose of this study is to determine the adherence and acceptability to and blood levels of three daily regimens of tenofovir in both oral and gel form.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adherence and Acceptability to and Blood Levels of Tenofovir Gel and Tablets in HIV Uninfected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is necessary to monitor both the adherence and blood levels of microbicides in order to gauge its efficacy in a study population. Utilizing an experimental microbicide (tenofovir gel) and an anti-HIV drug (TDF), this study will measure the adherence and acceptability to and blood levels of the two interventions in three separate regimens given to HIV-uninfected women. The expected duration of participation for each participant is 21 weeks. Study participants will be randomly assigned into one of six study groups, each with a different regimen sequence. Each sequence will consist of three study periods and three wash-out periods. Each study period lasts 6 weeks, followed by a 1 week wash-out period. The regimen assigned for a given study period will include either oral TDF, tenofovir vaginal gel, or both. All participants will be prescribed all three regimens in the order designated by their randomized assignment. Study visits will occur at Weeks 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 20, and 21. Medical history, a physical exam, behavioral assessment, and urine, blood, pelvic sample collection, and counseling will occur at all visits. At some study sites rectal swabs may be performed. Counseling will include information regarding contraception, protocol adherence, HIV, HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection risk reduction, and male condom use. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, to be determined by the study site, will occur during all three study periods. These studies may involve additional procedures.</detailed_description>
