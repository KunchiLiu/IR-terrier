	<brief_summary>We are collecting brain tissue specimens and blood samples from patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who are undergoing intracranial surgery to remove brain tissue, including brain tumors, tissue from epilepsy surgery and brain tissue removed during surgery for other non-cancerous types of brain tissus. These specimens will then be studied using a novel microscopic laser-directed protein mass spectrometric analysis, looking for unique protein signatures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We are collecting brain tissue specimens and blood samples from patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who are undergoing intracranial surgery to remove brain tissue, including brain tumors, tissue from epilepsy surgery and brain tissue removed during surgery for other non-cancerous types of brain tissus. These specimens will then be studied using a novel microscopic laser-directed protein mass spectrometric analysis. Data from different brain tissues including tumors of different histological sub-types will be analyzed for unique protein signatures. These protein signatures will then be statistically correlated with clinical data including time to tumor progression and response to therapy. The goal of this study is to determine molecular patterns that will be more predictive of tumor behavior, thus leading to an improved understanding of the basic biology of these poorly understood cancers. This in turn, may lead to more refined therapies and improved outcomes.</detailed_description>
