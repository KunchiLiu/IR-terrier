	<brief_summary>1. Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw(ONJ)is detectable by positron emission tomography(PET). 2. Bisphosphonate-associated ONJ can be diagnosed and characteristically differentiated from other bony pathologies of the jaw(osteomyelitis, osteolytic lesions, and osteoradionecrosis)by PET imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bisphosphonate-Associated Jaw Osteonecrosis and PET Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Is to review medical records of approximately 1000 patients with bisphosphonate-associated ONJ who have had PET imaging at the time of diagnosis. Also to review medical records of patients who have been diagnosed with jaw osteomyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, and cancerous lytic lesions who received PET imaging at the time of diagnosis. If sufficient information regarding presentation and treatment cannot be obtained form the medical record, approximately 300 patients will contacted by mail (and phone if necessary) by the PI or sub-investigators to question them regarding the onset of symptoms, treatment interventions, and outcomes.</detailed_description>
