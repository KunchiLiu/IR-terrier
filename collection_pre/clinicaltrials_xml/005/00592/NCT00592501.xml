	<brief_summary>Photon beam radiation is the standard type of radiation used to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Photon beam radiation enters the body and passes through healthy tissue, encounters the tumor and leaves the body through healthy tissue. Proton beam radiation has been shown to have the same effect on tumors as photon beam radiation but it enters the body, passes through healthy tissue, and encounters the tumor but then stops. This means less healthy tissue is affected by proton beam treatment than by photon beam treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of proton beam radiation in treating nasopharyngeal cancer and reducing the acute and long-term side effects from the treatment. This study will also test to see if the sparing of the healthy tissue can improve quality of life</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Before beginning study treatment, participants will be asked to fill out a Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires, a Speech Assessment, a ChemoSensory Questionnaire, a Patient Swallowing Diary, A Swallowing Study, Salivary Tests and a Trismus Assessment. Participants will need to go to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) or Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for these tests. - Radiation therapy will be given once a day, five days a week, for seven weeks. This will be given as outpatient care at the Northeast Proton Therapy Center (proton component) and Massachusetts General Hospital (photon component). - During radiation treatments, participants will receive cisplatin intravenously once every three weeks. This three-week period is called a cycle of treatment. - After the completion of radiation, participants will receive cisplatin intravenously once every 4 weeks along with fluorouracil as a continuous infusion over 4 days starting on the day cisplatin is given, for three cycles. - Participants will have a physical exam and blood work drawn weekly to monitor their health. - An MR/CT scan of the head and neck will be done 2 months after the radiation treatment. - Follow-up visits will occur once every three months for 2 years, then once every 6 months during years 3-5, then annually. During these follow-up visits, participants will have the following tests and procedures: physical examination; blood work; chest CT scan and CT/MRI of the head and neck will be repeated once every 6 months during the first three years; swallow study; salivary study; QOL questionnaires; speech assessment; ChemoSensory Questionnaire; and Trismus Assessment.</detailed_description>
