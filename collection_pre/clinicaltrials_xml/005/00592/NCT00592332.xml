	<brief_title>Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure in Type 1 DM, Q2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to the fundamental importance of glucose as a cerebral fuel, a complex and redundant counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia exists in man. Some studies have shown that prior activation of GABA(A) receptors may result in blunting of counterregulatory responses during next day hypoglycemia. The Specific Aim is to determine if repeated activation of GABA(A) receptors using Alprazolam will result in blunting of neuroendocrine, ANS and metabolic counterregulatory mechanisms during next day hypoglycemia in T1DM and healthy man.</detailed_description>
