	<brief_summary>Angiographic evaluation for intermediate lesions is not always accurate. Fractional flow reserve-guided deferral strategy for these lesions showed the same event rate as routine intervention strategy. However, proper FFR criterion for these lesions in the era of drug-eluting stent is not known. This study sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of intermediate lesions according to FFR and compare those of FFR-guided intervention with routine drug-eluting stent implantation strategy.</brief_summary>
