	<brief_title>Systemic Consolidation Therapy After Chemoradiation Therapy Following Operation for High Risk Early Stage Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic consolidation therapy with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (3 cycles per 3 weeks) following radical hysterectomy and adjuvant chemoradiation (3 cycles per 3 weeks) for high risk early stage cervical cancer will elevate the therapeutic efficacy by removing the microscopic metastatic lesions which could not be identified by naked eye and diagnostic imaging tests.</detailed_description>
