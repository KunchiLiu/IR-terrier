	<brief_summary>Depression is likely the most prevalent and disabling psychological complication associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). Yet no controlled depression treatment trials have been performed in this population. The proposed study is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of venlafaxine XR (Effexor XR) in 133 adults with SCI and major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia who are at least one month post injury. Participants will be recruited from four SCI Model System sites, the University of Washington, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, University of Michigan, University of Alabama, Birmingham and Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, Dallas, TX. The purpose of the study is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine XR as a treatment for MDD. The primary outcome will be the percent of responders (those who report at least a 50% reduction in depression severity from baseline to the end of treatment) in the venlafaxine XR versus placebo control group using intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes will include changes in pain, health related quality of life depression-related disability and community participation. A successful clinical trial could lead to more aggressive identification and treatment of MDD as well as improved health and quality of life in this important population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression is likely the most prevalent and disabling psychological complication associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). The prevalence of major depression in people with SCI is 22% or two to six times higher than in the general population. Depression is linked to a myriad of adverse outcomes including poor subjective health, poor community integration, higher rates of medical complications and high rates of suicide. Surprisingly there are no randomized controlled trials for treating major depressive disorder (MMD) in people with SCI. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants in this population, the common assumption that antidepressant medications are effective and well-tolerated among people with SCI is uncertain. Multiple factors such as severe stresses, bereavement and loss of rewarding activities may complicate treatment. Treatment trials suggest antidepressants may not be as effective in people with medical/neurological conditions as they are with depression that develops as a primary condition. For almost 20 years clinicians and scientists have called for controlled clinical trials of antidepressants among people with SCI in order to establish evidence-based treatment. The proposed study is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of venlafaxine XR (Effexor XR) in 133 adults with SCI and MDD or dysthymia who are at least one month post injury. Participants aged 18-64 will be recruited from four SCI Model System sites, the University of Washington, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, University of Michigan, University of Alabama, Birmingham and Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation, Dallas TX. The purpose of the study is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine XR as a treatment for MDD. The primary outcome will be the percent of responders (those who report at least a 50% reduction in depression severity from baseline to the end of treatment) in the venlafaxine XR versus placebo control group using intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes will include changes in pain, health related quality of life and participation. A successful clinical trial could lead to more aggressive identification and treatment of MDD as well as improved health and quality of life in this important population.</detailed_description>
