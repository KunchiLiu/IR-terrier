	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to optimize conditions for a planned human intervention study focusing on how diet predispose for, and influence, lifestyle disease development and its consequence in cardiovascular disease development.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prestudy: Lifestyle and Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common for many of the risk factors of lifestyle diseases is that they are induced by improper diet. Recent research has shown that especially total amount and composition of the macro nutrients, protein, carbohydrate and fats, is important. A time course experiment has been performed where 5 subjects underwent a diet intervention for four weeks with a controlled, balanced macro nutrient energy content of every meal. The sampling time points were 0, 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 days. The goals were to determine optimal length of intervention with stabilization of gene expression to occur and compare blood and subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue as source of biological material for RNA for DNA microarray analysis. Microarray analysis were performed on 3 of the 5 subjects.</detailed_description>
