	<brief_title>Corneal Flap Thickness Planed vs Measured After LASIK by Using Tree Different Systems Cut</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty-six eyes had undergone LASIK were examined, al within 2 weeks to 1 month after surgery. Study involved 3 treatment groups: One with 30 eyes of 15 patients, corneal flaps were created with the microkeratome femtosecond laser 15 KHz 100μm (Intralase Corp, Irvine, Calif.), one with 30 eyes of 15 patients, corneal flaps were created with mechanical microkeratome (Hansatome 160μm (Chiron Vision Corp, Claremont, Calif) and one with 26 eyes of 13 patients, corneal flaps were created with mechanical microkeratome K3000 130μm ( BD Ophthalmic Systems, Waltham, Mass) . A central scan of the total corneal thickness was taken with the confocal microscope (Confoscan 4, Fortune Technologies, Italy) before and at 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery. Corneal epithelial thickness and the Anterior stroma morphology were analyzed by using the NAVIS software V. 3.5.0 (NIDEK, Multi-Instrument Diagnostic System, Japan).</detailed_description>
