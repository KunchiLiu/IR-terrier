	<brief_title>The Optimization of Procedural Pain Control in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2006, in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the St. Antonius Hospital an analgesia improvement program has been implemented. This program consisted of training of ICU nurses and intensivists using a hospital based standardized pain protocol, and systematic pain measurements in rest, rated by the patient himself whenever possible or otherwise by the attending nurse. This program has resulted in a reduction of severe pain levels (NRSâ‰¥4) in ICU patients in rest from 41% to 22%. In order to further reduce this percentage, a pain titration protocol is introduced in 2007. As no attention has yet been paid to intervention-related pain levels in these patients, in this prospective study pain control will be studied using different analgesic dosages of morphine iv (2,5 mg vs 7,5 mg) around unavoidable painful interventions within a pain titration protocol for pain control in rest.</detailed_description>
