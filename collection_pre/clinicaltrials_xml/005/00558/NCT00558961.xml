	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of Gleevec and Chlorambucil in Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent study by Aloyz et al demonstrated a synergistic effect of imatinib on chlorambucil-mediated cytotoxicity in CLL cells in vitro. Imatinib inhibits c-abl and sensitizes cells to chlorambucil. The Phase I component of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of Gleevec when used in combination with chlorambucil. Once the maximum tolerated dose has been determined, a total of 16 patients will be enrolled in the Phase II component of the study. This study will determine the dose limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Gleevec in combination with chlorambucil.</detailed_description>
