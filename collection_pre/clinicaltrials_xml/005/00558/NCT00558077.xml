	<brief_summary>To date, it is still unclear the potential role of laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related anovulatory infertility. Metformin administration, alone or combined with clomiphene citrate (CC), has shown to be an effective and attractive second-line treatment for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) after failure of CC treatment. The aim of the present study will be to compare in a randomized controlled fashion the efficacy of LOD with metformin plus CC administration in the treatment of the CC-resistant PCOS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Second-Line Treatments for Anovulatory Infertility in PCOS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 50 primary infertile anovulatory PCOS patients with documented CC-resistance will be enrolled and randomized into two groups of treatment of 25 subjects each. Group A will undergo diagnostic laparoscopy followed by metformin plus CC, whereas group B will undergo LOD followed by observation. Anovulatory patients will receive IM progesterone. The treatment will be of six months followed by nine-month of observation for pregnant patients. The incidence of spontaneous menses, and the pregnancy, abortion, and live-birth rates will be recorded.</detailed_description>
