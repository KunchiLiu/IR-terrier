	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study conducted in Asia-Pacific was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sorafenib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for chemonaive patients with unresectable stage IIIB (with effusion) or stage IV NSCLC. However, as indicated below, the study was terminated prematurely when the results from Study 11961 (NCT00300885), an earlier Phase 3 study of similar design in subjects with advanced NSCLC, showed an overall lack of efficacy and increased mortality in subjects with squamous subtype. The data available is presented as descriptive analyses, due to the limitations of implementing the statistical analysis plan.</brief_summary>
