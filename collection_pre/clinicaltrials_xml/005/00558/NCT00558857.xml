	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-randomized study to determine the feasibility of using a new technique called Dynamic Substrate Mapping (DSM) to help guide the treatment of ischemic ventricular tachycardia (IVT). We hypothesize that DSM will lead to simpler, more effective ablation of IVT. Results from this study will be used to determine if further clinical investigation is warranted.</brief_summary>
