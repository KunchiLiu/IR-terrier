Ongoing oral medications (other than those specifically for acne) are acceptable provided subjects are on a stable regimen throughout the study and provided the medications are determined likely to not interfere with study assessments. 6. Subjects will not use medicated cosmetics and/or soaps (including soaps containing antibacterial agents such as benzoyl peroxide, keratolytic agents such as salicylic acid, skin fresheners/astringents or aftershave lotions) for the duration of the study. 7. Subjects who agree not use any other acne treatment (including prescription and nonprescription medications) on the test site for the duration of the study. 8. Subjects who agree not to change facial cosmetic products during the study. 9. Subjects who agree to only use sunscreen/sunblock agents that are labeled as noncomedogenic. 1. Subjects or parents of subjects who are unable to understand the protocol or to give informed consent/assent. 2. Subjects with mental illness. 3. Subjects with no inflammatory acne. 4. Subjects with any acne cysts or nodules. 5. Subjects with acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne (e.g. Chloracne, druginduced acne), or any acne requiring systemic treatment. 6. Subjects with excessive facial hair that may interfere with study assessments. 7. Subjects with other facial skin disorders that may interfere with study assessments. 8. Subjects with a history of skin cancer or actinic keratosis. 9. Subjects who have used tanning devices within one week prior to baseline study visit. 10. Subjects who have applied any topical products (e.g. emollients, sunscreens) or any cosmetics to the face at least one hour prior to study assessments. 11.

Subjects with known allergies, a history of, or sensitive to salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide or any of the test article components. 13.

This includes but is not limited to the following: antiinflammatory drugs (e.g. topical and systemic corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines), antiacne drugs, topical and oral retinoids, topical antibacterial agents to the face, and any immunosuppressive drugs. Ongoing oral medications not expected to interfere with study assessments are allowed if the subject is on a stable regimen. 14. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another clinical investigation or have been enrolled in an acne trial within a period of 30 days prior to enrollment in this study. 15. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing. 16. Subjects who require electrolysis, waxing, or depilatories on the face during conduct of the study. 17.
