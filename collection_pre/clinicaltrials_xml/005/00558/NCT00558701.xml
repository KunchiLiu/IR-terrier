	<brief_summary>This single-center, prospective, randomized, and controlled study evaluated the efficacy of silver-coated dressing with active microcurrent in comparison to silver-coated dressing with sham microcurrent on wound-closure time for autogenous skin donor sites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microcurrent for Healing Autogenous Skin Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aims of the study are to evaluate the impact of active versus sham direct microcurrent application to silver nylon dressings in the treatment of donor sites for partial thickness thermal injuries. The primary endpoint is wound-closure time (re-epithelialization of 90% or more of wound surface). A secondary endpoint was infection. Exploratory assessments of clinical outcomes, including inflammation, and pain medication (type, dosage, route, timing) will also be conducted.</detailed_description>
