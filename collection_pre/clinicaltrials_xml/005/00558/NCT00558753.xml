	<brief_summary>The Department of Anesthesiology is conducting a clinical trial to evaluate if pregabalin given prior to and for several days after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) will reduce the prevalence of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) at late postoperative times. The prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is 13% at 6 months post-surgery. CRPS is a painful debilitating condition, with 4 main classes of symptoms : sensory, including burning, allodynia, and hyperalgesia in the affected limb; vasomotor, including temperature asymmetry and skin color changes; edema and sudomotor, including sweating; and movement disorders and dystrophy, including decreased range of motion, motor dysfunction (weakness, tremor, dystonia) and changes in hair, nails or skin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Department of Anesthesiology is conducting a clinical trial to evaluate if pregabalin given prior to and for several days after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) will reduce the prevalence of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) at late postoperative times. The prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is 13% at 6 months post-surgery. CRPS is a painful debilitating condition, with 4 main classes of symptoms : sensory, including burning, allodynia, and hyperalgesia in the affected limb; vasomotor, including temperature asymmetry and skin color changes; edema and sudomotor, including sweating; and movement disorders and dystrophy, including decreased range of motion, motor dysfunction (weakness, tremor, dystonia) and changes in hair, nails or skin. Gabapentin and the related more potent compound pregabalin have been shown to reduce postoperative pain in animal models. Pregabalin also reduces neuropathic pain in rats. In patients, gabapentin has been administered before surgery to treat postoperative pain. In addition, pregabalin has been given postoperatively to reduce dental pain after molar extraction. Gabapentin has been used for many years in patients with neuropathic pain, including reflex sympathetic dystrophy. More recently, pregabalin has also been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, no clinical study has investigated whether perioperative administration of gabapentin or pregabalin can reduce persistent long-term pain syndromes e.g. CRPS.Subjects between the ages of 21 and 80 will be recruited after obtaining an Informed Consent.</detailed_description>
