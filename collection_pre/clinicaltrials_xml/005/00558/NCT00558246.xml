	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, multi-center clinical study of up to 80 patients with full thickness surgical incisions associated with bi-lateral breast procedures. Breast procedures where symmetrical incisions of at least 15cm in length are planned for both breast (bilateral procedure) will be randomised to receive final skin closure of one breast with Prineo (DERMABOND PROTAPE) and the other with intradermal sutures (control). Patients will be evaluated post-operatively at 24 hours (± 6 hours), 7 days (± 1 day), 12 - 25 days, and 90 days (± 10 days).</brief_summary>
