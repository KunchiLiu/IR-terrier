Subjects who are cooperative, willing to give written informed consent prior to study entry, and willing to comply with the study protocol. Subjects who are able to understand and answer questionnaire items. Subjects who can walk (with or without a walking aid).

Subjects with an ABPI &lt; 0.8 as measured within four weeks prior to enrollment. Subjects whose condition, in the opinion of the investigator, does not require or allow for compression therapy.
