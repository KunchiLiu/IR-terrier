	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Low Dose Flu Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. Previous clinical studies demonstrated that delivery of vaccines intradermally (into the skin) can achieve good efficacy even with lower doses of the vaccine. Comparison: Low dose flu vaccine delivered intradermally with a microneedle device compared to the standard dose flu vaccine delivered intramuscularly (into the muscle) with a regular needle.</detailed_description>
