	<brief_summary>Intensive falls prevention programs have been shown to be effective in reducing falls; however, a number of practical programs, based in community setting have not been successful at reducing rate of falls. The purpose of this study was to test, in a randomized, controlled trial, the efficacy of this intermediate-intensity, individual, multifactorial model to reduce falls. It was hypothesized that more contacts would lead to greater adherence and efficacy in reducing falls.</brief_summary>
