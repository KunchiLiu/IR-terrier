	<brief_summary>Primary objective: * Immunogenicity To demonstrate that the influenza vaccine administered by intradermal route at least as immunogenic as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered by intramuscular route at the same dosage in term of HA antibody titres Secondary objectives - Immunogenicity - To describe the immune response 21 days after vaccination with the influenza vaccine administered by ID route versus the adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered by IM route.. - To describe the compliance of both vaccines administered with the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) Note for Guidance immunogenicity criteria, specific for elderly subjects - Safety - To describe the safety profile after vaccination in each group - Acceptability - To describe the pain at the injection site - To describe the comfort of the injection</brief_summary>
