	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to identify how much and how often pralatrexate, given with vitamin B12 and folic acid, can be given safely to patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) that has relapsed (returned after responding to previous treatment) or is refractory (has not responded to previous treatment). It is also being conducted to get information on whether or not pralatrexate is effective in treating relapsed or refractory CTCL.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed relapsed or refractory cutaneous Tcell lymphoma (CTCL): 1. Mycosis fungoides Stage IB or higher 2. Sézary syndrome 3. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell No curative treatment options. Progression of disease (PD) or relapse of disease after at least 1 previous systemic therapy, PD after last prior treatment regimen, and recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months. Adequate blood, liver, and kidney function as determined by laboratory tests. Methylmalonic acide (MMA) serum concentration &lt; 200 nmol/L and homocysteine (Hcy) concentration &lt; 10 μmol/L at screening, or receipt of 1 mg daily oral folic acid for at least 10 days prior to the planned start of pralatrexate and 1 mg intramuscular vitamin B12 within 10 weeks of the planned start of pralatrexate. Women of childbearing potential must use a medically acceptable contraceptive regimen from study treatment initiation until at least 30 days after the last dose of pralatrexate and must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first day of study treatment. Serum pregnancy test not required for patients who are postmenopausal (greater than 12 months since last menses) or are surgically sterilized. Women who are breastfeeding. Men who are not surgically sterile must use a medically acceptable contraceptive regimen from start of pralatrexate until at least 90 days after the last administration of pralatrexate. Written informed consent and privacy authorization. Active concurrent malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix). If there is a history of prior malignancy, the patient must be diseasefree for ≥ 5 years. Patients with other prior malignancies &lt; 5 years before study entry may be enrolled if treatment resulted in complete resolution of the cancer and currently have no clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of active or recurrent disease. Congestive heart failure Class III/IV per the New York Heart Association Heart Failure Guidelines. Uncontrolled hypertension. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive diagnosis with a CD4 count of &lt;100 mm3 or detectable viral load within the past 3 months, and is receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Symptomatic central nervous system metastases or lesions for which treatment is required. Active uncontrolled infection, underlying medical condition that would impair ability to receive protocol treatment. Major surgery within 2 weeks of planned start of treatment. Receipt of any conventional chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) encompassing &gt;10% of bone marrow within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to study treatment or planned use during the study. Receipt of systemic corticosteroids within 3 weeks of study treatment, unless on a continuous dose of ≤10 mg/day of prednisone for at least 1 month. Initiation of or change in dosage of topical corticosteroids within 3 weeks of study treatment (topical steroid use within 3 weeks is allowed if strength/use has been stable for at least 1 month; topical corticosteroids cannot be started during the study). Use of investigational drugs, biologics, or devices within 4 weeks prior to study treatment or planned use during the study. Receipt of a monoclonal antibody within 3 months without evidence of progression. Use of oral retinoids within 4 weeks of study treatment or highdose vitamin A. Previous exposure to pralatrexate, unless the patient was on this study, achieved a complete or partial response, and was taken off study treatment because of investigator decision, and subsequently experienced disease recurrence or progressive disease. Reentering patients: must not have received subsequent therapy for CTCL during the time off initial study treatment.</criteria>
