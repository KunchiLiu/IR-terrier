	<brief_summary>Plasma L-arginine concentrations are decreased in premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). A carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) polymorphism has been correlated with low plasma concentrations of L-arginine in neonates (&gt; 35 weeks of gestation). Recently Moonen et al (Pediatr Res 2007; 62(2):188-90) described a correlation between this CPS1 T1405N single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the presence of NEC in VLBW infants. However there is no data about the correlation between the plasma arginine concentrations and the T1405N SNP in the CPS-1 gene in VLBW infants. In the present project we postulate that T1405N SNP in the CPS-1 gene is associated with lower plasma arginine concentrations and is also a risk factor for the development of NEC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plasma L-arginine concentrations are decreased in premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). A C-to-A nucleotide transversion (T1405N) in the gene that encodes carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle, has been correlated with low plasma concentrations of L-arginine in neonates (&gt; 35 weeks of gestation). Recently Moonen et al (Pediatr Res 2007; 62(2):188-90) described a correlation between this CPS1 T1405N single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the presence of NEC in VLBW infants.
