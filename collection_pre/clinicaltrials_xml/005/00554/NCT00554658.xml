	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to assess the effect of quetiapine treatment in neuroleptic naive, first-episode schizophrenic patients on aspects of functional and structural neuroplasticity assessed by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation and voxel-based morphometry. Main outcome measure is a change in gray matter density under quetiapine treatment from baseline to steady-state-treatment after 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
