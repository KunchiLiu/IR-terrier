	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proposed pilot study is to examine the use of varenicline in people with schizophrenia to specifically assess tolerability and efficacy for smoking cessation. Specifically, The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine if taking of varenicline along with an individual smoking cessation supportive program is a safe and effective treatment of nicotine addiction in schizophrenic patients. We hypothesize that the varenicline treated patients will achieve higher rates of smoking cessation than those who receive placebo and individual support.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the data analysis will be to measure the rate of smoking cessation in the two treatment groups. Smoking cessation will be measured weekly through a composite measure of self-reported abstinence, end expired carbon monoxide (CO) of less than C10 ppm and urine cotinine dipstick measure of &lt; 30 ng/ml. The primary endpoint will be point prevalence at 12 weeks. The four week continuous abstinence rate for the last four weeks of the treatment phase will also be evaluated. The point prevalence abstinence rates will also be obtained. The secondary objective is to determine whether smoking cessation is associated with a worsening of cognition and psychiatric symptomology. We hypothesize that subjects who achieve abstinence in the varenicline group will not show worsening on neurocognitive and symptom measures compared to abstinence subjects in the placebo group. Lastly, we will attempt to identify any clinical or topographic markers which predict cessation.</detailed_description>
