	<brief_summary>Experimental studies suggest that systemic inflammation leads to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. This study will examine the effects of the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease. Subjects will be treated with sulfasalazine or to placebo for six weeks. After a two-week rest period, subjects will cross over to the alternative treatment. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery will be studied before and after each drug. We hypothesize that anti-inflammatory therapy will reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
