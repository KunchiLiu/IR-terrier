	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether injecting local anaesthetic into the vaginal tissues,just prior to transvaginal egg collection,will decrease the amount of pain experienced by women having their eggs collected on an IVF cycle. All women will also receive intravenous sedation as required as well as a sleeping tablet thirty minutes prior to the procedure which is our routine procedure for egg collection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Anaesthetic for Transvaginal Egg Collection in IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transvaginal oocyte retrieval is the most common method of oocyte collection in IVF cycles. A variety of different methods are used to provide analgesia/anesthesia for oocyte collection. Our unit has always used an oral pre-medication followed by intravenous fentanyl during the procedure but this doesn't seem to provide adequate analgesia for some women. The aim of this study was to compare the addition of intravaginal local anaesthetic injection versus saline placebo to our usual analgesia regime to see whether less intravenous fentanyl was required and whether the women experienced less pain during oocyte collection.</detailed_description>
