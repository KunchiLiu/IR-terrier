	<brief_title>CHInese Medicine NeuroAid Efficacy on Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is a major cause of death and disability. Previous clinical studies performed in China have shown that NeuroAiD increase stroke patients'recovery in terms of neurological disability and functional outcome{Chen et al,2009}and thus may be beneficial as part of a post-stroke rehabilitation programme. In the CHIMES study,we seek to test the hypothesis that NeuroAiD is superior to a placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional outcome in patients recruited within 72 h after the ischemic stroke with intermediate range of severity {6&lt;_NIHSS&lt;_14}.More details of the study protocol have recently been published {Venketasubramanian et al,2009}.</detailed_description>
