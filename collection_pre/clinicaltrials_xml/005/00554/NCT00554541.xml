	<brief_title>Lower Extremity Venous Hemodynamics in Obese Patients Without Clinically Significant Venous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease of the veins include blood clots, varicose veins, leg swelling, and sores on the legs. Venous disease is more common in overweight patients, but little is known as to why this is the case. This research project is investigating the relationship between body weight and function of the leg veins using a special non-invasive technique known as venous plethysmography. We hope to investigate the reason for the relationship between body weight and higher risk of vein problems. Approximately 45 people will take part in this study. Patients will be recruited from among three groups: normal weight people, overweight people, and obese people. Resting ankle-brachial index will be measured in both lower extremities to exclude the presence of peripheral arterial disease. Venous physiologic study using air plethysmography with positional maneuvers will be performed. Parameters to be measured will be outflow time, passive draining and refill time, and exercise venous plethysmography. All studies will be performed with the Phlebotest system (Osborn Medical). All study procedures will be done during one visit, and no further follow-up is required.</detailed_description>
