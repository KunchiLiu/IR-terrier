	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine which of tertiary prevention spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) or a home exercise program is the more efficient approach to reduce pain and increase functional capacity, quality of life and general health condition. To do so, 60 participants with chronic cervical pain, will be recruited and divided into 3 groups according to the intervention they will receive: control group, experimental group 1 who will receive preventive chiropractic care in the form of spinal manipulations and experimental group 2 will have to perform an individualized home exercise program on a daily basis. We hypothesize that a group of patient receiving SMT + a home exercise program will present less pain and functional disabilities over a 1 year period. The innovative value of this project is mainly related to the fact that it will generate new and potentially very useful data concerning the clinical significance of preventive chiropractic care. Moreover, such data will be beneficial to our profession as chiropractic makes a step towards prevention, wellness and public health.</brief_summary>
