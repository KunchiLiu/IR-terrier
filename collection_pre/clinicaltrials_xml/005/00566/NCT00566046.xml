	<brief_summary>Post-traumatic seizures can appear frequently after a severe traumatic brain injury. Two types of seizures are usually identified: early seizures during the week following the trauma and late epilepsy afterward. Several antiepileptic drugs are usually used to prevent early seizures but no treatment has demonstrated any preventive effect against late epilepsy. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug usually used for the treatment of epileptic patients and has pharmacologic properties that could also be interesting for the prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy.</brief_summary>
