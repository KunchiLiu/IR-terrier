	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Combination With Zoledronic Acid for the Treatment of Breast Cancer With Bone Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs: Zoledronic acid is designed to strengthen the bone and prevent fractures or breaks in the bone. Dasatinib is designed to block (stop) cells responsible for the breakdown of bone. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled in a group of at least 3 participants to begin receiving zoledronic acid and dasatinib. The dose of dasatinib you receive will depend on when you enrolled in this study. All participants will receive the same amount of zoledronic acid. The first group of participants will be treated with the lowest dose of dasatinib given in combination with zoledronic acid. Once the highest tolerable dose level is found, up to 25 additional participants will be enrolled at that dose level. This is called the Phase II portion of the study. Drug Administration: You will receive zoledronic acid through a needle in your vein on Day 1 over 15 minutes. You will take dasatinib by mouth daily for 28 days. Dasatinib should be taken on an empty stomach or after a light meal. Every 28 days is called a study "cycle." Study Visits for Participants in the Phase I Portion: On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - You will have a performance status evaluation. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an ECG. On Day 8 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an ECG. On Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. - You will have a physical exam. - You will have a performance status evaluation. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an ECG. On Day 21 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. - Your vital signs will be measured. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an ECG. On Day 1 of Cycle 2, you will have an ECG. On Day 1 of all other cycles, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. - You will have a physical exam. - You will have a performance status evaluation. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have MRIs, CT scans, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease. On Days 1 and 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 3rd month, urine will be collected over 24 hours to check for markers of bone loss. After Cycles 3, 6, 9 and so on, you will have CT scans, MRIs, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be experiencing. Study Visits for Participants in the Phase II Portion: On Day 1 of all cycles, you will have the following tests and procedures performed. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - You will have a performance status evaluation. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Days 1 and 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 3rd month, urine will be collected to check for markers of bone loss. After Cycles 2, 4, 6 and so on, you will have CT scans, MRIs, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease. At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be experiencing. Length of Study: You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects. End-of-Study Visit: Once you go off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit. - Your vital signs will be measured. - Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have MRIs, CT scans, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease. This is an investigational study. Zoledronic acid is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. Dasatinib is not FDA approved or commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been authorized for use in research only. Up to 28 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 12 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive carcinoma of the breast. 2. Patients must carry a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer with predominant bone involvement. For the purposes of this study, predominant bone involvement will be defined as radiographically detected bone metastasis in the presence or absence of other sites of metastatic breast cancer (i.e. visceral involvement). If visceral involvement is present, patients must be asymptomatic and have no tumors in visceral organs that measure &gt;3cm in size. 3. Patients must agree to serial urine collections for measurement of Ntx. 4. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 5. Patients must be able to swallow oral medications. Dasatinib must be taken whole and cannot be crushed. 6. Patients must have evaluable disease using WHO Criteria for Assessment of Disease Response in Bone or MDACC Modified Response Criteria for Assessment of Disease Response in Bone. 7. Patients must not have had &gt;1 chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients with metastasis diagnosed &lt;/= 6 months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy are considered to have had chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. 8. Patients with ER positive disease must have had disease progression on at least one prior hormonal therapy for metastatic disease. Patients must also have developed disease progression on their most recent hormonal therapy regimen and be agreeable to continue this regimen in combination with protocol therapy. For the purposes of this study disease progression while receiving hormonal therapy will be defined as: Radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to RECIST criteria, Progression of disease by physical exam in patients with skin involvement.
