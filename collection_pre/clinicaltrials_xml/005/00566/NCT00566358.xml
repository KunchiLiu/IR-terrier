	<brief_summary>Diabetes reversion is observed after bariatric surgeries even before significant weight loss could explain it, mainly in predominantly malabsorptive procedures (98,9% for biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch), followed by those combining malabsorption and gastric restriction (83,7% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Changes in the hormonal communication between the digestive system and the pancreas would explain the antidiabetogenic role of the surgery, so this effect could be obtained in nonobese, diabetic individuals. In order to try this hypothesis, RUBINO and MARESCAUX (2004) studied the gastrojejunal bypass (duodenal exclusion)in an mouse model of diabetes without obesity. In their technique the stomach volume is kept intact, maintaining the caloric ingestion and the weight of the animals. There was a fast improvement of diabetes, independent of diet and weight, without the potential nutritional deprivations commonly seen in the bariatric surgery like iron and vitamin deficiency. This study will evaluate the mechanisms of amelioration of type 2 diabetes mellitus after duodenal exclusion surgery in human non-obese, diabetic volunteers and known insulin secretion capacity, by the method of standardized meal stimulus. It is expected to be secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal hormones that stimulate insulin secretion (incretins). The knowledge about the clinical outcomes of this technique in humans and the description of the secretion pattern of gastrointestinal hormones after the surgery may contribute to the implementation of this surgery as a new therapeutic option for overweight (non-obese) diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment of Non-obese Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Duodenal Exclusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is large recovery of insulin sensibility after bariatric surgery, as the patients get closer to ideal weight. Diabetes reversion is more frequent after predominantly malabsorptive procedures (98,9% for biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch), followed by those combining malabsorption and gastric restriction (83,7% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Glycemia normalization occurs in an early phase of the postoperative period, even before significant weight loss could explain it. These techniques have in common a bypass of the duodenum and part of the jejunum. Many peptides are released in this segments that regulate pancreatic beta cells (insulin producers) either in physiological state or in diabetes. Anatomical-functional changes in the enteroinsular axis would explain the antidiabetogenic role of the surgery, so this effect could be obtained in nonobese, diabetic individuals. In order to try this hypothesis, RUBINO and MARESCAUX (2004) studied the gastrojejunal bypass (duodenal exclusion)in Goto-Kakizaki mice (GK), the most used animal model of diabetes without obesity. In their technique the stomach volume is kept intact, maintaining the caloric ingestion and the weight of the animals. There was a fast improvement of diabetes, independent of diet and weight. The authors concluded that this procedure should be applied in humans for reversal of diabetes without the potential nutritional deprivations commonly seen in the bariatric surgery like iron and vitamin deficiency. The amelioration of diabetes after bariatric surgery is related to the modulation of production of gastrointestinal hormones relevant to the insulin production (incretin effect). This study will evaluate the mechanisms of amelioration of type 2 diabetes mellitus after duodenal exclusion surgery in human non-obese, diabetic volunteers and known insulin secretion capacity, by the method of standardized meal stimulus. It is expected to be secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal hormones that stimulate insulin secretion (incretins). The knowledge about the clinical outcomes of this technique in humans and the description of the secretion pattern of gastrointestinal hormones after the surgery may contribute to the implementation of this surgery as a new therapeutic option for overweight (non-obese) diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
