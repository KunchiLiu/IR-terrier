	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy is a common endoscopic procedure as an investigation of colorectal pathology. Different modalities of pain control have been described in the past. Propofol is a perfect drug for endoscopic procedure since it has the characteristic of fast onset, short half-life and early recovery. Its unfamiliarity and its potential cardiovascular and respiratory side effect make it unpopular to endoscopists. Recent reports showed propofol is safe in bolus titration by nurse in Caucasian in all endoscopic procedures. Our previous pilot study showed nurse administered propofol sedation (NAPS) is effective and safe and highly acceptable by Chinese patients. Here we conduct a randomized controlled study to compare the effectiveness of NAPS versus traditional sedation.</brief_summary>
