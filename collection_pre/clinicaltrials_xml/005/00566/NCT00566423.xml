	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that baseline plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels are surrogate markers of clinical severity of PAH and that changes in plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and MIF levels pre and post exercise.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of PAH, based on currently accepted gold standard for Right Heart Catheterization. Patients with mean artery pressure of greater that 25 mm Hg at rest or 30mm Hg during exercise with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 18mm Hg on right heart catheterization. Significant left heart disease or renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg%).</criteria>
