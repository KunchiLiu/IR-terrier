	<detailed_description>In this randomized, double-blind, euglycemic glucose clamp study, 10 healthy male volunteers received a subcutaneous injection of 0.4 U/kg insulin detemir, insulin glargine or NPH insulin on three separate study days in a cross-over design. After insulin administration, plasma glucose was maintained at 0.3 mmol/l below fasting level for 24 hours by manually adjusted glucose infusion. C-peptide, insulin, NEFA and counter regulatory hormones were measured throughout the clamp period. Endogenous glucose release (EGR) was assessed by the isotope dilution technique (3-3H-glucose).</detailed_description>
