	<brief_summary>This study is a three-armed randomised controlled trial that aims to determine the effect of a structured educational programme on physical activity levels and glucose tolerance in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The educational programme is designed to promote physical activity by targeting perceptions and knowledge of IGT, exercise self-efficacy, and self-regulatory skills. The study will also investigate whether the effectiveness of the educational programme at promoting self-regulatory skills and physical activity is enhanced by the inclusion of a pedometer and personalised step/day goals.</brief_summary>
