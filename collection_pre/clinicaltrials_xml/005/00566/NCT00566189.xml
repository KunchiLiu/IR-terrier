	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery leads to remission of type 2 diabetes in morbid obese patients in 80% (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)to 90% (biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch) of cases. The current consensus supports bariatric surgical treatment for diabetic patients with BMI as low as 35kg/m2 but it has questioned that lower body mass patients might benefit of the surgery as well. This study is proposed to describe the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in mild obese (BMI 30-35) human volunteers on incretins, insulin production and sensitivity and its clinical (diabetic chronic complications) and metabolic impact.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery leads to remission of type 2 diabetes in morbid obese patients in 80% (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)to 90% (biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch) of cases; most of the remainder achieve better glycemic control, even if they regain weight. The current consensus supports bariatric surgical treatment for diabetic patients with BMI as low as 35kg/m2 but it has questioned that lower body mass patients might benefit of the surgery as well. Actually, many clinical researchers worldwide would consider a lower limit BMI of 30kg/m2, i.e., any grade of obesity. This study is proposed to describe the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Fobi-Capella technique, adapted to create a larger gastric pouch, about 80ml)in mild obese (BMI 30-35) human volunteers on incretins, insulin production and sensitivity and its clinical (diabetic chronic complications) and metabolic impact.</detailed_description>
