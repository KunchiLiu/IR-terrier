	<brief_summary>This study is a single site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group design. this study is designed to directly examine the efficacy of a single daily dose of atomoxetine taken in the morning in alleviating sleep initiation insomnia in children with ADHD. Primary outcome measures are sleep parameters, specifically mean sleep onset latency (time of onset to persistent sleep), as measured by actigraphy/sleep diary, and parent and child-reported evening settling difficulties, as measured on the evening subscale items of the parent and child versions of the DPREMB-R. Secondary outcome measures include: additional actigraphic sleep parameters (night wakings, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency), daytime sleepiness (Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale, sleepiness visual analogue scale (VAS), and morning behaviors on the DPREMB-R); ADHD symptom improvement (ADHD-RS, parent version; provider-completed CGI); a neurocognitive measure of attention and impulsivity (CPT); executive functions (Brown ADD Scale for Children) and functional outcomes/quality of life (CHQ).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects are children aged 6 through 17 years with DSMIV criteriadefined ADHD and sleep initiation insomnia. the sleep onset delay must not be exclusively related to direct or rebound effects of psychostimulant treatment. All subjects will be screened for primary sleep disorders with survey questionnaires (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, CSHQ (12) and Restless Sleep Questionnaire) (Visit 1); subjects scoring above a predefined threshold for OSA and/or RLS/PLMD symptoms will be excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria include IQ &lt; 80 (WISCIII screen at baseline), history of significant chronic medical illness (diabetes, severe asthma), comorbid depression or other significant psychiatric comorbidities (ODD, LD not excluded; determined by screening with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC)), history of chronic use of sedating (eg, antihistamines) or alertnessenhancing (eg, caffeine) medications, history of conditions for which use of atomoxetine is contraindicated (eg, narrow angle glaucoma), use of other prescription medication for ADHD and/or use of prescription/OTC medication for sleep (eg, alpha agonists, hypnotics, melatonin, antihistamines) following the screening visit, and history of failure to respond to an adequate (defined as appropriate dose and adequate duration of therapy) previous trial of atomoxetine</criteria>
