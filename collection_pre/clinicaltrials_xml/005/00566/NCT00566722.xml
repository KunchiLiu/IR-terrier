	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of Humira (adalimumab) in patients who had a sub-optimal response to prior systemic therapy. This open-label study was conducted in a patient population of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis patients, which is an approved patient population for adalimumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Study of Adalimumab in Subjects Who Have a Sub-optimal Response to Systemic Therapy or Phototherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 16-week multicenter, open-label study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab, followed by 40 mg adalimumab every other week in the treatment of psoriasis in patients with a sub-optimal response to etanercept, methotrexate (MTX), or Narrow band Ultraviolet âˆ’ B (NB-UVB). Approximately 150 participants were planned for 3 sub-studies: 80 participants with sub-optimal response to etanercept, 40 participants with sub-optimal response to MTX, and 30 participants with sub-optimal response to NB-UVB. Actual enrollment was 82 participants with sub-optimal response to etanercept, 41 participants with sub-optimal response to MTX, and 29 participants with sub-optimal response to NB-UVB. Screening was performed at least 96 hours and no more than 31 days before the Baseline visit (Week 0). A participant who was eligible for the study based on sub-optimal response to one treatment (MTX, NB-UVB, or etanercept) was required to discontinue that treatment within a specified time before first dose of adalimumab (see descriptions of sub-study groups). In addition, if the participant was also receiving another qualifying treatment, he/she was required to have discontinued the other treatment at least 30 days before the Baseline visit (Week 0). Adalimumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection. At the Baseline Visit (Week 0), all participants received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab SC. Every other week (odd-numbered weeks) from Week 1 to Week 15, participants received 40 mg adalimumab SC. This was a single group assignment study, that is, all participants received the same treatment; however, data were summarized for 3 groups (sub-studies) that were defined by psoriasis treatments participants received before entering this study: methotrexate, etanercept, or narrow-band, ultraviolet-B. Efficacy was evaluated using the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of disease severity, and patient-reported outcomes: Patient's Global Assessment (PTGA) of disease severity, the Psoriasis-related Pruritus Assessment, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a visual analog scale (VAS) for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis pain, the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI: SHP). Serious and nonserious adverse events were summarized by sub-study of participants (suboptimal response to MTX, suboptimal response to NB-UVB, and suboptimal response to etanercept).</detailed_description>
