	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to verify the performance of PSD Veritas in providing staple line protection for surgical procedures that buttress the stomach and other staple lines during roux-en-Y surgery. The study is designed as two separate patient groups. One will enroll patients into a group where linear staple lines are buttressed at the stomach. The second portion of the trial will enroll patients into a group where the circular staple line at the GJ and linear staple lines at the stomach are buttressed with PSD Veritas.</detailed_description>
