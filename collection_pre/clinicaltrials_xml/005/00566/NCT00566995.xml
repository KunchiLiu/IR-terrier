	<brief_summary>This study will examine the effectiveness of an investigational drug called ZD6474 (also known as vandetanib or ZACTIMA). Vandetanib is an experimental drug that is designed to prevent the growth and development of new blood vessels on tumors and to prevent the direct growth of cancer cells. It has been tested in a number of clinical trials on adults with cancer, but the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration has not specifically approved it as a cancer treatment. The purpose of this investigational study is to better understand how vandetanib affects humans who have kidney cancer related to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, and to develop tests that may improve researchers understanding of kidney cancer and its effects. Volunteers must be at least 18 years old and must have been diagnosed with kidney cancer related to VHL. Candidates must have a life expectancy greater than three months and must have at least one measurable renal tumor for study purposes. Candidates may not be receiving any other investigational agents or have been treated with an investigational drug within the past four weeks. Candidates who have had surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy within the past four weeks will be excluded from the study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and medical history. During the study, participants will receive an oral dose of vandetanib once a day for 28 days (a treatment period known as a cycle). Participants will need to return to the National Institutes of Health every two weeks on the same day of the week as the first dose of vandetanib for a series of tests and procedures, including blood and urine tests and an electrocardiogram. Every 12 weeks, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be done to assess the size of participants tumors. Participants whose tumors do not grow and who do not have unacceptable side effects may continue to receive vandetanib to maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study....</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Vandetanib in Individuals With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Von Hippel Lindau disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for developing tumors in a number of organs, including the kidneys, brain, spine, adrenal glands, eyes and pancreas. The molecular hallmark of VHL is inactivation of the VHL gene which leads to accumulation of proteins targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin pathway, which includes a group of transcriptionally active proteins called the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), whose alpha subunits undergo degradation in a VHL-dependent fashion. Accumulation of HIFs results in overexpression of several genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF), and erythropoietin, which are believed to play a role in tumorigenesis, tumor progression and metastasis. ZD6474 is an orally administered receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the Kinase insert domain-containing receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR/VEGFR2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)/vascular growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is an endothelial cell receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and plays a crucial role in mediating tumor angiogenesis, while epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (a receptor for TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor (EGF) is believed to mediate tumor growth and proliferation. Objective: Primary Objective To assess the overall response rate in VHL patients with renal tumors treated with single agent ZD6474 Secondary Objectives: To study the safety and tolerability of ZD6474 To evaluate time to progression and progression-free survival in VHL patients receiving ZD6474 To study the effect of ZD6474 treatment on non-renal tumors associated with von Hippel Lindau disease ( pancreatic tumors, pheochromocytoma, central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas) To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells and to explore the utility of these markers as surrogates of angiogenesis inhibition To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on biomarkers of angiogenesis such as plasma VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 Eligibility: Adults with clinical diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease Presence of one or more measurable renal tumors Age greater than or equal to 18 years Adequate organ function, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2) and life expectancy (greater than 3 months) Design: Single agent ZD6474 administered daily at a starting dose of 300mg per day Patients will be evaluated for response every 12 weeks using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria The study is based on an open label two-stage optimal phase II design Accrual of a maximum of 37 patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients must satisfy all the following criteria to be eligible for study enrolment. Clinical diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease. The presence of at least one measurable (as defined by RECIST) renal tumor (renal cell carcinoma (RCC)). Patients with tumors localized to the kidney as well as those with metastatic RCC are eligible. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Life expectancy greater than 3 months Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 02. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to 3,000micro/L, absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500 micro/L platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000 micro/L, serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of reference range or measured 24 hr. creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 ml/min, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 2.5 times upper limit of reference range, total bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of reference range (less than 3 times upper limit of reference range in patients with Gilberts disease), alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 times upper limit of reference range (or less than or equal to 5 times upper limit of reference range if considered to be related to liver metastases by the principal investigator (PI)). No history of serious intercurrent medical illness.

Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events (to less than or equal to grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or have received treatment with a nonapproved or investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of study treatment except those used for imaging studies. Use of 5HT3 antagonists because of the potential effect on corrected QT interval (QTc) interval. Any concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes. Concomitant medications that are potent inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) function, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates such as phenobarbital, or St. Johns Wort. Clinically significant cardiac event (including symptomatic heart failure, myocardial infarction or angina) within 3 months of entry or presence of any cardiac disease that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. History of clinically significant arrhythmia [including multifocal premature ventricular contraction (PVC), bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia] that is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation controlled on medication is not excluded. Presence of Left bundle branch block.

Congenital long QT syndrome or first degree relative with unexplained sudden death under the age of 40 years QTc with Bazetts correction that is unmeasurable, or greater than or equal to 480 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG). If a patient has QTc greater than or equal to 480 msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may be repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening ECGs must be less than 480 msec in order for the patient to be eligible for the study).

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patient known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and requiring antiretroviral therapy. Currently active diarrhea that may affect the ability of the patient to absorb ZD6474 or tolerate further diarrhea. Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation Patients with known bleeding disorders Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZD6474 is an antiangiogenic agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ZD6474. Any known hypersensitivity to ZD6474 or other excipients of ZD6474.</criteria>
