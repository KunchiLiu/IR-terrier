	<brief_summary>- Primary objectives: - To demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad® rHA administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1. - To demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad® rHA administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1. - To demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad® rHA administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age and 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is well-tolerated compared to children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1. - Secondary objectives - To describe the antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad® rHA administered to healthy children from 9 months of age. - To evaluate the safety profile of Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad® rHA administered to healthy children from 9 months of age.</brief_summary>
