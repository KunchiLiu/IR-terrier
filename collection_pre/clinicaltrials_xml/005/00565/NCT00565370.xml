	<brief_summary>There is strong scientific rationale for exploring the role of sorafenib with capecitabine and cisplatin (XP) in AGC. XP is a new standard of care in AGC and sorafenib is a novel signal transduction inhibitor that prevents tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis through blockade of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGF-R2 and PDGFR-beta.</brief_summary>
