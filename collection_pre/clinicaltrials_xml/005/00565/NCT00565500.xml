	<brief_summary>Study design: Single center, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel groups. To evaluate the potential interaction between aspirin and ibuprofen or celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and documented stable ischemic heart disease, a total of 24 patients chronically treated with aspirin will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups: 1) celecoxib 200 mg bid; 2) ibuprofen 600 mg tid; 3) placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib, Ibuprofen and the Antiplatelet Effect of Aspirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with arthritis and vascular disease may receive both NSAIDs and lowdose aspirin for the secondary prevention of important vascular events. The use of COX-2 inhibitors may have the potential advantage vs. nonselective NSAIDs in reducing the probability of interfering with permanent inactivation of COX-1 platelet by low-dose aspirin, in this setting. In fact, recent studies suggest that the likelihood of COX-inhibitors to present this pharmacodynamic interaction is inversely related to their COX-2 selectivity. Thus, differently from the non-selective NSAID ibuprofen, prior administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib, does not antagonize the irreversible inhibition induced by aspirin in healthy subjects. Aim of this study is to determine whether celecoxib given at therapeutic dose at steady state alters the antiplatelet activity of low-dose aspirin, in comparison with ibuprofen.</detailed_description>
