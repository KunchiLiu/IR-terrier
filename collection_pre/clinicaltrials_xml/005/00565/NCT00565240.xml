	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that administration of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) and hormonal contraceptives (HC) in the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle will result in atresia of the follicles in the extant wave and cause synchronous re-emergence of a new follicular wave. We anticipate that this will provide us with information to facilitate the development of a new method for ovarian synchronization; a safer, more effective ovulation induction therapy; a new method for emergency contraception; and a greater understanding of human folliculogenesis.</brief_summary>
