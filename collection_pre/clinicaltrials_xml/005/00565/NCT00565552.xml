	<brief_summary>So far the evaluation of scar treatment was based on subjective criteria. The patient groups were divided into treated versus non-treated. In this study we use patients undergoing ear reconstruction with autologous rib cartilage. The thoracic scar of harvesting the rib cartilage is routinely reopened after 3 month during second stage of reconstruction. Therefore we have a ideal model of clinical, physiological and histological scar evaluation in a homologous patient group. All patients randomly treat one half of the scar with a silicone gel (Dermatix). The other half is untreated as an internal control.</brief_summary>
