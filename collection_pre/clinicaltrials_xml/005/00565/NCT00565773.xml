	<brief_summary>Acute rejection is a common problem after a kidney transplant. Rejection can occur when the kidney recipient's immune system tries to attack (or reject) the new kidney. Rejection typically most often develops in the first few months after a transplant. This single center study will seek to determine if a new combination of anti-rejection medications, including the recently FDA approved drug called Belatacept, is better than the current standard anti-rejection drug regimen at preventing rejection. Also to be determined will be whether the new combination of drugs will allow participants to wean off their oral anti-rejection medications over time. This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new investigational drug combination using alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus when given with or without donor bone marrow. This combination of medicines has not been tested before in humans. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is approved for use in some types of white blood cell cancers, but is considered investigational in transplant patients. Belatacept is now FDA approved and is being studied in transplant patients. Sirolimus (Rapamune) is approved for use in transplant patients, but its use with belatacept and alemtuzumab is investigational. In the initial 20 subjects enrolled in the study, half tested whether an infusion of bone marrow from the kidney donor would improve the effect of these drugs. This bone marrow infusion was also considered investigational. Enrollment of 20 additional subjects was begun in January, 2013. The donor bone marrow infusion has been eliminated. Enrollment was open to primary living and deceased donor kidney recipients. Enrollment is closed as of 8/12/2014. Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be a single-center, open-label,proof of concept study in non-HLA-identical living and deceased donor renal transplants. The initial 20 subjects were randomized to either receive/not to receive a single donor bone marrow infusion in addition to the investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus. Since the bone marrow infusion has been eliminated in the second group of 20 subjects, no randomization will be required. All recipients in the second group of 20 subjects will receive the same investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus. At the time of transplant, participants will receive a 3-hour IV infusion of 30 mg. of alemtuzumab. Participants will receive a combination of sirolimus and belatacept for at least 1 year. At that time, eligible participants will consent to and begin oral immunosuppressive withdrawal or continue therapy through study close. Sirolimus will first be weaned by halving the dose and/or increasing the dosing interval over at least a 2-6 month period. After sirolimus is discontinued, participants will remain on monthly IV belatacept monotherapy indefinitely. Follow-up will continue for at least five years. If subjects are successfully weaned from oral immunosuppression during their participation in this trial, no other alternative therapy will be warranted. Since belatacept is now FDA approved, subjects will be eligible to continue this therapy after their study participation has ended.</detailed_description>
