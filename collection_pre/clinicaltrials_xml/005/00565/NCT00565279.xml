	<brief_summary>A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of seborrhoeic dermatitis has a potentially causative neurogenic inflammatory aspect. ASF1057 is a new drug that acts through a modulation of neurogenic inflammation through important complementary mechanisms of action. This study will test the efficacy and safety of ASF1057 in the treatment of patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis.</brief_summary>
