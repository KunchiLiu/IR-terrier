	<brief_summary>Interleukin 29 (IL-29) is a substance that is produced in the body to help fight viral infections. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and antiviral effects of PEG-rIL-29 (a man-made form of IL-29) when it is given either by itself at different doses or in combination with the approved dose of ribavirin (an antiviral drug) to subjects with hepatitis C infection who have received no prior treatment for this disease or who have relapsed following previous treatment with PEGylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN-α), or other form of IFN-α, and ribavirin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of PEG-rIL-29 (or PEG-IFN Lambda) in Subjects With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-part study of PEG-rIL-29 in subjects with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection who have either received no prior treatment with a PEGylated IFN-α (or other form of IFN-α) or who have relapsed following prior treatment with a PEGylated IFN-α (or other form of IFN-α) and ribavirin. Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of PEG-rIL-29 when given as a single agent either every other week or weekly over a 4-week period to treatment-relapsed subjects. Part 2 of the study will evaluate dose levels and/or schedules of PEG-rIL-29 in combination with daily oral ribavirin administered over a 4-week period to treatment-relapsed subjects. Part 3 of the study will evaluate dose levels and/or schedules of PEG-rIL-29 in combination with daily oral ribavirin administered over a 4-week period to subjects who have received no prior treatment.</detailed_description>
