	<criteria>Patient has completed participation in one of the designated eligible QRxPharma, Inc. acute pain leadin studies. Patient has a BMI ≤35. Patient will anticipate taking the first dose of study medication in this Extension Study no longer than 24 hours after taking the final dose of study medication in the leadin study.

Patient has a pulseoximetry measurement ≥95%, a respiration rate ≥12 breaths/minute, systolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure ≥50 mm Hg at the Extension Study Baseline Visit. Patient is willing to refrain from driving throughout the duration of participation in the study. Patient has acute asthma, head injury, elevated intracranial pressure, convulsive states, congestive heart failure (NYHA classification of III or IV), current cardiac arrhythmia, current transient cerebral ischemic attacks, current uncontrolled unstable coexistent systemic disease, serious intercurrent illness, other medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude participation in the study. Patient has allergy, hypersensitivity, or contraindications to opioids. Patient has poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication) at the Extension Study Baseline Visit. Patient is currently taking tramadol or anticipates taking tramadol during the course of the study. Patient is currently taking antipsychotic drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, muscle relaxants, or medications for the treatment of depression. Patient is currently taking any opioid analgesic other than Q8003 or other opioid study medication, or anticipates taking any opioid analgesic other than Q8003 or other opioid study medication during the course of the study.

Patient has a history of drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

Patient has received any investigational medication within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug in this study other than Q8003 or is scheduled to receive any investigational drug other than Q8003 during the course of this study.
