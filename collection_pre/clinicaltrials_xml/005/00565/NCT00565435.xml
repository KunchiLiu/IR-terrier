	<brief_summary>Since Chiari malformation is a common disease, many patients require surgical operation to relieve pressure from the back portion of the skull. The purpose of this research is to compare two different materials that are routinely used to repair the opening in the brain covering during the surgery on the back portion of the skull in patients with symptomatic Chiari Malformation. None of the materials used in this study nor any procedures are experimental.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chiari Study Looking at Use of Duragen Versus Duraguard</brief_title>
