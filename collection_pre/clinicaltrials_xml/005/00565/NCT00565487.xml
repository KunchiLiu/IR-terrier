	<brief_title>Combination Study of Capecitabine and Erlotinib Concurrent With Radiotherapy for Non-Operable Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past several decades, 5-fluorouracil based chemoradiation has been the cornerstone for the treatment of locally advanced non-operable pancreatic cancer. However, the survival of these patients is disappointing. The majority of the patients suffer either local progression or metastatic disease. With the availability of Capecitabine, a few pilot studies showed the the drug is convenient, tolerable and safe in combination with radiation therapy. Capecitabine demonstrated its superior anti-tumor activity with 14 months of median survival. However, these are small Phase I studies and the survival benefit needs to be further validated with larger studies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Inhibiting EGFR by Tarceva has demonstrated effective treatment in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Anti-epidermal growth factor therapy in combination with radiotherapy has been demonstrated efficacious in other solid tumors such as head and neck cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of Tarceva and Capecitabine has synergistic anti-tumor effect. Hence, improvement of median survival could be potentially achieved with this novel combination.</detailed_description>
