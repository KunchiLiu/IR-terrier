	<brief_title>Use of Teriparatide to Accelerate Fracture Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Teriparatide is a man-made form of a naturally occurring hormone called parathyroid. It increases bone density and bone strength to help prevent fractures and can be used to treat osteoporosis in people who have a high risk of bone fracture. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of teriparatide to the effect of placebo on pelvic fracture healing. This study will last 16 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either teriparatide or placebo for the duration of the study. Participants will also be given calcium and vitamin D supplements to take daily throughout the study. At 4-week intervals, participants will undergo functional evaluations that will include the instrumented sit-to-stand test, the timed-up-and-go, and a gait velocity test. Participants will also undergo a DXA scan upon enrollment; undergo a CT evaluation upon enrollment and 16 weeks post-fracture; and complete specific pain, self-perceived function, mental status, and depression scales throughout the study.</detailed_description>
