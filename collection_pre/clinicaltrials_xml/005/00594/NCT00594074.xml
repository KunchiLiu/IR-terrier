	<brief_title>Alcohol in the Treatment of Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that individuals who consume a moderate amount of alcohol, such as a glass or two of wine daily, will lose more during a weight-reduction program than will those who do not, if equal calories are administered to both groups. The purpose of this pilot study is to look at the relationship of alcohol in weight loss. The current standard in weight loss programs is to eliminate alcohol from the diet. We propose to enroll 50 females enrolled at the Structure House residential diet program in Durham, North Carolina. Half or the subjects will receive 150 calories in the form of white wine, 3.5 ounce with lunch and 3.5 ounces with dinner. The other half of the subjects wil receive their 150 calories in their regular diet. All participants are asked not to consume any additional alcohol. Participants will be weighed daily. The study lasts four weeks.</detailed_description>
