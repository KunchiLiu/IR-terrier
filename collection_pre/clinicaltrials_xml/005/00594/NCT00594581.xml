	<brief_summary>This study was undertaken to investigate safety and scar-improvement activity of different applications of Juvista (avotermin), administered to surgical incisions made to the skin of a healthy population of male volunteers aged 18-45 years. The study addressed two issues: whether Juvista (avotermin) administered at 200ng/100μl/linear cm wound margin is more effective than 50ng/100μl/linear cm for scar improvement and, secondly, whether dosing once only (before wounding) or twice (before and after wounding) is optimal for scar improvement.</brief_summary>

Subjects with tattoos or previous scars within 3cm of the area to be incised during the trial. AfroCaribbean volunteers, because of their increased susceptibility to hypertrophic and keloid scarring. Subjects who, on direct questioning and physical examination, have evidence of any past or present clinically significant disease. Subjects with a chronic or currently active skin disorder, which would adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or involved the areas to be examined in this trial. Subjects with a history of clinically significant allergies. Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality following review of pretrial laboratory data and physical examination. Subjects taking, or who had taken, certain prescribed drugs in the 4 weeks before to Day 0 and, in particular, topical or systemic steroids, antiinflammatory, anticoagulant, antiproliferative drugs, and antibiotics. Subjects who have taken part in a clinical trial within 3 months before admission to this trial, or who are currently participating in a clinical trial, whether an investigational drug was involved or not. Subjects with any clinical evidence of severe ongoing, or prolonged, depression or mental illness. Subjects smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day. Subjects drinking more than 28 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = ½ pint of beer [285ml], 25ml of spirits, or 1 glass of wine). Subjects showing evidence of drug abuse.
