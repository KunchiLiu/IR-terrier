	<detailed_description>Exercise prescriptions are used for initiating a physical active lifestyle in sedentary populations. A Danish project called 'Exercise on Prescription' (EoP) is implemented in primary healthcare. Patients eligible for EoP are non-institutionalised adults with medically controlled lifestyle diseases or risk factors of lifestyle diseases, who are motivated to change lifestyle, able to improve health status through a physical active lifestyle, and willing to pay a fee of â‚¬100 for the intervention. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on: 1) Self-efficacy, 2) Readiness to change, 3) Decisional balance, 4) physical activity level, and 5) health related quality of life. The EoP-group is compared to an intervention group receiving only motivational counselling.</detailed_description>
