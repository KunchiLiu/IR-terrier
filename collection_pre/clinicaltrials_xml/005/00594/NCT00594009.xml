	<brief_title>Venovenous CO2 Removal in Patients With COPD and Acute Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of an extracorporeal circuit to remove carbon dioxide from the blood in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD resulting in acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure. The extracorporeal circuit consists of venovenous configuration through a percutaneously inserted 18 F double lumen catheter placed in a central vein. Centrifugal pump and heparin bonded circuit are used and patient is heparinized to maintain an ACT &gt; 180. Circuit blood flow and gas sweep speed will be adjusted to maximize CO2 removal and minimize ventilator settings and patient's work of breathing. Patients will remain on the extracorporeal circuit for a maximum of four days as tolerated. Plasma Hemoglobin will be monitored daily.</detailed_description>
