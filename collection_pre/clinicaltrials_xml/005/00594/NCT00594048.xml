	<brief_title>The Effects of Device-guided Breathing Exercises on Blood Pressure in Patients With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of macrovascular events. Lowering blood pressure leads to a reduced risk of developing these complications. To treat hypertension effectively you can use blood pressure lowering drugs, but it is also important to use proven and safe non-pharmacological interventions. It is suggested that Breathing Rate and Systolic Blood Pressure can be linked directly together by the baroreflex. With the use of the Resperate, people will lower their breathing rate by breathing similar to music patterns which could theoretically lead, through the described link, to blood pressure reduction. Patients will be randomize into two groups: one will get a discman with freely chosen music and the other the Resperate. Patients are instructed to use the breathing device or discman for 15 minutes at about the same time every day during the 9 week study period, except for the first week.</detailed_description>
