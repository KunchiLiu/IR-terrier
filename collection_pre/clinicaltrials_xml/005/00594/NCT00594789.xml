	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate a post-fracture intervention for improving osteoporosis care in older men and women who have suffered a fracture that may indicate the presence of osteoporosis. Although osteoporosis can be identified with a bone mineral density (BMD) test, most individuals with osteoporosis are not diagnosed until they fracture. Post-fracture care often "falls between the cracks" when there is a breakdown in communication between hospital and community, or between specialists and primary care physicians. Often physicians and patients fail to make the connection between an acute fracture and osteoporosis, or the value of secondary prevention strategies. If untreated, there is an extremely high rate of additional fractures after a first osteoporotic fracture. It follows that improving BMD testing and/or treatment in appropriately identified individuals is a necessary step in optimizing post-fracture patient care. Over the next three years we will be testing and optimizing a notification procedure to physicians and/or patients relying upon fracture events reported to the provincial health service (Manitoba Health).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closing The Post Fracture Care Gap In Manitoba</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major 'care gap' exists in the management of patients with fractures suggestive of osteoporosis. Currently, only a small minority of these individuals who are at high risk for recurrent fractures undergo evaluation for possible treatment. We propose to test and optimize a novel approach to address this question, relying upon fracture events reported to provincial health service (Manitoba Health) as a mechanism for osteoporosis case identification and enhancing post fracture care. Phase 1 (one year duration): individuals meeting the fracture case definition will be randomized to usual care (no intervention), physician notification and physician/patient notification. The notification will provide a general recommendation for osteoporosis assessment. The use of appropriate post-fracture investigations and treatment will be prospectively evaluated. Phase 2 (up to two years duration): the intervention will be refined and iteratively trialed for all individuals meeting the fracture case definition. Phase 3: a recommendation for long term maintenance of the post-fracture intervention will be developed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women and men age 50 and older with one of the following fracture definitions: Hip fracture (physician ICD9CM 820821 plus a procedure code for sitespecific fracture reduction or fixation, open or closed) Spine fracture (physician ICD9CM code 805), or Humerus fracture (physician ICD9CM code 812), or Colles' fracture (physician ICD9CM code 813 plus a physician claim for sitespecific fracture reduction or fixation, open or closed, or cast application). Age less than 50. NonManitoba residents, cancelled Manitoba Health coverage, death or discharge to a personal care home. A fracture event in the previous 12 months meeting the study case definition (i.e., only a single notification per year is planned). Hip or wrist fractures without a procedure tariff. Current treatment with an osteoporosis medication. BMD testing within the preceding 3 years.</criteria>
