	<brief_summary>Outcome of psychodynamic psychotherapy measured by [123I] nor-B-CIT SPET imaging Background Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a widely practised form of psychotherapy in the treatment of depression. There is evidence that serotonin transporter (SERT) densities are altered in depression. Preliminary observations have suggested that SERT function may recover in connection with dynamic psychotherapy. The objective was to determine whether SERT densities change in relation to clinical recovery during psychodynamic psychotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>N=26 Method Twenty six drug-na√Øve currently depressed (moderate/severe) patients with no previous treatment were recruited for the study. The baseline study included a group of 18 healthy controls. The patients were randomised into psychotherapy and waiting-list control groups. For controls, psychotherapy was started after a 6-month waiting period. [123I] nor-B-CIT SPET imaging was performed at baseline and after 12 months of psychotherapy. For the controls, additional imaging was performed after the 6-month waiting period.</detailed_description>
