	<brief_summary>Subjects with non-neurogenic over-active bladder will be enrolled. The hypothesis is that augmentation cystoplasty using an autologous neo-bladder construct will increase functional capacity and thereby reduce the number of micturition episodes per day in subjects with non-neurogenic over active bladder and urge predominant incontinence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects with non-neurogenic over-active bladder and urge predominant incontinence who are intolerant to medical therapy or have persistence of symptoms despite medical therapy and require augmentation cystoplasty will be enrolled. The hypothesis is that augmentation cystoplasty using an autologous neo-bladder construct will increase functional capacity and thereby reduce the number of micturition episodes per day in subjects with non-neurogenic over active bladder and urge predominant incontinence.</detailed_description>
