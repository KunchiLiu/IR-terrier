	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Simvastatin in the Treatment of Portal Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins exert beneficial vascular effects independently of cholesterol reduction by improving endothelial dysfunction. In cirrhosis sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction further increases intrahepatic resistance and portal pressure. Previous studies have shown that statins improve hepatic endothelial dysfunction in cirrhosis, suggesting that statins could be an effective therapy for portal hypertension (PHT). This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of continuous simvastatin administration on the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), as a surrogate marker of prognosis, and its safety in patients with cirrhosis and PHT.</detailed_description>
