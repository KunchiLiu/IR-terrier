	<brief_summary>Brittle and broken bones can occur after organ transplantation. However, the long-term effects of bone marrow transplantation on bone health and the risk of breaking bones are not well understood. This study will help to assess how common it is for those who have received a bone marrow transplant to have fractures. It will also investigate blood tests related to bone health. This will be done by measuring bone mineral density and obtaining blood tests.</brief_summary>
