	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the dialysis filter AN69ST (Nephral 400 ST Dialysis Membrane) induces less clotting during hemodialysis than a conventional polysulphone filter. Our hypothesis is that the two filters induce the same degree of clotting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Nephral 400 ST Dialysis Membrane on Coagulation in Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six consecutive hemodialysis (HD) sessions are evaluated per patient, altogether 10 - 12 stable HD patients (or at least 48 HD sessions altogether). During these six sessions, AN69ST and Fx8 are used on alternate days. Dalteparin is given intravenously as a single bolus dose at start of HD (50% of the conventional dose). Clinical clotting is evaluated visually each hour of HD after blood draining of the venous air trap: 1=no clot, 2=a fibrinous ring, 3=a clot &lt;1 cm, 4=a clot &gt;1 cm and 5=coagulated system (stop in HD). Blood specimens are taken at start and after each hour of HD. Markers of coagulation (prothrombin 1+2) and of platelets (beta-thromboglobulin) are evaluated as well as anti FXa-activity. The two filters are going to be compared statistically with respect to the degree of clinical clotting and of intravascular coagulation and platelets activation.</detailed_description>
