	<brief_summary>The objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the SPACE 360 Delivery System using SPACE CpsXL Bone Cement compared to standard vertebroplasty in the treatment of pathological fractures of the spine caused by metastatic tumors of the spine, myeloma, or lymphoma. Up to a total of three levels per patient may be included or five levels for multiple myeloma. The control group will be standard vertebroplasty.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is cement leakage as determined radiographically (CT). will be cement leakage measured by CT. Secondary endpoints are reduction of pain (VAS) and quality of life measurements (Oswestry disability index).</detailed_description>

Female subjects must either be no longer capable of reproduction or taking acceptable measures to prevent pregnancy during the study 16. Subject must be willing and able to comply with specified followup evaluations 1. Primary tumors other than plasmacytoma 2. Renal cell tumors 3. More than 80% compression of the vertebrae 4.
