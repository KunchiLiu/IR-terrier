	<brief_summary>Allergy skin tests and allergen immunotherapy are common procedures for both the diagnosis and treatment of atopic diseases. Allergen immunotherapy has proved to be effective in reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma1-2. Despite its clinical benefit, there is risk of systemic reactions associated with these procedures. The systemic reaction rate to skin testing for aeroallergens is significant lower than the rate of reactions to immunotherapy, but it is not negligible. Lin et al reported only 2 patients who had systemic allergic reactions to skin testing for respiratory allergies in 10,400 patients tested.3 They determined the overall risk of inducing anaphylactic reactions by skin testing to be less than 0.02% and other studies have produced similar results.4-5 The rate of systemic reactions to skin testing is likely underscored. Thompson et. al reported a systemic reaction rate of 6% of patients receiving skin testing.6 It is important to recognize the risk of systemic reactions seeing skin testing is commonly done. It is also imperative to recognize the treatments for these reactions to prevent progression. Hypothesis The systemic reaction rate to allergen immunotherapy and skin testing to aeroallergens is higher than previously reported. Biphasic anaphylactic reactions rarely occur with allergen immunotherapy and skin testing.</brief_summary>
