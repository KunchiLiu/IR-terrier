	<brief_title>Soy Derivatives for Control of Hot Flashes in Men on Androgen Deprivation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Literature has shown that low dose estrogens can control hot flashes in men on androgen deprivation but with a high risk of thromboembolic events. Soy derivatives that contain isoflavones, a type of phytoestrogen, have been evaluated in peri-menopausal women as a possible safer alternative to synthetic estrogens but there has not been a similar study performed on their effect in men on androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.</detailed_description>
