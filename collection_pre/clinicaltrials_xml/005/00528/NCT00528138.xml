	<brief_summary>It has recently been published that hyperbilirubinemia is a reliable marker for the preoperative diagnosis of perforated acute appendicitis. The investigators believe, based on their own previous publications, that C-reactive protein (CRP) with or without a white blood cell count and some other clinical parameters, are more specific markers for the preoperative diagnosis of perforated acute appendicitis. The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the specificity and sensitivity of hyperbilirubinemia CRP, white blood cell count and other clinical parameters for the preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis.</brief_summary>
