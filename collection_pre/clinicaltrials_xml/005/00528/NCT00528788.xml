	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease have greater cardiovascular risk than the general population. Vitamin D analogues have been shown in observational studies to have mortality benefit for these patients. This study is designed to investigate doxercalciferol's effect on the vasculature (i.e. endothelial cell function) as a possible mechanism to explain the mortality benefit.</brief_summary>
