	<brief_summary>Pain prevention and/or therapy in neonates is still a challenge. It is widely accepted that early pain experience can have a tremendous impact on the pain memory. We want to investigate if a simple, fast method, that is nearly devoid of side effects can lead to a significant alleviation of pain sensation in neonates. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in various painful conditions. Trials on acupuncture in children are rare. Trials on acupuncture in neonates are lacking so far. Our hypothesis is that neonates in the active laser group experience less pain than those in the placebo group.</brief_summary>
