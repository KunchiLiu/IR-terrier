	<brief_summary>To investigate whether nonthermal low level laser acupuncture has beneficial effects on nausea and vomiting in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy for a malignant solid tumor. In a previous crossover study comparing needle acupuncture to no intervention in an otherwise similar setting we found beneficial effects, but this trial was not even single-blinded and therefore the results are questionable. The hypothesis is that active laser acupuncture is more effective than placebo laser acupuncture concerning episodes of retching/vomiting (primary outcome measure) and rescue antiemetic medication (secondary outcome measure) with a fix standard antiemetic medication</brief_summary>
