	<detailed_description>Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that causes numbness to the throat when misted into the air. This numbness in the throat should stop the urge to clear the throat in the middle of the operation. Therefore, this should stop the interruptions during the surgery. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive the saline mist. This will moisturize and soothe the throat. Participants in Group 2 will receive the lidocaine mist. Lidocaine or saline is misted into the air that you breathe during the surgery. You and your surgeon will not be told which group you were assigned to. At the end of the surgery, your surgeon will answer some questions to help determine if the use of lidocaine or saline is beneficial. You will be considered off-study once you are sent to the recovery room after surgery. This is an investigational study. Lidocaine is FDA-approved and commercially available for local anesthesia. If you are in the lidocaine or the saline group. Up to 105 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
