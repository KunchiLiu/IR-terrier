	<criteria>Major Documented laboratory diagnosis of HIV1 infection Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL Currently on a stable stavudine or zidovudine containing antiretroviral therapy regimen for at least 12 weeks Naive to tenofovir DF Inclusion Criteria for the First 96Week Extension Completed 48 weeks of treatment in Arm 1 or Arm 2 of the study &lt;18 years of age (at the start of the extension) Participants initially randomized to Arm 2 will be given the option to replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir DF in the 96week extension at the investigator's discretion, if the investigator determines that tenofovir DF is safe and beneficial for the participant. Inclusion Criteria for the Second, Third, and Fourth 96Week Extension Completed of treatment with study drug in the first extension phase &lt;18 years of age at the start of the extension. This inclusion criterion is not applicable in those regions where tenofovir DF is not commercially available for treatment of HIV1 infection in adults. Participants receiving ongoing therapy with any of the following Nephrotoxic agents Systemic chemotherapeutic agents Systemic corticosteroids Interleukin 2 (IL 2) and other immunomodulating agents Investigational agents Pregnant or lactating participants Evidence of a gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome or chronic nausea or vomiting which may confer an inability to receive an orally administered medication Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with participant compliance Malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) or basal cell carcinoma. Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy within 15 days prior to screening Prior history of significant renal disease (ie, nephrotic syndrome, renal dysgenesis, polycystic kidney disease, congenital nephrosis) Prior history of significant bone disease (ie, osteomalacia, chronic osteomyelitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteochondroses, multiple bone fractures)</criteria>
