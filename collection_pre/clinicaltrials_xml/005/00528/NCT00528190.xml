	<brief_title>Treatment of Aspergillus Fumigatus (a Fungal Infection) in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine whether antibiotic treatment directed against Aspergillus Fumigatus will be effective at preventing respiratory exacerbations and improving pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) who are chronically colonized/infected with aspergillus. This aim will be accompanied by means of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial incorporating two parallel treatment arms.</detailed_description>
