	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the bronchodilator efficacy of three doses (50 µg, 100 µg and 200 µg) of BEA 2180 delivered by the Respimat® once daily to placebo and tiotropium bromide delivered by the Respimat® in patients with COPD. Additional objectives include comparing the effects on dyspnea and health status.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with ICHGCP guidelines prior to participation in the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions. 2. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P95 4381) and must meet the following spirometric criteria: Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 (postbronchodilator, 30 minutes post salbutamol/albuterol) &lt;80% of predicted normal and FEV1 less than or equal to 70% of FVC at the PFTs at Visit 1 (screening). 3. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older. 4. Patients must be current or exsmokers with a smoking history of more than 10 pack years. Patients who have never smoked cigarettes must be excluded. 5. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and electronic PEFR measurements, and must be able to maintain records (Patient Daily Diary) during the study period as required in the protocol. 6. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the Respimat® inhaler (Appendix I) 1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient ability to participate in the study. 2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion criterion No. 1. 3. Patients with a recent history (one year or less) of myocardial infarction. 4. Patients with any unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia. 5. Patients who have been hospitalized for heart failure within the past 3 years. 6. Patients with a malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed. 7. Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction as defined in exclusion criteria No. 1. 8. Patients with known narrowangle glaucoma. 9. Patients with asthma or a history of asthma. 10. Patients with a history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis. 11. Patients with known active tuberculosis. 12. Patients with a history of and/or active significant alcohol or drug abuse. See exclusion criterion No. 1.</criteria>
