	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether atypical antipsychotic drugs (commonly prescribed for treating schizophrenia) induce changes in anthropometry and metabolism, including alteration in insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion by the pancreas, when given to lean, non-diabetic, individuals who are antipsychotic drug(s)-naïve, and free of metabolic syndrome at enrollment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>β-Cell Function in Schizophrenic Subjects on Atypical Antipsychotic drugS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AADs) induce weight gain, truncal adiposity and may engender a metabolic syndrome which may progress to IFG/IGT or DM. AADs effects in lean schizophrenic patients without metabolic syndrome are not documented, especially the relationship between weight gain and changes in insulin sensitivity (S), beta-cell function (β), and circulating adiponectin. We prospectively determined the outcome of 9-month therapy with AADs on anthropometrics, metabolism and adiponectin, including HOMA-modeling of S, β, and βxS (hyperbolic product, assessing individual β adjusted for S)in 36 schizophrenic subjects (M:F 24:12; Caucasian n=23; North-African n=12; South-Asian n=1) aged 35±9 years (mean±1SD) free of MetS (NCEP-ATPIII).</detailed_description>
