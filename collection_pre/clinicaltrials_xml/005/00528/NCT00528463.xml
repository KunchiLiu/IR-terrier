	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain is a complication of amputation. Although pre-empitve epidural analgesia was once thought to prevent such a com plication, recent studies did not demonstrate this. Peripheral blocks are more powerful then epidurals, and can even influence somatotropic representation in the brain. This a prospective case series in which the investigators hope to show a decrease, against historical control, of the incidence of post-operative amputation lower limb phantom pain. The investigators established the block at least 24 hours pre-operative and continue it for at least 2 days. Patient are followed daily for the 1st 3 days and then up to 3 month for the incidence of phantom limb pain. The investigators hope to recruit 30 patients.</brief_summary>
