	<brief_summary>This was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in the United States. Subjects with a diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture in a metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint that resulted in a fixed flexion deformity of at least one finger, other than the thumb, that was at least 20° as measured by finger goniometry and was suitable for injection were randomized 2:1 to receive AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo. This study was designed to be part of the larger clinical program, for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, where the data from 2 pivotal Placebo-Controlled studies (AUX-CC-857 (NCT00528606) and AUX-CC-859 (NCT00533273)) and 7 non-pivotal studies were evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture, with a fixed flexion deformity of at least one finger, other than the thumb, that had a contracture at least 20°, but not greater than 100°, for MP (80° for PIP) joints, caused by a palpable cord that had never been treated with AA4500. Had a positive "table top test," defined as the inability to simultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top. Judged to be in good health. Had a chronic muscular, neurological, or neuromuscular disorder that affected the hands. Had received a treatment for Dupuytren's contracture, including surgery (fasciectomy or surgical fasciotomy), needle aponeurotomy/fasciotomy, or injection of verapamil and/or interferon on the selected primary joint within 90 days before the first dose of study drug. Had a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, a disease process that affected the hands, or other medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion, would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study.</criteria>
