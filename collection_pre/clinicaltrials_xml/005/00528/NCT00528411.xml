	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how Ticagrelor, a new oral reversible anti-platelet medication, affects platelets. Anti-platelet agents are medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets. Blood clots prevent us from bleeding, but when they form inside the arteries their formation is linked to a risk of medical problems such as heart attack and stroke. This study investigated how long it takes for Ticagrelor to begin working and how long it takes for it to stop working after the last dose of drug. Ticagrelor will be compared to clopidogrel, an established anti-platelet treatment for preventing blood clots, and placebo plus Aspirin.</brief_summary>
