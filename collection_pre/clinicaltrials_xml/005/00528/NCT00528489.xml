	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of PENNVAX-B Vaccine Alone, With Il-12, or IL-15 in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vaccine that is effective against multiple strains of HIV remains the best option for preventing the spread of HIV. Plasmid DNA vaccines are inexpensive and easy to construct. When DNA vaccines are administered in combination with cytokines, such as IL-12 or IL-15, the immune response to the vaccine is increased. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the DNA plasmid vaccine, PENNVAX-B when administered alone, or with IL-12 or IL-15 DNA adjuvants. The most effective and safe dose of IL-15 will also be determined during this study. This study will last approximately 12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group 1 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B combined with 0.8 mg IL-15 in each deltoid or placebo. Group 2 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B alone or placebo. Group 3 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B combined with IL-12 in each deltoid or placebo. Group 4 will receive PENNVAX-B combined with 2 mg IL-15 or placebo. Injections will occur at study entry, Months 1, 3, and 6. Additional study visits will occur on Days 14, 42, 98, 182, 273, and 364. At these visits a brief physical, blood collection, interview, and risk reduction counseling will occur. At some visits HIV testing, urine collection, and pregnancy tests will also occur. As of 05/30/08, participants will be enrolled into Groups 3 and 4 at a limited pace to allow for additional safety reviews for the first few participants in these groups. Additionally, safety data will be reviewed for Groups 1 and 2 to determine whether the remainder of participants in Groups 2, 3, and 4 will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
