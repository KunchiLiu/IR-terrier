	<brief_title>Morphine vs. Oxycodone for Postoperative Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally, a 1:1 ratio in analgesic potency between intravenous morphine and oxycodone has been presumed (1-2), but one study demonstrated a 3:2 ratio between those drugs (3). During the last years, several studies indicate that oxycodone has the potential of mediating pain relief through the kappa-opioid receptor (4-6), and not only on the my-opioid receptor like most other opioids used in the clinic. Kappa-opioid receptors are widely distributed in visceral organs, and this may explain why Kalso (3) found less need for oxycodone compared to morphine in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate whether patients with visceral postoperative pain need less oxycodone compared to morphine, and whether patients receiving oxycodone experience better pain relief and less adverse effects compared to patients receiving morphine. Before start of surgery, the patients will be tested with PainMatcher, an instrument testing electrical pain threshold in the skin (7-10), to ensure that both groups have the same pain threshold before surgery.
