	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to compare Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) of patients randomised to treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy alone or to adjuvant chemotherapy with 1 year of bevacizumab. The secondary objectives of this trial are to: - compare Overall Survival (OS), Breast Cancer-Free Interval (BCFI), Disease- Free Survival (DFS) and Distant Disease-Free Survival (DDFS) of patients randomised to treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy alone or to adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with 1 year of bevacizumab - evaluate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab An exploratory sub-study (not reported here) was to identify biomarkers (from tumour or serum) predictive of toxicity and for the level of benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to standard adjuvant systemic treatment.</brief_summary>
