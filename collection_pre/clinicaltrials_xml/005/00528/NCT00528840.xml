	<brief_summary>This was a Phase 3, 9-month, open-label study conducted in the United States. Subjects with a diagnosis of advanced Dupuytren's disease in a metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint that resulted in a fixed flexion deformity of at least one finger, other than the thumb, that was at least 20° as measured by finger goniometry and was suitable for evaluation and injection were enrolled. This study was designed to be part of the larger clinical program, for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, where the data from 2 pivotal Placebo-Controlled studies (AUX-CC-857 (NCT00528606) and AUX-CC-859 (NCT00533273)) and 7 non-pivotal studies were evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Dupuytren Contracture</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of advanced Dupuytren's disease, with a fixed flexion deformity of at least one finger, other than the thumb, that had a contracture at least 20°, but not greater than 100° for MP (80° for PIP) joints, caused by a palpable cord. Had a positive "table top test," defined as the inability to simultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top. Were naïve to AA4500 treatment or had received one or two injections of AA4500 for the treatment of advanced Dupuytren's disease in Auxilium Studies AUXCC851, AUXCC853, or AUXCC855. Were judged to be in good health. Had a chronic muscular, neurological, or neuromuscular disorder that affected the hands. Had received treatment for advanced Dupuytren's disease within 90 days of enrollment on the joint selected for the initial injection of AA4500, including surgery (fasciectomy or surgical fasciotomy), needle aponeurotomy/fasciotomy, or injection of verapamil and/or interferon. Had a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, a disease process that affected the hands, or other medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion, would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study.</criteria>
