	<brief_title>Risk Factors for Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is known, that in the group of young children the most common reason of recurrent UTI is anatomic abnormalities, such as vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis. However, not all recurrent UTI can be explained by anatomic abnormalities. The vast majority of school age children with recurrent UTI have anatomically normal urinary tract. Recent studies discuss about the role of behavioral and functional abnormalities (inadequate fluid intake, stool retention, infrequent voiding, etc.) that can predispose recurrent urinary tract infections. Influence of some these abnormalities for recurrent UTI is controversial. Family history, behavioral and functional abnormalities which predispose to urinary tract infections in children with normal urinary tract are neglected in most protocols of urinary tract infection. Children in this study receive a careful evaluation including complete history, voiding-drinking diary, bowel questionnaire, physical investigation, sonography, voiding cystourethrogram. Follow up time - 1 year. Urinalysis once a month and during each episode of fever.</detailed_description>
