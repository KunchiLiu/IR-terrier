	<brief_title>A Comparison of Surgical Preparations and Wound Infection Rates for Elective Cesarean Sections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound infection is a universal potential morbidity to any type of surgery. Over the years many studies have been completed to evaluate ways to decrease this morbidity. Recent literature has looked at different types of surgical solutions used in pre-operative cleansing. Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine are two standard surgical prep solutions used on a global scale. The most recent literature has shown that chlorhexidine has a decreased wound infection rate for longer surgeries. Cesarean section, as a surgical time, varies from 20 - 60 minutes. There has been no known literature regarding wound infection rates using these two solutions in elective cesarean sections. This trial will review the rates of wound infection using chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine during elective cesarean section and determine if there is any statistically significant difference between the two solutions. The results could potentially decrease wound infection rates, decrease morbidity, decrease hospital length of stay, and help to guide further surgical management.</detailed_description>
