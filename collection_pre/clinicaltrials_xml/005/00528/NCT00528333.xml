Must have a minimum of 50% leukemic blasts that express CD33. ECOG performance status score of 0 to 2. WBC less than 30,000/ÂµL No known diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia. No other active systemic malignancies treated with chemotherapy within the last 12 months. Must not have received previous chemotherapy (except hydroxyurea) for AML. Must not have significantly abnormal kidney or liver disease.
