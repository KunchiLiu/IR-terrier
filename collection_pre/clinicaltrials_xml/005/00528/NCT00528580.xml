	<brief_summary>We propose a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that treatment with once-daily statins has a beneficial effect on inflammatory cytokines and clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized with sepsis. As our animal models suggest pretreatment with statins are required for their beneficial effects, we propose a study design intended to identify patients and initiate treatment early in their hospital stay. This Phase II study is intended to assess the feasibility of conducting a large-scale investigator-initiated translational research protocol that involves multiple clinical services within the Department of Medicine.</brief_summary>
