	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is an inherited blood disease that can cause intense pain episodes and may lead to organ failure. Preliminary studies have shown that adults with SCD may have brain abnormalities that contribute to problems with cognitive functioning, including attention and memory difficulties. This study will use brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing to examine the differences in cognitive functioning in adults with SCD and adults without SCD. 212 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study consisting of screening questionnaires, a neuropsychological testing battery, and MRI testing. Enrollment into this study ended in May 2008.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Cognitive Function and Brain Abnormalities in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD is an inherited blood disorder. Symptoms include anemia, infections, organ damage, and intense episodes of pain, which are called "sickle cell crises." In the past, SCD was considered a fatal disease, and many people with SCD died at a young age. Due to advances in medical care, people with SCD are now living longer lives; however, they often experience a deterioration in quality of life due to progressive organ failure. Past research has suggested that children with SCD commonly have frontal lobe dysfunction syndrome, which is a brain disorder that can affect cognitive functioning in areas such as attention, concentration, information processing, and decision making. Often times, however, neurocognitive and brain disorders are not diagnosed or treated in people with SCD. In preliminary brain imaging studies, at least half of adult participants with SCD had cognitive dysfunction that could be seen in images of the brain, while participants without SCD rarely had visible changes in the brain. Brain dysfunction may be one of the most important and least-studied problems affecting adults with SCD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent of cognitive functioning problems in adults with SCD. The study will also determine if there is a connection between cognitive functioning problems and abnormalities seen on MRI brain images of adults with SCD. This study is an observational case/control study that will enroll adults with SCD and a control group of healthy adults who do not have SCD. At a study visit on Day 1, participants will undergo blood collection and will complete psychosocial questionnaires. Female participants will provide a urine sample for pregnancy testing. Study researchers will conduct a medical record review, a physical exam, and a neurological exam. They will also interview participants to collect medical history information. On Day 2, participants will undergo either a brain MRI or neuropsychological testing; on Day 3, the other procedure will be completed. On Day 4, study researchers will explain the study procedure results to participants. Participants will be asked if they are willing to take part in a second phase of the study in the future. Enrollment into this study ended in May 2008. A pilot interventional study follows this study, and is reported separately in ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT 00850018.</detailed_description>
