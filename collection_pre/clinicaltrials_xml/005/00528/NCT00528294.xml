	<brief_summary>This trials examines the feasibility of GRID-therapy combined with biologically imaging based IMRT (BG-IMRT). Within this trial, the strict toxicity parameters of primary treatment of head and neck tumors are used. The GRID and BG-IMRT technique might be possible to reduce the total radiation dose 2 to 3 times.</brief_summary>
