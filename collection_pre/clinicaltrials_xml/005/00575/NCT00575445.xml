	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels will be increased in pediatric patients with uncontrolled asthma as determined by the Asthma Control Test (ACT). During the study the investigators will also examine if the combination of eNO and ACT will better predict asthma control that either tool alone when compared to a medical provider's assessment of the patient's asthma control.</brief_summary>
