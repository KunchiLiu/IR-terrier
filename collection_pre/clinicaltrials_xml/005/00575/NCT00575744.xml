	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Peritumoral Injection With Blue Dye Confirmation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a technique combining Technetium-99 sulfur colloid and Lymphazurin Blue Dye, we have established that the sentinel node predicts the pathology results of the rest of the axillary lymph nodes. This minimally invasive technique, which can be readily performed under local anesthesia, makes the need for full axillary lymph node dissection unnecessary for most patients. If the sentinel node is negative, no further surgery is necessary. If positive, a complete axillary node dissection is performed. In addition, the injections are made while the patient is under anesthesia, reducing the physical and psychological pain that accompanies injections done pre-operatively.</detailed_description>
