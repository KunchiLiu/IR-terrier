	<brief_summary>Generally, benign breast tumors are excised under the local anesthesia. But such action was so invasive that every patient would experience the physiological and psychological stimuli unavoidably. Sevoflurane was advised as a better inhalational anesthesic for its "easy come,easy go" property during short-lasting operations than isoflurane. We purposed that sevoflurane would be a superior anesthesic for benign breast tumor excision than isoflurane with relative less alteration in hemodynamics, less postoperative side effects and easily-control the depth of anesthesia.</brief_summary>
