	<criteria>Are scheduled to undergo routine cataract surgery by the investigator's preferred technique. Have normal appearing, freely mobile, conjunctiva in the inferior temporal portion culdesac site of the operative eye. Have concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either eye. Have a history of ocular pemphigoid. Have ever had penetrating ocular surface surgery. Have had intraocular surgery within the past 3 months. Have ever had prior surgery or full penetrating trauma to the conjunctiva at the proposed surgical site. Have a planned cataract surgery in the contraleteral eye within 2 weeks of the study related surgical procedure and sample collection. Have a combined procedure planned (trabeculectomy surgery planned in the same eye as cataract extraction surgery). Have at the proposed conjunctiva biopsy site, signs of conjunctival shortening of the fornix, scarring or adherence to the underlying episclera. Have according to the investigator's judgment, risk of intra or postoperative complications related to their cataract surgery as a consequence of participation in the study. Have a known hypersensitivity to azithromycin, or any macrolide antibiotic or to any of the ingredients in AzaSite. Have had a known hypersensitivity to Vigamox or any fluoroquinolone antibiotics or to any of the ingredients in Vigamox. Are unable or unwilling to withhold for a minimum of 3 weeks prior to initiation of study drug, the ocular or systemic use of either azithromycin or moxifloxacin, when it is the same medication as the subject's assigned study drug. This relates as well, to the use of either of these medications as a presurgical prophylaxis. Are unable or unwilling to withhold for a minimum of 3 weeks prior to initiation of study drug, the use of erythromycin ointment or ofloxacin. Have any ocular pathology with the exception of cataracts that in the judgment of the investigator could confound study assessments or limit compliance. Have a serious systemic disease or uncontrolled medical condition or psychiatric condition that in the judgement of the investigator could confound study assessments or limit compliance.</criteria>
