	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of weekly Vinblastine in chemotherapy na√Øve patients with progressive or incompletely resected paediatric low grade glioma, to generate estimates of the response rate, progression-free survival, toxicity and quality of daily living among the population treated and determine biologic factors which will enable us to predict tumour behaviour.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weekly Vinblastine for Chemotherapy Naive Children With Progressive Low Grade Glioma (PLGGs)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unresectable low grade glioma (LGG) of childhood increasingly appears as a chronic condition for which multiple treatments may be required. While several studies have shown evidence of short term tumour control with chemotherapy, the progression-free survival at 5 years is unsatisfactory. In addition, several regimens currently used for this condition are associated with significant risks of side effect and long term toxicity. We have piloted in a single arm study the feasibility and efficacy of Vinblastine for children with recurrent and refractory low grade glioma, who have failed at least one line of treatment (chemotherapy and/or irradiation). Preliminary results show promising activity with minimal toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have been &lt; 18 years of age when originally diagnosed. 2. Histologic Diagnosis: Patients must have histologic verification of LGG at original diagnosis. Exceptions are optic pathway gliomas in children with neurofibromatosis or children with large hypothalamic tumours for which a diagnostic biopsy does not seem necessary. Patients with disseminated low grade glioma are eligible. 1. Astrocytoma Variants: fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic, mixed 2. Pilocytic Astrocytoma 3. Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma 4. Infantile desmoplastic astrocytoma 5. Ganglioglioma 6. Oligodendroglioma 7. Mixed glioma (including oligoastrocytoma) 8. Pilomyxoid astrocytoma 3. Performance Level :Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 or a Lansky/Karnofsky score &gt; 50 4. Life expectancy: Patients must have a life expectancy of * 2 months. 5. Prior Therapy: Patients are eligible at the time of diagnosis or first progression following treatment with surgery only. 6. Measurable Disease: Patients must have measurable disease, documented by radiographic criteria. 7. Concomitant Medications 1. Steroids: Steroids may be used at the time of inclusion to control progressive symptoms. 2. Antiepileptic medications are permitted levetiracetam (Keppra) or clobazam (Frisium) being the preferred antiepileptic medications for chronic use reserving phenytoin and lorazepam for acute seizure control. 8. Organ Function Requirements: All patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function within 7 days of starting chemotherapy (ANC * 1.0 x 109/L /, and platelet count * 100 x 109/L (transfusion independent). 9. Regulatory: All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent and all institutional requirements for human studies must be met. This study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity. Inclusion criteria are restrictive. Patient must meet all inclusion criteria.</criteria>
