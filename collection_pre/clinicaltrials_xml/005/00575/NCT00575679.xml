	<detailed_description>Despite extensive legislative, law enforcement, and public awareness efforts, driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) remains a major cause of mortality and loss of years of productive life. A brief motivational interview (BI) is a non-confrontational, patient-centered discussion during which the individual's motivation and confidence to change health-related behaviors are explored. Previous studies of BIs in health care settings suggest that BIs administered after hospitalization for alcohol-related injury reduce the likelihood of repeat injury hospitalization and arrest for DUI.</detailed_description>
