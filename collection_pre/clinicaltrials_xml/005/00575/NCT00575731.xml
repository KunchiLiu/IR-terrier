	<brief_summary>Although studies demonstrate that people who consistently keep detailed food records are more likely to maintain their weight, few people continue to keep records given the vigilant attention needed. This study will test the efficacy of an alternative approach to record keeping that may be easier for people to sustain and lead to better long-term weight management. We propose that obese adults who attempt to keep their weight within a clearly defined and personalized 'range', e.g., a 5-lb range between 200-205 pounds, will be more likely to continue weighing themselves and remain weight stable because they have learned to self-regulate, i.e., accurately monitor changes in their weight, alert themselves when they've gained too much weight, and 'finetune' their eating and physical activity in response, but with the minimum effort and attention necessary. The primary aim for this randomized trial will examine whether participants in an 8-week 'Fine-Tuning' program are more likely to weigh themselves over the 6-month study than participants in an 8-week traditional 'Record-Keeping' program.</brief_summary>
