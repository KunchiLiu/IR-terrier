	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of endoscopic full-thickness plication (Plicator; NDO Surgical, Inc., Mansfield, MA) for the treatment of GERD in comparison to a sham procedure. Patients with symptomatic GERD requiring maintenance proton pump inhibitor therapy were entered into a randomized, single-blind, prospective, multicenter trial. Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to undergo endoscopic full-thickness restructuring of the gastric cardia with transmural suture. Eighty-one patients underwent a sham procedure. Group assignments were revealed following the 3-month evaluation. The primary endpoint was ≥ 50% improvement in GERD-HRQL score. Secondary endpoints included medication use and esophageal acid exposure. Patients achieving ≥ 50% improvement in GERD-HRQL score at 3-months versus baseline off-meds were considered responsive to their assigned procedure. Patients who failed to reach this level of improvement at 3-months were considered non-responders. Analysis of these dichotomized variables (responder/non-responder) was done using Fisher's exact test comparing the proportion of responders between the active and sham groups. Intent-to-treat analysis was also performed. The null hypothesis was that the proportion of responders was the same in both the active and sham groups. Testing was done at the 5% level of significance (alpha=0.05).</brief_summary>
