	<brief_summary>The prevalence of overweight children has increased dramatically over the last decade, and many overweight children will remain overweight as adults. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a naturally occurring dietary fatty acid, has shown promising results in reducing body fat among adults, and we propose to test the efficacy of CLA supplementation on body fat accretion in 6 to 10 year old children who are overweight or at risk of overweight.</brief_summary>
