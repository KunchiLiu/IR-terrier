	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Tigecycline to Treat Hospitalized Japanese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the treatment of Japanese subjects with CAP. Subjects with clinical signs and symptoms of CAP who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered for enrollment. Qualifying subjects will be assigned to receive tigecycline via IV administration for 7 to 14 consecutive days. The exact duration of administration of the study drug will be at the discretion of the investigator, based on the subject's condition. Subjects will be followed for safety until the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment 10 to 21 days after the last dose of therapy, and for efficacy until TOC assessment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hospitalized Japanese descent subjects known or suspected to have CAP with a severity that requires IV antibiotic treatment. Chest radiograph within 48 hours before the first dose of IV test article showing the presence of a new infiltrate. The presence of fever or hypothermia within 24 hours before the first administration of test article, and of at least two signs/symptoms of CAP within 24 hours before the first administration of test article. Any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude an evaluation of a response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy could be completed. Hospitalacquired pneumonia, other lung disease including viral, fungal, or parasitic pneumonia, immunosuppressive conditions, and other illness, which affect evaluation of safety and efficacy of tigecycline. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline or tetracyclines, or contraindication for these antibiotics.</criteria>
