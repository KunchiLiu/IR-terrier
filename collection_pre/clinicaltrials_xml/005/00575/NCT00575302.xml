	<brief_title>Study of Optimal Posology of Gonadotrophins in Patients With Insufficient Ovarian Response Due to Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women &gt; 38 years, who had an insufficient response to stimulation with regular (for age) posology of 225 IU of gonadotrophins (urinary or recombinant), in an agonist protocol will be randomized prospectively into 2 groups: 300 IU versus 450 IU of Gonal-f® administered in a short agonist protocol. Insufficient response is defined as: development of ≤ 4 mature follicles (of ≥ 16 mm) at time of hCG administration. Patient can be eligible for several cycles in same protocol.</detailed_description>
