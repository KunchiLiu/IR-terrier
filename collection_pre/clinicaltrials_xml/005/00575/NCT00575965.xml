	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: To define objective response, time to progression and safety of Simvastatin in Waldenstr√∂m's Macroglobulinemia. STATISTICAL DESIGN: For this phase II study, a single-stage design is used to evaluate the efficacy of Simvastatin. With a target enrollment of 30 participants, the 95% exact confidence bounds surrounding the response estimate will be no wider than +/- 19%.</detailed_description>
