	<brief_title>Vibration Therapy Effects on Muscle Firing Patterns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proprioception is the specialized sensory modality that informs the body as to movement, position, and spatial orientation through mechanisms that track sensations accompanying joint movement and position. Mechanoreceptors in joints, along with vestibular, visual, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ, ligament and tendon sensory receptors, comprise the propriosensory system, which conveys information to the motor system to maintain equilibrium on a reflexive, automatic basis. Alterations in somatosensory input from mechanoreceptors have been identified as causing aberrant muscle firing patterns.</detailed_description>
