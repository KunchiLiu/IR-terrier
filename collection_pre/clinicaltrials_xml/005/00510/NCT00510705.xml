	<brief_summary>Chronic inflammatory activation in fat tissue can be the link between adiposity and an increased risk for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is to investigate how molecular alterations in fat tissue can be influenced by regular physical exercise training alone or in combination with a medical therapy (glitazone or metformin) in obese patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and impaired glucose tolerance.</brief_summary>
