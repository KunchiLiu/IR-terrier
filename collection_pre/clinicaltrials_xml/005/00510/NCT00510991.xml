	<brief_title>Non Invasive Ventilation in Acute Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past, the mainstay of treatment for patients progressing to respiratory failure from acute asthma was intubation and mechanical ventilation. Newer strategies to prevent these intubations to prevent the inherent complications are being explored in form of various pharmacological means like heliox, magnesium sulfate etc. Non pharmacological strategies among which non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is one of the most challenging after showing success in patients with chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Data on efficacy of NIPPV in the management of AA is sparse but has the potential to improve the management of acute severe asthma. Noninvasive ventilation merits further studies in patients with AA, and some consensus panels have suggested that its widespread application in patients with asthma await such trials.The role of NIPPV is not yet clear and needs further studies and keeping this in view we planned this study to study the role of NIPPV in the management of acute asthma.</detailed_description>
