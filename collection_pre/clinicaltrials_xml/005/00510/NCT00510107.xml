	<brief_title>Weekly Docetaxel Plus Cisplatin or Oxaliplatin for AGC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy in Korea, and is one of the main causes of cancer death. While treatment options for AGC have expanded in recent years to include newer agents such as taxanes, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, myelosuppression remains a problem. Recently, weekly schedule of docetaxel is appealing due to limited incidence of severe myelosuppression compared with standard 3-weekly regimen. This altered toxicity profile suggests a potential for better tolerance and increased dose intensity.</detailed_description>
