	<brief_title>Effect of Policosanol as Monotherapy and Adjunctive to Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to determine the changes in the lipid profile [LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol] and the emerging risk factor, Lp(a), when policosanol is added to statin therapy. Additionally, one more primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the combination regimen.</detailed_description>
