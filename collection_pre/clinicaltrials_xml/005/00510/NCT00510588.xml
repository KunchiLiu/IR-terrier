	<brief_summary>Chronic inflammatory activation in fat tissue can be the link between adiposity and an increased risk for atherosclerosis. Aim of the study is to investigate how molecular alterations in fat tissue can be influenced by regular physical exercise training alone or in combination with a medical therapy (Glitazon or Metformin) in obese patients with stable CAD and impaired glucose tolerance.</brief_summary>
