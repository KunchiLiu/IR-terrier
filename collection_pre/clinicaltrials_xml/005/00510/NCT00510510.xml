Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to visit 1 or during the screening period (up to visit 3). Patients with a history of asthma indicated by (but not limited to): Blood eosinophil count &gt; 400/mm3, onset of symptoms prior to age 40 years.

Patients with a history of untoward reactions to sympathomimetic amines or inhaled medication or any component thereof. Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator have a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition such as (but not limited to) unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, long term prednisone therapy, history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, narrowangle glaucoma, symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia, bladderneck obstruction or moderate to severe renal impairment that might compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with evaluation, or preclude completion of the study. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
