	<brief_summary>An increased number of patients with heparin-induced skin lesions is reported in the literature. Heparin-induced skin lesions may result from either occlusion of cutaneous vessels in patients suffering from autoimmune HIT or from a type IV allergic reaction (delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response). However, the incidence and nature of heparin-induced skin lesions has not been determined in a prospective investigation. To address this open issue is the goal of this ongoing, so far monocenter, clinical investigation.</brief_summary>
