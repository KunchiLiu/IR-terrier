	<brief_title>A Study of Active Immunotherapy With GRNVAC1 in Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label evaluation of feasibility, safety and immunotherapy in patients with AML in complete clinical remission. Patients will undergo leukapheresis prior to or shortly after completing consolidation chemotherapy. Dendritic cells will be transfected with the messenger RNA encoding human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and a portion of the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP-1 (LAMP), matured, aliquoted, and cryopreserved. The final autologous vaccine product is referred to as GRNVAC1. Patients will be vaccinated with weekly for 6 weeks,will "rest" for 4 weeks, then will receive 6 boost injections, each administered every other week for 12 weeks. Patients will be followed every 4 weeks until Week 54, then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months up to approximately 5 years from the first vaccination or until relapse/progression.</detailed_description>
