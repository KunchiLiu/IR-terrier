	<brief_summary>A pilot study to examine the effects of LDL-Apheresis on patients with Stage III Congestive Heart Failure. Study hypothesis: Decreased blood viscosity from receiving LDL-apheresis will decrease workload on the heart and improve symptoms associated with the progression of Congestive Heart Failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Congestive Heart Failure Using a Device to Remove Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who qualify for the study will receive 7 bi-weekly LDL-Apheresis treatments with the Kaneka Liposorber device. Patients will assess their CHF symptoms using the KC Cardiomyopathy questionnaire prior to each treatment. Blood levels of certain indices related to CHF and safety profile labs will be drawn before and after the first and last treatment.</detailed_description>
