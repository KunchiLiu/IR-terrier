	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center open-label dose-escalation study of a novel compound (MDV3100) to treat patients with castration-resistant (hormone-refractory) prostate cancer. Additional patients will be enrolled in expanded cohorts at doses determined to be tolerable. Patients who tolerate the drug and do not progress will be allowed to continue to look for PSA response.</brief_summary>
