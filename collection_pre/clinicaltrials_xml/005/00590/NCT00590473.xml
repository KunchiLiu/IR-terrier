	<brief_summary>The hypothesis for this study is that bilateral sacral neuromodulation will improve symptoms of interstitial cystitis by at least 25% when compared to unilateral sacral neuromodulation as reported by patient's responses to the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Indices. This study will be a prospective randomized study comparing bilateral to unilateral sacral neuromodulation. The study population will include all patients diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, using the NIDDK criteria, having staged sacral neuromodulator stimulators placed at Hahnemann University Hospital.</brief_summary>
