	<criteria>1. Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm deemed to warrant surgical repair: 1. Fusiform aneurysm greater than or equal to 2 times diameter of normal adjacent aorta 2. Saccular aneurysm 2. Anatomy meets GORE TAG Thoracic Endoprosthesis specification criteria as indicated in the Instructions for Use (Appendix A) 3. Minimum 2 cm nonaneurysmal segment proximal and distal to the aneurysm • &lt;60 degree angle in the aortic arch may require additional length of nonaneurysmal segment if the arch is included in the treatment segment 4. Life expectancy &gt; 2 years 5. Surgical Candidate ASA Class I, II, III, or IV NYHA Class I, II, III or no heart disease 6. Male or infertile female 7. Minimum 21 years of age 8. Able to comply with protocol requirements 9. Signed Informed Consent Form 1. 4 mm aortic taper and inability to use devices of different diameters, to compensate for the taper, in the treatment area of the aorta 2. Significant thrombus at the proximal or distal implantation zones 3. Mycotic aneurysm 4. Hemodynamically unstable aneurysm rupture (noncontained aneurysm rupture) 5. Acute or chronic aortic dissection 6. Planned occlusion of the left carotid or celiac arteries 7. "Planned" concomitant surgical procedure (other than left subclavian transposition) or previous major surgery within 30 days 8. Myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident within 6 weeks 9. Severe respiratory insufficiency sufficient that precludes open thoracotomy 10. Renal insufficiency (Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL) with or without dialysis 11. Degenerative connective tissue disease, e.g., Marfan or EhlerDanlos Syndrome 12. Participation in another investigational device or drug study within 1 year 13.
