	<brief_summary>H2-receptor antagonists are the gold standard for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients. Various studies demonstrated superiority of proton pump inhibitors over H2-receptor antagonists in increasing gastric pH and in healing gastric acid-dependent diseases. It is unknown, whether proton pump inhibitors are more effective in increasing gastric pH than H2-receptor antagonists in critically ill patients requiring stress ulcer prophylaxis.</brief_summary>
