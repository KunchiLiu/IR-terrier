	<brief_summary>Background: During the first half of the 20th century, scalp irradiation was a standard treatment for induction of epilation in children suffering from Tinea Capitis. These children are now more than 50 years old and the aim was to investigate the possible association between their childhood low dose irradiation exposure and development of carotid atherosclerotic disease in adulthood. Methods: The study included 145 individuals treated by irradiation in their childhood, and 150 matched control subjects with no history of irradiation. B-mode ultrasound imaging and US Doppler were used to measure carotid and femoral stenosis and Intima-Media Thickness (IMT). Blood samples were taken for lipid profile and homocysteine evaluation.</brief_summary>
