	<brief_title>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy: Are All Systems Alike?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, 2 group, randomized, comparative study (sample:50; 25 in each group) that will investigate whether differences can be found in selected outcomes related to wound care, using Versatile One (EZCare)versus KCI VAC negative pressure/vacuum systems. Only wounds which currently meet criteria for such device use,and for which a physician's order has been written for the device, will be included in this study.</detailed_description>
