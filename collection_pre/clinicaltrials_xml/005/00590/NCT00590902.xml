	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - To measure the ability of OSI-774 to effectively treat bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer. - To see whether the use of OSI-774 provides meaningful symptomatic benefit in patients with advanced bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer. This study is a Phase II study. The first study of OSI-774 was done to evaluate what dose should be given to patients with cancer has been completed. The purpose of this research study is to see whether this experimental treatment, called OSI-774, can cause a type of non-small cell lung cancer to stop growing or shrink. This study is sponsored by a company called Genentech, and is being done at Memorial Hospital, as well as other cancer centers around the country interested in developing new drugs for the treatment of this type of cancer.</brief_summary>
