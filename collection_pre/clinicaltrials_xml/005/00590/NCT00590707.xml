	<brief_title>Post-Operative Delirium in Elderly Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We give sedative drugs to patients having spinal anesthesia so they are "asleep" (sedated) while we are fixing their broken hips. The spinal anesthesia provides pain relief at the site of surgery, while the sedative drugs keep people "asleep" during the procedure. We want to find out whether the amount of sedation we give might (1) make patients be confused when they wake up or (2) have anything to do with how well patients can do their ordinary daily routines a few months after their surgery.</detailed_description>
