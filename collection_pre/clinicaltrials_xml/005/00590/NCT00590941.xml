	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether people have genes that make them more likely to respond to chemotherapy and/or have side effects from chemotherapy for diffuse large cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Determinations for Side Effects and Response Rate for Patients Receiving Chemotherapy With Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon enrollment in the study, patients will have a blood sample collected for genotyping of the FCGR3A gene (immunoglobulin Fc G receptor IIIa), the ABCB1 gene (ATP Binding Cassette Beta 1; also called MDR1), and other candidate genes. Patients will be treated with R-CHOP for six cycles, which is standard therapy for advanced stage DLCL. Response will be monitored by an FDG-PET scan performed after 2 cycles of R-CHOP and restaging exams performed upon completion of chemotherapy. Gene polymorphisms will be analyzed to establish which polymorphisms predict response to R-CHOP.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diffuse large Bcell nonHodgkin's lymphoma according to the WHO classification, with measurable or evaluable disease No prior therapy for NHL. Patient may be enrolled in this study after the first cycle of RCHOP if all screening evaluations were performed prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy. Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4 Age greater than or equal to 18 years Patient must give written informed consent. A patient enrolled in another clinical trial may also enroll in this study if the other trial has an RCHOP treatment arm and the patient is randomized to the RCHOP only arm. Registration to this study must occur after randomization in the other trial. CNS involvement Known HIV positive Tcell lymphoma or history of indolent NHL Patients who will be treated with radiation therapy</criteria>
