	<brief_summary>Aortic atheroma has been correlated with traditional cardiac risk factors, coronary, carotid, renal and peripheral atherosclerosis, and is probably a manifestation of generalized atherosclerosis. Aortic atheroma has also been shown to be associated with atrial fibrillation, aortic valve sclerosis, and other calcification of the fibrous skeleton of the heart. None of the previous studies have looked at the noninvasive prediction of aortic atheroma using the history and physical signs of cardiovascular disease. This would be a time and cost-effective bedside diagnostic tool that would be useful prior to cardiac surgery, cardiac catheterization, and workup of ischemic stroke patients, especially when transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being considered for diagnosis but cannot be obtained due to previously mentioned reasons. Although physical examination of peripheral vascular disease is non-specific, a combination of physical examination signs increases the probability of generalized atherosclerosis.</brief_summary>
