	<brief_summary>High blood glucose levels in hospitalized patients with diabetes are associated with increased risk of medical complications. Improved glucose control with insulin injections may improve clinical outcome and prevent some of the hospital complications. It is not known; however, what is the best insulin regimen in hospitalized patients. Recently, the use of basal/bolus insulin therapy with detemir (Levemir®) and rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, glulisine) has been shown to facilitate outpatient glycemic control with lower rate of hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) events in patients with diabetes. In this study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of detemir and aspart insulin in the inpatient management of subjects with diabetes. We hypothesize that in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to general medicine wards, treatment with insulin detemir once daily plus insulin aspart before meals will allow better glycemic control and lower rate of hypoglycemic events than treatment with twice a day NPH plus regular insulin before meals. Detemir is a long-acting insulin which is given subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily. Aspart is a rapid-acting insulin which is given subcutaneously several times a day and frequently before meals. Detemir and aspart insulins are approved for use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA. This investigator-initiated research will be conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta and at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL. Dr. Umpierrez designed the study and will serve as principal investigator. A total of 65 patients will be recruited at Grady and 65 patients at the Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males or females between the ages of 18 and 70 years admitted to a general medical service. 2. A known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus &gt; 3 months, receiving any combination of oral antidiabetic agents (sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones) and/or insulin therapy. 3. Subjects must have an admission blood glucose &gt; 140 mg and &lt; 400 mg/dL and no evidence of ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate &lt; 18 mEq/L, venous or arterial pH &lt; 7.30, positive serum or urinary ketones). 1. Subjects with increased blood glucose concentration, but without a known history of diabetes. 2. Subjects with a history of acute hyperglycemic crises such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or ketonuria [63]. 3. Patients with acute critical or surgical illness and/or expected to require admission to a critical care unit (ICU, CCU), or to undergo surgery during the hospitalization course. 4. Patients with clinically relevant hepatic disease (ALT 2.5x &gt; upper limit of normal), or impaired renal function, as shown by a serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL for males, or ≥ 1.8 mg/dL for females. 5. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 2 years. 6. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. 7. Patients with recognized or suspected endocrine disorders associated with increased insulin resistance, such as hypercortisolism, acromegaly, or hyperthyroidism. 8. Female subjects are pregnant or breast feeding at time of enrollment into the study.</criteria>
