	<brief_summary>Past studies have shown that MRI is useful for staging prostate cancer. This study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to obtain more information. MRSIs with MRIs help doctors locate prostate cancer and determine the extent of tumor before deciding on treatment. This study looks at structural and chemical properties of prostates in prostate cancer patients before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
