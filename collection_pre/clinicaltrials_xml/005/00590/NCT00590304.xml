	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate asthma and examine the homes of children with asthma living in rural areas of the state. This study is being done to give investigators more information about the presence of allergens and endotoxin in the homes of children with asthma living in the delta region of Arkansas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma in the Delta Region of Arkansas: Characterization of Disease and Impact of Environmental Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children and disproportionately affects minority and low-income children. Current pediatric asthma research in this high-risk group focuses on children living in inner-city environments. Low-income, minority children with asthma from non-urban locales have not been studied extensively. The specific aims of the study will examine the impact of home environmental exposure to endotoxin on asthma severity and atopy status in the rural setting among predominately African American, low-income asthmatics. This study will answer several research questions. The first question involves the relationship between asthma severity and exposure to endotoxin among rural children at high risk for increased morbidity and mortality. Second, the relationship between atopy and endotoxin exposure has been the subject of recent debates among asthma researchers. The hygiene hypothesis suggest that the recent rise in atopic disease in Westernized societies is due to decreased microbial burden. Last data on atopy and aeroallergen exposure among high-risk rural asthmatics will be critical in the design and implementation of future intervention programs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>English speaking participants aged 417 years from four rural schools with physician diagnosed asthma or symptoms of asthma in the previous 12 months (coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath) (per parental or legal guardian report) and current taking prescribed medications for asthma such as inhalers, syrup or breathing machine. Children with significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as cystic fibrosis) or significant comorbid conditions such as severe developmental delay or cerebral palsy will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
