	<brief_summary>Researchers want to see whether Sho-saiko-to (SST) can help in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C may cause swelling within the liver and this can lead to scar tissue. In some patients, severe scarring of the liver, liver failure and liver cancer can occur. Standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C is a drug called interferon with or without another drug called ribavirin. There are a number of side effects that some patients are unable to take. Other patients may have an initial response, but then the virus and the inflammation come back. Sho-saiko-to is an herbal medicine that has been used for many years in Asia to treat liver disease. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether Sho-saiko-to may improve liver swelling and injury caused by chronic hepatitis C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SHO-SAIKO-TO for Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C: A Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C affects nearly three million Americans. Of these, 15% will develop liver cirrhosis and approximately 5% will progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment for chronic hepatitis C is limited to interferon-based therapy. Many patients decline or cannot tolerate interferon because of its serious side effects. Sho-saiko-to, an Asian herbal medicine consisting of seven botanicals, has demonstrated anti-fibrotic affect by inhibition of lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes and stellate cells in an animal study. It has also been demonstrated to prevent progression of cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma in human trials. This study is a single arm, single center trial of Sho-saiko-to in patients with chronic active hepatitis from hepatitis C infection who cannot tolerate or who have specific contraindications to interferon therapy. Patients will receive 52 weeks therapy with Sho-saiko-to. Outcome will be assessed by comparing pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies. Patients will be said to respond if they have an improvement of two points or greater on a standard measure of liver histology. If five or more of 25 evaluable patients respond, Sho-saiko-to will be deemed worthy of further testing.</detailed_description>
