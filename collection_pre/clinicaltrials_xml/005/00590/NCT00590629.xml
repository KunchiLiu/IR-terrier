	<brief_summary>Several risk factors including high cholesterol contribute to heart disease. We know that lowering triglycerides and raising HDL (protective cholesterol) in men reduces the risk for heart disease. We expect that women will share this same benefit because the combination of high triglycerides and low HDL appears to be a more important risk for heart disease in women. Niacin reduces triglycerides and raises HDL. We also expect to see improvement in markers of inflammation and clot formation and blood vessel health, which we hypothesize should all confer a reduced risk of heart disease in women. Women already taking lipid lowering statin will receive niacin therapy. We will measure blood lipid levels, markers of inflammation and clotting as well as a non-invasive measure of blood vessel reactivity. After 3 months of therapy we will repeat these measures.</brief_summary>
