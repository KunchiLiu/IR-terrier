	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the Silzone coated sewing cuff reduces the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis. The null and alternative hypotheses of this study are: - Ho: Patients receiving SJM Masters Series valves with Silzone coating will have an equal incidence of PVE when compared to those receiving the conventional cuff. - Ha: Patients receiving SJM Masters Series valves with Silzone coating will have a reduced incidence of PVE when compared to those receiving the conventional cuff.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient requires an isolated mitral, isolated aortic, or double (aortic and mitral) valve replacement The patient is a candidate to receive an SJM (St. Jude Medical) Masters Series valve(s) with either the conventional cuff or the cuff with Silzone coating The patient (or legal guardian) has signed a studyspecific consent form agreeing to the randomization, data collection, and followup requirements The patient has a medical condition which contraindicates implantation of the SJM Masters Series with Silzone coating The patient already has a prosthetic valve other than the valve being replaced at this time The patient requires a tricuspid valve replacement</criteria>
