This study aims to investigate the tolerance of a new strong steroid cream in comparison to an already marketed reference cream with equal amount of active but with different cream vehicle. The second part of the study will investigate the possible preventative property of a moisturizing cream on skin that has been previously cleared from eczema.</brief_summary>
