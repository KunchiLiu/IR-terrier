	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine what happens to dexmedetomidine in the body after it has been given to a newborn after heart surgery. We want to learn how long the drug stays in the body, how the drug is metabolized by the body, and how well the medicine works at a particular dose or amount.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding Dexmedetomidine in Neonates After Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, dose escalation study of a single bolus dose of dexmedetomidine followed by a continuous infusion for up to 24 hours in neonates who are immediately post-op from cardiac surgery, and require tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation in the post-op period. Pediatric populations may benefit from the favorable pharmacodynamic effects of this medication.</detailed_description>
