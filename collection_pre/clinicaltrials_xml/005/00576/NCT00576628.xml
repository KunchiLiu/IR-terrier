	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of subcutaneous C.E.R.A. for correction of anemia and maintenance of hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis and are not treated with ESA. Eligible patients will receive C.E.R.A. by monthly subcutaneous injections, dependent on body weight (with a recommended starting dose of 1.2 micrograms/kg). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
