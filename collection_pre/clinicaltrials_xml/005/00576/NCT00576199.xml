	<brief_summary>This single-arm, open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of Avastin (bevacizumab) treatment combined with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with localized unresectable liver cancer. Patients were treated with TACE at 8 or 10 week intervals for 4 sessions (continuation depended on investigator's discretion). Avastin 5 mg/kg intravenously was administered 24-48 hours prior to each TACE session and every 2 weeks between the TACE sessions until disease progression.</brief_summary>
