	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fibrin Sealant, Vapor Heated, Solvent/Detergent-treated with 500 IU/ml thrombin and synthetic aprotinin (FS VH S/D 500 s-apr) for hemostasis in participants receiving prosthetic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) conduits as compared to a control group treated by manual compression with surgical gauze pads.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female of all ages Subject undergoing peripheral vascular surgery, ie, conduit placement with an ePTFE graft such as arterioarterial bypasses [including: axillofemoral, iliofemoral, femorofemoral, iliopopliteal, femoropopliteal (including below knee), femorotibial vessel bypass], or arteriovenous dialysis access shunt in the upper or lower extremity. Signed informed consent Intraoperative inclusion criterion: Suture line bleeding eligible for study treatment is present after surgical hemostasis (i.e., suturing). Suture line bleeding eligible for study treatment is defined as: any suture line bleeding that would prevent immediate closure of the wound and require treatment of the bleeding first, and on a scale of mild, moderate, and severe, the suture line bleeding is assessed as moderate or severe. (Moderate is defined as: either more than 25% of the suture line bleeds, or at least 5 suture line bleedings are present, if counting of suture line bleedings is possible, or one pulsatile suture line bleeding is present. Severe is defined as: either more than 50% of the suture line bleeds, or at least 10 suture line bleedings present, if counting of suture line bleedings is possible, or more than one pulsatile suture line bleedings are present, or at least one spurting suture line bleeding is present.) Note: Bleedings that can be treated with additional sutures are not appropriate for the study. Such anastomoses should receive additional sutures, be recategorized, and if they still comply with the inclusion criteria, be randomized. Subjects concurrently participating in another clinical study treatment with another investigational drug or device within the last 30 days Other vascular procedures during the same surgical session (stenting and/or endarterectomy of the same artery are allowed) Arterioarterial bypasses with more than 2 anastomoses (e.g., aortobifemoral, axillobifemoral etc.) Pregnant or lactating women Congenital coagulation disorders Prior kidney transplantation Heparininduced thrombocytopenia Known prior exposure to aprotinin within the last 12 months Known hypersensitivity to aprotinin or other components of the product Known severe congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV infection or long term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs) Prior radiation therapy to the operating field Severe local inflammation at the operating field. Intraoperative exclusion criterion: Major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the planned surgical procedure. Intraoperative change in planned surgical procedure, which results in subject no longer meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, (e.g. abandonment of ePTFE graft placement).</criteria>
