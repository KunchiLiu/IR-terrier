	<brief_title>Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair With or Without Concomitant Burch Colposuspension in Patients With Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty-seven women suffering from POP and UI were randomly assigned to abdominal POP repair and concomitant BC ( 24 patients; group A) or POP repair alone without any anti-incontinence procedure ( 23 patients.; group B). They were followed-up at 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery and then annually. The primary outcome measures were anatomical outcome and changes in incontinence status as indicated by a bladder diary, the number of daily pads and the stress test. Secondary endpoints were changes in subjective symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL) as measured by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Impact Incontinence Quality of Life (IIQ-7) questionnaires.</detailed_description>
