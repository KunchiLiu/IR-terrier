	<brief_summary>Primary objective was to determine efficacy of Alfuzosin in the treatment of children and adolescents 2-16 years of age with newly diagnosed or progressive hydronephrosis due to elevated detrusor Leak Point Pressure [LPP] of neuropathic etiology. Secondary objectives were: - To investigate the safety and tolerability of alfuzosin 0.2 mg/kg/day in children and adolescents, - To investigate the number of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) episodes, - To investigate the pharmacokinetics of Alfuzosin (population kinetics).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alfuzosin Treatment in Children and Adolescents With Hydronephrosis of Neuropathic Etiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of 2 phases: - a 12-week efficacy phase then, - a 40-week safety extension phase. All eligible subjects received alfuzosin 0.2 mg/kg/day. The formulation and the frequency was assigned by Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) according to age group and ability to swallow tablets. Patients who completed the 12-week open-label treatment period were offered to continue in the 40-week open-label safety extension study. The treatment was the same as in the 12-week efficacy phase. All patients had a one-week follow-up period after the last dose intake.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children and adolescents of either gender 2 16 years of age with a detrusor Leak Point Pressure (LPP) of 40 cm water or greater and with newly diagnosed or progressive hydronephrosis either Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) grade 1, 2 or 3 due to neuropathic bladder dysfunction. Hydronephrosis of nonneuropathic etiology. Urological surgery in the last 4 months prior to the study. Urethral dilatation in the last 3 months prior to the baseline urodynamic assessment. αblocker therapy in the last 4 weeks prior to the baseline urodynamic assessment. Detrusor injections of botulinum toxin in the last 6 months. Urological diseases/conditions other than functional bladder obstruction of neuropathic etiology, that can lead to upper urinary tract dilatation (e.g., bladder anomalies, ureterocele). History of intolerance to αblocker therapy. Orthostatic hypotension. History of risk factors for Torsade de pointes (e.g., family history of Long QT Syndrome). The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
