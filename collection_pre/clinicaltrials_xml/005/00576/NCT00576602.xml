	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of subcutaneous Mircera, versus no ESA therapy, in chronic kidney disease patients with anemia after kidney transplant, not currently treated with ESA. Patients will be randomized to receive a)subcutaneous Mircera at a recommended starting dose of 0.6 micrograms/kg every 2 weeks, switching to monthly treatment at week 16 or b)supportive treatment (eg. iron supplementation) for management of low hemoglobin concentrations. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
