	<brief_summary>This research study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of the techniques that are used to analyze heart function. The main purpose of this study is to analyze and compare three different methods of assessment of regional and overall heart function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of the Gated Blood Pool SPECT: ERNA vs 3D Echo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to establish the reproducibility and to validate gated blood pool SPECT imaging with application of attenuation correction (ACGBS) in evaluation of left ventricular regional and global function and volumes, by direct comparison with Equilibrium Radionuclide Angiocardiography (ERNA) and 3-dimensional ECHO (3DE).</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>All patients scheduled for routine clinically requested ERNA study for ejection fraction measurement at the Yale University Cardiovascular Nuclear Imaging Laboratory are eligible to be enrolled in the study. Unstable medical condition preventing additional imaging. Weight greater than 300lbs, prohibiting imaging on the SPECT/CT imaging system. Patients with intracardiac shunts, emphysema or previously demonstrated allergies to octafluoropropane (the gas in the microbubbles), will not receive intravenous contrast during 3 DE image acquisition.</criteria>
