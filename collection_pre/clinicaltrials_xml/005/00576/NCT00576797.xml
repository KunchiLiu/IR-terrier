	<brief_summary>The human vagina contains a large number of normal bacteria. These bacteria are important because provide protection against other bacteria that may cause disease. Several important diseases are linked to abnormal bacteria in the vagina. Women with abnormal bacteria in the vagina are more likely to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS. Also women with unusual bacteria in their vagina are more likely to deliver a premature baby when they are pregnant. For these reasons, it is important to have a better understanding of the normal bacteria of the vagina.Some bacteria found in the vagina can not be grown in a laboratory. Our preliminary studies indicate a very wide variety of bacteria in the vagina. Also we have shown there are some differences between African American and Caucasian women. The goal of our study is to study the bacteria in the vagina of normal women using the latest technology. This technology involves study the bacterial DNA present in the normal microbes in the vagina</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The normal vaginal bacteria in healthy women of reproductive age plays a key role in preventing successful colonization by "undesirable" organisms including those responsible for bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, sexually transmitted diseases and urinary tract infections. Our long-term goal is to develop an accurate understanding of the vagina microbial ecosystem in normal, healthy women as an essential prerequisite for comprehending how the normal microflora reduces the risk of acquiring these common vaginal infections. Four hundred women will be recruited such that there will be equal distribution among four self-declared ethnic groups (Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian). These groupings were selected based on the original Forney study that identified different distributions supergroups of dominant vaginal microflora between African-American and Caucasian women. The experimental focus of this proposal is to use a combination of culture-independent methods (T-RFLP of 16S rRNA, 16SrRNA and recA genes sequence analysis and community genomics) to develop tools aimed at advancing our understanding of the composition and role of individual organisms and communities that make up the ecosystems of human vaginas . The specific aims are designed to develop genomic tools for the research and clinical scientific community to study the ecology of the human vaginal microflora</detailed_description>
