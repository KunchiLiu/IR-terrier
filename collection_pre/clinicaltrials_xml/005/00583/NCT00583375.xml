	<brief_summary>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Demonstrate equivalent clinical and radiologic outcomes to the "gold standard" (ABG) in a representative clinical model (hindfoot and ankle fusions) STUDY HYPOTHESIS: GEM OS™1 is an equivalent bone grafting substitute to autologous bone graft in applications as shown by non-inferiority analysis STUDY RATIONALE: Evaluate a fully synthetic growth-factor enhanced bone graft substitute to facilitate fusion in conditions or injuries requiring bone graft in a representative clinical fusion model and thus the opportunity to provide equivalent union rates as ABG without necessitating an additional invasive procedure to harvest the graft REGULATORY PHASE: Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for Premarket Approval (PMA) Application as a bone regeneration system, pivotal phase</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1) Bone defect in the hindfoot or ankle requiring fusion using open surgical technique with supplemental bone graft/substitute, requiring one of the following procedures: Ankle joint fusion Subtalar fusion Calcaneocuboid fusion Talonavicular fusion Triple arthrodesis (subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints) Double fusions (talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints) 1. Previous fusion surgery of the proposed fusion site. 2. The patient uses chronic medications known to affect the skeleton (e.g. glucocorticoid usage &gt; 10mg/day). 3. Pregnant or a female intending to become pregnant during this study period. 4. Morbidly obese (BMI &gt; 45 kg/m2)</criteria>
