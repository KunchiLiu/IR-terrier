	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that celecoxib effectively reduces pain after a tonsillectomy and reduces post-operative narcotic use. To test this hypothesis, the study is placebo controlled (sugar pill). Half of the participants will receive a sugar pill, half will not. All participants will receive the standard post-operative pain medications. We ask participants to log the amount of medications they use daily, and the amount of pain they have each day. It is hoped that celecoxib will reduce the amount of post-operative pain medication needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib as a Post-tonsillectomy Pain Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-tonsillectomy pain is typically controlled through narcotic medications, such as Lortab elixir. Despite its standard use, this pain control is typically not as effective as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID). The problem with using NSAIDs for post-tonsillectomy operative pain is the significant increased risk of rebleeding. Celecoxib is an NSAID that is a COX-2 inhibitor; the drug is designed to act as an NSAID without the increased risk of rebleeding or hemorrhage. This study is a double blind, randomized study; neither the study participant or the study investigator knows if the participant is receiving celecoxib or a placebo (sugar pill). The blinded list is maintained by the research pharmacists and can be unblinded when needed (such as in an emergency). Participants begin taking the study medication the night before surgery and continue through 10 days post-operative. Participants are asked to complete a journal that catalogs the amount of standard post-operative medications taken, the amount of pain experienced, and any other comments. Participants are contacted by phone at 5 and 10 days post-op. Study participation ends at the standard 3-week post-operative check-up.</detailed_description>
