	<brief_title>Open-Label Duloxetine Monotherapy in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duloxetine has established efficacy for treatment of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Chronic PTSD is often treated with antidepressants, in fact there are only two FDA-approved treatments for PTSD. Yet many chronic PTSD patients, especially male combat veterans, have a limited response to antidepressant treatment (Baker et al, 1995; Cañive et al, 1998; Hertzsberg et al 2000) and new pharmacotherapies should be investigated.</detailed_description>
