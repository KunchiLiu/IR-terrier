	<brief_summary>This study is been designed to answer the question of whether local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) decreases the perception of pain associated with amniocentesis in a randomized double blind placebo controlled manner. Our objective is to determine the effect of local anesthesia on the maternal pain perception from an amniocentesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Anesthesia and Pain Perception During an Amniocentesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women meeting criteria for project and agreeing to treatment will be randomized into either the 1% Lidocaine or placebo(normal saline) group. The initial injection of either 1% lidocaine or placebo (normal saline) will be administered 2 minutes prior to the amniocentesis procedure. 2cc of 1% lidocaine or placebo (normal saline) will be initially administered as an intradermal "wheal", followed by a deeper infiltration of the 1% lidocaine or placebo (normal saline) to the depth of the peritoneum. All procedures will be performed by either the Maternal-Fetal medicine (MFM) or the reproductive geneticist utilizing continuous ultrasound guidance under sterile conditions. Each woman will be asked to rate their pain perception immediately after the procedure on two pain scales.</detailed_description>
