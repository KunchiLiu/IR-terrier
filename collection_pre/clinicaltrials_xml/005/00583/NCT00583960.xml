	<brief_title>Office-based Radial Expansion Balloon Dilation of the Esophagus and Trachea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dilation of the esophagus is performed for strictures, webs, and rings at all levels of the esophagus. Dilation of the trachea is performed for subglottic and tracheal stenosis. Radial expansion balloons have been developed by Bost Scientific Corporation for the purpose of dilating the esophagus and trachea through flexible esophagoscopies. These sequential controlled radial-expansion balloons can be introduced via a guide wire through the working channel of a 5.1 mm transnasal esophagoscope. Traditionally, otolaryngologists have performed esophageal and tracheal dilation per oral under general anesthesia. This technique allows the procedure to be performed in the office, sparing the patient the risk of anesthetics. The purpose of this study is to review the UCDMC experience with esophageal and tracheal balloon dilation using the transnasal esophagoscope.</detailed_description>
