	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device for bridge-to-transplant is associated with a reasonable assurance of safety and probable benefit such that the EXCOR® Pediatric merits approval by the Food and Drug Administration under a Humanitarian Device Exception (HDE).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess Safety and Probable Benefit of the EXCOR® Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Berlin Heart Inc. is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center, single arm study to access the safety and probable benefit of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device [EXCOR® Pediatric]. The study will compare the EXCOR® Pediatric with a historical control population supported with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation in children.</detailed_description>
