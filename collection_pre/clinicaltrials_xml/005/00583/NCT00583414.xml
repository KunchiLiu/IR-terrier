	<brief_title>Endovascular Exclusion of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in High Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, non-randomized evaluation of endovascular aneurysm repair in high-risk patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this endovascular prosthesis is safe and effective for the intended use of treating AAA/iliac aneurysm in patients who are at high risk for standard aneurysm surgical repair. Up to 400 patients will be enrolled at the Cleveland clinic Foundation. Baseline procedures may include angiogram, intravascular ultrasound, CT scan, physical exam, blood work and ankle-brachial index. The endovascular prosthesis is placed in the operating room under regional or general anesthesia and the procedure length is approximately 2-3 hours. Follow up evaluations will be done at 1 month, 6 months (if clinically necessary), 12 months and yearly, and may include a physical exam, CT scan, KUB, ultrasound, blood work, and an ankle-brachial index.</detailed_description>
