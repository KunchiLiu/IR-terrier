	<brief_title>Computer Modeling With Reconstruction of Maxillofacial Skeleton</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept of open reduction and internal fixation of facial fractures is well accepted. However, there are situations in which an accurate reduction and restoration of facial symmetry is challenging. In these more difficult cases, the PI uses computer aided design/modeling software as well as intra-operative computer aided surgical navigation systems to assist with repair of these complex injuries. A retrospective review of these cases has not previously been performed.</detailed_description>
