	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of combining a drug known as Lovastatin to the chemotherapy drug cytarabine. Lovastatin is currently used to lower blood cholesterol levels and lab data suggests that it increases the anti-leukemia activity of cytarabine. This research is being done because high doses of cytarabine induce remissions in only about 25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with primary refractory AML (that is no prior remission). Patients who have greater than 10% AML blasts in the bone marrow or blood upon recovery from two cycles of standard cytarabine and anthracyclinebased induction chemotherapy are eligible. Patients who have received etoposide and/or 6thioguanine during remission induction will be eligible. Patients with relapsed AML. Patients must have had a documented remission lasting &gt; 30 days at some point during their prior therapy. Their current relapse must be untreated. Relapse is defined as the presence of greater than 10% AML blasts in the bone marrow or blood after having had a documented remission. Patients who have received a highdose cytarabine containing regimen (&gt;2 g/m2/dose) within 3 months prior to registration on this protocol are not eligible. No active CNS involvement. A lumbar puncture prior to treatment is not required and should not be performed in the absence of significant CNS symptoms or signs. Nonpregnant and nonnursing. Treatment under this protocol would expose an unborn child to significant risks. Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an effective means of birth control. Although NOT considered formal Exclusion Criteria, study physicians are strongly encouraged as part of this decisionmaking process to recognize that the following may increase the risks to a subject entering this protocol: Other serious illnesses which would limit survival to &lt;2 years, or a psychiatric condition which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent. Performance Status &gt; 2. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or infection, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol treatment unreasonably hazardous for the patient. Patients with a "currently active" second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed therapy and considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse within one year. Patients who have received any investigational agent within the prior 4 weeks.</criteria>
