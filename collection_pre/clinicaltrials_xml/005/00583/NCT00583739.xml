	<brief_summary>A randomized trial from the British National Health Service found that supervised exercise benefits women with early stage breast cancer with improved functional and psychological benefit after a 12-week intervention and 6 months later. Considering the needs of breast cancer patients and survivors and the reported benefits of exercise and yoga intervention, the investigators propose a pilot study of an 8-week yoga intervention in breast cancer patients. This study would specifically address measures of fatigue and psychosocial distress in the population of breast cancer patients during treatment and within the year following treatment. Currently there is very limited literature on yoga intervention in this population.</brief_summary>
