	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the difference in drug levels of Sandostatin after IM injection of Sandostatin LAR without ultrasound guidance (as is the standard of care) compared to drug levels of Sandostatin after IM injection of Sandostatin LAR with ultrasound guidance in subjects with Acromegaly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Sandostatin LAR Injection in Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IM intragluteal injections have been reported to be inaccurate in their placement in the intramuscular compartment when performed as dictated by the current standard of care. This inaccuracy of placement may have an effect on the efficacy of drugs delivered by the IM route. Furthermore, the inaccuracy of IM injections was found to be directly related to BMI and was found to be more inaccurate in female subjects. Ultrasound guidance of IM injections will improve the accuracy of placement of IM injections and may improve drug levels and efficacy of Sandostatin LAR in the treatment of Acromegaly.</detailed_description>
