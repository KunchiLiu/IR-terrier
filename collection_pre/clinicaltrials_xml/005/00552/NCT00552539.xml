	<brief_title>Syphilis Video Tool to Promote Knowledge and Testing in the ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized four-group intervention-control Solomon design was implemented with Group 1 participants receiving a pre-test survey, the educational video intervention, and a post-test survey; Group 2 the pre-test and post-test surveys; Group 3 the video intervention and a post-test survey; and Group 4 the post-test survey. This design was selected to assess the effect of the video in increasing syphilis knowledge while controlling for the influence of the pre-test instrument in potentially sensitizing participants to key facts. A computer-generated randomization list was created and used to assign patients to groups.</detailed_description>
