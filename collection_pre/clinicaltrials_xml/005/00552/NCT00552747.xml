	<brief_summary>Fenofibrate is a drug that acts on the PPAR alpha receptors, increasing HDL-cholesterol and decreasing triglyceride levels. The interaction with these receptors has antiatherogenic actions by regulating the expression con key proteins that participate in vascular inflammation, plaque stability and thrombosis. Fenofibrate reduces triglycerides and increases HDL-C in plasma. It also decreases small, dense LDL particles. The use of this drug has resulted in improvement of vascular function measured by endothelial function. Our hypotheses state that fenofibrate will improve: endothelial function, improve HDL antioxidant capacity and size distribution towards a predominance of small HDL particles.</brief_summary>
