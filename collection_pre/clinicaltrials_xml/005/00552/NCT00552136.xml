	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if the clinical outcome success rate of Total Ankle Arthroplasty is similar to that of Ankle Arthrodesis over a period of 10 years. This will include looking at whether Total ankle arthroplasty results in a lower rate of hindfoot arthrosis and arthritis after surgery compared to ankle joint arthrodesis and if the rate of complications and revision surgery is acceptable when compared to Ankle Arthrodesis over a period of 10 years.</brief_summary>
