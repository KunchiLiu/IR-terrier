	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate an assessment of the intraocular pressure with the dynamic contour tonometry and the Goldmann applanation tonometry in patients with active anterior uveitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Assessed by Dynamic Contour Tonometer (DCT) and Goldman Applanation Tonometry (GAT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keratoprecipitates are often found in anterior uveitis. Also elevation of the IOP can be seen in these patients. Goldmann applanation tonometry is the standard technique to assess the IOP but depends on the corneal thickness. Therefore IOP is measured by Goldmann and dynamic contour tonometry and corneal thickness is quantified by Orbscan at active uveitis and after the keratoprecipitates have disappeared.</detailed_description>
