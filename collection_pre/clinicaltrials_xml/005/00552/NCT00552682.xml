	<brief_title>Pilot, Opened, Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Duloxetine in the Treatment of Fibromialgy in Patients With Infection by HIV 1+</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among HIV-1-infected patients, diagnosis of fibromialgy has increased over the last years . Appropriate identification of firomialgy in these patients is challenging and sometimes can be more complicated than in HIV-negative population. Concomitant infectious processes and symptoms due to HIV infection itself need to be ruled out before establishing a formal diagnosis. The treatment of this disease frequently includes muscular relaxants , pain-killers, anti-inflammatories and antidepressives despite no drug is formally indicated for this pathology. Duloxetine approved indications include both treatment of major depressive disorders (MDD) and diabetic neuropathic pain. Recent studies in HIV negative patients show efficacy to control pain and depressive symptoms in patients with fibromialgy The main purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of duloxetine in HIV-1-infected patients with fibromialgy. The main purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of duloxetine in HIV-1-infected patients with fibromialgy or chronic fatigue syndrome presenting with widespread pain.</detailed_description>
