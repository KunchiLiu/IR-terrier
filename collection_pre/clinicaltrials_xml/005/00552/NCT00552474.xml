	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the brain when using the ANS Totally Implantable Deep Brain Stimulation System as an adjunctive treatment for reducing some of the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation to Treat Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, controlled, multi-centered, 12 months post-implantation study. A maximum of 15 sites will enroll a total of 136 patients. All study participants will have the study device surgically implanted. After implant surgery, study participants will return to the clinic for evaluation 30 days after surgery, three months after surgery, six months after surgery and twelve months after surgery. At the baseline, three, six and twelve month visits the patient's Parkinson's symptoms and ability to perform daily activities will be evaluated using a number of accepted assessment tools including a Dyskinesia diary, evaluation of PD symptoms, quality of life scoring and patient extension study to monitor the safety and efficacy of the ANS Libra/Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System. After the 1 year study, patients may enter another protocol (C-06-04) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System. Patients may be followed for an additional 4 years. If necessary, patients may continue to have access to the investigational device under protocol (C-13-02) which allows for compassionate use access to it.</detailed_description>
