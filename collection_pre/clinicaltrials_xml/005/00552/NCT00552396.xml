	<brief_summary>Development of new treatments for diseases such as multiple myeloma is a focus for research. The research being conducted is on treatment called Anti-KIR (1-7F9), which activates the body's own cells to kill tumor cells. This is different from many other treatments where chemicals are given to kill tumor cells. The purpose of the study is to determine a safe dose of Anti-KIR (1-7F9) to administer in humans and to gain information about its effectiveness in the treatment of multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label, Dose-escalation Safety and Tolerability Trial Assessing Anti-KIR (1-7F9) in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial Design: The trial is an open-label, dose-escalation trial to determine the safety and tolerability of Anti-KIR (1-7F9) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). A 3+3 design will be employed for the first dosing cycle at each dose level. The 7 planned dose levels are 0.0003 mg/kg, 0.003 mg/kg, 0.015 mg/kg, 0.075 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg. The subjects will receive up to a total of 4 administrations of Anti-KIR (1-7F9) with a dosing interval between each administration of 4 weeks. Safety, toxicity, PK (pharmacokinetic) and PD (pharmacodynamic) obtained in the first 4 weeks after dosing per group will be the basis for dose-escalation decisions. There will be follow-up visits every week the one month after the first administration and every two weeks following the second, third and fourth administrations. After the last administration there will be follow-up visits every month until KIR occupancy is no longer detected.</detailed_description>
