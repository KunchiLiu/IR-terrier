	<brief_summary>The timing of intervention study is a prospective, randomized, international, multicentre comparison of the relative efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of a management strategy of coronary angiography and intervention performed within 24 hours of randomization versus delayed coronary angiography and intervention in patients after 36 hours with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients presenting or admitted to hospital with symptoms suspected to represent an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or MI without persistent ST elevation) i.e., clinical history consistent with new onset, or a worsening pattern, of characteristic ischemic chest pain or ischemic symptoms occurring at rest or with minimal activity (lasting longer than five minutes or requiring sublingual nitroglycerin for relief of the pain) 2. Able to randomise within 24 hours of the onset of the most recent episode of symptoms 3. At least two of the three following additional criteria: Age more than or equal to 60 years Troponin T or I or Creatine Kinase Myocardial Bands (CKMB) above the upper limit of normal for the local institution ElectroCardioGram (ECG) changes compatible with ischemia (i.e., ST depression at least 1 mm in two contiguous leads or T wave inversion mroe than 3 mm or any dynamic ST shift or transient ST elevation) 4. Written informed consent dated and signed 1. Age less than 21 years 2. Not a suitable candidate for revascularisation 3. Comorbid condition with life expectancy less than six months</criteria>
