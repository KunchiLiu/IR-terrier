	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrences of respiratory symptoms risk factors and abnormalities in lung function in young children (3-6 years old) with hemato-oncologic diseases at presentation (before treatment) and up to 3 years follow-up (study period).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Function at Presentation and Follow-up in Hemato-Oncology 3-7 Years Old Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are a part of the routine follow-up of patients receiving anti-cancer treatment. Treatment is frequently associated with diverse pulmonary damage which may become functionally and clinically evident many years later. PFTs may help to quantify the damage in the lungs; help to evaluate the point at which lung function deviates from normal to allow early intervention before irreversible lung damage occurs and thereby to reduce morbidity and mortality. Reliable PFTs in the preschool age have traditionally been difficult to perform, but recent publications have demonstrated that the majority of preschool children can produce reproducible forced expiratory flow volume (FEVC) curves with proper coaching techniques. This recent development may enable studying the long term effect (years) of treatment on lung function in young children suffering from hemato-oncologic diseases.</detailed_description>
