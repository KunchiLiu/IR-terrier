	<brief_summary>Study Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of a standardised extract of Cannabis sativa given orally 2 times daily as compared to placebo for the relief of muscle stiffness and pain in multiple sclerosis for a period of 12 weeks. Study Patients: 400 patients with multiple sclerosis (age 18-64, stable disease during previous 6 months, ambulatory or not, antispasticity medication and physiotherapy stabilised ≥ 30 days) with experiencing muscle stiffness ≥ 4 on a 11-point numerical Likert scale at baseline. Study treatment: Group 1: Cannabis extract (delta-9-THC 2.5mg, CBD 1.25 mg per capsule), flexible dosing between 5 mg and 25 mg THC/d, administered twice daily, additionally to previous antispasticity and analgesic medication. Group 2: Matched placebo, twice daily, additionally to previous antispasticity and analgesic medication. Treatment Schedule: Start dose 5 mg THC/d, individual dose titration with increase of 5 mg THC every 3 days, maximal total daily dose 25 mg THC, administered as 2 equal doses based on tolerability. Treatment duration: 12 weeks. Study sites: 20 neurological clinics in the United Kingdom.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent. Diagnosis of MS according to McDonald criteria. Current muscle stiffness ≥ 4 on a 11point categorical rating scale. Ongoing troublesome muscle stiffness for at least 3 months. Stable disease for the previous 6 months. Antispasticity medication and physiotherapy stabilised for the last 30 days. Patients may be ambulatory or not. Age 1864. Immunosuppressants which may affect spasticity (including corticosteroids and interferon but excluding azathioprine) taken currently or in previous 30 days Past or present history of psychotic illness. Open/infected pressure sores or other source of chronic infection. Significant fixed tendon contractures. Severe cognitive impairment such that the patient is unable to provide informed consent. History of clinically important renal, cardiovascular or neurol. diseases (apart from MS). Malignancy within the past 2 years. Cannabinoids taken currently or in previous 30 days. Positive qualitative urinary test on cannabinoids at screening visit. (In this case a patient will be allowed to repeat the test at a second screening visit later.) Known hypersensitivity to cannabinoids. Current drug abuse, including alcohol abuse. Laboratory parameters outside the following limits: Creatinine &gt; 3x upper limit of normal Bilirubine &gt; 3x upper limit of normal Transaminases &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal Anticipated immunisations within the 12 weeks of trial participation. Other problems likely to make participation difficult at the discretion of the neurologist. Women who are pregnant, lactating or not using adequate contraception. Participation in other treatment studies currently or within the previous month.</criteria>
