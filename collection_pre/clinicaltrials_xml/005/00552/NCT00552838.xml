	<brief_summary>Multidisciplinary antimicrobial utilization teams (AUT) have been proposed as an effective mechanism for improving antimicrobial use, but data on their efficacy remain limited. The researchers postulated that a multi-disciplinary AUT would improve antimicrobial use in a teaching hospital when compared to the standard of care (no AUT intervention). Design: Randomized-controlled intervention trial. Setting: A 953-bed urban teaching hospital. Patients: Patients admitted to internal medicine ward teams who were prescribed selected antimicrobial agents (piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, or vancomycin) during the 10month study period. Intervention: Eight internal medicine ward teams were randomized monthly to academic detailing by the AUT while 8 internal medicine ward teams were randomized indication-based prescription of broad spectrum antimicrobials. Measurements: Proportion of appropriate empiric, definitive, and end antimicrobial usage (antimicrobial use from the initiation of therapy until definitive therapy is prescribed).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study was conducted when Bernard C Camins, MD (BCC), one of the investigators, was still employed at Emory University. The principal investigator is no longer at Emory University. This trial is being registered by one of the investigators, BCC, so we can submit the manuscript for publication. BCC is now at Washington University and this study was conducted while he was at Emory University.</detailed_description>
