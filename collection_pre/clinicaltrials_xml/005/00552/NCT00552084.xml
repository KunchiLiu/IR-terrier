	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart rhythm disorder that usually involves a rapid heart rate. People who take fish oil supplements may reduce the risk of a recurrence of AF. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of fish oil at decreasing the recurrence of AF and will examine the reasons why fish oil may reduce this risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Fish Oil Supplements at Reducing the Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AF is the most common type of serious heart arrhythmia. It affects approximately 2% of the population and is becoming more common. In AF, the heart's atria, or upper chambers, contract in a very disorganized and abnormal manner and are unable to correctly pump blood into the heart's ventricles, or lower chambers. Symptoms may include a rapid or irregular pulse, dizziness, fainting, or breathing difficulty. Recent studies suggest that inflammation plays a fundamental role in the development of AF. Inflammation, and the resulting oxidative stress, can cause cellular and tissue damage. In turn, this may alter heart function, potentially leading to both the onset and recurrence of AF. Markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are often elevated in patients with AF, providing further evidence of inflammation's role. While there are several treatment options for AF, they are usually only moderately effective. Previous research has shown that fish oil supplements have anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antioxidant effects and can reduce the risk of AF following surgery. However, it is not known exactly how fish oil reduces this risk and whether the same positive effect will carry over in people who experience the more common type of AF that is unrelated to surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oil supplementation at decreasing the recurrence of AF in adults who have not undergone recent surgery. Researchers will also examine the ways in which fish oil reduces AF recurrence. This study will enroll people who have had at least two occurrences of AF. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fish oil supplements or placebo for 24 weeks. At study visits at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24, participants will undergo a medical and social history review, a physical exam, and blood and urine collection. At the baseline study visit, an electrocardiogram will also occur.</detailed_description>
