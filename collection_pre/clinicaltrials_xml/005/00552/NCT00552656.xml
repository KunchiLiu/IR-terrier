	<brief_title>Long Term Efficacy and Safety of Firebird Sirolimus-Eluting Stent In Complex Coronary Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized clinical trials and large-scale registry studies have shown that sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) decrease major adverse cardiovascular event(MACE)and restenosis rates compared with bare metal stents (BMSs), but relatively small proportion of patients of complex lesions were enrolled in these studies. Moreover,with the increase in complexity of lesions, different DES shows different effects. The long term effects of DES for treatment of complex coronary lesions remains to be established. This study aims to investigate the long term efficacy and safety of Firebird sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in a high-risk population, that is, the patients who had complex coronary lesions, including multivessel diseases,diffuse long lesions, left main lesions, chronic total occlusion, bifurcation lesions, small vessel diseases,severe calcification or angulation lesions, ostial lesions, restenotic lesions after bare metel stent implantation .</detailed_description>
