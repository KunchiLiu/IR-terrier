	<brief_title>The SOURT OUT IV TRIAL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2 Purpose In a randomized study to compare the Cypher Select+ and the Xience V coronary stents in the treatment of unselected patients with coronary artery disease. 2.1 Primary objective In a randomized study to compare the Xience V and the Cypher Select+ coronary stents by assessing SAFETY (cardiac death, myocardial infarction and/or stent thrombosis) and EFFICACY (target vessel revascularization) after 9 months. 2.2 Secondary objective To compare device success rate, procedure success rate and complication rate during hospitalization, after 1 month and after 9 months and the incidence of late stent thrombosis after 12, 24 and 36 months.</detailed_description>
