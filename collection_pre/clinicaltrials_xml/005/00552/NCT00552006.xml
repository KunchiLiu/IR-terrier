	<brief_summary>In the aftermath of traumatic experiences like natural disasters or man-caused traumatic events, such as war experiences, a substantial part of the affected individuals develop a number of psychological symptoms. The characteristic symptom pattern occurring in the aftermath of traumatic events is called posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and includes functional impairment of the affected individuals. The investigators want to test whether Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is an effective tool in reducing trauma related symptoms in formerly abducted children and youths and former child soldiers, when applied by lay personnel.</brief_summary>
