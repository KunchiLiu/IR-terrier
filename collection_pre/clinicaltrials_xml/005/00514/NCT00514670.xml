	<brief_summary>The objective of the trial is to assess the impact of a disinfection and hand hygiene program on absenteeism in elementary school classrooms. Students in intervention classrooms will use alcohol-based hand sanitizers at school, and their classrooms will be disinfected using quaternary ammonium wipes. We hypothesize that the use of disinfectants and hand hygiene products in elementary school classrooms will reduce absenteeism.</brief_summary>
