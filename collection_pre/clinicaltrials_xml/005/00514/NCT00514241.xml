	<brief_summary>The aim of platelet rich plasma (PRP) application is to accelerate the healing cascade via application of elevated cytokine concentrations released during platelet degranulation. This is a prospective randomized study of the effect of autologous platelet concentrate application during surgical closure following a vein harvest during coronary bypass surgery. This prophylactic measure will be compared to standard surgical closure techniques with the primary outcome being the incidence of leg wound infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Use of Gravitational Platelet Separation System on Leg Wound Healing in Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative wound disturbances, particularly surgical site infection of the chest and leg incision site following cardiac surgery are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. A recent dissertation from the National hospital in Norway showed a 20% infection rate in wounds after bypass surgery, this is probably representable nation wide. Prophylactic interventions that reduce postoperative wound disturbances and infection would have inherent value in cardiothoracic surgery. Ideally, a specific intervention would demonstrate improved patient outcomes while reducing the output of hospital resources. The aim of platelet rich plasma (PRP) application is to accelerate the healing cascade via application of elevated cytokine concentrations released during platelet degranulation. It is hypothesized that the elevated cytokine levels will elucidate an accelerated healing response of the affected tissue. PPP application has also been advocated as a tissue sealant for topical hemostasis. This is a prospective randomized study of the effect of autologous platelet concentrate application during surgical closure following a vein harvest during coronary bypass surgery. This prophylactic measure will be compared to standard surgical closure techniques with the primary outcome being the incidence of leg wound infection.</detailed_description>
