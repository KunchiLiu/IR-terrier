	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus(HVC) is a major public-health problem since it presents a long phase of clinical latency which makes its early diagnosis difficult and results in the development of a large number of cases to complications such as cirrhosis, hepatic insufficiency and hepatocarcinoma. In Brazil, it is estimated three million estimated cases to 52 thousand reports. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sustained virologic response (RVS) in HVC patients treated with pegylated-interferon or conventional-interferon and ribavirin, and to investigate the associated factors with RVS, by means of retrospective analysis.</detailed_description>
