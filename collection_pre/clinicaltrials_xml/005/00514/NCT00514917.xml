	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of androgen deprivation with or without docetaxel as determined by the median progression free survival (PFS) over the period of 18-month therapy and at least 18-month follow-up. The secondary objectives were: - To assess cancer specific survival; - To compare overall survival between the 2 treatment groups; - To evaluate patient-reported outcomes including quality of life, fatigue, and sexual functioning as measured by 3 different assessments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Androgen Deprivation With Leuprolide, +/- Docetaxel for Clinically Asymptomatic Prostate Cancer Participants With a Rising Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study per participant was to be at least 36 months, of which the treatment period was 18 months for all participants, followed by at least 18 months follow-up period. Participants received study treatment for up to 18 months from the time of study therapy initiation or less if one of the following occurred: disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, participant refusal or treatment delay beyond the time frame that is permitted for each treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma pathologically confirmed History of radical prostatectomy (preoperative radiation therapy to the prostate or pelvis or salvage radiation after radical prostatectomy was allowed) Demonstration of biochemical progression of disease based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time. The minimum PSA value for eligibility was greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1. PSA doubling time over three values must be equal to (=) 9 months with a minimum of 3 weeks between assessments Serum testosterone &gt;=100 nanogram per deciliter (ng/dL) Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;=70 percent (%) Adequate organ function as defined by the following laboratory criteria: White blood cells &gt;=3500 per cubic millimeter (mm^3) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;=1500 per mm^3 Platelet count &gt;=100,000 per mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt;= 10.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL) Total Bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to Gilbert's disease Creatinine l &lt;= 1.5 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) or creatinine clearance &gt;=60 cubic centimeters per minute Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase within predefined ranges Previous hormonal therapy was allowed provided that the total duration of therapy did not exceed 6 months Man of childbearing potential who was willing to consent to use effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter Participant who was willing and was able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III/IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease Uncontrolled serious active infection Anticipated duration of life &lt; 2 years Less than 5year history of successful treatment for other cancers or concurrent active nonprostate cancer other than nonmelanoma dermatologic tumor Peripheral neuropathy &gt;=Grade 2 History of hypersensitivity reaction to Docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80, leuprolide, or bicalutamide Prior chemotherapy within the past 10 years (except nontaxane based chemotherapy for treatment of other cancers); concurrent treatment on another clinical trial or with any other cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy (except salvage radiation therapy), chemoembolization therapy, cryotherapy Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including psychiatric disease, or significant laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for the participant's safety, delay or prohibit protocol participation, or interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study Radiographic findings suspicious for metastatic disease in the treating physician's clinical judgment. Participant who had radiographically suspicious pelvic lymph nodes prior to radial prostatectomy, but who, at the time of enrollment did not have suspicious adenopathy was eligible. Participant was eligible even if he/she had tumorcontaining pelvic adenopathy at the time of surgery as long as at the time of enrollment there was no radiographically evident nodal disease in the clinician's opinion Participant was the investigator or any subinvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol Participant unlikely to comply with protocol or research tests, for example, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study Participant who participated in another clinical study/received investigational product within 30 days of screening The above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
