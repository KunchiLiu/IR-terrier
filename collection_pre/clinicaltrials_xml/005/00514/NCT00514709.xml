	<brief_summary>DTaP-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine is being developed in order to comply with expanding programs for immunization in infancy, while offering the benefit of a reduced number of injections, and potentially of an increased acceptance. Primary Objectives: - To describe the antibody persistence at 12 to 18 months following a three-dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-HB-PRP~T or Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib™ given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, and one dose of Hepatitis B (Hep B) vaccine given at birth. - To describe the effect of a booster dose of DTaP-HB-PRP~T on immunogenicity at 12 to 18 months following a three-dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-HB-PRP~T or Tritanrix HepB/Hib™ given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, and one dose of Hep B vaccine given at birth. Secondary Objective: - To describe the safety profile of the booster dose of the DTaP-HB-PRP~T vaccine when administered concomitantly with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Study of Antibody Persistence and Booster Effect of DTaP-HB PRP~T Combined Vaccine in Filipino Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the investigational DTaP-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine when given as a booster dose, concomitantly with OPV, in Filipino children previously primed at 6, 10, and 14 weeks with the investigational DTaP-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine or Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib™ vaccine and having received a first dose of Hep B vaccine (Recomvax B™) at birth in a previous study, AL201 (NCT00348881).</detailed_description>
