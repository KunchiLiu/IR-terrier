	<brief_summary>Radio Contrast Induced Nephropathy (RCIN) remains a well recognized complication in patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures requiring radiographic contrast agents. Recent studies have shown benefit in administering Sodium Bicarbonate over normal saline( the uniformly accepted prophylaxy) in preventing RCIN.Therefore the aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate solved in normal saline compared with infusion of normal saline in prevention of RCIN.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Sodium Bicarbonate Solution in Decreasing the Incidence of Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radio Contrast Induced Nephropathy (RCIN) remains a well recognized complication in patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures requiring radiographic contrast agents and is the third leading cause of acquired acute renal failure in hospitalized patients. Strategies for the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy have focused on countering vasoconstriction (pre-hydration, fenoldopam, and theophylline), enhancing flow through the nephron (diuretics), or protection against oxygen-free-radical injury (urinary alkalinization and N-acetylcysteine). Among all prophylactic measures that have been proposed, adequate preprocedural and postprocedural hydration has demonstrated effectiveness in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. Thus, it remains the most frequently applied measure in clinical practice. A Recent study in May 2004 have shown benefit in administering Sodium Bicarbonate over normal saline as a prophylaxy.Since alkalizing renal tubular fluid with bicarbonate may reduce injury. Comparisons: IV 154 mEq/L solution of NaCl 0.9% OR IV 154 mEq/ L sodium bicarbonate solved in 154 mEq/ L NaCl 0.9%. Each fluid is infused at the rate of 3 ml/kg/ hour one hour before the angiographic procedure, continuing at the rate of 1 ml/kg/ hour for 6 hours after the procedure. Maximum rate of fluid permitted is that for a body weight of 110 Kg.</detailed_description>
