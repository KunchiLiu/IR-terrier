	<brief_summary>The NID-2 study, a multicentric study (21 centres enrolled), was planned in two phases: Phase 1(observational study, completed at 2007): after the identification of a type-2 diabetic population with typical DN, to study of the rate of renal and cardiovascular events during a middle term follow-up. Phase 2(interventional study, started at 2007): after randomization in two groups, a group (intervention group) is treated with an intensive multifactorial intervention whose aim is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to diabetic complications. The other group (control group) continues the conventional therapy . To avoid bias in the treatment in each center, the randomization was performed for centre.</brief_summary>
