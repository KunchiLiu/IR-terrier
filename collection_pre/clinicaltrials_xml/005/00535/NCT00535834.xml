	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients before and after treatment may help doctors learn more about the effects of the treatment on cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying samples collected from patients with localized prostate cancer who received treatment on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the formation of antibody complexes in serum samples taken before initiation of treatment and after completion of therapy in prostate cancer patients previously enrolled on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154. - Evaluate immunologic response. Secondary - Clone the underlying tumor antigens discovered through SEREX. OUTLINE: Samples previously collected on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154 (whole blood, serum, and peripheral mononuclear blood cells) are analyzed for immunologic responses and evidence of formation of anti-tumor antibodies. Western blot is used to detect any evidence of vaccine-induced autoantibody responses. If there is an indication of response, SEREX is used to clone the underlying antigens.</detailed_description>
