	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of an Inactivated Pandemic Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine to be investigated is producted in embryonated hen's eggs using an H5N1 reference strain NIBRG-14 which was prepared by NIBSC. The strain is a reassortant between A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/PR/8/34 by reverse genetics. Total 400 volunteers aged from 18 to 60 years old are to be enrolled with 100 subjects in each group. The eligible volunteers will receive two doses vaccine of 5μg，10μg or 15μg haemagglutinin antigen. The schedule is day 0,14 or day 0,28. The subjects will donate their blood samples for the detection of HI antibody and microneutralization antibody. Local and systematic adverse reactions will be recorded during the study.</detailed_description>
