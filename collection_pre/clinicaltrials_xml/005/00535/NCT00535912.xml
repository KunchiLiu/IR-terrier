	<brief_summary>GOELAMS LLC98 is a prospective randomized trial comparing in previously untreated B and C Binet stages B-CLL and on an intent to treat basis two strategies. Conventional chemotherapy consisted of six monthly courses of CHOP, followed by 6 CHOP courses every other 3 months in case of response. Experimental arm consisted of high dose therapy with autologous CD34+ purified progenitor cell support, used as consolidation of Complete Remission or Very Good Partial Response obtained after 3 monthly courses of CHOP, followed by 3 to 6 monthly-courses of fludarabine in case of insufficient response.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the prospective randomized GOELAMS LLC 98 trial reported here was to compare two therapeutic strategies in previously untreated B and C Binet stages B-CLL patients less than 60 years old. Conventional chemotherapy (Arm A) consisted of six monthly courses of CHOP, i.e. vincristin IV 1 mg/m2 on day 1, doxorubicin IV 25 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide (Cy) 300 mg/m2 and prednisone 40 mg/m2 both given orally from day 1 to day 5, followed by 6 CHOP courses every other 3 months in case of response. Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 /d IV for 5 consecutive days) was used in case of non response (stable disease or progression) after 3 CHOP courses. This conventional therapy was compared to high dose therapy with autologous CD34+ purified progenitor cell support (Arm B), used as consolidation of Complete Remission (CR) or Very Good Partial Response (VGPR, defined by &gt;50 % tumoral response and bone marrow lymphocyte infiltration &lt;30%) obtained after 3 monthly courses of CHOP. In the absence of CR or VGPR, 3 to 6 monthly-courses of fludarabine were performed before mobilization with Cy 4 g/m2 + G-CSF administration. The conditioning regimen included TBI 12 Gy and Cy 60 mg /kg /d for 2 days.</detailed_description>
