	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial was to test the combined and independent effects of 6 months of exercise and Mestinon in people with fibromyalgia. Specifically, we wanted to determine if Mestinon helped people with fibromyalgia have an easier time exercising and if their symptoms improved by the end of the trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Mestinon and Exercise in Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier, we demonstrated that people with fibromyalgia fail to make adequate growth hormone when they exercise intensively. We also demonstrated that a single dose of Mestinon helped people make normal levels of growth hormone when they exercised in our laboratory. We wanted to know if 6 months of exercise with concurrent Mestinon therapy would make growth hormone (and related markers) normal and improve fibromyalgia symptoms.</detailed_description>
