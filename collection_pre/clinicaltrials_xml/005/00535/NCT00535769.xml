	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if using an electronic reminder improves adherence to sunscreen use. The specific study aims are as follows: 1. To determine whether the use of electronic reminder system increases adherence to topical agents. 2. To assess technological feasibility of measuring adherence to topical agents using electronic monitors specially designed for tubes. 3. To assess technological feasibility of providing electronic reminders using cellular phone text-messaging system. 4. To obtain subjects' feedback on the adherence monitoring and reminder system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Adherence to Topical Agents: Applying Communication Technology to Improve Sunscreen Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to use communication technology to develop a novel means of monitoring and improving adherence to topical agents. We will conduct a randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial to assess the impact of automated reminder system on adherence rates to sunscreens. This study will involve designing an electronic monitoring device specifically for topical agents and creating a platform for an automated reminder system. The electronic monitoring devices will be adaptable to tubes of varying shapes and sizes, and they will send SMS messages to a central server in real-time each time the tube is opened. We will create a text-message reminder system to send reminders to users' cellular phones over a secured network. Our hypothesis is that the electronic monitoring and reminder system will increase patients' adherence to topical agents. We will measure the impact of the intervention on adherence rates and assess patients' views on the reminder system. This project will allow us to engineer a novel device to electronically monitor adherence to topical agents and to use communication technology to change patients' behavior.</detailed_description>
