	<brief_summary>In a prospective and randomized study protocol, three different blood pressure regulating agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, sevoflurane) will be compared concerning their effect on the cerebral oxygen balance between both hemispheres during aortic coarctation repair. Cerebral and somatic saturation will be monitored non-invasively and continuously via optical sensors applied to the right and left forehead and the somatic regions. Arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate and systemic saturation will be recorded continuously. Intermittently, arterial and venous blood gas analysis will be performed at 6 definite time intervals. The study ends at the end of the operation.</brief_summary>
