This program deals with diet and exercise, the influence of TV and magazines on eating habits, and handling stress. The second program, the Strong African American Families Teen Program (SAAF-T), helps teens learn how to develop plans for the future and to avoid drug use and unsafe sex. The sessions deal with goal setting, peer pressure, and staying in school.</brief_summary>
