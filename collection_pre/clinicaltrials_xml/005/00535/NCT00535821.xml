	<brief_summary>Early intervention in the treatment of septic shock, including early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in the first 6 hours of disease presentation, has been shown to significantly decrease mortality. However, this approach requires invasive hemodynamic monitoring, thus limiting its widespread application in the emergency department setting. A minimally invasive protocol utilizing esophageal Doppler monitoring (EDM) may be of benefit and practical if it is shown to result in similar outcome as EGDT.</brief_summary>
