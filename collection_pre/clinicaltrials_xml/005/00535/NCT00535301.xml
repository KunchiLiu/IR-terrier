	<brief_title>Outcomes of Anterior Colporrhaphy Versus Graft Reinforced Anterior Prolapse Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful correction of anterior vaginal prolapse remains one of the most challenging aspects of pelvic reconstructive surgery. Up to 70% have recurrent prolapse following anterior colporrhaphy. The low success rate has consequently led to widespread use of grafts in anterior vaginal prolapse repair. While both biologic grafts and polyglactin 910 mesh have yielded disappointing results, uncontrolled studies have demonstrated low recurrence rates with polypropylene mesh reinforcement. The Perigee Transobturator Prolapse Repair System (Perigee TPRS) (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, Minnesota) is used to repair anterior vaginal prolapse via a transobturator approach. Specially-designed helical needles are utilized to attach either a porcine dermal (InteXenTM) or soft polypropylene (InteProTM) graft to the pelvic sidewall at four points. We designed this randomized control trial to compare the anatomic success rates, effect on quality of life and sexual symptom scores, and rates of adverse events of the Perigee TPRS with polypropylene mesh to that of anterior colporrhaphy.</detailed_description>
