	<brief_title>Post-approval Study of the DURALOC速 Option Ceramic-on-Ceramic Hip Prosthesis System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-phased study on hip arthroplasty consists of a clinical follow-up phase and a clinical outcomes phase. The DURALOC速 Option Ceramic-on-Ceramic Hip Prosthesis System consists of: 1. a modular ceramic bearing insert that secures to a titanium metal alloy DURALOC速 Option Acetabular Shell via a taper locking mechanism; and 2. a ceramic femoral head that is attached to a conventional femoral stem to complete the total hip prosthesis device configuration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Skeletally mature Provide informed consent Sufficient acetabular and femoral bone stock to seat the prosthesis Willing and able to return for followup as specified by the study protocol Willing and able to complete the hip outcomes questionnaire and quality of life survey (SF12) Undergo hip replacement due to noninflammatory joint disease, including osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, congenital hip dysplasia or posttraumatic arthritis. Diagnosis of inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus, erythematosis etc. Active infections that may spread to other systems such as osteomyelitis, pyogenic infection of the hip joint overt infection, etc. Loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the affected limb which impedes evaluation. Poor bone quality (e.g. osteoporosis) such that there is concern about the ability of inadequate bone stock to support the implant. Morbid obesity Involvement in high levels of activity or participation in active sports Involvement in heavy manual labor employment Increased likelihood of falls due to concomitant illnesses or impairment Pregnancy, breastfeeding, a prisoner, mentally incompetent, a known alcohol or drug abuser Diagnosis of metabolic disorders or receiving systemic pharmacological treatments leading to progressive deterioration of solid bone support for the implant Known history of conditions that may interfere with the total hip arthroplasty survival or outcome (e.g. Paget's disease, Charcot's disease) Known presence of active metastatic or neoplastic disease Known allergic reactions to implant materials (e.g. ceramic, metal) Known history of tissue reactions to implant corrosion or implant wear debris Disabilities of other joints that impedes evaluation (e.g. knees, ankles) Known presence of highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit followup (e.g. immunocompromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis etc.) Previous prosthetic hip replacement device (any type including THA, surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis etc.)</criteria>
