	<brief_summary>The aim of this research study is to collect and store the specimens that are left over after patients undergo tests ordered by their physicians. These specimens will be used at a later time by researchers in the Pulmonary Division to develop a better understanding of pulmonary diseases or for the development of new treatments. Typical research studies that will be conducted on the stored tissue, fluid, or bacteria from the patient sample involve obtaining bacterial cultures, measurement of inflammatory markers, and examination of the characteristics of the tissue. Other similar tests may be done in the future; however, these tests have not all been determined at this time. It is important to note that no genetic testing will be performed on any samples that are obtained as part of this protocol.</brief_summary>
