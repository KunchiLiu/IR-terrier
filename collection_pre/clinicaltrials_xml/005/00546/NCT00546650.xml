	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NP101 with the currently approved oral, injection and nasal spray formulations of Imitrex® in healthy volunteers and to assess the bioavailability relative to the 6 mg subcutaneous injection. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of NP101 in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
