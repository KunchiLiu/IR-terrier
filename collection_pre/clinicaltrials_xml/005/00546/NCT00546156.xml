	<brief_summary>Dose dense chemotherapy, which is the term for Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by Taxol chemotherapy given every two weeks, is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of ER+ or PR+ breast cancer. In this trial, the standard chemotherapy is being combined with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is an antibody which works differently from the way other chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors by binding to a substance found on cancer cells called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer and lung cancer. However, it is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Another goal of this research is to determine whether we can develop a way to identify tumors that will respond well to this study treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To prepare for the surgery that will occur at the end of the study treatment, a small "clip" will be placed into the tumor area so that the surgeon can locate the site of the tumor at the time of surgery. This is a standard procedure for breast cancer. - During the clip placement, a needle will be inserted into the tumor to measure interstitial fluid pressure (IFP measurement). IFP is done for research purposes to help understand how the tumor responds to the study treatment. - Study treatment will begin with one dose of bevacizumab alone, followed two weeks later by chemotherapy and bevacizumab in eight two-week cycles. The study treatment will be given intravenously in the clinic. - After the first dose of bevacizumab and prior to starting chemotherapy, a needle biopsy of the breast tumor will be performed for research purposes. A second measurement of IFP will also be done at this time. - During the treatment period, tests and procedures will be performed at specified intervals and include the following: research MRI, physical exams, blood tests, urine tests, EKG, and MUGA or ECHO. - Surgery to remove the tumor will occur no less than four weeks after the last dose of Paclitaxel.</detailed_description>
