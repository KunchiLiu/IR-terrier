	<brief_summary>Conflicting results have been reported concerning the association of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Schumacher et al. reported an association between AAA and PXF, with no consideration of grade. However, a later study did not confirm the association between AAA and PXF. The present study aimed at comparing the relative prevalence of PXF in patients suffering from AAA and in age-matched hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>
