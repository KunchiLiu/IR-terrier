	<brief_title>Treatment Insulin Resistence in HCV G-1 Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Differents studies show that infection by virus hepatitis C have a relevant rol in the development of insulin resistance. The insulin resistence is associated with a progression of fibrosis and the development of steatosis. The insulin resistence is frecuently associated with very difficult to cure patients as cirrhotics, afro-american patients, overweight patients and co-infected HCV-HIV patients. Recently is repported that sustained virological (SVR) response in genotype 1 patients is different according the insulin resistance. The SVR was 60% in patients without insulin resistance versus 20% in patients with strong insulin resistance (HOMA &gt; 4. The present trial desire to analyze the effect that the treatment of insulin resistance produce in higher range of RVS.</detailed_description>
