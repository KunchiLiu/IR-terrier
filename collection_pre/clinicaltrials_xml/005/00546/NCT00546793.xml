	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule of veltuzumab can be established in NHL or CLL patients and to confirm the safety and efficacy of veltuzumab that was previously established when administered intravenously.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I/II Study of Subcutaneously Administered Veltuzumab (hA20) in NHL and CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first study of veltuzumab given IV weekly in NHL patients (IM-T-hA20-01) has shown excellent tolerability and even efficacy at weekly intravenous doses as low as 80-120 mg/m2 over 4 consecutive weeks. These clinical results confirm experiments laboratory studies. Laboratory studies using Veltuzumab administered subcutaneously showed potent activity based on B-cell depletion. The current study's goal is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule of veltuzumab can be established in patients with NHL or CLL</detailed_description>
