	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial in a parallel-group design. Aim of the study is the evaluation of tumor-free survival after ablation (by APC, argon plasma coagulation) of Barrett's mucosa plus esomeprazole versus surveillance without ablation in patients cured from Barrett's cancer combined with randomization of esomeprazole vs placebo for symptomatic reflux control after successful ablation of Barrett's mucosa . There are two hypotheses: (1) Consecutive thermal ablation of metaplastic, non-neoplastic long segments of Barrett's esophagus (&gt;2cm)plus esomeprazole after successful endoscopic therapy of mucosal cancer by means of ER will decrease the incidence of secondary cancer (local recurrence and metachronous cancer) by a minimum of 50% compared to acid suppression alone without ablation within a 5-years follow-up (primary endpoint). (2) After successful ablation of Barrett's esophagus patients need ongoing acid suppression therapy for medical control of their underlying reflux disease (secondary aim of the study). Duration of the study: Patient recruitment period: 3 years. Follow-up period: 5 years. Total duration: 8 years. The study is already in the recruitment period.</brief_summary>
