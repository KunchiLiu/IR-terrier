	<brief_summary>Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause of cervical cancer. This study will further evaluate induction of immune memory and anamnestic responses in women who previously took part in the primary study (580299/001) and follow-up study (580299/007). Subjects were aged 15-25 yrs at the time of entry into the primary study and participation in the follow-up study lasted approximately 6 years. In the primary and follow-up studies, subjects were protected against HPV-16 and HPV-18 endpoints and had sustained antibody responses to both vaccine types over at least 5.5 years of follow-up. All subjects from North American study sites that completed the follow-up study will be invited to take part in the current study. The study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a dose of GSK Biologicals HPV vaccine (580299) in women who had been immunologically primed in the primary study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
