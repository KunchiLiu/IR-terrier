	<brief_summary>Pancreatic islets are the part of the pancreas that produce insulin and help control the blood sugar. This study aims to improve islet transplantation as a treatment for Type 1 Diabetes by using a new combination of immunosuppressive drugs that have been successful in treating other autoimmune diseases and in preventing kidney transplant rejection.</brief_summary>
