	<brief_summary>This is a double blind, randomized, parallel group design placebo-controlled mono-center study. Patients will be evaluated within twelve months of CIS onset. Patients with at least 2 silent ovoid T2 bright areas in the deep white matter on their clinic brain MRI scan will be offered participation in the study. Patients will be randomized to oral riluzole or placebo (1:1). Patient will take 50 mg of riluzole or placebo once a day for one month. If 50 mg once a day is well tolerated, patients will then go on 50 mg twice daily for the rest of the study. They will start Avonex (Interferon beta 1a) therapy 30 mcg IM once weekly 3 months after study drug (riluzole or placebo) is initiated if their liver function has remained normal. Forty patients within twelve months of onset CIS onset will be enrolled at UCSF MS Center. Patients will be evaluated every month for the first 12 months and every three months thereafter for a total study duration of 24-month. Enrollment period will last six months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroprotection With Riluzole Patients With Early Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the effect of riluzole up to 50 mg bid on MRI parameters, including T1 lesions load, atrophy of gray and white matter, and 1H-MRSI; and to determine safety of riluzole when administered orally up to 50 mg bid for 2 years in double blinded clinical trial of patients with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) and at least 2 silent T2-bright areas in the deep white matter. These patients have a high risk of conversion to MS within 2 years and faster rate of atrophy (Dalton 2004). Specific aims: 1. To determine the effect of treatment compared to placebo on annual change in measures of normalized brain gray and white matter volume changes. 2. To determine the effect of riluzole compared to placebo on annual change in proton spectroscopic intensities of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), in acute and chronic lesions. 3. To determine the safety of riluzole up to 50 mg bid in patients with CIS in association to Avonex (Interferon beta 1a) 30 mcg IM once a week. 4. To monitor changes on MS functional composite (MSFC) (Cutter 1999, Rudick 1998), optic coherence tomography (OCT), low contrast sensitivity and EDSS in these patients. 5. To monitor recovery from exacerbations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient must give written informed consent; 2. Patients with a early MS or clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) in the past 12 months as defined by an acute or subacute episode suggestive of demyelination affecting the optic nerves, brain stem or spinal cord or other central nervous system location. 3. Entry age 1855 4. Males and females 5. At least 2 silent T2 bright areas in the deep white matter on screening brain MRI. 6. No riluzole, interferon, copaxone, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone or other offlabel immunosuppressive drugs for MS prior to study entry 7. No corticosteroid during the 4 weeks prior to baseline MRI exam 8. No prior exposure to total lymphoid irradiation 9. No history of substance abuse, including documented alcohol dependence within 6 months prior to screening or alcohol liver damage with AST , ALT &gt; twice upper normal limits 10. No pregnant or nursing patients 11. No history of systemic illness or medical condition that would limit the likelihood of completing the gadoliniumenhanced MRI procedures. Automatic exclusionary conditions will include hypersensitivity reaction to riluzole or any of the tablets components, uncontrolled hypertension, epilepsy, and insulin dependent diabetes, asthma, known malignancy other than skin cancer, symptomatic cardiac disease or metallic objects on or inside the body. 12. Patients willing to use birth control during the study. 13. Patients willing to go on Avonex therapy 3 months after being randomized to study drug and no contraindication to use of interferon therapy. 1. A history of major depression or psychosis. 2. A clinically significant MS exacerbation within 30 days of the screening 3. Pregnancy 4. Abnormal screening liver function (AST or ALT &gt; twice the upper normal limit). 5. Patients receiving hepatotoxic medications such as drugs interfering with CYP 1A2.</criteria>
