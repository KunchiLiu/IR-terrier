	<detailed_description>The ADRIE study is an observational study on the clinical relevance of platelet reactivity in aspirin and clopidogrel treated cardiovascular patients. Main objective: - to determine if platelet reactivity, assessed by specific and non-specific tests, is predictive of ischemic events during the 3-year follow-up. Secondary objectives: - primary outcome in each pre-specified sub-group : patients with coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke or peripheral arterial disease as main qualifying disease at entry, - to determine if platelet reactivity, assessed by specific and non-specific tests, is predictive of bleeding events during the 3-year follow-up, - to investigate potential determinants of platelet reactivity at entry in the study</detailed_description>
