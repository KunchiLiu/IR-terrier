	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the predictive value of task persistence as measured by a mirror tracing task. A secondary purpose is to evaluate differences in task persistence in smokers with or without schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that task persistence in smokers in both diagnostic categories (schizophrenia and no schizophrenia) will predict tobacco dependence treatment outcome at one and six months. It is also hypothesized that smokers with schizophrenia will show lower levels of task persistence after controlling for other motor skills than smokers without schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
