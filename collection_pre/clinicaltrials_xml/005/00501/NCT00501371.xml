	<brief_summary>Phase III, Randomized, double-blind, parallel placebo-controlled study. Two arms: MCS (30mg/day) vs. placebo. Subproject MCS-2: alpha-blocker naïve subjects Subproject MCS-3: subjects responding poorly to alpha-blocker</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MCS in Treating Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Suggestive of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For MCS-2 This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study where eligible male subjects (age 40, N=188), after a two-week washout period, will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either MCS 30 mg/day or placebo for 12 weeks. Group A: MCS 30 mg/day for 12 weeks Group B: placebo for 12 weeks Subjects are limited to those who are currently not being treated medically for BPH or LUTS with alpha-blockers, anti-cholinergics, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or hormonal therapeutic agents. For each treatment arm, about 85 subjects eligible for final per protocol analysis will be recruited. Concerning an expected dropout rate of 10%, 188 subjects in total will be recruited onto the study. For MCS-3 This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on, parallel study where eligible male subjects (age 40, N=242), after a two-week washout period, will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either MCS 30 mg/day plus alpha-blocker or placebo plus alpha-blocker for 12 weeks. Group A: alpha-blocker plus MCS 30 mg/day Group B: alpha-blocker plus placebo Subjects are limited to those who are currently not being treated medically for BPH or LUTS with anti-cholinergics, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or hormonal therapeutic agents. For each treatment arm, about 220 subjects eligible for final per protocol analysis will be recruited. Concerning an expected dropout rate of 10%, 242 subjects in total will be recruited onto the study. All participating subjects will be advised to maintain a normal diet as they do before joining the study. However, participating subjects are advised to refrain from extra source of carotenoids supplementation and MCS extracts made into a capsule, soft gel, or crude granule extracts.</detailed_description>

PSA≦4 ng/ml within 4 weeks of V1 and no pathologicallyproven prostate cancer. No known malignancy, except cancers without signs of recurrence for &gt; 5 years and no need for further anticancer treatment. AST/ALT≦3X UNL. creatinine≦3X UNL. Subjects who sign the informed consent form. Exclusion criteria Subjects' LUTS are not BPHrelated but are associated with such conditions as urethral stricture, prostatitis, neurogenic bladder, or pelvic treatment procedures. Have been treated with pelvis irradiation or pelvic surgery. Plan to undergo any invasive procedures within the study period, such as, prostate surgery, prostate biopsy, cystourethroscopy, pelvic surgery, laparotomy, or any procedures needing urethral catheterization. Participating in another investigational agent study in the past 12 weeks or are going to do so during the study period. Active infection or inflammation. Considered ineligible by the investigators. Inclusion criteria for subproject MCS3 Age≧40 years old. The alphablocker dosage used should be as high as subjects can tolerate. No known malignancy, except cancers without signs of recurrence for &gt; 5 years and no need for further anticancer treatment. PSA≦10.0 ng/ml without pathologicallyproven prostate cancer or other cancers. Prostate biopsy is mandatory &gt; 12 weeks before screening, if PSA is≧4 ng/ml to rule out prostate cancer. AST/ALT≦3X UNL. Creatinine≦3X UNL. Subjects who sign the informed consent form. Exclusion criteria Subjects' LUTS are not BPHrelated but associated with such conditions as urethral stricture, prostatitis, neurogenic bladder, or pelvic treatment procedures. Subjects who have been treated with pelvis irradiation or pelvic surgery. PSA &gt; 10.0 ng/ml, abnormal DRE of the prostate or any suspicion of prostate malignancy. However, those who have a negative prostate biopsy are allowed. Active infection or inflammation. Considered ineligible by the investigators.</criteria>
