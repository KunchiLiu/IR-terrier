	<brief_summary>There is some evidence for a hypercoagulable state in sleep apnea-hipopnea syndrome (SAHS), which could play a role in the increased cardiovascular morbility and mortality. Respiratory alterations (hypoxia, hypoxia- reoxygenation) and sleep fragmentation that these patients suffer during the sleep may induce modifications in clotting-fibrinolisis factors that may be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVES:To calculate and compare the prevalence of sleep apnea-hipopnea syndrome in patients with venous thromboembolism with a gender, aged and BMI matched control group. Assessment of the association between SAHS and other risk factors for VTE. To compare clotting- fibrinolisis patterns, sleep parameters, blood pressure and pulmonary arterial obstruction index in patients with SAHS and VTE and those ones without SAHS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: 133 SAHS patients and 133 controls will be studied. The study includes: a) medical history; b) anthropometric variables (weight, height, body mass index, Mallampati index); c) sleepiness tested by Epworth scale; d) London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale; e) conventional polysomnography (PSG); f) testing: clotting-fibrinolisis factors (factor V, VII, VIII; C and S protein, plasminogen tissular activator (t-PA) and inhibitor of plasminogen activator (PAI-1); g) d-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin III complex; h) basic biochemical profile and hemograma; i) Pulmonary artery obstruction index.</detailed_description>
