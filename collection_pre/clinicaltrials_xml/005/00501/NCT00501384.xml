	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the optimal dose or range of doses of SR121463B for the reduction in recurrence of ascites, when used concomitantly with a standard dose regimen of spironolactone. The secondary objective was to determine the tolerability of different fixed doses of SR121463B in cirrhotic ascites, over a 12-week treatment period. This SPA study is followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, 40 weeks long-term safety extension (ExSPA). The first extension is followed by another long-term study (PASCCAL-1).</brief_summary>
