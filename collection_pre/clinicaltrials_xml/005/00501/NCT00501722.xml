	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the optimal dose or range of doses of SR121463B for the treatment of ascites and the correction of hyponatraemia when used concomitantly with a standard dose regimen of spironolactone. The secondary objective is to determine the tolerability of different fixed doses of SR121463B over a 14 day treatment period in cirrhotic ascites. This Hypo~CAT study is followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, one-year long-term safety extension (Expo~CAT). The first extension is followed by another long-term study (PASCCAL-1).</brief_summary>
