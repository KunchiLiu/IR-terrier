	<brief_summary>To date, there is a paucity of research focusing on maternal breastfeeding goals, how these goals may change after an unexpected event such as a preterm birth, and how mothers of ill and preterm infants define breastfeeding success. No studies were identified that focused exclusively on the breastfeeding goals of mothers of hospitalized preterm infants The purpose of this study is to answer the following research questions: 1) What are the breastfeeding goals of mothers with preterm infants in the NICU? and 2) What are mothers' perceptions of facilitators and barriers to meeting their breastfeeding goals in the NICU?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitation and Barriers to Breastfeeding in the NICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the objective of this study is to describe the breastfeeding goals of mothers and their perceptions of breastfeeding support in the NICU, this study will follow a descriptive, qualitative design. Mothers of preterm newborns in the Royal Victoria Hospital will participate in a semi-structured interview about their breastfeeding goals and what they perceived to be facilitators and barriers to achieving their intended goals. During the interviews, the mothers will be asked a set of socio-demographic questions, open-ended questions about their breastfeeding goals, and open-ended questions about their perceptions of barriers and facilitators to meeting these goals in the NICU Participants may also receive one follow-up phone call to clarify their responses to the questions or to validate the information obtained from the interview.</detailed_description>
