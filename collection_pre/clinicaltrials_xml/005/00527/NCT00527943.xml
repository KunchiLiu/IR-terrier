	<brief_summary>The study is designed to determine whether vorapaxar, when added to the existing standard of care (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) for preventing heart attack and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome, will yield additional benefit over the existing standard of care in preventing heart attack and stroke. The study is also designed to assess risk of bleeding with vorapaxar added to the standard of care versus the standard of care alone.</brief_summary>
