	<brief_title>Renal Effects of Levosimendan in Patients Admitted With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term "cardiorenal syndrome" has been applied to the presence or development of a renal dysfunction in HF patients and may be the major precipitant of decompensation and cause for admission in these patients. The renal hypoperfusion that occurs with cardiac injury can lead to sodium and water retention and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and neurohormonal pathways with resultant deleterious effects on the myocardium. A vicious cycle may then ensue and be associated with increased cardiovascular complications. In this regard, renal dysfunction is of a functional nature and thus means to intervene with this vicious cycle need to be sought. Several studies already demonstrated the deleterious effects of renal dysfunction on prognosis in patients with HF due to chronic left ventricular dysfunction. Levosimendan increases myocardial contractility without significant changes in the intracellular calcium ion and cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations and does not enhance myocardial oxygen demand. By its action on the potassium channels this drug also dilates the coronary and peripheral arteries and exerts an anti-ischemic,anti-stunning effect. To date, the effects of levosimendan on renal function in patients with worsening chronic HF, remain unknown.</detailed_description>
