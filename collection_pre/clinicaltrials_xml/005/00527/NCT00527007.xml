	<brief_summary>The rapidity of the resolution of cardiovascular failure has a strong impact on septic shock patients' outcome. The aim of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is to determine whether external cooling might accelerate improvement in cardiovascular function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>External Cooling in Septic Shock Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffering from septic shock need fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy for restoring cardiovascular function. Corticosteroids and activated protein C have been both proposed for vascular tone improvement. While external cooling is largely used in ICU febrile patients, benefits and risks of fever treatment during sepsis have been rarely studied. Surveys show that external cooling is usual care applied by nurses themselves without medical order. The control of thermal balance might decrease cardiac output and oxygen consumption, and reduce serum lactate concentration. However some animal studies have suggested that fever might be essential for host defence. This trial compares two strategies of fever management on vasopressor dependence in septic shock patients. In the treatment group, external cooling is applied to normalize the body temperature between 36째5 C and 37째C, while control patients receive any fever treatment. The goal for mean arterial pressure is the same in the two groups and vasopressor withdrawal is determined by similar algorithm.</detailed_description>
