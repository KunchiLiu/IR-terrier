	<brief_title>Evaluation of SAFER Latinos' Program to Prevent Youth Violence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To prevent youth involvement in violence, outreach workers will work with families and youth to improve school bonding, family cohesion and awareness and utilization of existing services; and a youth drop-in center will provide youth with an adult supervised place to "hang out", do homework, or participate in sports and job training. Following implementation of the intervention, we will collect detailed process data (regarding implementation), and evaluate impact/outcome using a quasi-experimental design with baseline (prior to intervention) and two followup data collections in both the intervention and a control community (Culmore, Virginia), measuring change in a selected set of aggregate community variables that represent mediating factors and outcomes for youth violence in Langley Park. Data will be collected via a survey and focus groups.</detailed_description>
