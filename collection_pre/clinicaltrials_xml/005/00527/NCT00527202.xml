	<brief_summary>Objectives : to investigate the analgesic effects and safety of intradermal botulinum toxin A injection in the treatment of focal painful neuropathies (eg, postherpetic neuralgia, nerve trauma)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Botox to Treat Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be randomized, performed in parallel group and double blind versus saline and will include 30 patients. Botulinum toxin injection will be injected intradermally in the painful area (one single injection) following a method adapted from that used in hyperhidrosis. The patients will be followed for 6 months after the injection. Primary outcome will be self-reported pain from the patients diaries. Secondary outcomes will be neuropathic symptoms, quality of life, allodynia to brush and pressure, detection and pain thresholds, proportion of responders, pain relief and clinical global impression. Clinical assessment will take place before injection then at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.</detailed_description>
