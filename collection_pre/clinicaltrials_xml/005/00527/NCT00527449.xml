	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to optimize results in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of local advanced primary breast cancer. Therefore patients become first 3 cycles of Epirubicin/Docetaxel followed by 3x Carboplatin/Docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Primary Breast Cancer With Epirubicin/Docetaxel and Carboplatin/Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are in the situation that an operation is possible. Using a neoadjuvant therapy the rate of breast-conserving surgery can be extended and tumor cell proliferation may be inhibited. Further the neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an in-vivo-activity-test for the used drugs. Epirubicin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin have shown antineoplastic activity against solid cancer alone and in combination. Using two different combinations of these three drugs, first 3 cycles Epirubicin/Docetaxel and then changing to Carboplatin/Docetaxel for 3 further cycles it is assumed that the results of the therapy will improve. Main criterion is the determination of pCR, second criteria are the rate of breast-conserving surgery, tumor response and therapy-dependent toxicities.</detailed_description>
