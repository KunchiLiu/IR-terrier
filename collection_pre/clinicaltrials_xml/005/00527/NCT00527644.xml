	<brief_summary>The Visu-Loc spring clip is being used to occlude the cystic duct at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A HIDA scan will be completed on post operative day one to check for biliary leaks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Spring-Type Laparoscopic Clip Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective the Visu-Lock clip is at preventing leakage of bile (liquid made by liver and stored in gall bladder) after gallbladder surgery. It is not known if the Visu-Lock clip stops leaks better than other clips that have been used during gallbladder surgery. Null hypothesis: There is no difference in subclinical or clinical leak rate between spring and crush clips used for cystic duct ligation. Alternative hypothesis: Titanium spring clips decrease the rate of subclinical or clinical biliary leak from the cystic duct stump after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</detailed_description>
