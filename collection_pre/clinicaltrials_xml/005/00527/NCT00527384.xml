	<brief_summary>Physiological changes can occur from different types of stress as induced by an infection, an environmental toxicant exposure, or an emotional disturbance. The stress-induced effects can modify health by lessening defense mechanisms as maintained by the immune system. The ability of different forms of stress to alter physiological processes (body functions) will be assessed by monitoring the blood profile of cell numbers and functions as well as the plasma protein content. It is anticipated that the pattern of blood changes will reflect the types of stress and the degree to which body functions could be altered by the stress.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood will be collected from patients with an ongoing infection that has lead to sepsis (systemic inflammation) as a index of major stress. The blood will be analyzed for the types of proteins that could alter immune system functions and affect organ functions, including cardiovascular effects due to blood vessel changes. This will be followed by analysis of stress effects on mice and mice that have been generated with human immune cells. The ability of stress to alter blood patterns will also be examined in mice with genetic modification of metallothionein expression, which is believe to influence oxidative stress.</detailed_description>
