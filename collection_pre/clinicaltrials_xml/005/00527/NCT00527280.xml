	<brief_title>Face Reconstruction by Allotransplantation of Composite Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most facial defects can be reconstructed with autologous tissues using standard plastic surgical techniques. However, when the circular facial muscles (eg. orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris) are destroyed by burns, ballistic traumas, tumors, or congenital deformities there are no conventional surgical solutions. The study was designed following the advice of the French National Ethics Advisory Committee for life sciences and health (CCNE). The objectives are to study the feasibility and efficacy of face CTA transplantation, functional results, and influence on quality-of-life, as well as the management of immunosuppression.</detailed_description>
