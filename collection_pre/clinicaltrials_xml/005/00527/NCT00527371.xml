	<brief_summary>In patients with an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia), is treatment using photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP 120 Watt) as effective and cost-effective as the standard treatment of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)? A higher-power (120W) laser system has recently been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. This system, which uses laser energy to vaporize the prostate tissue, will be compared with the current standard treatment of transurethral resection of the prostate. This newer generation laser may offer more efficient removal of prostate tissue with fewer complications and may result in clinical and economic benefits compared to the standard treatment. However, there have been no studies comparing the 120W laser with the standard transurethral resection of the prostate. This study will provide currently unavailable information for clinicians and decision makers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PVP Compared to TURP for the Treatment of Benign Hyperplasia of the Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following a review of treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC), the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) recommended that "a registry study be conducted to establish longer term effectiveness and complication rates for PVP given the likelihood of increasing diffusion of this technology". Since then, the Medical Devices Bureau of the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, has licensed in April 30, 2007, a 120W-KTP laser system (Greenlight HPS (TM)) for sale in Canada. As several new 120W systems will be operating in Ontario in the coming months, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and durability of 120W PVP compared to conventional TURP in the treatment of patients with BPH.</detailed_description>
