	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well partial breast radiation therapy works in treating women undergoing breast-conserving therapy for early stage breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial Breast Radiation Therapy in Treating Women Undergoing Breast-Conserving Therapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from partial breast irradiation using two different techniques. - To determine patient satisfaction with partial breast irradiation as it pertains to their overall treatment experience as measured by a questionnaire. - To determine if there are patient factors that limit a patient's suitability to receive partial breast irradiation delivered by a particular technique. - To evaluate wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast irradiation. - To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence rates. OUTLINE: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation comprising either MammoSite® brachytherapy twice daily for 5-10 days OR 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily for 5-10 days. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
