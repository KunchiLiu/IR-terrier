	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel and prednisone together with or without cediranib works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving docetaxel together with prednisone, with or without cediranib, may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Prednisone With or Without Cediranib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond to Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate of patients with hormone refractory metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with docetaxel and prednisone with vs without cediranib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety profile of cediranib, docetaxel, and prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. To determine the duration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and PSA control in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with cediranib, docetaxel, and prednisone. III. To determine the partial and complete response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with cediranib, docetaxel, and prednisone. IV. To determine time to progression in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with cediranib, docetaxel, and prednisone. V. To determine overall survival in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. VI. To perform correlative marker studies measuring serum levels of VEGF, PDGF, sICAM, bFGF, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8. VII. To perform a pilot study of [F18]FMAU positron emission test (PET) imaging on patients receiving cediranib, docetaxel, and prednisone. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating institution. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive oral cediranib once daily on days 1-21, docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, and oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-21. ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel and prednisone as in arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Archival paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or slides from time of diagnosis (or subsequent, but prior to therapy) are evaluated for expression of molecular targets relevant to this study. Blood specimens from baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and after completion of study treatment are analyzed for protein markers. Samples are analyzed by ELISA and IHC for angiogenesis-associated plasma proteins, plasma levels of VEGF, tumor expression of PDGFR, and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 plasma levels. Patients also undergo positron emission test (PET) scans utilizing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) at baseline and after course 1. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 52 weeks.</detailed_description>
