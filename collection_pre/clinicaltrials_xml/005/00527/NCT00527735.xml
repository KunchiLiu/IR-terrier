	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed lung cancer (Stage IIIb/IV nonsmallcell lung cancer or extensive stage smallcell lung cancer [SCLC]) Measurable tumor lesion (as long as it is not located in a previously irradiated area) as defined by modified World Health Organization criteria Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤1 at study entry Accessible for treatment and followup Brain metastases Malignant pleural effusion Autoimmune disease Motor neuropathy of autoimmune origin SCLCrelated paraneoplastic syndromes Any concurrent malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer; carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast; or prostate cancer treated with systemic therapy (participants with a previous malignancy but without evidence of disease for 5 years were allowed to enter the study) Prior systemic therapy for lung cancer. Prior radiation therapy or locoregional surgeries performed later than at least 3 weeks prior to randomization date were allowed. Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (motor or sensory) Known HIV or hepatitis B or C infection Chronic use of immunosuppressants and/or systemic corticosteroids (used in the management of cancer or noncancerrelated illnesses). However, use of corticosteroids was allowed if used as premedication for paclitaxel infusion or for treating immunerelated adverse events or adrenal insufficiencies. Inadequate hematologic function defined by an absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,500/mm^3, a platelet count &lt;100,000/mm^3, or hemoglobin level &lt;9 g/dL. Inadequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level &gt;2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≥2.5 times the ULN if liver metastases are present, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels ≥2.5 times the ULN or ≥5 times the ULN if liver metastases are present. Inadequate renal function defined by a serum creatinine level ≥2.5 times the ULN Inadequate creatinine clearance defined as less than 50 mL/min.</criteria>
