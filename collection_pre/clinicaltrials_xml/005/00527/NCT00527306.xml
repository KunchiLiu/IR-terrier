	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out if taking a multivitamin daily can affect the number of canker sores that people get and how long they last. Previous studies have shown that people who get canker sores are more likely to be deficient in one or more vitamins. It has also been found that correction of such vitamin deficiencies reduces the number and duration of canker sores. However, it is not known if taking a multivitamin daily will reduce the number and duration of canker sores.</brief_summary>
