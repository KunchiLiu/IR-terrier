	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that teriparatide is superior to the active comparator in the change from baseline to 18 months of lumbar spine volumetric trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in males with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a multinational, European, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator controlled study with 2 study periods: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, and an open-label treatment phase of 18 months. Approximately 100 adult men with osteoporosis associated with sustained glucocorticoid therapy will be enrolled into the study. Approximately one-half of the participants (at all investigational sites) will be randomized to teriparatide 20 micrograms/day (ug/day given as a subcutaneous (sc) injection), and the other half randomized to risedronate 35 milligrams (mg) once weekly (QW) oral (po) tablet. All participants will receive approximately 1000 mg/day elemental calcium and 800 to 1200 international units per day (IU/day) of vitamin D.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ambulatory men 25 years of age and older presenting to Visit 1 with a bone mineral density (BMD) of at least 1.5 standard deviation (SD) below the corresponding normal young adult men average BMD (T score of 1.5 or lower), as determined from the manufacturer's database at any of the following regions of interest: total hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine Have received glucocorticoid therapy at an average dose of at least 5.0 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone or its equivalent for a minimum of 3 consecutive months immediately preceding screening (Visit 1), as determined by medical history. A minimum of 2 lumbar vertebrae (L) in the L1 through L3 region must be evaluable by quantitative computerized tomography. Normal or clinically insignificant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the investigator) including serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1 84), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Presence of a mild, moderate, or severe spinal fracture in both the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) and first lumbar vertebra (L1), as determined by the central reading facility using the semiquantitative technique. Abnormal albumincorrected serum calcium levels History of unresolved skeletal diseases that affect bone metabolism other than glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis History of malignant neoplasms in the 5 years prior to Visit 2, with the exception of superficial basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have been definitively treated. Increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma; this includes patients with Paget's disease of the bone, previous primary skeletal malignancy, or skeletal exposure to therapeutic irradiation. Abnormal thyroid function not corrected by therapy Past and/or current treatment with certain medications.</criteria>
