	<brief_title>Communication and Intimacy-Enhancing Therapy for Men With Early Stage Prostate Cancer and Their Partners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomized clinical trial evaluating communication and intimacy-enhancing intervention (CI) vs usual care (UC). - To collect descriptive information and basic psychometrics on proposed study measures. - To gather preliminary data regarding the impact of CI on couples' psychosocial adaptation, relationship closeness, and sexual intimacy in order to calculate power for a larger full scale trial. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I: Patients and their partners receive communication and intimacy-enhancing intervention (CI) once a week comprising the following five 90-minute sessions: Rationale and Overview; Basic Communication; Intimacy and Sexuality; Improving Intimacy; and Reflecting on Changes and Cancer Survivorship. - Arm II: Patients and their partners receive standard psychological and emotional care (usual care [UC]) (i.e., social work consultations and referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist, if requested or deemed necessary by the attending physician). Physical impairment, psychological adjustment, relationship closeness, relationship communication, sexual function and satisfaction, male self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, intervention evaluation, and erectile dysfunction treatment utilization, and referral are assessed at 1 week post-intervention or at 6-8 weeks post baseline and then at 3 months (for patients and their partners in arm I) and at 8 weeks post-baseline and then at 3 months (for patients and their partners in arm II). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients and 50 partners will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
