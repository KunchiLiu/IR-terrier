	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess: - TBE antibody persistence 24, 34, 46 and 58 months (as applicable) after the first booster TBE vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml given in Study 223, by means of ELISA (IMMUNOZYM FSME IgG) and Neutralization test (NT), - TBE antibody response to a second booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml in the present study, by means of ELISA and NT, - Safety of FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml after the second booster vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who participated in Study 223 will be eligible for participation in this study if: they understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions and provide written informed consent they received the first booster vaccination with FSMEIMMUN 0.5ml during the course of study 223 blood was drawn after their first booster vaccination in Study 223. Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they: received any TBE vaccination since their first booster vaccination with FSMEIMMUN 0.5ml have a history of infection with or vaccination against other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese Bencephalitis) since their first booster vaccination with FSMEIMMUN 0.5ml are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of the study) since their first booster vaccination with FSMEIMMUN 0.5ml have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 liters wine / week or equivalent level of other alcoholic beverages). Subjects will not be eligible for booster vaccination if they: are not clinically healthy, (i. e. the physician would have reservations vaccinating with FSMEIMMUN 0.5ml outside the scope of a clinical trial) suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence immunological functions are females of childbearing potential and are pregnant or breastfeeding before the booster vaccination (positive pregnancy test result at the medical examination before the booster vaccination) have shown an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since their first booster vaccination in Study 223 are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including administration of an investigational product within six weeks prior to the booster vaccination until the end of the study do not agree to keep a Subject Diary. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria, but have a febrile illness (body temperature &gt;= 38.0Â°C, measured orally) at the scheduled time of vaccination, will not be vaccinated until their body temperature returns to normal. Subjects who have been administered any vaccination within 2 weeks prior to the booster vaccination will not be vaccinated until an interval of two weeks has passed. If subjects have received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the scheduled time of vaccination, the vaccination should be performed at a later time. If a subject had a tickbite within 4 weeks of the scheduled booster vaccination, the vaccination shall be delayed such that an interval of 4 weeks has passed since the tickbite in order to avoid any interference with diagnostic assays in the event of a TBE infection. If a subject has donated blood or plasma or has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 4 weeks of the scheduled booster vaccination, the vaccination shall be delayed until an interval of 4 weeks has passed.</criteria>
