	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To determine whether fatigue improves as patients are treated for febrile neutropenia (Day #1, Day #2 and Day #6). Secondary Objectives: - To identify clinical factors associated in cancer patients with low risk for outpatient treatment of febrile neutropenia on either outpatient febrile neutropenia treatment pathway presenting with moderate to severe fatigue. Moderate fatigue is defined as a score of 4 through 6 on the Brief Fatigue Inventory and severe fatigue is defined as a score of 7 through 10 on the Brief Fatigue Inventory. - To describe demographic information in cancer patients with low risk for outpatient treatment of febrile neutropenia and fatigue while enrolled in either of two outpatient febrile neutropenia treatment pathways.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Cancer patients with solid tumors at low risk for outpatient treatment of febrile neutropenia evaluated in the EC and enrolled in outpatient febrile neutropenia pathways (pathway 1 or 2). Low risk is defined as hemodynamically stable solid tumor patients that do not have pneumonia or are on steroids. Febrile neutropenia is marked by a temperature greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees Celsius and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than or equal to 1000 within 24 hours. 2. Patients must be able to speak, read and write in English. 3. Patients must be able to complete the required survey tools independently. 4. Patients must report a moderate to severe fatigue level to question # 3 of the BFI( 4 or greater on a 010 scale) on EC admission day. 5. Pregnant women if they meet eligibility criteria of the NF pathway and are able to take the oral/IV antibiotic prescribed by th pathway. 6. Patient must be greater or equal to 18 years of age. 1) Patients will be excluded from the study if they are not on the neutropenic pathway at the time of study entry.</criteria>
