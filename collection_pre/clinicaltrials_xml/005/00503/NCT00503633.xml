	<brief_title>Biomarkers of Insomnia and Fatigue in HIV/AIDS (Symptoms and Genetics Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will characterize insomnia subtypes and identify genetic markers and metabolic parameters associated with these subtypes. The results will be useful in later developing interventions to improve sleep, reduce fatigue, and thereby enhance the quality of life of HIV-infected persons. A cross-sectional sample of 350 subjects will be recruited to describe relationships between biomarkers and insomnia subtypes. The initial assessment will include: - wearing a wrist actigraph for 72 hours - providing a fasting blood sample - measuring blood pressure, height, weight, neck, waist, hip, and thigh - completing questionnaires - urine screening Depending on the results of the initial assessment, approximately 200 subjects will be followed every month by telephone to assess symptoms and every 3 to 6 months with study visits similar to the initial assessment. Findings from this longitudinal part of the study will characterize the development of insomnia, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness over time in patients living with HIV.</detailed_description>
