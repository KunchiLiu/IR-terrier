	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with bevacizumab and gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with bevacizumab and gemcitabine works as first-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation, Bevacizumab, and Gemcitabine as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination regimen of gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (Abraxane®), and bevacizumab as first-line treatment for Her2/neu-negative metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer. Secondary - To determine the partial, complete, and overall response rate. - To determine the safety and side effect profile of the treatment combination. - To explore the relationship between circulating tumor cells (CTC) and disease progression, by measuring CTC at baseline and over the course of treatment. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes followed by paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (Abraxane®) IV over 30 minutes followed by bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection periodically for correlative laboratory studies. Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC) expression by antibody immunostaining. Blood samples are analyzed for the presence of circulating tumor cells by the CellSearch™ system. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
