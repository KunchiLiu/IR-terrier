	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to learn more about how we measure depression in elderly cancer patients (patients aged 70 and older). Depression is one of the most common causes of emotional distress in the elderly and continues to be under-recognized. This is a problem because depression can have a negative impact on quality of life. The symptoms of depression are linked to poor health outcomes and higher costs of health care. In fact, depression is one of the top five concerns facing the elderly today.</brief_summary>
