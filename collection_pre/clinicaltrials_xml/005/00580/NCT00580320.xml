	<brief_summary>Bortezomib will enhance the activity of dacarbazine against melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Weekly administration of the combination will prove to be feasible and tolerable at an appropriate dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Dacarbazine and Bortezomib in Melanoma and Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to determine recommended phase II doses for the combination dacarbazine and bortezomib administered weekly. Secondary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose combination and to observe anti-tumor activity in terms of response rate(s), duration of response, time to progression, and time on treatment (a measure of both antitumor activity and treatment tolerance).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis of cutaneous or mucosal melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma (STS), or an APUD (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) tumor. APUD tumors include parathyroid carcinoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, small cell carcinoma of the lung, pheochromocytoma, islet cell tumors, carcinoid tumors, and malignant paraganglioma. Measurable or evaluable disease not appropriate for resection and/or radiation with curative intent. Patients with small cell carcinoma must have extended stage disease or, if limited stage disease, must have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Age 18 years or greater ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1 Women must be postmenopausal, infertile as the result of a surgical procedure, or willing to use a medically accepted form of birth control (abstinence, hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condon with spermicide) for the duration of study treatment. Men also must agree to use a medically accepted form of birth control for the duration of study treatment. Uncontrolled brain metastatic disease Platelet count &lt;100 Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5 Blood transfusion or hematopoietic growth factors for cytopenia within one month of enrollment. Calculated or measured (Cockcroft and Gault formula) creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/minute AST &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal, unless elevation due to metastatic disease, in which case AST &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal Bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/mL Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, mannitol, or dacarbazine Pregnant or nursing Other investigational drugs within 14 days of enrollment Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigator/subinvestigator might compromise the objectives of the study</criteria>
