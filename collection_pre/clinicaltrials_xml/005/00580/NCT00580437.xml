	<detailed_description>Although there is an increasing quantity of data demonstrating the value of stress echo in risk stratifying patients for cardiac risk prior to major non-cardiac surgery, the current clinical practice utilized for assessing patients being evaluated for kidney or pancreas transplantation is both a stress echocardiogram and a coronary angiogram. This gap in opinion appears to be a concern on the part of both nephrologists, endocrinologists, and surgeons that the stress echocardiogram may miss significant angiographic disease that could result in major post-operative complications in this high-risk subgroup of patients (unstable angina, non-fatal infarction, or death).</detailed_description>
