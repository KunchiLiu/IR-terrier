	<brief_summary>People who aspirate after neurologic insults such as stroke often develop fatal pneumonia. This study examines the effects of dynamic vocal cord closure on swallowing. Implants placed over the chest wall are connected to electrodes placed around the nerve that closes the vocal cords. The patient triggers closure by flipping the switch of a coil taped over the skin covering the internal stimulator. Vocal cord motion is verified by videotaping through an endoscope, and the status of swallowing is documented radiologically by a modified barium swallow.</brief_summary>
