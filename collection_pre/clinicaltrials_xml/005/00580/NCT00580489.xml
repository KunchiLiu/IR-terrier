	<brief_summary>The study is exempt from informed consent by the MetroHealth Medical Center institutional review board (IRB), because two standards of care are used and there is no increased clinical risk to the patient due to the study. The researchers randomize either fentanyl or morphine to be given to trauma patients and record how their pain scale is treated along with observing for adverse events. They are looking to see if the hypothesized benefits of fentanyl (which is much more expensive than morphine) actually exist.</brief_summary>
