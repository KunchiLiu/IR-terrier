	<brief_title>Prevalence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Women With Gynecologic Malignancy Planning to Undergo Surgical Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urgency, frequency, fecal incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction, is directly affected by gynecologic malignancies and the surgical and medical management of those malignancies. Increased risk of injury to the urinary tract is a recognized complication of surgical and medical therapy of gynecologic malignancies. To date, only a few studies have looked at the incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms at the time of diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy and prior to treatment, and there have been no published studies describing the incidence of sexual dysfunction at the time of diagnosis and prior to therapy of gynecologic malignancies. However, sexual dysfunction has been described in patients with urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse and following surgery for incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.</detailed_description>
