	<brief_summary>To detect coronary artery disease by both coronary and carotid artery imaging and myocardial perfusion imaging using a new low mechanical index real time system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Coronary Stenosis With Intravenous Microbubbles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this clinical study will be to visualize both coronary and carotid arteries as well as detect myocardial perfusion following a routine intravenous injection of Definity (0.05-0.20 millimeters), Optison (0.1-0.4 millimeters) or PESDA (0.05-0.2 mL). Following these injections , we will attempt to Contrast Pulse Sequencing on the Siemens Acuson Sequoia system to image both the coronary and carotid arteries, as well as the Myocardial perfusion.</detailed_description>
