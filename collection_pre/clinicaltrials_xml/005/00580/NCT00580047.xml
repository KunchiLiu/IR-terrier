	<brief_title>Effects of Zoledronic Acid Versus Alendronate on Bone Loss After Kidney and Kidney/Pancreas Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims are to determine baseline bone mineral density (BMD) in kidney and kidney/pancreas transplant patients who will be randomized to weekly alendronate, annual zoledronic acid infusions or placebo (calcium with Vitamin D). These patients will be followed for two years with annual bone density testing as well as biochemical markers. A secondary aim is to evaluate compliance and tolerability of taking annual intravenous zoledronic acid versus weekly alendronate in the transplant recipient.</detailed_description>
