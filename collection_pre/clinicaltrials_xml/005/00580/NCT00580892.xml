	<brief_summary>The researcher can use Optical coherence tomography a near-infrared diode to emit light that can produce images of the specimen under investigation and provide information about tissue abnormalities without causing damage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography of Airway and Pleural Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher can use Optical coherence tomography endoscopic imaging to improve diagnosis and treatment of airway and pleural malignancy. In the events of burn injury and smoke inhalation injury, the Optical coherence tomography can determine the change of the airway tissues and severity of airway injury. During endoscopic procedure the lesions will be biopsied and prepared by standard histologic methods. The Optical coherence tomography endoscopic imaging can measured histologic of the tissue samples and compared to standard histologic examination. The Optical coherence tomography endoscopic imaging can measured the epithelial thickness and compared to visual inspection of the mucosa on bronchoscopy.</detailed_description>
