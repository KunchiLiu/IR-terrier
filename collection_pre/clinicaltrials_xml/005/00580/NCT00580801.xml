	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and safety of telaprevir on Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 4, alone or in combination with standard therapy, that is, pegylated-interferon-alfa-2a and ribavirin in treatment-naive (never been treated before with antiretroviral therapy) participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study of Telaprevir in Treatment-Naive Participants With Chronic Genotype 4 Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2a, partially-blind, randomized (study drug assigned by chance) and multiple-dose study to evaluate the activity and safety of telaprevir on HCV early viral kinetics in treatment-naive participants who are chronically infected with HCV Genotype 4. The study consists of 4 parts: Screening period (6-week); Investigational Treatment period (consisting of 2-week treatment with telaprevir or telaprevir+standard treatment or placebo); Standard Treatment period (consists of 46 or 48-week standard treatment); and Follow-up period (24-week). The activity of telaprevir will be evaluated by early viral kinetic parameters along with viral response and pharmacokinetic assessments during the investigational treatment phase. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
