	<detailed_description>The objective of this proposal is to establish the validity of an Internet based protocol for real-time, remote, telefluoroscopic evaluation of oropharyngeal swallowing function. The investigators will achieve this goal by testing the hypothesis that oropharyngeal swallowing function evaluated by an experienced speech-language pathologist (SLP) using a remote, interactive, real-time, dynamic Internet telefluoroscopic procedure, which was developed in the PI's laboratory, has an acceptable level of agreement with the evaluations performed by an experienced SLP who is present in the fluoroscopy suite and using the traditional videofluoroscopic methodology. In other words, the primary aim of this investigation is to determine whether the telemedicine approach to evaluation of swallowing function is reliable relative to the traditional method by which a clinician is in direct contact with a patient for a pre-examination interview, clinical examination, and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing function. Confirmation of the reliability of the telefluoroscopic evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia (hereafter referred to as dysphagia) can result in equity of access for underserved groups for whom SLPs with expertise in evaluating swallowing function are locally unavailable. Ultimately, the success of this project could translate specialty services into routine clinical practice across the United States and globally.</detailed_description>
