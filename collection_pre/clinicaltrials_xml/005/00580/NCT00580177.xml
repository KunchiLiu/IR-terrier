	<brief_title>PHS, Lichtenstein Mesh, and PerFixPlug for Primary Inguinal Hernia Repair - 3 Years Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dissection requirements differ between various methods for inguinal hernia repair, which may effect operation times, pain response and possibly recovery time. The objectives of this study were to establish if any differences concerning these aspects could be detected after three principally different techniques for primary inguinal hernia repair. 472 men between 30 and 75 years with primary inguinal hernias were included in a prospective controlled study and randomised to Lichtenstein mesh (L), PerFix Plug® (P) or the Prolene® Hernia System (PHS) procedure. All patients were seen and data were collected after 2 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years.</detailed_description>
