	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what effect taking cisplatin in combination with bevacizumab before surgery and then standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab after surgery will have on participants with Estrogen Receptor (ER) negative, Progesterone Receptor (PR) negative and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. Cisplatin is used to destroy cancer cells in many types of cancers, and has shown to be effective and have manageable side effects. Bevacizumab is an antibody, which is a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To prepare for surgery, a small "clip" will be placed into the tumor area so that the surgeon can locate the site of the tumor at the time of surgery. This is a standard procedure for breast cancer. - The study drugs will be given in four 3-week cycles (about 3 months). Participants will come into the clinic each day they receive study treatment intravenously. Cisplatin will be given on day one of the treatment cycle (once every 3 weeks) for four cycles. Bevacizumab will be given on day one of the treatment cycle for three cycles. - On day one of each 3-week cycle a physical exam, routine blood tests and urine test will be performed. 7-8 days after chemotherapy, blood tests and a hearing test will be performed. A preoperative study visit will take place 7-10 days before surgery and a physical exam, routine blood tests, Electrocardiogram (EKG) and an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast will be performed. - Surgery to remove the tumor will occur at least three weeks after the last dose of cisplatin and is considered standard of care. - Postoperative chemotherapy will begin at least three weeks after surgery. Everyone on the research study will receive four 2-week cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide plus bevacizumab. After the 8 weeks, the doctor will decide which of the following two treatment regimens the participant will receive: Bevacizumab for four 2-week cycles (once every two weeks) or; Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab for four 2-week cycles (once every two weeks). - At the end of the postoperative chemotherapy, the participant will return to the clinic for a medical history, physical exam, vital signs, performance status, routine blood tests, multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or Echocardiogram Scans, and a hearing test.</detailed_description>
