	<brief_summary>The objective is to evaluate whether once weekly subcutaneous (SC) injection of idrabiotaparinux sodium (biotinylated idraparinux) is at least as efficient to prevent clots in brain and in the other organs than oral international normalized ratio (INR) adjusted-dose warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The end of the study is defined by a common study end date for all participants, defined as 9 months (39 weeks) after the last participant randomized. All participants will receive oral warfarin (or matching placebo) and weekly SC injections of idrabiotaparinux sodium (or matching placebo) up to 6 months before the common study end date. All participants are expected to be treated for at least 6 months. All participants will have then an 6-month observational period after cessation of study treatment.</detailed_description>
