	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to allow patients to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for the treatment of dystonia. This is NOT a research study, but rather, a requirement by the FDA for humanitarian use of the deep brain stimulator device in the treatment of this rare disorder. Use of DBS for dystonia is approved for humanitarian use by the FDA in the treatment of chronic, intractable (drug refractory) dystonia, including generalized and segmental dystonia, hemidystonia, and cervical dystonia (torticollis) in patients 7 years or older. Thus, this proposal request authorization by the IRB to allow patients at VUMC to access this HUD therapy.</brief_summary>
