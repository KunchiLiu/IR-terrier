	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of smoking cessation medications on alcohol drinking. Following 7 days of medication pre-treatment to achieve steady state levels, participants complete a laboratory session assessing alcohol self-administration behavior and a cue reactivity session assessing their reactivity to alcohol-related cues. Subjects are maintained on study medication for 4 weeks after the laboratory session. The study is subdivided into three studies based on subject population. Study 1A enrolls heavy drinking smokers (tested under nicotine deprivation). Study 1B enrolls heavy drinking smokers (not tested under nicotine deprivation), non-daily smokers, and nonsmokers. Study 1C enrolls smokers (not tested under nicotine deprivation) and nonsmokers who meet criteria for alcohol use disorders. In Study 1A, volunteers are administered either varenicline (Chantix), bupropion (Zyban), or placebo. In Studies 1B and 1C, volunteers are administered either varenicline (Chantix) or placebo.</brief_summary>
