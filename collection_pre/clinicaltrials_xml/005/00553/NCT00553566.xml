	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Learning about the long-term effects of dietary, lifestyle, and environmental factors on the risk of cancer progression and recurrence may help the study of bladder cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how dietary, lifestyle, and environmental factors affect patients with early-stage bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary, Lifestyle, and Environmental Factors on Patients With Early-Stage Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To examine if common and potentially modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and environmental exposures affect the risk of recurrence and progression in bladder cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Detailed information will be collected about the patients' lifestyle and their exposure to risk factors associated with bladder cancer using semi-structured questionnaires. A baseline questionnaire will be administered at the time of diagnosis and will collect information about socio-demographics, environmental exposures, medical history, diet, health-related quality of life, and social support. Further questionnaires will be administered at regular follow-up visits to capture information relating to changes in exposure. A postal questionnaire will be used to collect historical information that may require the patient to check records or consult family or friends. Patients will also be asked to keep a 1-week food, fluid, and micturition diary. Patients continue to complete questionnaires at 3 months and then annually for up to 5 years.
