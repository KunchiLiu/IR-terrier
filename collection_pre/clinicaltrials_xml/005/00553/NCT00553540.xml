	<brief_title>A Randomized Prospective Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Orthopedic Spinal Supports in the Treatment of Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Back pain is a common and expensive medical condition. Although rarely life-threatening, back disorders are a major cause of pain, disability, and social cost affecting the quality of life in most patients. Although primary care providers routinely treat back pain, little is known about how often primary care providers manage occupation-related symptoms and how outcomes compare with other treatment modalities. Treatment outcomes utilizing a non-operative treatment paradigm have not been adequately studied. This paradigm consists of treating patients sequentially with analgesics, physical therapy, use of back supports, caudal epidural steroid injections, or surgical referral. The use of spinal supports as a complimentary treatment along with physical therapy and posture education is promising.</detailed_description>
