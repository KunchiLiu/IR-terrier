	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: A regimen of low dose of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin may be as effective as currently recommended regimen for chronic hepatitis C in HIV-coinfected patients. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of lower dose of pegylated interferon-α 2a (135 µg weekly) plus ribavirin and a shorter duration of treatment (20 weeks after achieving an undetectable plasmatic HCV-RNA)than the current recommended in patients with chronic hepatitis or compensated cirrhosis by hepatitis C virus, genotypes 2 or 3, in HIV-coinfected patients in real use conditions. Method: Phase IV, postautorization, open labelled multicenter trial with a planned duration of 118 weeks in which 71 patients from several hospitals of the Servicio Andaluz de Salud will be enrolled. The usual clinical and analytical follow up will be performed but additional blood samples will be obtained for determination of interferon and ribavirin plasma levels. The primary end point wall be a sustained virologic response (defined as an undetectable serum HCV-RNA after 24 weeks after the cessation of treatment). Likewise, rapid virological response (at 4 weeks of treatment), early virological response (at 12 weeks), and end of treatment response rates will be evaluated as well as their relationships with the plasma interferon an ribavirin concentrations determined by ELISA and HPLC, respectively. The safety and tolerability of the studied medications will be evaluated by means of clinical adverse events, physical examination and laboratory results.</brief_summary>
