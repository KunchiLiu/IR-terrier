	<brief_summary>Background: The best treatment of the patella during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is controversial. The implantation of a patellar component adds to the operation time and the costs of the operation.There is a huge variation as to whether the patella is resurfaced or not during TKA. Meta-analysis of prospective, randomised trials might indicate that patellar resurfacing reduces the risk of reoperation and anterior knee pain, but drawing firm conclusions is not possible and additional, high quality randomised trials are required. Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine whether ther is a difference between the two groups in knee pain, functions, patient satisfaction and quality of life after TKA.</brief_summary>
