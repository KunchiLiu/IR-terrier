	<brief_title>Study of Bevacizumab and Erlotinib in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no definite evidence of a superior therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in elderly patients. With the exception of one known study, single agent erlotinib has not been studied exclusively in the elderly and the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab has never been studied exclusively in the treatment naive elderly. This is an important population that needs less toxic therapies.</detailed_description>
