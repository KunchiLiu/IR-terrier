	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation with or without alemtuzumab followed by donor stem cell transplant to see how well it works in treating patients with immunodeficiency or other nonmalignant inherited disorders. Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, a monoclonal antibody such as alemtuzumab, and radiation therapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining abnormal cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine Phosphate, and Total-Body Irradiation Followed by a Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Immunodeficiency or Other Nonmalignant Inherited Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Improve donor chimerism levels in patients with inherited nonmalignant disorders undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen either through the addition of Campath (alemtuzumab) or a slightly higher dose of total-body irradiation (TBI). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Decrease the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) through use of marrow as the stem cell source and Campath. II. Assess disease response following HCT. III. Immune reconstitution following HCT. IV. Incidence of infections. V. Overall survival. VI. Percent of patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)33/CD19 donor chimerism &gt; 50%. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients with no life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1 month before the planned hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) receive alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) over 6 hours on day -10 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2. They also undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. Patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, or life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1 month before the planned HCT receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 and undergo 2 low doses of TBI on day 0. HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo HCT on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally (PO) 2-3 times daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a taper until day 180. They also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO 3 times daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 40 followed by a taper until day 96. After completion of HCT, patients are followed up at day 84, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-transplantation, and then once a year for 3 years.</detailed_description>
