	<brief_summary>This is a randomised, open label multicenter Phase III study comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant lapatinib plus paclitaxel, versus trastuzumab plus paclitaxel, versus concomitant lapatinib and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel given as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2/ErbB2 over-expressing and/or amplified primary breast cancer. Patients will be randomised to receive either: lapatinib 1500 mg daily, trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenous (IV) load followed by 2 mg/kg IV weekly, or lapatinib 1000 mg daily with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV load followed by 2 mg/kg IV weekly for a total of 6 weeks. After this biological window, patients on monotherapy arms will continue on the same targeted therapy plus weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 for a further 12 weeks, up to definitive surgery. In the combination arm, patients will receive lapatinib 750 mg daily in combination with trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV plus weekly paclitaxel 80mg/m^2 IV for a further 12 weeks, up to definitive surgery. After surgery, patients will receive three courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by the same targeted therapy as in the biological window of the neoadjuvant setting for a further 34 weeks (in the combination arm, lapatinib dose will be 1000 mg daily in combination with trastuzumab). The planned total duration of the anti-HER2 therapy will be one year.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female gender; Age ≥18 years; Performance Status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 01 Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer: Primary tumour greater than 2 cm diameter, measured by clinical examination and mammography or echography, Any N, No evidence of metastasis (M0) (isolated supraclavicular node involvement allowed); Over expression and/or amplification of HER2 in the invasive component of the primary tumour [Wolff et al 2006] and confirmed by a certified laboratory prior to randomisation Known hormone receptor status. Haematopoietic status: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,5 x 10^9/L, Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L, Hemoglobin at least 9 g/dl, Hepatic status: Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). In the case of known Gilbert's syndrome, a higher serum total bilirubin (&lt; 2 x ULN) is allowed, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN, Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN, Renal status: Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL, Cardiovascular: Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ³ 50% measured by echocardiography (ECHO) or Multiple Gate Acquisition (MUGA) scan, Negative serum pregnancy test, within 2weeks (preferably 7 days) prior to randomization (For women of childbearing potential) Fertile patients must use effective contraception (barrier method condoms, diaphragm also in conjunction with spermicidal jelly, or total abstinence. Oral, injectable, or implant hormonal contraceptives are not allowed) Signed informed consent form (ICF) Patient accepts to make available tumour samples for submission to central laboratory to conduct translational studies as part of this protocol Received any prior treatment for primary invasive breast cancer; Previous (less than 10 years) or current history of malignant neoplasms, except for curatively treated: Basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; Carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with a prior malignancy diagnosed more than 10 years prior to randomisation may enter the study. Patients must have been curatively treated with surgery alone. Radiation therapy or systemic therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine) are NOT permitted. Prior diagnoses of breast cancer or melanoma are excluded. Diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer; Bilateral cancer; This criterion has been deleted from the protocol Version 1. Patients with multifocal cancer are no longer excluded. Known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, clinically significant arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, transmural myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension (≥180/110), unstable diabetes mellitus, dyspnoea at rest, or chronic therapy with oxygen; Concurrent disease or condition that would make the subject inappropriate for study participation or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's safety; Unresolved or unstable, serious adverse events from prior administration of another investigational drug; Active or uncontrolled infection; Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prevent the understanding or rendering of ICF; Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel. Subjects with ulcerative colitis are also excluded; Concurrent neoadjuvant cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy other than the trial therapies); Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent or participation in another therapeutic clinical trial; Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to trastuzumab or lapatinib or their excipients; Pregnant or lactating women; Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers</criteria>
