	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bifurcation lesion is still one of the most challenging lesion subsets in the field of non-surgical treatment for a stenotic coronary artery. When one stent is placed in the main brach, it increases the side branch's stenosis degree. However, its mechanism and incidence are not known. This study will be performed to search for the mechanism and incidence of that phenomenon.</brief_summary>
