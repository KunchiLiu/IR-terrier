	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of selenium and vitamin E may stop cancer from growing or coming back. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving selenium together with vitamin E to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing cancer progression and recurrence in patients with early-stage bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selenium and Vitamin E in Preventing Cancer Progression and Recurrence in Patients With Early-Stage Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To investigate whether selenium and/or vitamin E (α-tocopherol) supplementation reduces the risk of recurrence and progression. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by recurrence risk group (high vs intermediate) and treatment center and randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily. - Arm II: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily. - Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily. - Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily. In all arms, treatment continues for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed every 6 months for 5 years.

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histopathologically confirmed nonmuscleinvasive transitional cell carcinoma (&lt; pT2) Newly diagnosed disease Able to be randomized within twelve months of diagnostic transurethral resection bladder tumor/biopsy Must meet 1 of the following recurrence risk criteria: Intermediate risk Multiple G1 pTa (&gt; 1) Solitary G1 pTa (≥ 3 cm) G2 pTa G1 pT1 G2 pT1 (1 or 2 tumors) High risk G3 pTa G3 pT1 Cis Multiple G2 pT1 (3 or more foci) Low risk Solitary G1 pTa &lt; 3 cm PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Not pregnant or breast feeding No HIV infection No condition that, in the opinion of the local investigator, might interfere with the safety of the patient or evaluation of the trial objectives PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No concurrent immunosuppressive therapy after organ transplantation No concurrent cyclosporine Those who currently use or have used selenium and/or vitamin E supplements will not be excluded, however, they must agree not to take supplements containing selenium and vitamin E above a prespecified dosage</criteria>
