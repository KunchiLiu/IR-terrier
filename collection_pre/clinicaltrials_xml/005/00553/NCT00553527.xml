	<detailed_description>The purpose of this prospective clinical data collection is to document the performance and clinical outcomes of Biomet Humeral Stems. All stems on which data will be collected are legally marketed and none of the devices are investigational or experimental. This data collection effort will document the clinical outcomes of the humeral stems. The data gathered will be collated and used to provide feedback to designing engineers, support marketing efforts, and answer potential questions from reimbursement agencies. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are within the indications and contraindications stated in the labeling, cleared by the FDA, for the device. Surgical techniques and patient care are to be standard for the surgeon participating in the protocol. There will be no experimental or investigational surgical techniques used.
