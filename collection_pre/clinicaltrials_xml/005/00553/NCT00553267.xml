	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that the fixed dose combination of telmisartan 40mg + amlodipine 10mg (T40/A10) or the fixed dose combination of telmisartan 80mg + amlodipine 10mg (T80/A10) is superior in reducing blood pressure at eight weeks compared with amlodipine 10mg monotherapy (A10) in patients who fail to respond to six weeks treatment with A10.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>diagnosis of essential hypertension and blood pressure not adequately controlled before informed consent (inadequate control defined as seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;= 95 mmHg if on existing antihypertensive treatment or seated DBP &gt;= 100 mmHg if treatmentnaïve). failure to respond to six weeks treatment with amlodipine 10mg. (Failure to respond defined as seated DBP &gt;= 90 mmHg.) able to stop any current antihypertensive therapy without unacceptable risk to the patient. willing and able to provide written informed consent. pregnancy, breastfeeding, unwilling to use effective contraception (if female of childbearing potential). known or suspected secondary hypertension. mean seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;=200 mmHg and/or mean seated DBP &gt;= 120 mmHg during runin treatment or mean seated SBP &gt;= 180 mmHg and/or mean seated DBP &gt;= 120 mmHg at the randomisation visit or at any time during randomised treatment. any clinically significant hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or post postrenal transplant. clinically relevant hyperkalaemia. uncorrected volume or sodium depletion. primary aldosteronism. hereditary fructose or lactose intolerance. symptomatic congestive heart failure. patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. history of drug or alcohol dependency within the six months prior to signing consent. concurrent participation in another clinical trial or any investigational therapy within thirty days prior to signing consent. hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aortic or mitral valve. known allergic hypersensitivity to any component of the formulations under investigation. (Includes known hypersensitivity to telmisartan or other ARBs or amlodipine or other dihydropyridine CCBs.) noncompliance with study medication (defined as less than 80% or more than 120%) during the openlabel runin treatment period. current treatment with any antihypertensive agents, whether or not prescribed for this indication, that cannot be safely stopped (investigator¿s decision) by the start of the runin period. chronic administration of any medication known to affect blood pressure, other than the trial medication. any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of telmisartan and amlodipine.</criteria>
