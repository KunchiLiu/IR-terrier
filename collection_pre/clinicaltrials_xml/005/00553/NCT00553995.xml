	<brief_summary>Physical inactivity induces vascular dysfunction and glucose intolerance during five days of bed rest. This study will investigate the effects of salsalate on these responses. Subjects will be randomized to treatment with salsalate or placebo for four days prior to initiation of bed rest. Vascular function in the brachial artery will be determined by ultrasound prior to treatment and before and after the 5-day bed rest protocol. We hypothesize that treatment with salsalate will be associated with protection again the development of glucose intolerance and vascular dysfunction in this setting.</brief_summary>
