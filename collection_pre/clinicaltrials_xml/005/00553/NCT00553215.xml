	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying quality of life in patients with bladder cancer may help determine the long-term effects of bladder cancer and may help improve the quality of life for patients in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying quality of life in patients with bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To study the effects of recurrence and progression on health-related quality of life (HRQL). - To study the effects of repeat cystoscopy on HRQL. - To study the patients' assessments of a hypothetical prognostic model and how this affects their preference for the mode of surveillance. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Quality-of-life questionnaires developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) will be used. The EORTC QLQ-BLS24 with 24 questions specific to non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and the EORTC QLQ-BLM30 with 30 questions specific to muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be combined and used in conjunction with the general cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30. Assessments using the QLQ-C30 will be made at baseline in the entire cohort of patients. Follow-up assessments using the QLQ-C30, QLQ-BLS24, and QLQ-BLM30 167 will be made at first routine follow-up and annually until the end of study.
