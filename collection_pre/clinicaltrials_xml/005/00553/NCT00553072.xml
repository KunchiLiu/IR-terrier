	<brief_summary>Magnesium sulphate has been shown to be neuroprotective. The investigators hypothesize that magnesium sulphate infusion given to babies with perinatal asphyxia should improve outcome in the immediate neonatal period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnesium Sulphate in Perinatal Asphyxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnesium sulphate has a neuroprotective potential as has been shown by many studied in pregnant ladies with eclampsia where it helped neonates also and in mothers with preterm labour where the incidence of cerebral palsy was less. We designed a randomised controlled trial on 40 neonates with severe perinatal asphyxia to see whether it helps in the short term outcome of these neonates.</detailed_description>
