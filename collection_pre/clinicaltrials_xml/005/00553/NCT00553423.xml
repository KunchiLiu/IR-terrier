	<brief_title>Lactulose for the Prevention of Hepatic Encephalopathy in Cirrhotic Patients With Upper Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Variceal hemorrhage occurs in 25 to 35 % of patients with cirrhosis and accounts for 80 to 90% of bleeding episodes in these patients. Around 25-30 percent of patients develop hepatic encephalopathy. Development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with gastrointestinal bleed can cause increase morbidity with higher hospital costs in these patients. To date no randomized trial has been done in terms of prevention of encephalopathy in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. One trial has compared lactulose in combination with antibiotic against mannite, showed equal efficacy in both groups. No study has been done evaluate the efficacy of lactulose in prevention of encephalopathy in these patients. We hypothesize that prophylactic use of Lactulose decreases the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy with upper GI bleed in cirrhotics.</detailed_description>
