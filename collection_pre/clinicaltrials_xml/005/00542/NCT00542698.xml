	<brief_title>Changing Physical Activity Behavior in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes Using Counceling and Information From Continuous Glucose Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes affects 20.8 million Americans and is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Although physical activity is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes, it is difficult to change physical activity behaviors and up to 60% of individuals with diabetes do not participate in regular physical activity. The use of a nurse counseling intervention based on established behavior change theory with technology-derived graphical representations of glucose information created a unique opportunity to test the feasibility of motivating people with type 2 diabetes to change physical activity behaviors. The consent form described the study protocol, participant expectations, benefits, risks, and the process of maintaining participant confidentiality.</detailed_description>
