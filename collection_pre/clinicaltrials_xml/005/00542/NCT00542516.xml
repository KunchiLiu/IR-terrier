	<brief_summary>Currently the most use solution to volemic reposition in hip replacement arthroplasty is the crystalloid solution. This trial intends to compare two different volemic replacements: HES and Ringer's lactate. This research has been analyzing hemodynamic parameters and the coagulation status before and after the pre-expansion with the solutions above mentioned.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial is randomized an blind to the physician who is analyzing the results.It has been select adults; both sex; ASA I and II. These patients must be submitted to hip arthroplasty replacement. The anesthesia technique is single shot spinal anesthesia. Primary endpoint: assessment alternative; technique replacement volemic with HES 130/04. Secondary endpoint: haemostatic abnormalities; blood loss; transfusion blood.</detailed_description>
