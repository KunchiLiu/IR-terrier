	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a severe lung condition that causes respiratory failure. Individuals with ALI/ARDS often require the use of a respirator or artificial breathing machine, known as a mechanical ventilator, while in an intensive care unit (ICU). Research has shown that lung protective ventilation (LPV), a type of mechanical ventilation technique, is an effective way to reduce the number of deaths due to ALI/ARDS. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a Web-based educational program that aims to educate ICU clinicians about the use of LPV in patients with ALI/ARDS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating a Web-Based Ventilator Management Educational Program for Clinicians (The Lung Injury Knowledge Network [LINK] Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS is a life-threatening condition that involves inflammation of the lungs and fluid accumulation in the air sacs, leading to low blood oxygen levels and respiratory failure. Common causes include pneumonia, septic shock, and lung trauma, and most patients require immediate care in an ICU. The main form of treatment for ALI/ARDS is the delivery of oxygen and a continuous level of pressure to the damaged lungs through mechanical ventilation. Each year, 74,500 people die due to ALI/ARDS and 22% of these deaths could be prevented with the use of LPV. LPV is a mechanical ventilation technique in which lower volumes of oxygen are administered. The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a Web-based educational program that will provide educational and instructional resources about ALI/ARDS and LPV to ICU clinicians, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. Hospitals participating in this study will be randomly assigned to access the Web site at either the beginning of the study period or a later time. Participating clinicians at each hospital will access the Web site as often as necessary for a 6-month period. The Web site will contain background and educational information on ALI/ARDS and LPV, including how to recognize ALI/ARDS and how to implement LPV in patients. Scholarly articles and other materials, including a chart to help clinicians determine appropriate ventilator settings for each patient, will be available to download. Clinicians will also be able to email questions to critical care experts. At the end of the 6-month study period, study staff will compare the number of patients receiving LPV to the number of patients who received LPV prior to the start of the study.</detailed_description>
