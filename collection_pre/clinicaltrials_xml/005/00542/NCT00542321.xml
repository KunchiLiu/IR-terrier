	<brief_summary>Intensive care unit (ICU) patients on respirators are at high risk for preventable pulmonary complications (PPC). Turning these patients from side to side may reduce PPC, but carries the burden of decreases in blood pressure and oxygenation. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in PPC or adverse events when ICU patients on respirators are turned by nurses or by an automated turning bed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Lateral Rotation Interventions for Efficacy and Safety in ICU Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of two turning protocols and study procedures for a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of horizontal positioning interventions to reduce pulmonary complications in mechanically ventilated critically ill adult patients. The hypothesis of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is no difference in pulmonary complications between manual, 2-hourly lateral rotation to &gt; 45 degrees (control), and continuous automated turning to 45 degrees (experimental) groups.</detailed_description>
