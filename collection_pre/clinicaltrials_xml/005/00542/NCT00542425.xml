	<criteria>Primary The patient has a bone mineral density Tscore â‰¤ 2.5 at the lumbar spine or hip (femoral neck) by dual energy xray absorptiometry (DXA). Women with a bone mineral density Tscore of 2.0 or lower and a prior lowtrauma forearm, humerus, vertebral, sacral, pelvic, hip, femoral, or tibial fracture within the past 5 years, or who have an additional risk factor such as age 65 or greater or a strong maternal history of osteoporosis defined as a fracture related to osteoporosis or osteoporosis itself as determined by BMD criteria, are also study candidates. The patient is in good general health as determined by medical history and physical examination and is without evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the opinion of the Investigator. Primary History of bone disorders (e.g., Paget's disease) other than postmenopausal osteoporosis. Prior treatment with approved or as yet unapproved boneacting investigational agents.
