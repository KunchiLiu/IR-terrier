	<brief_summary>PHASE: IV TYPE OF STUDY: With direct benefit. DESCRIPTIVE: Multicenter, randomized, open label study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of cyclosporine with infliximab in steroid- refractory attacks of ulcerative colitis. STUDY TREATMENTS:Cyclosporine 2mg/kg/day intravenous(IV)for 7days then Neoral 4mg/kg/day orally for 3 months. Infliximab 5mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2 and 6. NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 50 patients in each group i.e. a total of 100 patients. INCLUSION PERIOD: 24 months. STUDY DURATION: 27 months. MAIN EVALUATION CRITERIA: Clinical response at D7 according to the Lichtiger Index score AND Clinical Remission at D98 according to the Mayo Disease Activity Index score SECONDARY EVALUATION CRITERIA: Clinical remission at D98 (according to the Mayo Disease Activity Index score) Endoscopic response Colectomy rate Tolerance</brief_summary>
