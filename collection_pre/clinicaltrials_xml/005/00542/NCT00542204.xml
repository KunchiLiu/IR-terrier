	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a major, growing, and costly chronic disease in the U.S., and implementation of recommended diabetes care remains poor, not merely suboptimal, and varied for a sizable proportion of Americans with diabetes. To further reduce the treatment and adherence gaps in diabetes care, the researchers propose to evaluate a Customized, Continuous Care Management (CCCM) program that actively supports a partnership between the patient and his/her multidisciplinary care management (CM) team using an online disease management (ODM) system, which is integrated with a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) system that includes a personal health record and secure patient-clinician messaging capabilities. The CCCM program builds upon CM strategies proven effective in past studies and creates an ODM system that is built upon and fully integrated with a leading, commercially available EHR product - providing a blueprint for instituting customized, continuous care management for many different chronic conditions in a range of ambulatory care settings.</brief_summary>
