	<brief_title>Phase Ia Dose-Escalation Safety, Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Study of Imprime PGG™ Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of Imprime PGG versus placebo when administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the frequency, type, and severity of treatment emergent adverse events. The secondary objectives are: 1. to determine the pharmacodynamics of a single intravenous dose of Imprime PGG when administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the number of subjects who experience a 15% or more increase from baseline in the percentage of neutrophils with primed CR3; and 2. to derive the pharmacokinetic profile of a single intravenous dose of Imprime PGG when administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the plasma concentration of Imprime PGG versus time.</detailed_description>
