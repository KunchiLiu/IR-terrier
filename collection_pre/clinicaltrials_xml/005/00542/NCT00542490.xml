	<brief_title>Vaginal Cuff Brachytherapy Followed by Chemotherapy in Patients With Endometrioid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients must have undergone complete surgical staging including bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. All patients will receive radiation therapy. Treatment will be delivered either by LDR or HDR brachytherapy. The treatment plan must be started at the time of enrollment. The vaginal brachytherapy should be started within 4 weeks of surgery (within 2 weeks of enrollment), in order to avoid delays in initiation of systemic therapy, which should start on post-operative day 21. The dose will be prescribed to the vaginal (mucosal) surface as defined at the surface of the applicators. Following vaginal cuff radiation therapy, all patients will receive chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
