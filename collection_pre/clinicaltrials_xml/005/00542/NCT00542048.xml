	<brief_summary>The primary objective of study CT 4003 is to assess the behavior of EndoTAG®-1 in the body (making a so-called pharmacokinetic profile). Therefore, the course of the drug in the body is examined, i.e. the amount and speed of the drug uptake as well as the distribution and the elimination of the drug is being investigated. Further objectives of the study are to assess the effect of EndoTAG®-1 on liver metastases concerning size and blood supply measured by imaging techniques (contrast-enhanced ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging as well as duplex sonography) and to assess the effect on blood markers which are indicators for the destruction and neoplasm of blood vessels (so-called markers of angiogenesis).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics and Mode of Action of EndoTAG®-1 in Tumor Patients With Hepatic Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver metastases are among the most frequent neoplasms of the liver and represent a quite uniform clinical entity regardless from which carcinoma they originate. The treatment is dependent on number and size of the hepatic lesions but still, none of the therapeutic options leads to satisfying results. The growth of tumors and metastases is dependent on blood vessels, which supply the tumors and metastases with nutrients. Liver metastases, independent from which original tumor they come from, are especially well supplied with blood. The aim of the treatment with the investigational medicinal product EndoTAG®-1 is to target the blood vessels, which supply the metastases, and destroy them. Consequently, the metastases themselves will be damaged.</detailed_description>
