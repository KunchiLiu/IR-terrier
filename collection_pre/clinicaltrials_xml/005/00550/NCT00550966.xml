	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Psychoeducative Program for Improving Quality of Life in Fibromyalgic Patients [Study Protocol]</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most fibromyalgic patients are attended at primary care (PC). However, the effectiveness of the treatments prescribed by general practitioners is usually scarce. The main objective of the present research is to assess the efficacy of a structured psychoeducative intervention, combined with relaxation, developed to improve the quality of life of patients suffering fibromyalgia (FM). The second objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of this multimodal intervention.</detailed_description>
