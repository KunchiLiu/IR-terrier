	<criteria>At Screening Disease to be studied: Has a diagnosis of following disease as defined by DSMIVTR criteria. Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed（296.5x） Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode hypomanic（296.40） Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode manic（296.4x） The diagnosis of mood episode will be made with reference to Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview: M.I.N.I, Japanese Version. At Screening The subject who has a diagnose of bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed (296.5x) must meet the following criteria: Is currently experiencing a major depressive episode or has had a major depressive episode as defined by DSMIVTR criteria within 60 days of the screening visit and at least one additional major depressive episode and one manic or hypomanic episode, as defined by DSMIVTR criteria, within 3 years of enrolment. A well documented history of a mixed episode that meets DSMIVTR criteria may be counted as a previous episode.All subjects must have experienced at least one welldocumented manic or mixed episode in the past. Has a duration of the most recent/current depressive episode of at least 2 weeks but not longer than 12 months prior to enrolment. The subject without current major depressive episode must have a major depressive episode within 60 days of screening and has depressive symptoms at screening or is under treatment for depressive symptoms, which can be confirmed by medical record, etc. If the subject is currently experiencing a major depressive episode, the subject must have a minimum total score on the HAMD (17item scale) of 18 at the screening. This criterion will not apply to the subject with recent depressive episode. At Screening The subject who has a diagnose of bipolar I disorder, most recent episode hypomanic（296.4x） or bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic（296.5x） must meet the following criteria: Has experienced a recent manic or hypomanic episode (current or within 60 days of the Screening Visit) and has had at least one additional manic or hypomanic episode and one depressed episode, as defined by DSMIVTR criteria, within three years of enrolment. A well documented history of a mixed episode that meets DSMIVTR criteria may be counted as a previous episode. All subjects must have experienced at least one welldocumented manic or mixed episode in the past. Has a duration of the index manic episode of at least 1 week (unless hospitalised) or hypomanic episode of at least 4 days. In neither case should the index episode be more than 12 months in duration. The subject current experiencing hypomania episode or without current episode must have a manic episode which can be confirmed by medical record, etc. The subject without current episode must have a episode within 60 days of screening and has manic or hypomanic symptomatology is under treatment for manic or hypomanic symptoms. If the subject's index episode is subject initial manic mood event, subject must have a minimum score of 10 (moderate severity) on the first 11 items of the YMRS at the screening. A threshold YMRS score that indicates significant manic symptoms is not required for patients who previously experienced welldocumented DSMIVlevel mania or when the index episode is hypomania or when a subject's index manic or hypomanic episode is documented to have occurred within 60 days of the screening Visit. At Screening Age: Is at least 20 years of age (at the time of informed consent). At Screening Sex: either sex. Female of childbearing potential will be eligible for inclusion in this study. However they have to have a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit, agree to further pregnancy testing at the time points determined in study assessments and procedures and practice one of the following methods of contraception from the screening visit until the end of the followup examination. Abstinence Injectable progestogen Implants of levonorgestrel Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria as stated in the product label Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject Double barrier method: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical / vault caps) plus spermicidal agent (foam /gel / film / cream / suppository) At Screening In/Out patient: Either At Screening Informed consent: the subject capable of giving written informed consent. At Week 0 of First Phase (titration) If the subject is currently experiencing a major depressive episode, the subject must have a minimum total score at baseline on the HAMD (17item scale) of 18 at the start of First Phase. This criterion will not apply to the subject with recent depressive episode. At Week 0 of First Phase (titration) If the subject's index episode is subject initial manic mood event, subject must have a minimum total score at baseline of 10 (moderate severity) on the first 11 items of the YMRS at the start of First Phase (titration). A threshold YMRS score that indicates significant manic symptoms is not required for patients who previously experienced welldocumented DSMIVlevel mania or when the index episode is hypomania or when a subject's index manic or hypomanic episode is documented to have occurred within 60 days of the screening Visit. At Week 0 of Second Phase (maintenance therapy) Each subject completing 8 to 16 weeks of openlabel lamotrigine treatment in the First Phase must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for entry into the Second Phase (maintenance therapy, randomization phase). At Week 0 of Second Phase (maintenance therapy) Has no tolerability problem with lamotrigine at a minimum dosage of 100 mg/day during the final 2 weeks of the First Phase (titration). At Week 0 of Second Phase (maintenance therapy) Has improved/stabilised during the First Phase (titration) as indicated by a CGIS score of ≤3 (mildly ill).
