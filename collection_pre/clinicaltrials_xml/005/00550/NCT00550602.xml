	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate respiratory symptoms and their impact in the quality of life and after treatment of the respiratory condition (tracheobronchomalacia - TBM).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tracheobronchomalacia: Treatment Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TBM is an abnormal collapse of the tracheal and bronchial walls. It is characterized by flaccidity of the supporting tracheal and bronchial structures and a significant reduction of airway diameter on expiration seen in the trachea and/or in the mainstem bronchi. Currently there is no available data on the efficacy of central airway stabilization for treating TBM. Our study would provide this important information and would establish the effect of central airway stabilization on symptoms, functional status, quality of life, lung function and exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic and severe TBM.</detailed_description>
