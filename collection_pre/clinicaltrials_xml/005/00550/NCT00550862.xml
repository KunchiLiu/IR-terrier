	<criteria>Male or female age 18 to 70 years. Stable dose of ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO, UDCA) for at least 6 months prior to screening. Female patients must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or prepared to use 2 methods of contraception with all sexual partners during the study and for 14 days after the end of dosing. Male patients must be prepared to use 2 methods of contraception with all sexual partners during the study and for 14 days after the end of the dosing. Proven or likely PBC, as demonstrated by the patient presenting with at least 2 of the following 3 diagnostic factors: 1. History of increased AP levels for at least 6 months prior to Day 0 2. Positive AMA titer (&gt;1:40 titer on immunofluorescence or M2 positive by ELISA) or PBCspecific antinuclear antibodies (antinuclear dot and nuclear rim positive) 3. Liver biopsy consistent with PBC. Screening AP value between 1.5 and 10 × ULN. Administration of the following drugs at any time during the 3 months prior to screening for the study: colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic corticosteroids. Screening conjugated (direct) bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN. Screening ALT or AST &gt;5 × ULN. Screening serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL (133 mol/L). History or presence of hepatic decompensation (e.g., variceal bleeds, encephalopathy, or poorly controlled ascites). History or presence of other concomitant liver diseases including hepatitis due to hepatitis B or C virus (HCV, HBV) infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), alcoholic liver disease, definite autoimmune liver disease or biopsy proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
