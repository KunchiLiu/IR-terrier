Diagnosis of any other inflammatory arthritis (eg, spondyloarthropathies); or a noninflammatory arthritis or musculoskeletal condition (eg, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia) that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with clinical assessments. Evidence of active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Use of etanercept, anakinra, or oral DMARDs with the exception of methotrexate, within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Use of biological DMARDs within the 8 (adalimumab or infliximab) or 12 (abatacept) or 56 (rituximab) weeks prior to enrollment.
