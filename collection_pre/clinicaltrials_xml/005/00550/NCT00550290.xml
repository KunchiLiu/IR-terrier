	<brief_title>Prophylactic Antibiotics for Prevention of Wound Complications Following Vulvectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infectious morbidity in gynecologic oncology has not been thoroughly investigated to date. Included in the literature are several studies that highlight substantial numbers of post-surgical infectious complications. Specifically among patients undergoing radical vulvectomy, the incidence of post-operative wound complication is as high as 58%. Surgery is the treatment of choice for vulvar cancer, but few studies establish protocols or management strategies to prevent the complications of post-operative wound infection and breakdown. This proposed randomized prospective study would specifically investigate the efficacy of a 24 hour post-operative course of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics - namely Cefazolin - in preventing wound infection and wound breakdown following vulvectomy. This same regimen has been described by a leader in the field of gynecology in his text - TeLinde's Operative Gynecology. This study will utilize two arms - one as the treatment arm utilizing 24 hours of prophylactic antibiotics and the other as control.</detailed_description>
