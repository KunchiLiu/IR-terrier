	<brief_summary>The major goal is to determine whether the experimental agent has clinically promising activity that would merit progression to a formal phase III trial. Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer after docetaxel chemotherapy have limited treatment options and no systemic treatment has been proven to be effective. Because of its action, safety and simple administration SU011248 has potential for effectiveness in this disease setting. Promising activity in this study would provide the necessary proof-of-principle for a larger confirmatory study in this population, and potentially in earlier stages of this common disease.</brief_summary>
