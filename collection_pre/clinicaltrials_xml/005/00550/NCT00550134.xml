	<brief_summary>Patients with cancer often complain that their "mind does not seem to be clear." This can be due to stress, depression, anxiety, or physical problems caused by cancer or the treatments used to control symptoms. There are many purposes for this study; one of them is to learn about the effects of cancer treatments on the brain, and another is to identify useful tools to detect these effects. The results of this study may stimulate new research comparing different treatments to the current treatment so the researchers may learn how to treat symptoms more effectively and improve patient quality of life. We would also like to learn more about the effects chemotherapy may have on DNA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Changes Associated With Breast Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, longitudinal study to examine time-dependent neurocognitive changes in patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This study will assess chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction. The researchers will recruit patients with localized breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for the first time and will test the effects of chemotherapy on patients' cognitive function utilizing a standardized neuropsychological battery. Patients scheduled for chemotherapy will be given a battery of neuropsychological undergo MRI evaluation prior to beginning chemotherapy and one month following completion of treatment.</detailed_description>
