	<brief_summary>There are currently no published data on the efficacy of the chlorhexidine-impregnated foam dressing to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSI) in hemodialysis patients. The researchers perfomed a cross-over intervention trial on patients who were dialyzed through central venous catheters at two outpatient dialysis centers were enrolled. The use of a chlorhexidine-impregnated foam dressing was incorporated into the catheter care protocol during the intervention period. A nested cohort study of all patients who received the foam dressing was also conducted to determine independent risk factors for development of BSI. The primary outcomes were the catheter-related bloodstream infection rates in the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes include the clinical sepsis rates between the two groups and risk factors for development of bloodstream infection despite the use of the foam dressing.</brief_summary>
