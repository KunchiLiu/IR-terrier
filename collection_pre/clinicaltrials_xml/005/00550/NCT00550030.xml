	<brief_summary>Etanercept, a biological antipsoriatic drug with anti-tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) activity has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. However, in a substantial portion of cases etanercept does not induce reduction in psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 75% or greater, now being considered as gold standard for treatment efficacy. In this study the researchers aim to determine in a randomized half-side comparison, whether additional narrowband UVB-311nm phototherapy accelerates and improves the therapeutic efficacy of etanercept.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etanercept Plus UVB-311nm Phototherapy in Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who have received a standard dose of etanercept (50 mg or 25 mg s.c. twice weekly) for at least 6 weeks without a PASI reduction of 75% or greater qualify for the study. Etanercept is continued and UVB-311nm phototherapy is added at 6 weeks or thereafter on a randomized body half (left or right; head exempt) 3 x per week until complete response (defined as reduction in PASI to &lt; 3) for a maximum of another 6 weeks (until week 12). PASI score and patient disease score is assessed weekly; patient life quality score at week 0, 6, and 12; all scores at follow-up visits at month 3, 6, and 12. Paired statistical testing (T-test or Wilcoxon) for differences in PASI and patient disease and life quality scores is done; Fischer exact test is applied to determine differences in complete remission, PASI reduction &gt; 90%, &gt; 75%, and/or 50% between body sites.</detailed_description>
