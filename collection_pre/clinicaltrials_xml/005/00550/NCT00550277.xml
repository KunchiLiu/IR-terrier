	<brief_summary>Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) provides a novel approach for cancer treatment. LBH589, an oral HDAC inhibitor, has been well tolerated in phase I trials and has shown activity against several types of cancer. In this nonrandomized phase II trial, we are investigating the activity of LBH589 in the treatment of patients with refractory clear cell renal carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LBH589 Treatment for Refractory Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) provides a potential target for cancer treatment. Histones are components of the core proteins of nucleosomes, and acetylation and deacetylation of these proteins play a role in the regulation of gene expression. HDAC activity is known to be increased in many types of malignant cells; HDAC inhibitors have been shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in cultured tumor cells. Since this tumor-associated mechanism is common to many types of cancer, HDAC may have a broad role in cancer treatment.</detailed_description>
