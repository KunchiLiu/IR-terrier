	<brief_summary>Rational: The possible contribution of methacholine challenge test via spirometry to the clinical diagnosis of young children with various respiratory symptoms, the most appropriate spirometry index, and the proper cutoff point concentration that will define airway sensitivity have not yet been explored. Objectives: To assess airway reactivity by spirometry in a large group of children aged 3-6years with various respiratory symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spirometry and Methacholine Challenge Test in Asthmatic Children Age 3-6years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aimed to gather information concerning methacholine challenge test performed in children previously diagnosed with asthma (asthmatics) and 48 had prolonged cough (coughers) from the pediatric clinic at Meyer Children's Hospital. Tests were performed by inhalation of triple-concentration increments (0.06 to13.9mg/ml/methacholine). Spirometry was determined at baseline and after each inhalation in duplicate sets. End of test was defined by a fall of 20%FEV1 baseline (PC20-FEV1). PC20-FEV1&lt;4.0mg/ml was considered positive). Results from the challenge were related to data from questionnaires concerning respiratory symptoms were analyzed at the end of the studies.</detailed_description>
