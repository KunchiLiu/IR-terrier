	<brief_title>A Study to Examine the Efficacy and Safety of Posaconazole When Introduced Early in the Treatment of Refractory Fungal Infections (P05090 AM2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past two decades, invasive fungal infections (IFI) have become increasingly common among immunocompromised people, including solid-organ or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients, those with HIV infection, those with hematological malignancies, and individuals on immunosuppressive drug regimens. There is a high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with IFI. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in resistance to commonly used antifungal agents and an epidemiological shift to more drug-resistant strains. This has demonstrated the need for the development of a new generation of azoles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Proven or probable invasive fungal infection (IFI) including breakthrough infection while on antifungal treatment for at least 7 days.

Negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) at baseline for women of childbearing potential. Serum bilirubin &gt;10 times upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;10 times ULN. Documented allergy to azoles. Unable to take oral suspension medications or enteral feeding. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Participants who have received an investigational drug are allowed to be enrolled if the investigational drug was given 30 days prior to study registration, unless approved by the Sponsor.
