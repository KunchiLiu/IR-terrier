	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue, blood, and urine in the laboratory from patients receiving erlotinib may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: The phase II trial is studying proteomic profiling to see how well it predicts response in patients receiving erlotinib for stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Profiling in Predicting Response in Patients Receiving Erlotinib for Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To define a pre-treatment tumor proteomic profile that predicts response, stable disease, or progressive disease in patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride. Secondary - To test and refine a pre-treatment serum proteomic expression pattern that predicts response to erlotinib hydrochloride and/or carboplatin and paclitaxel after failing treatment with erlotinib hydrochloride. - To test and refine tumor proteomic profiles that predict response to carboplatin and paclitaxel after failing treatment with erlotinib hydrochloride. - To analyze individual and pattern(s) of erlotinib hydrochloride-induced genomic and proteomic biomarker changes in relation to response or non-response to treatment. - To correlate the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib hydrochloride with expression of EGFR, EGFR pathway, ErbB family, and other related biomarkers. - To determine a set of biomarkers to be evaluated in tumor tissue or surrogate tissues prior to treatment with erlotinib hydrochloride to enable patient selection for therapy. - To estimate response rate and progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with erlotinib hydrochloride as initial therapy. - To characterize the safety profile of erlotinib hydrochloride in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily until disease progression. At the time of disease progression, patients receive standard chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Patients with non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. Tumor tissue, plasma, serum, and urine samples are collected at baseline for proteomics analysis. After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
