	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of RTA 402 in Patients With Hepatic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RTA 402 is a synthetic triterpenoid that is designed to suppress oxidative stress and inflammatory processes that play a significant role in a wide variety of diseases. It is a potent suppressor of inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis, and RTA 402 has demonstrated activity in a preclinical model of hepatitis, in addition to other models of inflammation. This is a 28-day, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study. It is anticipated that a total of 3 groups of 8 patients each will be enrolled, in which 6 patients in each group will be randomized to receive RTA 402, and 2 patients per group will be randomized to placebo (3:1). Patients will receive treatment daily for 14 days with a starting dose of 5mg, 25mg, or 50mg. Patients will return for follow up visits on Days 16 and 21, and complete end of study procedures on Day 28.</detailed_description>
