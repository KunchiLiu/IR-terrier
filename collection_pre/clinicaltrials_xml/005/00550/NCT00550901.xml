	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexrazoxane and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may help kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dexrazoxane when given together with cisplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexrazoxane and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To establish the maximum tolerated dose of a 96-hour continuous infusion of dexrazoxane hydrochloride and a single-dose, one-hour infusion of cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. - To determine the pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane hydrochloride and cisplatin when given concurrently. - To describe the toxicities of infusional dexrazoxane hydrochloride and cisplatin given in combination. OUTLINE: Patients receive dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV continuously over 96 hours beginning on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood is collected periodically during course one for pharmacokinetic studies. DNA isolated from the samples is also analyzed for oxidative DNA damage by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
