	<brief_summary>The OsmohalerTM is a registered device in Australia. It is used to deliver a dry powder a commercial preparation of mannitol registered as AridolTM to test if a person has irritable airways such as active asthma. The overseas regulatory authorities need to know that people of all ages can achieve an adequate inspiratory flow through this device during a controlled deep inspiration. Adequate flow is generally regarded as greater than 30 litres per minute in children and 60 litres per minute in adults. The OsmohalerTM is a device with low resistance and is already in use in Australia to deliver mannitol. However there is a need to document inspiratory flows through the device during a controlled deep inspiration. The protocol requires subjects to perform a controlled deep inspiration from the device on three or five occasions. No substance will be inhaled.</brief_summary>
