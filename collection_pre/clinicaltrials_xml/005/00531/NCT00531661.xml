	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States (US). The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HF Pressure Measurement System in reducing heart failure (HF) related hospitalizations in a subset of subjects suffering from HF.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of HF ≥ 3 months, with either preserved or reduced LVEF 2. Diagnosis of NYHA Class III HF (historical assessment documented at screening visit) 3. Subjects with reduced LVEF must be receiving a beta blocker for 3 months and an ACEI or ARB for one month unless in the investigator's opinion, the subject is intolerant to beta blockers, ACEI or ARB. Beta blockers and ACEI (or ARB) doses should be stable for one month prior to study entry. 4. At least 1 HF hospitalization within 12 months of Screening Visit 5. Subjects with pulmonary artery branch diameter sized between 7mm and 15mm (implanted vessel) 1. Subjects with history of recurrent (&gt; 1) pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis 2. Subjects, in the Investigator's opinion, unable to tolerate a right heart catheterization 3. Subjects who have had a major cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke) within 2 months of Screening Visit 4. Subjects with Cardiac Resynchronization Device (CRT) implanted ≤ 3 months prior to enrollment 5. Subjects with a Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;25 ml/min who are nonresponsive to diuretic therapy or who are on chronic renal dialysis 6. Subjects likely to undergo heart transplantation within 6 months of Screening Visit 7. Subjects with congenital heart disease or mechanical right heart valve(s) 8. Subjects with known coagulation disorders 9. Subjects with a hypersensitivity or allergy to aspirin, and/or clopidogrel</criteria>
