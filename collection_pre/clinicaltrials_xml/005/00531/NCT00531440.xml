	<criteria>Patients who are receiving study medication at Month 12 (CRAD001A2307) and sign a new Informed Consent to extend the treatment or observation period beyond Month 12. Female patients must agree to continue using an approved method of birth control throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study medication. Another Informed Consent was required for the extension amendment. This Informed Consent allowed for separate consent to the amendment study itself, and the retrospective collection of biopsies and/or the yearly protocol biopsies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were not changed, except that patients who completed the core study in followup became eligible to participate in the amended extension. Patients who are receiving study medication and do not sign a new Informed Consent to extend the treatment and observation period beyond Month 12 cannot enter the extension.</criteria>
