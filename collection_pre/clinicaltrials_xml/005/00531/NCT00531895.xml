	<brief_summary>Background: Although major depression and chronic headache are strongly associated, there is insufficient evidence on the use of antidepressants for this specific comorbidity. This trial aimed to investigate the efficiency and tolerability of duloxetine for this indication. Methods: Thirty outpatients of our clinic, with DSM-IV major depression and concurrent primary chronic headache (chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache or both), 18-55 years, were recruited from April 2006 to March 2007, if they scored &gt;21 on the Montgomery-Ã„sberg Depression Scale (MADRS) and had no other significant clinical condition. Subjects received duloxetine 60 mg/day for 8 weeks. MADRS scores and a visual analog pain scale (VAS) were the co-primary outcome measures. WHO quality of life scale (WHOQoL BREF) scores and headache days/week were secondary outcome measures.Conclusion: In this preliminary open trial, duloxetine 60 mg/day was effective, fast acting and well tolerated for the treatment of comorbid major depression and chronic headache.</brief_summary>
