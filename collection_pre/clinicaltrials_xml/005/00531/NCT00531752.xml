	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether PF-03654746 is effective in the treatment of Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This will be a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which adults with ADHD will receive 3 weeks of treatment with PF-03654746, either a low dose (1 mg), or flexible dose (0.50 mg titrated up to 2 mg), and 3 weeks of placebo. A washout period will separate the 2 treatment periods. Participants will be required to washout of prior ADHD medication before entering the study. Participants will be required to come to the site for 10 visits over approximately a 10-week period.</brief_summary>
