	<brief_summary>The general objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Rituximab in the management of patients with refractory or relapsed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS). There have been several case reports and case series describing the use of Rituximab in patients with TTP-HUS; however its use has not been studied in a large trial. It is hypothesized that Rituximab may ameliorate the severity of certain cases of TTP-HUS by decreasing the number of activity of B-cells which may result in decreased production of the ADAMTS13 protease inhibitor. Patients with TTP-HUS not responding to standard therapy or patients with relapsed disease may have particular benefit. Treatments that decrease the frequency of relapse or shorten the time to remission of TTP-HUS will be of benefit by decreasing the need for blood product support.</brief_summary>
