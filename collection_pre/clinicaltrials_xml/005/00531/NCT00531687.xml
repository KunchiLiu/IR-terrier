	<brief_summary>Study Objectives: Primary objective - The primary objective of this study is to investigate the combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine/paclitaxel, with respect to complete remission in patients with germ cell tumours previously treated with BEP. Secondary Objectives - Overall survival - Progression free survival - Response rates (RECIST) - Duration of response - To investigate the safety of paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients previously treated with BEP</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed germ cell tumor (seminoma or nonseminoma) with measurable metastatic disease either by radiography (at a site which has previously not been irradiated) or elevation of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and/or elevation of betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG); Patient previously treated with standard BEP (3 or 4 cycles) with relapse 1 months or more after favorable response on previous chemotherapy (CR or PR) Male Age greater than or equal to 18 years; Performance status 0,1,2 or 3 WBC &gt; 3000 mill/l, ANC &gt; 1500 mill/l, platelet count &gt; 100.000 mill/l; serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal; Adequate renal function (Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &gt;60 ml/min). GFR will be assessed by direct measurement (EDTA clearance or creatinine clearance) signed informed consent; Uncontrolled active severe clinical infection (CTC grade 3 or 4). Serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the discretion of the investigator), including expected difficulty of followup related to mental disorders. Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy according to the CTC, version 3.0. Second malignancy other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer.</criteria>
