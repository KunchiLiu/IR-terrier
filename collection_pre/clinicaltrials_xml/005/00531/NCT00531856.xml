	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability Study of Inhaled Carbon Monoxide in Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanisms by which carbon monoxide exerts its effects in preventing damage of the graft appear to vary among the models and organs with the common theme of carbon monoxide acting as a potent anti-inflammatory molecule. Carbon monoxide affects several intracellular signaling pathways. In addition, carbon monoxide generates increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of three carbon monoxide dose levels consisting of a single 0.7 mg/kg dose and a single 2.0 mg/kg dose when administered post-operatively and a single 2.0 mg/kg dose, a single 3.0mg/kg dose and a 3.5 mg/kg dose when administered intra-operatively as an inhaled gas for 1 hour, by assessment of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory variables, serum carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), oxygenation, electrocardiography (ECG), and neurocognitive status in patients receiving kidney transplants.</detailed_description>
