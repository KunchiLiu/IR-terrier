	<brief_summary>A drug called AV650 (tolperisone HCl) will be given to patients who have spasticity following a spinal cord injury. This study has three purposes: 1. To determine whether AV650 is safe for patients with spinal cord injury; 2. To assess what the body does with AV650 once it is ingested; and, 3. To gather some early evidence as to whether AV650 is effective in treating spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury.</brief_summary>
