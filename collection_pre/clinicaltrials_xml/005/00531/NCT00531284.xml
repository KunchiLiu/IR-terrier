	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this Phase 1b/2 study were as follows: - Phase 1b (Bolus and Infusion): To evaluate the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed solid tumors and in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and in patients with refractory lymphoma. - Phase 2 (Bolus): To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Disease related Phase 1 Subjects (Bolus and Infusion): Solid Tumor: Histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor 1 to 3 prior treatment regimens At least one site of radiographically measurable disease of ≥ 2 cm in the largest dimension by traditional computed tomography (CT) scanning technique or ≥ 1 cm in the largest dimension by spiral CT scanning (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria); or if, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, evaluable disease can be reliably and consistently followed, the subject may be eligible upon approval by the Medical Monitor Multiple Myeloma (MM): Relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma following 2 or more prior treatment regimens. Measurable disease as indicated by one or more of the following: Serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL Urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 hr Serum Free Light Chain: Involved free light chain (FLC) level ≥ 10 mg/dL provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal Lymphoma: Histologically or cytologically confirmed lymphoma. Patients must have had an initial diagnosis of indolent nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (including follicular, small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytoid, and marginal zone lymphoma), indolent disease that transformed to a more aggressive subtype, as previously described or patients may have mantle cell lymphoma. Patients are required to have received prior rituximab (alone or combined with other treatment) and are considered refractory to (defined as no response, or progression within 6 months of completing therapy) or intolerant of continued rituximab. Patients may have received up to a maximum of four prior unique chemotherapy regimens, including if not contraindicated autologous stemcell transplantation (ASCT). For patients to enroll in the expanded dose group for lymphoma, patients must have measurable disease Phase 2 Bolus Subjects: Histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor diagnosis and: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Failed at least 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen but not more than 3 prior therapies for metastatic disease Small cell lung cancer (SCLC): Failed 1 to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens Ovarian: Failed at least 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen but not more than 4 therapies for metastatic disease Renal: Failed at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease Other solid tumor types: Failed at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or relapsed disease and for which standard of care therapy is no longer effective or does not exist At least one site of radiographically measurable disease of ≥ 2 cm in the largest dimension by traditional CT scanning technique or ≥ 1 cm in the largest dimension by spiral CT scanning (per RECIST criteria); or if, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, evaluable disease can be reliably and consistently followed, the subject may be eligible upon approval by the Medical Monitor Demographic Males and females ≥ 18 years of age Life expectancy of more than 3 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 02 Laboratory Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 3 times ULN Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/mm³, hemoglobin ≥ 8 gm/dL for solid tumors or 7.0 gm/dL for MM, and platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ for solid tumors or ≥ 30,000/mm³ for MM. Subjects should not have received platelet transfusions for at least 1 week prior to screening Screening ANC should be independent of granulocyte and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GCSF and GMCSF) support for at least 1 week and of pegylated GCSF for ≥ 2 weeks Subjects may receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions or receive supportive care with erythropoietin or darbepoetin in accordance with institutional guidelines Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 20 mL/minute calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault. Subjects with calculated CrCl &lt; 20 mL/min may be allowed, only with prior approval by the Medical Monitor. Ethical/Other Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional guidelines Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days of the first dose and agree to use dual methods of contraception during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. Postmenopausal females (&gt; 45 years old and without menses for &gt; 1 year) and surgically sterilized females are exempt from these requirements. Male subjects must use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months following the last dose if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. Disease Related Chemotherapy with approved or investigational anticancer therapeutics, including steroid therapy, within 3 weeks prior to first dose or 6 weeks for antibody therapy Radiation therapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to first dose (except for antibody therapy, where 6 weeks is required); localized radiation therapy within 1 week prior to first dose Subjects with prior brain metastases are permitted, but must have completed treatment and have no evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) disease for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose For lymphoma patients; patients with prior stem cell transplant therapy (autologous SCT within the prior 8 weeks; allogeneic SCT within the prior 16 weeks). Patients with prior allogeneic SCT should not have evidence of moderatetosevere graftversushost disease (GVHD) Evidence of CNS lymphoma Participation in an investigational therapeutic study within 3 weeks prior to first dose Prior treatment with carfilzomib Concurrent Conditions Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to first dose Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III to IV), symptomatic ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional intervention, or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to first dose Acute active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 2 weeks prior to first dose Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or subjects who are HIV seropositive Active hepatitis A, B, or C infection Significant neuropathy (Grade 3, Grade 4, or Grade 2 with pain) at the time of the first dose Subjects with pleural effusions requiring routine thoracentesis or ascites requiring routine paracentesis Subjects at risk* in whom the required program of oral and intravenous fluid hydration is contraindicated, e.g., due to preexisting pulmonary, cardiac, or renal impairment High risk for Tumor Lysis Syndrome. Ethical / Other Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating Any clinically significant psychiatric or medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed consent</criteria>
