	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to look at the effects of two different HIV medications on the body's response to insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels). This will be done using a method called the 'euglycaemic clamp' The study will also investigate the effects of these drugs on blood fats and on circulating markers in the blood stream related to blood vessels (vascular inflammation markers).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will undergo four euglycaemic clamp procedures in order to determine the extent of glucose disposal. The first clamp will be performed prior to the commencement of the first study drug administration, the second one following two weeks of study drug, the third after a two week washout period, prior to commencement of second study drug administration and the fourth after two weeks of the second study drug</detailed_description>
