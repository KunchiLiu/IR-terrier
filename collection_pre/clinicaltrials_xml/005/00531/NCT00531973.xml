	<brief_summary>The randomized LITE study will compare liposomal doxorubin versus standard epirubicin in the treatment of female breast cancer. In order to detect as early as possible post-chemotherapy cardiotoxicity, tissue Doppler imaging parameters elicited at transthoracic echocardiography will be used and will constitute the primary and co-primary end-points.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin in Women With Breast Cancer Exploiting Tissue Doppler Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomized LITE study will compare liposomal doxorubin versus standard epirubicin within a comprehensive adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. The study will enrol a total of 80 patients, randomized 1:1 to liposomal doxorubin vs epirubicin. Standard and tissue Doppler imaging parameters will be appraised at transthoracic echocardiography will be used and will constitute the primary and co-primary end-points. In addition, other efficacy and safety end-points will be appraised, including disease free progression.</detailed_description>
