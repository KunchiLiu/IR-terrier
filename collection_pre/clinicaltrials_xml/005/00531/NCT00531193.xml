	<brief_summary>To establish the extent to which BIIB014, following 8 to 12 consecutive days of dosing at selected dose levels, occupies the brain's A2A receptors. Receptor occupancy will be assessed by PET scanning using a radiolabelled tracer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using PET Scans to Study Brain Receptor Occupancy of BIIB014 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into cohorts of 2 to 4 subjects. PET scan results will determine the actual number of cohorts enrolled and the BIIB014 dose given to each subject. Since all enrolled subjects will be receiving BIIB014, this study is being listed as a 1-arm, Single Group study (actual study design is dose escalation). Participating subjects will be required to reside in the clinical unit for 10 to 14 consecutive days. Participants will receive 1 oral dose of BIIB014 daily for 8 to 12 consecutive days. During the study, subjects will undergo 2 PET scans and 1 MRI. Frequent blood sample for pharmacokinetic assessments will also be performed.</detailed_description>
