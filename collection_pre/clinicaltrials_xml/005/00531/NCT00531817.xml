	<brief_summary>This 2-arm study assessed the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab versus placebo, both in combination with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), in regard to reduction in signs and symptoms, in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to DMARDs. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or placebo IV every 4 weeks. All patients also received stable antirheumatic therapy, including permitted DMARDs. The anticipated time on study treatment was 3-12 months and the target sample size was 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
