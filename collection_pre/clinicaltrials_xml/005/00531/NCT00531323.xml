	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to look at whether changing directly from one medication for HIV (efavirenz) to a new medication for HIV (TMC125) has any effect on the levels of TMC125 in the blood, compared to when TMC125 is taken without efavirenz having been taken immediately beforehand. The study aims to help the investigators understand whether it is safe to change directly from efavirenz to TMC125 (with no gap between the treatments) in patients who need these treatments. The study will investigate the blood levels of TMC125 when it is taken both once and twice a day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC 125 Blood Levels Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pharmacokinetic parameters of TMC125 will be evaluated when TMC125 is given without and with a 14-day efavirenz intake preceding period in order to evaluate the risk of achieving sub therapeutic concentrations of TMC125 when switching straight from efavirenz containing regimens Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questions, physical examination and laboratory parameters. These will be performed at regular intervals during the drug study.</detailed_description>
