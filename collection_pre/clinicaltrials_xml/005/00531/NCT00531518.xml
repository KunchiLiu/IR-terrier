	<brief_summary>EDIPP is a multisite trial of early identification and intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis in adolescents and young adults, carried out at six sites across the United States. The hypothesis is that very early identification and intervention will be effective in delaying or preventing onset of psychosis and improving social and occupational functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection and Intervention for the Prevention of Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is structured as a cutoff, regression discontinuity design, in which lower risk-for-psychosis participants will not be treated by protocol but followed up for two years. Those at higher risk will be treated with anti-psychotic, antidepressant and mood stabilizing medications by symptom indications, and systematically provided psychoeducational multifamily group treatment, supported education and employment, and intensive clinical case management, using key elements of Assertive Community Treatment. Both arms of the study will be followed for two years and assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Outcome measures include rates of conversion to psychosis, relapse of psychosis, development of psychotic disorder diagnoses, levels of positive, negative and general symptoms, social and vocational functioning, family functioning, and neurocognitive functioning. The six sites include Sacramento, California; Salem Oregon; and surrounding counties, Ypsilanti and Washtenaw County, Michigan; Portland, Maine; Albuquerque, New Mexico and Glen Oaks, New York. In addition to symptomatic and functional outcomes, impact on incidence of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, will be assessed, as will cost-benefit effects.</detailed_description>
