	<brief_summary>In spite of the use of radiation combined with conventional chemotherapy, the long-term survival prognosis for most patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer is disappointing. Much effort is currently focussed on exploring new molecular targeted agents that may improve upon survival. The addition of an agent that targets blood vessel formation in tumors, bevacizumab or Avastin, to conventional chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Data from animal studies have shown that bevacizumab and related agents also increase tumor cure rates when administered both during and after radiotherapy. This suggests that combined bevacizumab and chemo-radiation may improve survival in local-advanced disease as well. Before such clinical studies can commence, the safety and normal tissue toxicity profile of bevacizumab with thoracic radiotherapy must first be established. In this study, escalating doses of bevacizumab will be administered during radiotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
