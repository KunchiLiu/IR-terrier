	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate whether there was an association between obesity and periodontitis, tendency to caries and periapical lesions. People who have a higher body mass index produce cytokines (hormone-like proteins), that lead to systemic/chronic inflammation (like periodontitis and periapical lesions), and obesity related dietary habits could result in an increment of dental caries because both the amount and the frequency of sucrose ingestion are important factors associated with the aetiology of the oral disease.</brief_summary>
