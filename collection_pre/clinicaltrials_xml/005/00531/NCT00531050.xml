	<criteria>Patients between 40 and 75 years of age diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Female patients must be surgically sterilized, postmenopausal or using a doublebarrier method of contraception. Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 to 32. Participation in any clinical investigation with experimental drug therapy within four weeks prior to dosing or longer as required by local regulation.

A past medical history of, or a family history (grandparents, parents and siblings) of a prolonged QTinterval syndrome or a prolonged QTinterval at screening. Any clinically significant medical abnormalities (excluding COPD) limiting ability to perform standardized exercise protocol on cycle ergometer will exclude the patient. For example, arthritis. History of clinically significant drug allergy or history of atopic allergy (asthma, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drugs similar to the study drug. History of immunocompromise, including a positive HIV, Hepatitis B or C test result.
