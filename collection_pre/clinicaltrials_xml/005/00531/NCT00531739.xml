	<criteria>Patient is 18 years of age or older of either gender Patient has primary diagnosis requiring a twostage colectomy or proctocolectomy Patient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before randomization. Patient must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions. Patient is participating in another clinical study which may influence adhesion formation. Patient has had barriers, solutions, or antiadhesive therapy, other than SurgiWrapTM, as planned at randomization, placed in the abdomen at the time of the initial surgery Patient who, at the initial surgery, had administration of irrigants containing corticosteroids, heparin, salicylates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or dextran 70 Patient has one or more medical condition(s), including severe renal, hepatic, hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this study. Patient is taking chronic (i.e., &gt; 2 weeks) therapeutic doses of medications known to affect healing such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Prophylactic aspirin (less than or equal to 325 mg once daily) for cardiovascular indications will be permitted in patients. Patient has an infection in the intraabdominal or pelvic area.</criteria>
