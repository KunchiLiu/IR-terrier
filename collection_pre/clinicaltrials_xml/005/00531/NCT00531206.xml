	<brief_summary>This observational study is supposed to assess (under conditions of clinical practice in daily routine) whether treatment with Aptivus (tipranavir) in combination with low-dose Norvir (ritonavir) will durably suppress viral load and may achieve suppression of viral load below the limit of detection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Highly pretreated male and female adult patients with virus resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Aptivus (tipranavir), coadministered with low dose Norvir (ritonavir), is indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment of HIV1 infection in highly pretreated adult patients with virus resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Age &lt; 18 years pregnant female patients Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Patients with moderate or severe (ChildPugh B or C) hepatic impairment. Rifampicin should not be used with Aptivus (tipranavir) because coadministration may cause large decreases in tipranavir concentrations which may in turn significantly decrease the tipranavir therapeutic effect. Herbal preparations containing St John's wort must not be used while taking Aptivus (tipranavir) due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of tipranavir. Coadministration of Aptivus (tipranavir) with low dose Norvir (ritonavir), with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or lifethreatening events is contraindicated. These active substances include antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine), antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (cisapride), neuroleptics (pimozide, sertindole), sedatives/hypnotics (triazolam) and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and lovastatin). In addition, coadministration of Aptivus (tipranavir) with low dose Norvir (ritonavir), with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide and propafenone, is contraindicated.</criteria>
