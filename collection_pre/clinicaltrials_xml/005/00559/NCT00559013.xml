	<brief_title>Peri-Strips Dry (PSD) Veritas Collagen Matrix Staple Line Reinforcement for Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study is designed as a prospective enrollment of patients undergoing open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery requiring the creation of an anastomosis. Patients who are scheduled for elective resection of the left, anterior and low anterior colon can be enrolled in the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must comply with followup evaluations Patient or representative must provide informed consent prior to enrollment Patient scheduled for elective surgical excision of the left, anterior or low anterior colon Patient must meet all criteria and be eligible to have open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis at one location Crohns disease Emergency colorectal surgery for trauma, obstruction, ischemic bowel, perforated diverticulum and all other emergent diagnosis. Patients who have not had mechanical bowel preparation Patients with known documented sensitivity/allergy to bovine material Severe radiation damage to tissue Carcinomatosis or stage IV cancer BMI is 35 or greater Cancer at primary anastomosis site that cannot be excised Patients who require an ileo rectal anastomosis Surgery anticipated to include jejunostomy pouch Anticipated diverting stoma No anti adhesive barrier can be used around anastomotic site No multiple circular anastomosis Surgeons discretion to exclude any patient he/she feels would not have a safe anastomosis Patient life expectacny less than followup timeframe of study Pregnancy Patients currently enrolled in a study that competes for the same patient population</criteria>
