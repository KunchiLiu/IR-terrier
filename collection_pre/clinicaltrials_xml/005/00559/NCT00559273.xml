	<brief_summary>This study will compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Mircera and subcutaneous darbepoetin in the treatment of renal anemia in participants with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis and not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Participants will be randomized to receive either Mircera once every 4 weeks, at a starting dose of 1.2 micrograms/kilogram (mcg/kg), or darbepoetin alfa once weekly, at a starting dose of 0.45 mcg/kg (or once every two weeks, 0.75 mcg/kg). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 (creatinine clearance [CrCl]/ glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 30 to 59 milliliter per minutes per 1.73 meter square [mL/min/1.73m^2]) or Stage 4 (CrCl/GFR 1529 mL/min/1.73m^2) who did not require dialysis. CrCl/GFR was estimated with the CockcroftGault equation or the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation Anemia defined as baseline Hb concentration less than (&lt;) 10.5 gram per deciliter (g/dL) Previous therapy with any ESA within 12 weeks prior to screening Renal allograft in place Immunosuppressive therapy in the 12 weeks prior to screening Overt gastrointestinal bleeding and red blood cells (RBC) transfusions within 8 weeks before screening</criteria>
