	<brief_title>Qualitative Research on Women With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia is a chronic-illness requiring life-long treatment and is caused by an inherited enzyme deficiency that leads to an overproduction of hormones produced by the adrenal glands, which in turn, masculinizes the female genitalia before birth. While the mechanisms by which CAH influences physiological development are understood, the impact of this hormonal elevation on health-related quality of life (HRQL), psychological health, and health-seeking behaviors is less clear. This study is guided by three research questions: (1) how does CAH influence HRQL domains (physical, functional, emotional and interpersonally), (2) how does CAH influence the mental health of women diagnosed with CAH, and (3) how does CAH influence decisions to seek help from a counselor? Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with women with CAH. Interviews will be analyzed through the Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methodology.</detailed_description>
