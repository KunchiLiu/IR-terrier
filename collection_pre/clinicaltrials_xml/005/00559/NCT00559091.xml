	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if ribavirin (a drug commonly used to treat hepatitis C) also has activity in the treatment of patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of the M4 and M5 subtype.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Ribavirin to Treat M4 and M5 Acute Myelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is dysregulated in many human malignancies, including a subset of myeloid leukemia (M4/M5 AML and blast crisis CML). eIF4E overexpression leads to oncogenic transformation. Ribavirin impedes eIF4E mediated transformation in vitro, in primary human specimens and in animal models. While ribavirin has been used extensively for the treatment of viral hepatitis C and its safety profile has been well defined, it has never been used in patients with AML. This study will establish the efficacy and safety of ribavirin in M4/M5 AML patients. In addition, this study will also include correlative studies to determine the effect of ribavirin on eIF4E activity and eIF4E related pathways in M4/M5 AML patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), either M4 or M5 subtype de novo or resulting from a transformation from MDS or a myeloproliferative disorder. Patients with AML who (a) have failed primary therapy defined as failing two induction chemotherapies, (b) have relapsed or (c) are not suitable for intensive induction chemotherapy will be eligible. OR Patients with AML blast crisis from CML if they are not suitable candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy or have failed imatinib mesylate OR Patients with secondary AML after MDS if they are not suitable candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. ECOG 0,1,2, or 3 Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks. Adequate renal and hepatic function Uncontrolled central nervous system involvement by AML Active cardiovascular disease as defined by NYHA class IIIIV categorization. Intercurrent illness or medical condition precluding safe administration of ribavirin. Received any previous therapy within 28 days prior to study entry.Hydrea is permitted but must be stopped 7 days prior to starting study drug. Known infection with HIV.</criteria>
