	<brief_title>Topical Avastin for Treatment of Corneal Neovascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary outcomes measures included neovascular area (NA), defined as the area of the corneal vessels themselves; vessel caliber (VC), defined as the mean diameter of the corneal vessels; and invasion area (IA), defined as the fraction of the total cornea into which the vessels extend. The occurrence of ocular and systemic adverse events was closely monitored throughout the course of the study.</detailed_description>
