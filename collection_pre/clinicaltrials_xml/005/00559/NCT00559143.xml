	<brief_summary>Aim of present study is to examine the short and long-term results of pacing from right ventricular apex and to compare them with those of biventricular pacing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biventricular Alternative Pacing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study all subjects to be studied will have atrioventricular conduction disturbances that require permanent artificial pacing. In all subjects a biventricular pacemaker will be implanted. Moreover the subjects will be randomized in a biventricular or conventional pacing mode and will be observed for a long term period.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrioventricular Block</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects between the age of 18 to 75 years with classic indication for permanent artificial pacing in which it is expected very high percentage of ventricular pacing, (pacing systoles constitute the 80% and more of the total). Physiologic or mildly affected systolic function of left ventricle, LVEF&gt; 40%. Subject is willing and able to comply with the Clinical Investigational Plan and to remain available for followup visits, through study closure. Subject (or if allowed by local law/regulations: subject's legally authorised representative) is willing and able to sign and date the study Informed Consent. Subjects with classic indication for Biventricular Pacing (European Guidelines 2007). Permanent atrial fibrillation. Cardiovascular surgery within the last three months prior to enrollment. Myocardial infarction within the last three months prior to enrollment.</criteria>
