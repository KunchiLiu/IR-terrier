In addition, the subject has not participated in clinical trials with more than 3 new chemical entities in the past 12 months.

Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John'sWort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and linezolid (antibiotic) for 1 month prior to first dose of study medication. Abuse of alcohol defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units for males and 14 units for females or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units for males and 2 units for females. 1 unit is equivalent to a halfpint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass (125ml) of wine. Consumption of grapefruit juice or grapefruit within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication until collection of the last PK sample. The subject is unable to abstain from strenuous physical activity for 48 h prior to screening and follow up and for 48 h prior to and 48 h after each treatment period. Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 90 day period An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from, or use a condom during, sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women from the time of the first dose of study medication until 90 days following administration of the last dose of study medication OR An unwillingness of the male subject to use a condom/spermicide in addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception such as an IUD, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, subdermal implants or a tubal ligation if the woman could become pregnant from the time of the first dose of study medication until 90 days following administration of the last dose of study medication. Current or recent (within one year) gastrointestinal disease; a history of malabsorption, esophageal reflux, irritable bowel syndrome; frequent (more than once a week) occurrence of heartburn; or any surgical intervention (e.g., cholecystectomy) which would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs.

The subject has a history of a clinically significant abnormality of the neurological system (including dementia and other cognitive disorders or significant head injury) or any history of seizure (excluding febrile seizure). The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen. The subject has tested positive for HIV. The subject has a past history of drug abuse or dependence according to DSMIV TR criteria within the past 12 months or has tested positive for urine drugs of abuse at prestudy screening. The subject has any history of serotonin syndrome or in the investigator's judgement, a history of clinical significant intolerance to SSRIs.
