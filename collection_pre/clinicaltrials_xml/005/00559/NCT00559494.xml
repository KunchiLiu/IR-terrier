	<brief_summary>While research in animal models of spinal cord injury have provided many promising insights, human studies have failed to produce effective therapies. We propose to investigate the drug Minocycline (a metalloproteinase inhibitor) for the treatment of spinal cord injured patients aiming to limit neurological injury and improve neurological outcome. This drug influences several secondary injury mechanisms implicated in spinal cord injury and has been effective in improving outcome after spinal cord injury in animal models. We also propose to examine the safety and feasibility of spinal cord perfusion pressure augmentation with a protocol of IV fluids and inotrope medications versus standard maintenance of mean arterial pressure in subjects who exhibit a decrease in perfusion pressure to less than 75 mmHg. The purpose of this pilot study is 1) to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical trial protocol for Minocycline in patients with acute spinal cord injury, and 2) to ensure adequate drug dosing and metabolic effect. After undergoing a process of informed consent, patients agreeing to participate in the study will be randomized to placebo or treatment groups in a double-blind fashion. Clinical neurological examinations, patient-reported quality of life, and functional independence categorization will be combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid laboratory investigations to establish some of the pharmacological properties and the safety profile of this medication in this group of patients. In addition, patient tolerance to the dosing regimen will be assessed. The results of this study will provide the preliminary data necessary to plan for a larger prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial to assess efficacy and to further assess safety.</brief_summary>
