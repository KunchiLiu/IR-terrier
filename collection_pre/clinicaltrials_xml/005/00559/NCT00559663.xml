	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of dark chocolate with green tea in healthy subjects on clot formation (platelet activity) cholesterol profile and markers of inflammation in two groups. The first group will be on a regimen of dark chocolate, and the second group will be on a regimen of green tea. Clinical outcomes will be determined after seven days of each treatment and both groups will undergo both treatments subsequently and serve as their own control. The hypothesis is that both green tea and dark chocolate will reduce platelet activity and reduce LDL, hsCRP and increase HDL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavonoid Effect on Activation and Stimulation of Thrombocytes, hsCRP and Lipid Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds ubiquitous in fruits and vegetables. They appear in especially high concentrations in the form of flavanols in green tea as well as in cocoa, and are known to have beneficial antioxidant effects in vitro. Flavonoids have been proposed as a key protective dietary component, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, including the reduction of elevated blood pressure in persons with hypertension and capable of decreasing LDL. The aim of this prospective single cross-over study is to assess the effect of green tea and dark chocolate consumption on inhibiting platelet activation, Lipid levels, and hsCRP in healthy volunteers. This research will be done at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and will include 35 subjects who will be randomized equally between the two groups. All blood work will be processed at the Sinai Center for Thrombosis Research. Clinical outcomes will be recorded using a standard case report form.</detailed_description>
