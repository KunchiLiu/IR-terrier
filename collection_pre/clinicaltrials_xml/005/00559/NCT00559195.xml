	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Epoetin beta may cause the body to make more red blood cells and may help relieve fatigue in patients with malignant solid tumors receiving palliative care. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well epoetin beta works in treating fatigue and anemia in patients receiving palliative care for malignant solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Beta in Treating Fatigue and Anemia in Patients Receiving Palliative Care for Malignant Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the impact of epoetin beta on fatigue and quality of life of patients receiving palliative care for malignant solid tumors. Secondary - Evaluate the impact of epoetin beta on hemoglobin level (increase &gt; 2 g/dL). OUTLINE: Patients receive epoetin beta subcutaneously once a week for up to 3 months. Fatigue, quality of life, and hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels are assessed every 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
