	<brief_summary>This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of Avastin and docetaxel following cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, in patients with HER2 negative operable breast cancer. Patients will receive 4 x 3 week cycles of chemotherapy with doxorubicin (60mg/m2 iv on day 1 of each cycle) and cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 iv on day 1 of each cycle). They will then receive 4 x 3 week cycles of docetaxel (75mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle) in combination with Avastin (15mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
