	<brief_summary>To determine safety and effectiveness of low-dose therapeutic AEGR-733 +/- atorvastatin, ezetimibe or fenofibrate (compared to placebo) on liver fat accumulation measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Low Doses of AEGR-733 on Hepatic Fat Accumulation by MRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal within the current development program and this study is to investigate whether lower doses of AEGR-733 can result in significant reductions in LDL-C and TGs while providing fewer gastrointestinal adverse events and less hepatic fat accumulation than seen in studies with higher doses. The potential for atorvastatin, ezetimibe or the PPAR-alpha agonist (fenofibrate) to ameliorate any hepatic fat accumulation will also be investigated. The twelve week dosing schedule allows us to demonstrate the longer term effects of lower doses of MTP-I on hepatic fat accumulation.</detailed_description>
