	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving an infusion of donor lymphocytes may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with hematologic cancer that has come back after a donor stem cell transplant. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well donor lymphocyte infusion works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic cancer after donor stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Hematologic Cancer After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine if the complete response rate exceeds 10% in patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic malignancies treated with donor lymphocyte infusion. Secondary - Estimate the complete response rate in these patients. - Assess the toxicity of donor lymphocyte infusion in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive up to four donor lymphocyte infusions at least 1 month apart in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or uncontrolled graft-versus-host disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for hematologic malignancy at least 30 days ago No failure to engraft following transplant No active acute or chronic graftversushost disease (GVHD) Minimal GVHD allowed Persistent or relapsed disease after ASCT, including 1 of the following: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), meeting any of the following criteria: Molecular relapse (may be treated with imatinib mesylate after transplant), as defined by any of the following: ASCT was nonTcell depleted, a negative bcr/abl was documented by PCR posttransplant, and bcr/abl is now detectable by 2 consecutive PCR determinations &gt; 30 days apart ASCT was nonTcell depleted and bcr/abl is detectable by PCR at any time after day 180 posttransplant Cytogenetic relapse after 36 months of imatinib mesylate Relapsed chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase CML after 36 months of imatinib mesylate Must currently be in chronic phase or accelerated phase CML only Patients with blastic phase CML must attain a second chronic phase Acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes, meeting any of the following criteria: Molecular relapse, as evidenced by &lt; 5% blasts in the bone marrow and the patient's leukemiaspecific molecular abnormality detectable by PCR Cytogenetic relapse, as evidenced by &lt; 5% blasts in the bone marrow and the patient's leukemiaspecific chromosome abnormality detectable by standard cytogenetics at any time after day 60 posttransplant Hematologic relapse, as evidenced by &gt; 20% blasts in bone marrow or soft tissue recurrence Must be treated with chemotherapy after transplant, but before study donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) Multiple myeloma Relapsed disease or recurrence of Mprotein after thalidomide or other salvage treatment Prior posttransplant documentation of disappearance of Mprotein by immunofixation Residual or progressive disease Rising Mprotein level at any time posttransplant (measured at 3month intervals) Original Mprotein detectable at 6 months posttransplant Immune protein electrophoresis (IPEP) is required to show that Mcomponent is the same on day 60 posttransplant as pretransplant Residual (&gt; 5%) plasma cells in bone marrow Relapsed nonHodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma Relapse or progression of disease must be evidenced within 3 months prior to donor lymphocyte infusion by physical exam, radiographic studies, or molecular studies Tumor should be rebiopsied to determine histology If EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) lymphoma is suspected, peripheral blood must be assayed for EBV genome (i.e., EBV DNA testing by PCR) within the past 30 days EBV infection with associated pancytopenia Persistent or refractory pancytopenia with EBV genome detected by PCR in the peripheral blood Refractory pancytopenia is defined as pancytopenia that is poorly responsive to growth factors and/or transfusions EBV lymphoproliferative disorder Clonal lymphadenopathy that is refractory to standard therapy with acyclovir and immunoglobulin (DLI may be given with rituximab) Not a candidate for repeat ASCT Chimerism status is not required for determining eligibility for DLI Patients eligible for allogeneic ASCT, but for whom DLI is offered as the first option, should have full donor chimerism at relapse or after therapy for relapsed disease Patients with relapsed underlying disease after transplant who achieved remission after chemotherapy are allowed No CNS recurrence that is not cleared by standard chemotherapy CNS remission status must be maintained for 2 weeks Original hematopoietic progenitor stem cell donor must be available for cell donation No syngeneic donors PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Karnofsky performance status 60100% Life expectancy â‰¥ 8 weeks Creatinine &lt; 3 mg/dL ABO/Rh and CMV IgG/IgM status known No HIV1 and HIV2 antibody Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months (males) or 6 months (females) after completion of study treatment PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics</criteria>
