	<brief_title>Cannabis Cigarettes Used for Doping: Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Urine Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About half of all positive doping cases in Switzerland have been related to Cannabis consumption (mainly recreational smoking). So far, the target analyte in urine is 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH), the main metabolite of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is excreted up to several days after single use. However, the wide detection window of THC-COOH does not allow a conclusion concerning the impact on the physical performance. Therefore, the evaluation of other target analytes with shorter elimination half-lives is needed and the aim (primary endpoints) of the present study. This pharmacokinetic, open, 1-session trial on 12 healthy, male, infrequently Cannabis smoking volunteers is focussed on the GC/MS profiling of THC and metabolites in urine and plasma after standardized smoking of a single 7% THC Cannabis cigarette of the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare &amp; Sport, Office of Medicinal Cannabis. Pharmacodynamic measurements (secondary endpoints) include the side-effects monitoring by using Visual Analog Scales and checking vital functions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy male subjects; light (max. 1/month), infrequent Cannabis smokers, medium (max. 15/month) tobacco smokers experienced in the inhalation technique; age 2030 years; body weight 75+/15 kg; evaluation based on normal medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (safety lab), normal lung functions (spirometry). Informed consent after information (written) by the study physician and principal investigator on nature, significance and scope of the trial. Informed consent by the volunteer regarding transmitting trialrelated data to the sponsor and to the competent control authorities. Hypersensitivity to cannabinoids. Regular (more than once per month, weekly or daily) Cannabis use. The use of alcohol, any medication or drugs, especially Cannabis, within the last 2 days prior to and during the 1day session is not allowed. Cannabis use is also not allowed during the following 11 days of urine collection, i.e. up to the end of the study. Positive Cannabis urine test before the session. Driving any vehicle, and operating with machines during and within 48 h after the session. Psychotic or vulnerable subjects.</criteria>
