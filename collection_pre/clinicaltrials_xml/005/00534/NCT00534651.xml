	<brief_title>Paracetamol and Endothelial Function in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with chronic pain diseases (e.g. osteoarthritis) are dependent on effective medication. NSAIDs are very effective in lowering pain in these patients. Recently there has aroused major concern with regard to cardiovascular side effects and safety, especially in selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (coxibs) but also in "regular" NSAIDs. At the moment, there is a big confusion, whether these drugs still should be used, especially in patients with known coronary artery disease. Physicians now try to switch to high dose paracetamol, despite the weaker efficacy in pain relieve, because this drug is considered generally as not harmful. As there is very few information on the cardiovascular effect of this drug, we plan to perform this study and investigate the impact of paracetamol on endothelial function, an important cardiovascular surrogate marker, on inflammatory markers and on oxidative stress in patients with coronary artery disease on top of standard medication, including aspirin</detailed_description>
