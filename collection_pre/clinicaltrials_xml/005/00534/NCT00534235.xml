	<brief_title>Post-Approval Clinical Trial Comparing the Long Term Safety and Effectiveness Coflex vs. Fusion to Treat Lumbar Spinal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this post-approval study is to examine the long-term survivorship of the coflex®. The coflex® Interlaminar Technology is an interlaminar stabilization device indicated for use in one or two level lumbar stenosis from L1-L5 in skeletally mature patients with at least moderate impairment in function, who experience relief in flexion from their symptoms of leg/buttocks/groin pain, with or without back pain, and who have undergone at least 6 months of non-operative treatment. The coflex® is intended to be implanted midline between adjacent lamina of 1 or 2 contiguous lumbar motion segments. Interlaminar stabilization is performed after decompression of stenosis at the affected level(s).</detailed_description>
