	<brief_summary>The present trial is a follow-up of AL203 study (NCT00343889). Primary Objectives: To describe the antibody persistence at 15 to 18 months of age and the booster effect of a dose of DTaP-HB-PRP~T or Tritanrix-HepB/Hib™ (given concomitantly with Oral Polio Vaccine [OPV]). Secondary Objective: To describe the safety profile of a booster dose of DTaP-HB-PRP~T or Tritanrix-HepB/Hib™ when administered concomitantly with OPV in each vaccine group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Study of Antibody Persistence and Booster Effect of DTaP-HB-PRP~T Combined Vaccine or Tritanrix-HepB/Hib™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will receive a booster vaccination of DTaP-HB-PRP~T or Tritanrix-HepB/Hib™ either concomitantly with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) following the completion of a three dose primary series with DTaP-Hep B-PRP-T combined vaccine or Tritanrix HepB/Hib™, both given concomitantly with OPV. Participants will receive a booster dose of the vaccine they had received in the primary series, and a concomitant dose of OPV Study AL203 (NCT00343889).</detailed_description>
