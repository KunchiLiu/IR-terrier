	<brief_summary>Retrospective studies have shown, that about half of the patients will have a recurrent episode after the first acute alcoholic pancreatitis. Of the patients in hospital, more than half annually are treated for recurrent acute pancreatitis. Because alcohol has been shown an important factor in the development of recurrent pancreatitis, it was hypothesized, that by attempting intensively to diminish the individual alcohol consumption the number of recurrent pancreatitis could be decreased. Two protocols will be compared: A) initial intervention against alcohol abuse and B) repeated interventions at 6 month intervals.</brief_summary>
