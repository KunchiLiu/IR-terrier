	<brief_title>The Effect of Toremifene Treatment to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Findings in Premenstrual Mastalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benign breast pain is a common complaint of women in western countries. As many as 41-69% of women reported having mastalgia sufficient to interfere with their daily routines. Approximately 8-10% of premenopausal women suffer monthly from moderate to severe breast pain.Tamoxifen has previously been found to be effective in reducing premenstrual mastalgia. We showed that another triphenylethylene derivative, toremifene, significantly alleviated cyclical breast pain as compared to placebo. In this study women suffering from cyclical breast pain are randomly allocated to receive toremifene (20mg) or placebo during the luteal phase for three consecutive cycles. The patients are then crossed over after a wash-out period to placebo or toremifene, respectively. The MRI investigations are made at two occasions during the premenstrual period after three cycles of toremifene and after three cycles of placebo.</detailed_description>
