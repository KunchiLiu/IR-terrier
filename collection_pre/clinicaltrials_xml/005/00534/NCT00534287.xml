	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis and septic shock are diseases of infectious origin with a high risk of death. Antibiotic therapy is mandatory but it is unknown whether one antibiotic alone is sufficient for initial therapy. The purpose of this study is to compare a therapy with meropenem alone or the combination of meropenem plus moxifloxacin in the treatment of severe sepsis/ septic shock. Patients randomly receive one of the two treatments for at least 7 days but not longer than 14 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Antibiotic Regimen (Meropenem Versus Meropenem+Moxifloxacin)in the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early intravenous empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is an essential part of sepsis therapy. Inadequacy of empirical antibiotic therapy is associated with an increased mortality rate. Carbapenems are designed for empirical antimicrobial monotherapy. Combination therapy has been suggested but efficiency remains to be proven. In this study, antimicrobial monotherapy with meropenem is compared with a combination therapy of meropenem and moxifloxacin. It is hypothesized that the superior antibiotic therapy is associated with a lower overall organ dysfunction in sepsis. Study therapy lasts for at least 7 days unless microbiological results suggest otherwise. Study therapy may be extended to 14 days. Follow up examinations occur at 28 and 90 days. This investigator initiated study is supported by the German government (bmbf) and unrestricted industrial grants.</detailed_description>
