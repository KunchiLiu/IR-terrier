	<brief_summary>Ischemic injury to muscular tissue is common in cardiovascular medicine. The most effective treatment to avoid ischemic damage is the rapid re-establishment of reperfusion. However, reperfusion itself can result in additional damage to ischemic tissue. This phenomenon is called ischemia - reperfusion (IR) injury and is caused by different pathologic mechanisms. Therapies are required which can be administered after the onset of an ischemic event to protect the tissue against IR injury. Therefore, a promising strategy to reduce IR injury is post-conditioning. Likewise, pharmacological therapies administered after the onset of reperfusion might prevent tissue injury. We have recently shown that high concentrations of exogenous vitamin C abrogate experimental IR injury of the forearm vasculature in patients with peripheral artery disease and in healthy subjects. Study hypothesis We hypothesize that the administration of mechanical post-conditioning or of high-dose vitamin C may protect skeletal muscle against IR injury. This shall be studied employing MR spectroscopy of the leg, which is an established model to assess muscle aerobic energy metabolism. Design Three periods, three way cross over study in 10 volunteers. One screening visit, three one-day study days with two washout periods of &gt;3 days in between are scheduled for each participant. The order of experimental days will be randomized. After the last treatment a final follow-up examination will be performed within one week.</brief_summary>
