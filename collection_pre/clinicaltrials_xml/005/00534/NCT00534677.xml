	<brief_summary>Terlipressin and Octreotide are two common agents used as adjuvants in the management of variceal bleeding. Both agents have been claimed equivalent to endoscopic therapy in randomized studies. There are no head to head clinical trials of these two agents available in the literature. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of Terlipressin and Octreotide in combination with Endoscopic Variceal band Ligation (EVL)in patients presenting with Esophageal Variceal Bleed (EVB).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety &amp; Efficacy of Terlipressin vs Octreotide for the Control of Variceal Bleed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of combining Endoscopic treatment with Octreotide or Terlipressin has not been prospectively studied in esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). This prospective, randomized clinical trial will help us in better patient management more efficiently and cost effectively.</detailed_description>
