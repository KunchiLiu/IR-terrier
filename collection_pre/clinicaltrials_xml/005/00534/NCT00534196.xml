	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Implant radiation therapy delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well implant radiation therapy using radioactive iodine works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implant Radiation Therapy Using Radioactive Iodine in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the efficacy of permanent brachytherapy with iodine I 125 seeds in patients with localized prostate cancer. - To determine the safety of this therapy in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo permanent brachytherapy seed implantation comprised of iodine I 125 into the prostate. Some patients may receive combination treatment (e.g., external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or hormone therapy in addition to brachytherapy). Quality of life and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is assessed and compared.</detailed_description>
