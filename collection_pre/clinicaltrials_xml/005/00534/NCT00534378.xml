	<brief_title>Phase I Trail for Intramuscular Administration of Midazolam Using An Autoinjector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational drug product being evaluated in this study is the Midazolam Autoinjector. This system is composed of an autoinjector filled with the drug product midazolam EP. The study drug is administered IM into the anterior thigh using the preloaded autoinjector. This method of administration was selected as it is the method that will be used in later clinical trials and for the marketed product. The autoinjectors were preloaded with midazolam 5 mg or 10 mg with a total volume of 1 or 2 mL. Healthy subjects are assigned to one of six target dosage groups (0.10, 0.18, 0.25, 0.33, 0.40, 0.49 mg/kg) and, based on their weight, received the necessary combination of fixed 5 or 10 mg doses to provide the assigned target dose.</detailed_description>
