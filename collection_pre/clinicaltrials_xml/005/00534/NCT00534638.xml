	<brief_summary>Genital infections with oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are common in both men and women. The most important disease associated with oncogenic HPV infection is cervical cancer, currently the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women globally. The current study is designed to evaluate the overall impact of HPV immunization in adolescents 12-15 years of age. This protocol posting has been updated following protocol amendment 09, 24 March 2014. The sections impacted are secondary objectives, endpoints, final analyses.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study participants who the investigator or delegate believes that they and/or their parents/legally acceptable representative can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits) should be enrolled in the study. A male or female between, and including, 12 and 15 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. A written informed assent must be obtained from all study participants prior to enrolment. In addition, a written informed consent must be obtained from the study participants' parent or legally acceptable representative. Note: As according to the Finnish law legal age of consent is 15 years, a written informed consent form can be obtained from study participants aged 15 years old and their parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) will receive a letter informing them of their child participation to the study. Healthy male and female study participants as established by medical history before entering into the study. If needed, a historydirected clinical examination will be performed by the investigator or delegate (e.g. study nurse). Study participants must not be pregnant. Absence of pregnancy should be verified (e.g. urine pregnancy test) as per investigator's or delegate's clinical judgement. If the study participant is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential, i.e. be abstinent, have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be postmenopausal or premenarcheal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must use adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination and continue for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Previous vaccination against HPV or Hepatitis B virus. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness, i.e. Oral temperature &lt;37.5°C (99.5°F) / Axillary temperature &lt;37.5°C (99.5°F) / Rectal temperature &lt;38°C (100.4°F).)
