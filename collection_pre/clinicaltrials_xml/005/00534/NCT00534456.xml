	<brief_summary>The purpose of Study 20060172 was to measure echocardiographic parameters and biomarkers in a subgroup of study subjects enrolled in Study 20050222 (the RED-HF Trial). This substudy 20060172 was terminated early due to feasibility constraints. All subjects enrolled in 20060172 were also enrolled in Study 20050222, which is ongoing. Study data will be analyzed when Study 20050222 ends, since unblinding before then would adversely affect Study 20050222.</brief_summary>
