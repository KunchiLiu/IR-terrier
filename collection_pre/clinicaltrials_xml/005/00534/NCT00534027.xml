	<brief_summary>Part 1 is complete. Part 2 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 segment that will commence upon identification of the maximum tolerated dose in part 1. The Primary objective of Part 2 of the study is to estimate efficacy in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Subjects in each of the 3 arms will receive up to 6 cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatin (at the same dose and schedule in part 1) in combination with either AMG 655 at the maximum tolerated dose (Arm 1), AMG 655 at a lower dose (Arm 2), or AMG 655 placebo (Arm 3) IV Q3W. Randomization will be stratified by ECOG (0 or 1) and disease stage (IIIb or IV/recurrent).</brief_summary>
