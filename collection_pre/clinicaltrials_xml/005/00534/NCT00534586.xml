	<brief_title>Anesthetics and Auditory, Visceral, and Heat Evoked Potentials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During surgery patients are exposed to different auditory and sensory stimuli. In this study we investigate the influence of different anesthetics to alertness and nociception. In addition to auditory stimuli (AEP as a measure of sedation), Contact Heat Evoked Potential Stimuli (CHEPS), and esophageal evoked potentials from the lower 1/3 of the esophagus are measured to quantify the effects of anesthetics. 60 Volunteers are enrolled into this study. For each drug, three different levels are measured: - level 1 no medication - level 2 low dose of medication - level 3 light sedation dose (volunteer responds to command) Four drugs are measured in the study: propofol, sevoflurane, S-ketamine and remifentanil.</detailed_description>
