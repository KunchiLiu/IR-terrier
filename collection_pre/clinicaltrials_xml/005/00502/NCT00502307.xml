	<brief_summary>This phase 2 trial is evaluating the antineoplastic activity of tivozanib (AV-951) in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic renal cell cancer. Tivozanib (AV-951) is a VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Tivozanib (AV-951), an Oral VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, in the Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 200 patients will be enroled into the initial, 16 week, open-label period using 1.5 mg/day dosing. Patients will receive tivozanib (AV-951) continuously for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off study drug. Patients will undergo disease assessment at baseline and after Cycles 2 and 4 and response will be determined by RESIST criteria. After the initial, 16 week open-label period, disease status will be assessed and compared to baseline using modified RECIST criteria: - Patients with greater than or equal to 25% tumor shrinkage will continue on their current dose of tivozanib (AV-951) - Patients with less than 25% tumor change (growth or shrinkage) will be randomly assigned to double-blind tivozanib (AV-951) or matching placebo for 12 weeks - Patients with greater than or equal to 25% tumor growth will be discontinued</detailed_description>
