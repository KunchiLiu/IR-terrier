	<brief_summary>Following acute mastoiditis there is a possible risk to develop hearing loss. The cause could be either possible involvement of the inner ear, or in cases that underwent surgery, secondary to the effect of the drill's noise. Extended hearing test will be performed for 25 children that suffered acute mastoiditis that resolved with conservative treatment and compared with 25 children that needed surgical intervention.</brief_summary>
