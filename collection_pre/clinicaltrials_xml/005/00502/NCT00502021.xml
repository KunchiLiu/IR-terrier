	<brief_summary>Preliminary studies have shown that flaxseed powder, rich in the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid,is beneficial for the general inflammation present in morbidly obese subjects by decreasing elevated serum markers.As omega-3 fatty acids display additional properties including possible amelioration of atherosclerosis,a 3-month supplementation protocol was devised.Arterial stiffness and intima thickness will be measured in severely obese subjects, in order to document possible reduction of these variables as well.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Population:Morbidly obese non-smoking patients of the Department of Gastroenterology, candidates for possible bariatric treatment Criteria for inclusion: Males and females, 18- 65 years old, body mass index/BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 (or &gt; 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities), non-hospitalized and receiving general oral diet, with elevated C-reactive protein/ CRP (&gt; 5mg/L), and signing informed consent; Criteria for exclusion: SIRS, shock, coma or organ failure, fever or infectious foci, cancer with or without chemo/radiotherapy, inflammatory illnesses (rhematic, gastrointestinal or other), transplantation or immunologic diseases, trauma, surgery or hospitalization in the last 30 days, use of steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating agents or antibiotics, and refusal to participate in the study; Dietetic routine: Daily flaxseed powder (Farinha de linhaca dourada) 60 g/day (232 kcal , containing 10 g of alpha-linolenic acid/ALA) or placebo (commercial manioc flour 60 g/day, 120 kcal)) during 12 weeks. An additional 60 subjects (30 patients, 30 controls) will ve managed with 30 ml/day flaxseed oil (10 g of alpha-linolenic acid/ALA) or 30 ml/day placebo (safflower oil).
