	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of ramipril in preventing a urinary protein to creatinine ratio (U p/c) greater than 0.5 following conversion to sirolimus from a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) in maintenance kidney transplant patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Receiving cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (TAC) since the first month posttransplant. In addition to a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), subjects must be treated with either corticosteroids at a dosage range of 2.5 to 15 mg/day for prednisone or prednisolone (2 to 12mg/day for methylprednisolone or the alternate day equivalent) or a steroidfree regimen for a minimum of 12 weeks before randomization or either MMF (&gt;/=500mg/day), mycophenolate sodium (MPS) (&gt;/=360 mg/day) or AZA (&gt;/=50mg/day). Subjects must be taking a minimum of 2 immunosuppressive drugs if on a steroidfree regimen. Subject is 3 to 60 months after renal transplantation. Subject is greater than 12 weeks after treatment for any acute rejection. Subjects who are currently receiving, or have received within 4 weeks before enrollment, RAAS blockade. Subjects with a calculated GFR &lt; 40mL/min (per the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD7] or abbreviated MDRD formula). Subjects with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (U p/c) of &gt;0.3. Subjects with a history of uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (SBP &gt;140 mm Hg). Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Grade C ChildPugh score). Additional Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria apply.</criteria>
