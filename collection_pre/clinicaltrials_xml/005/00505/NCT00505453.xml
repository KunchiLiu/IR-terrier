	<brief_summary>Vaccination is currently the most effective means of controlling influenza and preventing its complications and mortality in persons at risk. Once a year, a meeting of WHO experts takes place, leading to a recommendation on the influenza A and B strains that should be used for the production of vaccine for the coming influenza season.
