	<brief_summary>Autism is considered as an invading disorder of the development. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a particular form of autism and is difficult to diagnose. The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) has been developed in order to measure the degree of autistic traits in autistic adolescent with normal intelligence (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001, 2006). AQ comprises 50 questions, with 5 groups of 10 questions assessing imagination, social skills, attention switching, attention to detail and communication skills. Each of these items scores 1 point if the respondent records abnormal or autistic like behaviour. The minimum score on the AQ is 0 and the maximum 50. The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the French version of Autism Spectrum Quotient questionnaire. Secondary objectives are to: Evaluate if EQ and SQ can distinguish adolescents without psychiatric syndromes from those with classical autism or AS. Evaluate if AQ, EQ and SQ can distinguish adolescents with psychiatric disorders from autistic adolescents. Define the threshold of positivity for the 3 questionnaires.</brief_summary>
