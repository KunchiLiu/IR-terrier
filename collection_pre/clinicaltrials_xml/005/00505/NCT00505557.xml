	<brief_title>Dual-Plane Breast Augmentation: Axillary Approach With Assistant of Endoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual plane augmentation mammoplasty is a logical approach to realize the benefits of retromammary and partial retropectoral implant placement while minimizing the tradeoffs of other pocket locations. Traditionally, dual plane augmentation has been performed using transareolar or inframammary fold approach. However, the approach is unacceptable to Chinese patients because of the front scar formation. For aesthetic reasons, the axillary incision is more acceptable approach for augmentation mammoplasty. The endoscope assistant technique has been widely used in transaxillary breast augmentation. It provides the feasibility to perform dual plane breast augmentation by axillary approach. In this research, at least 40 patients with light degree of glandular ptotic and constricted lower pole breasts are selected to receive soft cohesive gel microtextured anatomic style silicone implants. Portions of the pectoralis major muscle is split without its release from the costal margin with the help of a 10mm, 30Â°endoscope and endoscopic diathermy scissors through a 4-cm incision in the axilla each side. Bleeding during surgery is kept to the minimum. The results of outcomes, operative time, bleeding volume, drainage volume, complications are observed.</detailed_description>
