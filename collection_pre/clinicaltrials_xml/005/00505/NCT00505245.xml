	<brief_title>M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) Validation Study in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You may be asked to provide some personal information. You will also be asked to complete surveys that measure your mood and quality of life. You will be asked to complete one or more symptom surveys. Completing these surveys takes 10-25 minutes. In order to understand symptoms that are specific to a particular cancer, cancer stage, or treatment, the research staff may ask you questions about symptoms you have had since you were diagnosed. The interviewer may ask follow-up questions to get more complete information about your symptoms. Interviews are digitally recorded and then transcribed (written out in text) later. Completing the interview along with other surveys takes about 45 minutes total. During your treatment, you may be asked to complete the symptom survey using the paper and pencil method, or a secure electronic method, or you may be asked to complete it over the telephone. If you are asked to use the phone method, we will use an interactive voice response (IVR) telephone system to contact you to find out about symptoms you may be experiencing. The research study staff will ask you for a convenient time for the system to call. How often the system will call you during your treatment depends on the type of treatment you are receiving. The research study staff will give you more information about the schedule of calls to expect for the study and the times you will be asked to complete the mood and quality of life surveys over the course of your treatment. Information about your symptoms in this study is collected for research purposes only. If you are experiencing severe or troublesome symptoms, you should report them to your doctor or nurse as well as rating them on the symptom assessment questionnaire. If the data collector notices that you have rated a symptom as severe, the data collector will ask you if your doctor or nurse is aware of the symptom or if you intend to report the symptom to your doctor or nurse. If you have not or do not intend to report the symptom, the data collector will let you know that he or she will report the symptom to your doctor or nurse. This is an investigational study. Up to 4,500 participants will participate in this multicenter study. Up to 4,000 will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Up to 500 will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.</detailed_description>
