	<brief_summary>Suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles at primary cesarean delivery is a common practice about which there are no data. Some Obstetricians believe that suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles increases post-operative pain, and it may decrease adhesions, yet there are no published data to support or refute these claims. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of rectus muscle reapproximation at cesarean delivery and post-operative pain. We also plan to assess the impact of rectus muscle closure on adhesions as seen at repeat cesarean delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Study of Rectus Muscle Closure at Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are more than 1 million cesarean deliveries performed annually in the United States, at a rate of 30.2% of all deliveries. Data are limited regarding optimal surgical closure techniques to minimize adhesions at cesarean. Adhesions are implicated in pelvic pain, infertility, difficult repeat surgery, and bowel obstruction. Practice techniques regarding rectus muscle reapproximation vary widely, and there are no data regarding the impact of this step on pain, and some data suggesting a reduction in significant adhesions. Given the frequency of cesarean deliveries, small changes in surgical technique may yield significant benefits. We hope to learn 1) whether suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles increases pain, and 2) the degree to which suture reapproximation of the rectus muscles alters adhesions when studied in a prospective, randomized trial. All patients undergoing primary cesarean delivery at Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital (LPCH) will be offered the study. Once consented, patients will be randomized to one of two standardized closure techniques at cesarean: two-layer uterine closure, peritoneal closure, fascial and skin closure, and either reapproximation of the rectus muscles with three-interrupted sutures, or non-closure. Intra-operative and post-operative pain management will be standardized. Subjects will undergo pain assessments while in-house on post-operative days 1 and 3, and at the standard post-partum clinic visit after 6 weeks. These assessments will require less than 5 minutes of the patient's time. Patients will be shown a pain chart, and will be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 at rest. They will then stand up and rate their pain again. Pain medication usage will also be assessed. The surgeons will know the groups to which the patients are randomized. The patients and those collecting data on pain scores will not. Primary Endpoint: combined opioid use and movement pain score (Silverman Integrated Assessment-SIA) 72 post-operative hours. Secondary Endpoint: surgical complications, maternal satisfaction with analgesia.</detailed_description>
