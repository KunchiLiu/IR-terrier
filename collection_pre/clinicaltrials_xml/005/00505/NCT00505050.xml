	<brief_summary>Recent meta-analysis reported reduction in mortality and hospitalization of HF patients.However, important issues in DMP for HF remain to be resolved. DMP are not homogeneous concerning methodology and in general included only elderly patients; most were tested in high-risk HF patients discharged from hospital; quality of life results are controversial; few reports included long-term results; some protocols had limited enrollment of screened patients, and it was suggested that could be less effective when patients are already followed by HF specialist.Improved survival was associated with cardiologist care as well with multidisciplinary teams providing specialized follow-up.Whether both together could benefits HF is not well defined. Also, no studies reported the long-term effects of a cyclic repetitive reeducation program.We tested whether a DMP that consisted of a long-term repetitive education program associated with a telephone monitoring could benefit HF outpatients in usual ambulatory care already under care of cardiologist with experience in HF</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible patients on ambulatory care were aged 18 years or older with irreversible chronic heart .failure with at least 6 months duration, and non planned surgical procedure or other procedure that could influence the followup in the next 6 months impossibility for attendance of education sessions and monitoring based on non corrected limitations of transport, or unfavorable distance, or social, or of communication; myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before randomization; cardiac surgery or angioplasty within 6 months randomization; hospitalized patients or recent discharged patients; severe renal/hepatic/neurological/pulmonary or any systemic disease that could confuse the interpretation of results and impair expected survival; and pregnant women or women of childbearing potential.</criteria>
