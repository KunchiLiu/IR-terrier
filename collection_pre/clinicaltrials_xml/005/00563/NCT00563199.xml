	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse delivered stage-matched intervention to cardiac patients for cessation of tobacco use. Review of literature shows that there is a clear lack of empirical evidence on (1) using nurses to deliver stage-matched smoking cessation interventions, and (2) the effectiveness of such intervention for cardiac patients in Chinese populations. The ultimate goal of the intervention achieve a higher quit rate in the intervention group than in the controls. In addition, the change in the patient's smoking behaviour such as reduction of the number of cigarettes smoked, and progression to a higher stage of readiness to quit, will also be measured. This study is the first step to address the urgently needed data for (1) promoting the delivery of nurse-run stage-matched smoking cessation interventions to help patients stop smoking, (2) developing smoking cessation policy and programmes in the hospitals and for the health care system, and (3) contributing an evidence-based approach to orientate clinical services towards prevention, so as to reduce premature deaths and the enormous disease burden of our society.</brief_summary>
