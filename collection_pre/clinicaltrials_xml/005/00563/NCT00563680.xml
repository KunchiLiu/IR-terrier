	<brief_summary>Single-arm, open-label study of AMG 479 in up to 35 subjects with Ewing's Family Tumors (EFTs) and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors (DSRCTs) who have progressed or recurred after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. An exploratory cohort of an additional up to 10 subjects with prior exposure to anti-IGF-1R therapy and who have progressed or recurred after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
