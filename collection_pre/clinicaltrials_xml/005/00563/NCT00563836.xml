	<brief_title>Phase II Study of the Trifunctional Antibody Catumaxomab Administered Intra- and Postoperatively in Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open label, multi-center, single-arm, phase II study according to FlemingÂ´s one-stage design. The surgical procedure on Day 0 will be performed according to AGO State of the Art, followed by one intraoperative and four postoperative intraperitoneal administrations of catumaxomab within 16 days. The Discharge Visit will be performed when the patient is leaving the hospital but not earlier than 1 day after the last infustion, followed by the End of Study Visit on Day 30. Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody targeting EpCAM on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these different immune effector cells, which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.</detailed_description>
