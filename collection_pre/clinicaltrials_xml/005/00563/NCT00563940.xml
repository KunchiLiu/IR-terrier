	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular edema is a common complication of ocular diabetes mellitus and can cause blindness. Hypoxygenation of the retina stimulates tissue mediators, especially different subtypes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is responsible for proliferation, extension and increased permeability of the vessels. The aim of our study was to examine the short-term effect of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin® 1.25 mg in 0.05 ml) and triamcinolone on visual acuity and central retinal thickness in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema (CSME).</brief_summary>
