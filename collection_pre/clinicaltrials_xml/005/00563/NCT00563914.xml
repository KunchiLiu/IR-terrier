	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess the safety of different doses of ferroquine with artesunate (AS) in adult African patients with uncomplicated malaria. The secondary objectives are to assess activity in reducing parasitemia and the pharmacokinetics of ferroquine and its metabolites.</brief_summary>
