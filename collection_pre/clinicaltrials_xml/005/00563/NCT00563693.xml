	<brief_title>Chronic Heart Failure - Cheyne Stokes Respiration - CS2 (3C-study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure (HF) is one of the most important public health problems in cardiovascular medicine. Several patients with chronic heart failure also has Cheyne Stokes respiration pattern. Earlier studies have shown that this respiration pattern improves with Adaptive servo ventilator. We wish to investigate wether this leads to improved cardiac function.</detailed_description>
