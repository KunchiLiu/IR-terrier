	<brief_summary>PET imaging of activated microglia offers a tool of investigation of a range of brain diseases where neuroinflammation is a component. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most frequent motoneuronal disease in adult. This study was designed to explore the feasibility of molecular imaging modality by Positron Emission Tomography using 18F-X as an in vivo marker of activated microglia for the assessment of neuroinflammation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. PET may help in the diagnosis of the disease and, further, may allow assessment of the efficacy of antiinflammatory treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Imaging Modality by Positron Emission Tomography Using 18F-X : Study of Microglial Activation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18F-X PET will be carried out requiring arterial sampling in 2 patients suffering from ALS and 2 normal subjects in order to evaluate the 18F-X quantification. Then simplified PET using 18F-X will be carried out in 13 patients and 13 normal subjects. Binding potential maps showing specific binding of 18f-X will be generated for each subject. Regional binding potential values will be calculated for anatomically defined regions of interest after coregistration to and special transformation into the subject's own MRI.</detailed_description>
