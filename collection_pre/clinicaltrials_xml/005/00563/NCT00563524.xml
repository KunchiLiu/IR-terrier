	<criteria>Men and Women of nonchildbearing potential 18 years or older. Physician Area and Severity Index (PASI) greater than 11. Physician Global Assessment (PGA) greater than 3. Use of any investigational small molecule drug within 30 days before the first dose of test article administration, and use of any investigational biologic agents within 5 half lives before study day 1, or 90 days for investigational biologics that may have a long clinical duration of effect. Live vaccines within 3 months before test article administration or during the study. Use of any biologic therapy within approximately 5 halflives before test article administration. Approximate halflives of biologic therapies approved for psoriasis are as follows: Enbrel, 5 days; Humira, 14 days; Remicade, 9 days; Amevive, 12 days; Raptiva, 6 days. It is recommended that Amevive be discontinued for at least 90 days because of its long clinical duration of action. Psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) therapy within 4 weeks before study day 1. Ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy within 2 weeks before study day 1. Receipt of systemic psoriasis therapy (eg, oral retinoids, methotrexate, hydroxyurea, cyclosporine, or azathioprine) or systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks before study day 1. Topical steroids, topical vitamin A or D analog preparations, or anthralin within 2 weeks before study day 1. (Exception: topical therapies, including steroids at no higher than mild strength [class 6 or 7 topical corticosteroids], are permitted on the scalp, axillae, face, and groin, but the dose of the medication must be kept stable throughout the trial.)</criteria>
