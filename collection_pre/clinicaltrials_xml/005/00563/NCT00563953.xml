	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, uncontrolled, open label, multicenter study of a primary chemotherapy regimen consisting of four cycles of liposomal pegylated doxorubicine 35 mg/m² IV plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² on Day 1 every 4 weeks followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m²/week for 12 weeks before surgery in breast cancer patients at risk of developing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Surgery (tumorectomy, quadrantectomy, or mastectomy plus lymphadenectomy) will be performed 2 to 5 weeks after the last primary chemotherapy infusion. Patients with &gt; 10% of hormone receptor-positive cells will receive appropriate hormone therapy according to menopausal status. Patients treated with breast-conserving surgery will receive radiation therapy to the mammary gland. Patients with T4 tumors or significant axillary involvement (≥ ypN2) will receive radiation therapy to the breast or chest wall and to the lymph node chains.</detailed_description>
