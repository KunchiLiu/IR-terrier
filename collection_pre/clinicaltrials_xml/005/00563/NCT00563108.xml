	<brief_summary>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) contributes substantially to transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Steroids remains first line therapy for acute GVHD but there is currently no consensus on second line therapy for those in whom steroids have been ineffective. Basiliximab has been shown to be a safe and effective immunosuppresant in the prevention and treatment of rejection after renal transplantation and its role in acute GVHD prophylaxis and treatment has been described favourably. This is a randomized control trial to investigate its efficacy and safety in the management of acute GVHD post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).</brief_summary>
