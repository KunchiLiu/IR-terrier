	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of tivozanib (AV-951) and Torisel™ given in combination for renal cell cancer. The study will also assess the effects of the combination of tivozanib (AV-951) and Torisel™ on the tumor. Tivozanib (AV-951) is a VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Temsirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor which is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b, Open-Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety of Tivozanib (AV-951) in Combination With Temsirolimus in Subjects With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-finding study of tivozanib (AV-951) in combination with temsirolimus to include approximately 36 subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenomic, and antineoplastic activity of tivozanib (AV-951) when administered in combination with temsirolimus. Tivozanib (AV-951) will be administered once daily for 3 weeks beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by 1 week off (1 cycle = 4 weeks). Temsirolimus will be administered intravenously once weekly starting on Day 8 of Cycle 1.</detailed_description>
