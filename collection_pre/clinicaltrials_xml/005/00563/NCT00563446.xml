	<brief_summary>Anaemia is a common consequence of chronic renal failure. Darbepoetin alfa is a unique erythropoietic protein that stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropietin and conventional recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). Darbepoetin alfa has been shown to have a serum half-life 3-fold longer than that of rHuEPO, which allows dosing at extended intervals and less frequent injection. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa therapy given at an extended once monthly dosing interval in the treatment of renal anaemia in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</brief_summary>
