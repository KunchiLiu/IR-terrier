	<brief_summary>There is a significant (50-80%) risk of acute graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) and early mortality (30%) associated with high risk stem cell transplantation (SCT) such as that from a matched unrelated donor or HLA-mismatch sibling. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to be an effective and safe immunosuppressant in the prevention and treatment of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Its role in acute GVHD prophylaxis in high risk SCT will be investigated in this clinical trial.</brief_summary>
