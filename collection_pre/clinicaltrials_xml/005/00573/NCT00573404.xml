	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate and sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of imatinib mesylate given together with sunitinib in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate and Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in combination with sunitinib malate in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. - To determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - To determine the antitumor activity in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-14 in course 1 and on days 1-42 in all subsequent courses. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples are collected on day 15 and day 43 for pharmacokinetics. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.</detailed_description>
