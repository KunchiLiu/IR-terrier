PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well internal radiation therapy works in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internal Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the feasibility of high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (without the use of external-beam radiotherapy) as definitive treatment for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. - To assess acceptable toxicity, defined as treatment related toxicity (urinary and rectal), no worse than that seen by patients treated with conventional therapy (grade 3 urinary toxicity &lt; 10% and grade 3 rectal toxicity &lt; 10%). Secondary - To achieve adequate dosimetric coverage of the prostate comparable to current standards. - To assess the effect of treatment on sexual function. OUTLINE: Patients undergo 4 high-dose rate brachytherapy treatments over 2 days. Patients complete bladder, bowel, sexual function, and quality of life questionnaires, including the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, the International Prostate Symptom Score Index (IPSS), and the MSKCC Prostate Quality of Life questionnaire at baseline and then at every follow-up visit. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
