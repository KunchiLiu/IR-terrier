	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Aromatase inhibition therapy using letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known whether sorafenib is more effective than a placebo when given together with letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane in treating metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works compared with a placebo when given together with letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane in treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib and Letrozole, Anastrozole, or Exemestane in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Estrogen Receptor-Positive and/or Progesterone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To compare the progression-free survival of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate vs placebo and letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane. Secondary - To compare the overall survival and time to treatment failure of patients treated with these regimens. - To compare the objective tumor response rate and duration of response in patients treated with these regimens. - To assess the adverse event profile of sorafenib tosylate in combination with aromatase inhibitors in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior aromatase inhibitor therapy (yes vs no) and line of endocrine therapy for metastatic disease (first-line vs second-line). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily and oral letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane once daily on days 1-28. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily and oral letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane once daily on days 1-28. In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
