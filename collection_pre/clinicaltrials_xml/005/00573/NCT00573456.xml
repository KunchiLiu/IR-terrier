	<brief_title>Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which glucose is not sufficiently metabolized. This results in high glucose levels in blood and glucose in the urine. Cells can starve because glucose is not being metabolized. Both types of diabetes can cause dangerous complications, including blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, and kidney failure. A decrease in circulation may eventually require the amputation of limbs. We are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the central nervous system, the viscera and the endocrine system has the potential to enhance the immune system; thereby improving the health of the patients.</detailed_description>
