	<brief_summary>To determine whether targeting lower arterial oxygen saturations from the day of birth alters the early (first 3 months) postnatal development of the control of ventilation and the hypercapnic and hyperoxic responses in very preterm infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Targeting Lower Arterial Oxygen Saturations on the Development of Control of Breathing in Very Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To measure the effects of baseline oxygenation in extremely low birth weight preterm infants on: i) The early (first 5 breaths) and late or steady state (3-5 minutes) ventilatory response to CO2 ii) The immediate (&lt; 1 minute) ventilatory response to hyperoxia iii) The PCO2 apneic threshold iv) The breathing pattern during quiet and REM sleep v) The morphology of periodic breathing cycles vi) The incidence and morphology of sighs</detailed_description>
