	<brief_summary>High blood pressure is one of the most common health problems in the United States. There are many drug treatment options for high blood pressure, but these medications are not always effective. People with treated high blood pressure can still suffer from other serious cardiovascular health problems, including heart attack, sudden death, or stroke. Genetic variations may cause some people to be more susceptible to these cardiovascular outcomes despite treatment. This study will identify new gene regions that may influence the effectiveness of high blood pressure drugs in preventing the above mentioned cardiovascular conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analyzing Gene Regions That May Interact With the Effectiveness of High Blood Pressure Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure affects nearly one in three individuals in the United States. There are many factors that can cause high blood pressure, including family history and genetic traits, kidney disease, stress, diabetes, and diet. If left untreated, high blood pressure can increase one's risk for stroke, heart attack, and heart failure. There are four major classes of drugs used to treat high blood pressure, which include diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. Each class works differently in treating high blood pressure, and certain gene regions may affect the effectiveness of the various high blood pressure drugs. The purpose of this study is to identify new gene regions that may influence the effectiveness of the four major high blood pressure drug types in preventing a heart attack, sudden death, or stroke. This study will draw upon specimens and data from three large population-based studies: the Group Health population, the Cardiovascular Heart Study, and the Jackson Heart Study. New samples of DNA and laboratory data will only be collected from participants in the Group Health population. The remaining samples will be pre-existing samples from the other two studies. Through a whole-genome study of the DNA samples, researchers will distinguish genomic regions of interest for the four major drug classes to identify associations between the drugs and genes in the population. Researchers will further genotype the "interesting" genomic regions discovered in the whole-genome study. Ethnic-specific genetic variations will also be identified to fully characterize the genetic variations. The study will be replicated to assess the validity of the findings.</detailed_description>
