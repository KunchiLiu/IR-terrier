	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib and pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, etoposide, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and pemetrexed may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib when given together with cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and pemetrexed in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Combined With Cisplatin and Etoposide or Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the recommended phase II dose and maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate when administered in combination with cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and pemetrexed disodium in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Secondary - To characterize the toxicities of these regimens in these patients. - To evaluate the efficacy of these regimens in these patients, as measured by RECIST criteria or by tumor markers, if applicable (e.g., PSA, CA-125). - To determine the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib tosylate when administered in combination with etoposide in these patients (samples are no longer being collected and studies are no longer being performed as of 1/8/09). OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. - Group 1: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2 of courses 1 and 2 and on day 1 of all subsequent courses; etoposide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3; and oral sorafenib tosylate once or twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. - Group 2: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive sorafenib tosylate as in group 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients in group 1 undergo blood sample collection on day 1 of courses 1 and 2 for pharmacokinetic studies (samples are no longer being collected and studies are no longer being performed as of 1/8/09). After finishing treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.</detailed_description>
