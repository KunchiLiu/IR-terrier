	<brief_summary>Prior studies in animal models have established that the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is regulated in part by the effects of chronic alcohol abuse on hepatic methionine metabolism. The hypothesis of the clinical study was that provision of the methionine metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) would correct abnormal hepatic methionine metabolism thereby effectively treating ALD. The two goals of the clinical research were a)to determine the clinical relationship of aberrant hepatic methionine metabolism to ALD by comparisons of patterns of serum methionine metabolites in groups of ALD patients, alcoholics without liver disease, and normal healthy subjects, and b) to determine the treatment effects of SAM on patterns of serum methionine metabolites and on the histopathology and biochemical features of liver injury in ALD patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We assessed a total of 297 potential ALD candidates, from whom 40 were enrolled in the study. In addition, we enrolled 26 gender matched active alcohol drinkers without liver disease (AD) and 28 age and gender matched healthy control subjects (HS). Of the original 40 ALD subjects who provided initial enrollment data, 3 declined to proceed with the trial. Therefore, 37 ALD patients were randomized to receive SAM at a dose of 400 mg or placebo three times daily for 24 weeks. However 11 of these dropped out after initial evaluation, leaving 26 ALD patients, 13 in each arm, who completed the 24 week trial.</detailed_description>
