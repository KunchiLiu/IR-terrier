	<brief_title>Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for Bipolar Condition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 2000 study in the American Journal of Psychiatry reported that, "in those with bipolar, two major areas of the brain contain 30 percent more cells that send signals to other brain cells". This fact explains why famous people with the Bipolar condition like astronaut Buzz Aldrin, financier Robert Campeau, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, composer Mozart, scientist Isaac Newton, physician Sigmund Freud and media giant &amp; entrepreneur Ted Turner, excelled in life due to the additional brain power! The excessive brain power, however, had to be controlled occasionally with mood stabilizers. Mood stabilizers include a number of anticonvulsants and Lithium. These medications, however, have adverse side effects on the kidneys. The proposed evaluation does not have any adverse health effects.</detailed_description>
