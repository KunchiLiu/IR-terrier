This medication, for the purpose of this trial, is used as a short-term sedative for infants who are immediately post-operative from cardiac surgery and have a breathing tube and are breathing with the assistance of a mechanical ventilator or breathing machine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding Dexmedetomidine In Infants Post-Operative From Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, dose escalation study of a single bolus dose of dexmedetomidine followed by a continuous infusion for up to 24 hours in infants who are immediately post-operative from cardiac surgery and require tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation in the post-operative period. Three bolus doses and infusion doses will be administered to a total of 36 evaluable patients.</detailed_description>
