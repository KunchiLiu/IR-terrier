	<brief_title>Energy Specific Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive parathyroid glands secrete an excess of parathyroid hormones, resulting in increased levels of calcium in the blood stream, which can lead to weakening of the bones and to kidney stones. We are postulating that the non-invasive energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the central nervous system, the viscera and the endocrine system has the potential to stop the over secretion of the parathyroid hormones and normalize the body's metabolic functions.</detailed_description>
