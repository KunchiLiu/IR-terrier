	<brief_summary>Transobturatory tape (TOT) procedure is a minimally invasive approach to urinary stress incontinence owing to the category of the sling-adopting procedures. Its efficacy and safety, also in comparison with similar procedures have been demonstrated. The benefits of the sling- adopting procedures in comparison to laparoscopic Burch colposuspension, which has been considered as the gold standard treatment, have been showed. But these comparisons did not included the TOT procedure in the experimental arms. Based on this considerations the aim of this trial will be to compare TOT and laparoscopic Burch colposuspension in women with urinary stress incontinence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Burch Colposuspension Versus Transobturatory Tape for the Treatment of Female Urinary Stress Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with predominant and genuine stress urinary incontinence will be enrolled and randomized in two groups (groups A and B). Patients of group A will be treated with laparoscopic Burch colposuspension, whereas patients of group B will be treated with TOT procedure. All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric, clinical, hormonal, urodynamic, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the surgical outcomes, the clinical subjective and objective efficacy data, and the adverse experiences will be evaluated in each patient. Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less will be considered significant.</detailed_description>
