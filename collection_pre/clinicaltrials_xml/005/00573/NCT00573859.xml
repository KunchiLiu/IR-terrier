	<brief_summary>Whereas the smoking prevalence rates in the general population are declining, rates among people diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to be elevated. Smoking may be a form of self-medication in people with ADHD, which has specific reinforcing mechanisms such as improvement of ADHD core symptoms, enhancement of moods and arousal, or a combination of both. In addition, the reinforcing effects of smoking may be potentiated by stimulant medication. The study examined the reinforcing effects of ad libitum smoking with and without ADHD medication in adult smokers with clinically diagnosed ADHD. Participants were adults with ADHD. The effects of two day of ADHD medication compared to two days on placebo for were studied on nicotine intake (i.e., cotinine levels). In addition, task performance on the Continuous Performance Task and nicotine withdrawal symptoms were examined in response to ADHD medication + smoking a cigarette versus ADHD medication + abstinence versus placebo medication + smoking versus placebo medication + abstinence. The study identified the reinforcing mechanisms of smoking in interaction with ADHD medication. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of nicotine addiction and facilitate the development of targeted smoking cessation and prevention programs for individuals with ADHD and other people with deficiencies in impulse control and excessive risk taking.</brief_summary>
