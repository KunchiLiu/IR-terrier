	<brief_summary>Cilostazol is an antiplatelet agent used to reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication. Cilostazol inhibits phosphodiesterase III (PDE III), which causes it to be a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Recently there were report of beneficial effect of cilostazol like vasodilation, lipid metabolism, and cytokine production. But there were few clinical studies that support these effects of cilostazol. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effect of cilostazol presented by PWV and plasma adipocytokines.</brief_summary>
