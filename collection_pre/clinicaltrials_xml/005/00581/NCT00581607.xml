	<brief_summary>Patients with advanced sarcoidosis often develop pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a condition where the right side of the heart has to push the blood though the lungs at a higher pressure than normal. Since this pressure is higher, it is harder for the heart to pump the blood through the lungs to the left side of the body. If the blood can not get through the lungs, it can not get pumped through the rest of the body. This leads to weakness and shortness of breath. This type of hypertension does not usually respond to regular blood pressure medicines. The purpose of this study is to determine if bosentan (Tracleer) will help sarcoidosis associated pulmonary hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Blind, Randomized Trial of Bosentan for Sarcoidosis Associated Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized in 2:1 manner to receive either bosentan or placebo for 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, there will be an additional 32 weeks of an open label extension.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with known sarcoidosis 21. Age 18 or greater Patients with documented pulmonary hypertension with a PA mean &gt; 25 mm Hg as measured by cardiac catheterization within six months of entry into the study. Pulmonary artery occluding pressure and or left ventricular end diastolic pressure must be less than 15 mm Hg. Patients with WHO class II or III Six minute walk distance of between 100 to 500 meters Patients on stable immunotherapy for their sarcoidosis, including prednisone, methotrexate, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and/or infliximab Patients able to provide written consent Patients on pulmonary vasodilator drugs (flolan, remodulin, bosentan, sildenafil) n the prior 28 days. Patients on stable dose of calcium channel blocker for more than 1 month prior to right heart catheterization can be continued on the calcium channel blocker. Patients with severe airway obstruction as defined by FEV1/FVC of less than 35% Patients with World Health Organization (WHO) class IV status. Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding Patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% Cardiac index &lt; 2.0 liters and/or right atrial pressure &gt;15 mm Hg Significant liver dysfunction not due to sarcoidosis. Patients with severe other organ disease felt by investigators to impact on survival during the course of the study. Patients unable to perform the 6 minute walk study</criteria>
