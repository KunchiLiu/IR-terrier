	<brief_summary>Women who undergo posterior colporrhaphy with graft augmentation will have a lower recurrence of their posterior wall defect than women who undergo a traditional posterior colporrhaphy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Traditional vs. Graft-augmented Posterior Colporrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional approach to surgical repair of posterior wall defect is the posterior colporrhaphy. Although this technique has been successful in the anatomic correction of the defect, the functional outcomes have been disappointing. This fact suggests improvement in the functional and anatomic outcomes following a traditional posterior colporrhaphy. Consequently, the idea of incorporating graft material into the repair to augment the patient's own tissue has been examined. Placing a piece of graft material in between the vagina and rectum adds an extra layer of support and thus augments the strength of the repair. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anatomic and functional outcomes of posterior compartment, graft-augmented traditional posterior colporrhaphy vs. traditional posterior colporrhaphy alone.</detailed_description>
