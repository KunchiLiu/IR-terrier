	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to try different medications in patients with low blood pressure and other problems with their involuntary (autonomic) nervous system. The pharmacological trials in this study will perhaps lead to more effective treatment. This study consists of single dose trials, dose selection trials, 5-day trials and chronic (approximately 2 months) trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Orthostatic Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We see many patients at the Autonomic Dysfunction Center who can be given a fairly definitive diagnosis, e.g., Orthostatic Intolerance, Pure Autonomic Failure, Multiple System Atrophy, and Baroreflex Failure. However, some patients present with a unique constellation of symptoms of autonomic dysfunction so that they do not fit into a diagnostic category. We hypothesize that a genetic cause exists in some of these patients. We further propose that our comprehensive evaluation of these patients will provide us with information on the pathophysiology of their condition and assist us in optimizing their treatment.</detailed_description>
