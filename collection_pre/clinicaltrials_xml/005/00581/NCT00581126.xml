	<brief_title>Study Evaluating BENEFIX in Previously Treated Patients With Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase IV, open-label, non comparative, multicenter, previously treated patients (PTP) clinical trial. Patients with severe or moderate hemophilia B with baseline levels of plasma factor IX &lt; 5% activity will participate in this study for both treatment regimens: "on demand" therapy for acute bleeding episodes and therapy for prophylaxis of bleeding episodes ( "Short-term therapy")*. * Short-Term Therapy: Prophylactic therapy given before surgery, including dental procedures, prior to a event that would likely result in bleeding ( sports, exercise, or heavy work), as well as to prevent further bleeds into a target joint).
