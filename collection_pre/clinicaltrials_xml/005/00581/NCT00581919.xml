	<brief_summary>Patients will receive Bortezomib, Dexamethasone, and Doxorubicin in 21 day cycles a total of 4 to 8 times (based on response to the treatment). Patients will also receive acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) daily.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 2 Bortezomib, Dexamethasone, + Doxorubicin With ALCAR for Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to assess overall response rate to the treatment. Secondary objectives include: evaluating and describing the incidence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy using the FACT/GOG-Ntx assessment tool; evaluating the utility of adding ALCAR to the chemotherapy to reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy; and evaluating the utility of the Grooved Pegboard Completion Time as a longitudinal measure of peripheral neuropathy.</detailed_description>
