	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see if a standard tool used to check anxiety in white men works well for Black men. The tool is used only for men who have prostate cancer. It is meant to see how the cancer affects men. If the investigators have a good tool, it is more likely that the investigators can help those who have high levels of anxiety. This test is known as the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (also called the MAX-PC).</brief_summary>
