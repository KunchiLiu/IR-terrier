	<brief_summary>Robotic-assisted Abdominal Sacrocolpopexy is both a feasible and safe method for apical prolapse repair of the vagina.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Robotics offers many advantages over traditional laparoscopy: 1) intuitive movement of instruments, 2) "wristed instruments" with increased degrees of freedom, 3) enhanced 12X magnification, 4) 3-D depth perception, 5)tremor filtration, 6) enhanced surgeon comfort and ergonomics, and 7) a steeper learning curve. With robotic assistance, the surgeon can comfortably perform precise, repetitive motions, with greater dexterity and vision. To date, there have been a small number of published cases of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and two cases of series utilizing robotic-assistance. There have been no prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing either of these modalities to conventional abdominal sacrocolpopexy.</detailed_description>
