	<detailed_description>Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that can provide information about tissue abnormalities, change in structure of an organ. This technique uses a near-infrared diode to emit light that can produce images of the specimen under investigation without causing damage or alterations.</detailed_description>
