	<brief_summary>This study aims to learn about the needs and feelings of women who are infertile. Being infertile means not being able to have a child without the help of a third party. There are other options for building a family. The researchers are interested in the participants' thoughts about these options and want to learn about the experiences of infertile women due to cancer treatment as well as women who are infertile due to other causes. The researchers hope that what they learn will allow them to better care for infertile women in the future.</brief_summary>
