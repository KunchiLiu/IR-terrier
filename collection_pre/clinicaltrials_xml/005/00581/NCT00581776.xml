	<brief_summary>Patients will receive Rituximab, Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Dexamethasone in three week intervals for 6 cycles; then rituximab consolidation (weekly x 4) , then one dose of rituximab every 12 weeks until 5 years or disease progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of VcR-CVAD With Rituximab Consolidation and Maintenance for Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) and the complete response rate (CRR) to the VcR CVAD regimen (response rate at completion of induction). Patients will receive Rituximab, Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Dexamethasone in three week intervals for 6 cycles; then rituximab consolidation (weekly x 4) , then one dose of rituximab every 12 weeks until 5 years or disease progression.</detailed_description>
