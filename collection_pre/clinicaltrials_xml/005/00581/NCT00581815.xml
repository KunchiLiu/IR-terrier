	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain chemical information from part of your body without a biopsy. This is done using a technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) which is similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) except that signals are detected from the chemicals (spectroscopy) naturally present in your body using radio waves. To receive this information from your body, small loops of wire (surface coils), placed near the tissue of interest, may be used to more effectively detect signals that come from the chemicals in your body. The investigators may use a second radio channel simultaneously, which will allow us to obtain greater chemical information (decoupling). The results may also help us to understand how this study can be used to help other patients with your condition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to use 1H spectroscopy or 1H decoupled 31P NMR spectroscopy to obtain biochemical information about tumor metabolism in patients, both before and after antineoplastic therapy. In healthy volunteers, normal tissue metabolism will also be studied. It is hypothesized that metabolic information may be of prognostic significance, or may be useful for timing of therapy.</detailed_description>
