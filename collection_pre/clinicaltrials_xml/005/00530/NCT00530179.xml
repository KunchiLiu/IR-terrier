	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate: 1. whether an imaging test called a PET (Positron emission tomography) scan performed after two cycles of standard chemotherapy is able to identify patients who have a high cure rate after completing standard chemotherapy alone; and 2. whether high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) when used in combination with an antibody called Rituximab results in high cure rates for those patients predicted to do poorly with standard chemotherapy by the PET scan.</brief_summary>
