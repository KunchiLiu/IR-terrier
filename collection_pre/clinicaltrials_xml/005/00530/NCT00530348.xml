	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab (Lemtrada™) as a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), in comparison with subcutaneous (SC) interferon beta-1a (Rebif®). The study had enrolled participants who had not previously received MS disease-modifying therapies. Participants had monthly laboratory tests and comprehensive testing every 3 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif® Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis, Study One</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every participant had received active treatment; there was no placebo. Participants who qualified were randomly assigned to treatment with either alemtuzumab or SC interferon beta-1a at a 2:1 ratio (that is, 2 given alemtuzumab for every 1 given interferon beta-1a). Alemtuzumab was administered in two annual courses, once at the beginning of the study and again 1 year later. Interferon beta-1a was self-injected 3 times per week for 2 years. All participants were required to return to their study site every 3 months for neurologic assessment. In addition, safety-related laboratory tests were performed at least monthly. Participation in this study ended 2 years after the start of treatment for each participant. Additionally, participants who received alemtuzumab might be followed in CAMMS03409 (NCT00930553) an extension study for safety and efficacy assessments. Participants who received interferon beta-1a and completed 2 years on study might be eligible to receive alemtuzumab on the extension study.</detailed_description>
