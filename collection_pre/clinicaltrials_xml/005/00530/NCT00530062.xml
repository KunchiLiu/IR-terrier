	<brief_summary>This is a research study designed to compare the single-dose effectiveness of albuterol-HFA-BAI (breath activated inhaler) and albuterol-HFA-MDI (metered dose inhaler) in asthmatics with poor inhaler coordinating abilities. Patients must be 7 to 70 years of age to participate in this study.</brief_summary>
