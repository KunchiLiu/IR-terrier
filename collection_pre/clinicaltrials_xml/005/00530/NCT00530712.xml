	<criteria>Stenotic, restenotic (from PTA or adjunct therapy, not including stents or stent grafts) or occluded lesion(s) located in the native superficial femoral artery or superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries. Symptomatic femoralpopliteal atherosclerosis. Willing to comply with all followup evaluations at the specified times. Provides written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. Previously implanted stent(s) or stent graft(s) in the target vessel. Planned use of devices other than angioplasty balloons during procedure. Received endovascular treatment of the target lesion (except stents/stent grafts) within six months of the index procedure. Life expectancy of less than 12 months. Symptomatic femoral disease in the opposite limb.</criteria>
