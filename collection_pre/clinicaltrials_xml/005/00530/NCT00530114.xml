	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are the following: 1. To demonstrate that AMG 223 will produce a statistically significant reduction in serum phosphorus compared with placebo over a 3 week treatment period in subjects with CKD receiving dialysis 2. To describe a dose response for AMG 223 3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 223</brief_summary>
