	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Safety Study for JNJ-18054478 in Asthma Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind study (neither the physician or the patient knows which drug they are receiving, active or placebo) to Investigate the effectiveness and safety of 12 weeks of dosing with JNJ-18054478 (300 mg taken orally once daily) compared with placebo in patients with persistent asthma. The hypothesis is that the study drug will be more effective in treatment of asthma than placebo as measured by the percent change from baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in one Second (FEV1) after 12 weeks of therapy, without any significant adverse events. Safety evaluations will include, monitoring for adverse reactions, clinical laboratory tests of blood and urine, ECGs to monitor the cardiovascular system, vital signs and physical examinations. Patients will take three capsules (100 mg) of JNJ-18054478 orally once daily for 12 weeks or placebo for the same period.</detailed_description>
