Patients who have sleep impairment associated with RLS. Patients who answered as 3 (severe) or 4 (very severe) to Question 4 (Sleep disturbance) in the IRLS Rating Scale Patients whose IRLS Rating Scale total scores are 15 points or more. Patients requiring treatment for daytime RLS symptoms (7:00 to 17:00). Patients with signs of secondary RLS (e.g. chronic renal failure, irondeficiency anemia, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease). Patients whose serum ferritin level is &lt;10 μg/L (ng/mL) at the start of Screening period. Patients with following sleep disorder not associated with RLS e.g. narcolepsy, sleep terror disorder, sleep walking disorder, breathing related sleep disorder (Patients with obvious apnea in nighttime sleeping when they do not have alcohol drinking or over 15 times/hour is used to a target for apnea hypopnea index,in which case to implement polysomnography), etc. Patients with complication of movement disorder (e.g. Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia, dystonia, etc.). Patients with severe hepatic/renal/cardiac/pulmonary disorder or hematopoietic disorder. The severity refers to Grade 3 according to "the Classification of the Severity of Adverse Experiences" (Pharmaceutical affairs Bureau/Safety Division (PAB/SD) Notification No. 80, dated 29 June 1992). Patients with the medical history or complication of cancer or malignant tumour. Patients with the medical history or complication of substance abuse (e.g. alcohol or drug) or dependency of substance for the last one year Patients whose diastolic blood pressure (BP) is &gt;110 mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg or whose systolic BP is &gt;180 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg at the start of Screening period and Week0. Patients intolerant for ropinirole hydrochloride (HCl) or other dopamine agonists. Patients with the medical history of allergy to ropinirole HCl in the past. Patients with the medical history of Augmentation to ropinirole HCl or other dopamine agonists in the past and those who have experienced early morning RLS symptoms. Augmentation is defined as below: RLS appear 2 hours earlier than the pretreatment. Symptoms become severer than the pretreatment. Symptoms which start after less time at rest than they did before treatment. The RLS extend to other sites (e.g. arm and trunk).
