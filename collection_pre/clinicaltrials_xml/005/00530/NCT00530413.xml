	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of low-dose Phenobarbital on the treatment of catamenial epilepsy. We propose that since the catamenial seizures are associated with the reduction in levels of GABA-enhancing allopregnanolone, short-term replacement with the GABAR-enhancing agent Phenobarbital will reduce the incidence of catamenial seizures.</brief_summary>
