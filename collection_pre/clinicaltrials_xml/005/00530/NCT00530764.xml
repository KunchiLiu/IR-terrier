	<brief_title>A Study of SativexÂ® for Pain Relief in Patients With Advanced Malignancy.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Dronabinol</mesh_term>
	<criteria>The patient has advanced active cancer for which there is no known curative therapy. The patient is able (in the investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements. The patient has a clinical diagnosis of cancer related pain, which is not wholly alleviated with their current opioid treatment. The patient is receiving a sustained release (SR) fixed dose of opioid therapy (excluding Methadone). N.B. The opiate therapy must be Step III according to the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder. The patient is willing to continue to take their regular daily baseline opioid regimen (SR) at the same dose, throughout the duration of study. The patient should be excluded from entering study if they have received or are due to receive during the study period; chemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiotherapy, which, in the opinion of the investigator will affect their pain. Any history or immediate family history of schizophrenia, other psychotic illness, severe personality disorder or other significant psychiatric disorder other than depression associated with their underlying condition. Any known or suspected history of a diagnosed dependence disorder, current heavy alcohol consumption, current use of an illicit drug or current non prescribed use of any prescription drug. The patient has poorly controlled epilepsy or recurrent seizures (i.e. at least one year since last seizure). The patient has experienced myocardial infarction or clinically relevant cardiac dysfunction within the last 12 months or has a cardiac disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient at risk of a clinically relevant arrhythmia or myocardial infarction.</criteria>
