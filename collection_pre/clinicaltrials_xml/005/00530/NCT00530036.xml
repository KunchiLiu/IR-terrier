	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence (UI) is a frequent problem in community-dwelling older adults and has a huge burden on health complications and healthcare costs. Although effective treatments exist, UI is frequently neglected resulting in unmet needs for continence treatment and potential negative health outcomes. The impact of UI in older patients receiving home care services has not been extensively explored. In a recent study we observed that UI was identified in 46% of 699 patients followed by the "Fondation des Services d'Aide et de Soins à Domicile" in Geneva but the impact of UI on outcome such as institutionalization, hospitalization or death is unknown.</brief_summary>
