	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Longterm HPN With Two Lipid Emulsions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term parenteral nutrition is indicated in the home care setting of patients who are unable to completely cover their daily caloric requirements by oral/enteral nutrition due to e.g. pre existing malnutrition or compromised intestinal absorption. An appropriate nutritional supplementation ensuring the provision of patients basic requirement of amino acids, glucose, lipids, micronutrients and electrolytes is therefore required to stop weight loss, increase quality of life and to reduce unfavorable consequences of malnutrition in those patients. Major causes for malnutrition and compromised intestinal absorption are malignant processes. Tumor cachexia, weight loss due to insufficient nutrition of &lt; 60 -80 % of the calculated substrate need for &gt; 14 days, antineoplastic therapy and surgical intervention are consequences of the malignant disease and lead to catabolic processes.</detailed_description>
