	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Calorie Supplementation on Growth in Young Children on ADHD Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study evaluating the effect of caloric supplementation on maintenance of growth parameters during two years of open-label atomoxetine treatment in 5 and 6 year old children with ADHD. The study will assess the efficacy of caloric supplementation in maintaining baseline percentiles for height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either PediaSure for caloric supplementation, or no supplementation. Secondary aims include assessing the tolerability and efficacy of long-term, open-label atomoxetine treatment in 5 and 6 year old children with ADHD, and obtaining adequate pilot data regarding the safety, efficacy, and potential effects of atomoxetine on growth parameters in order to submit a multisite R01 to more adequately assess atomoxetine treatment and its effects in young children with ADHD.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children who participated in the 8 week DBPC trial of atomoxetine (1K23MH066127) who wish to participate in a longterm, open label trial of atomoxetine. Parents and patients must be able to attend regular study visits. Visits will be scheduled every 30 days for the first 6 months and then every 60 days for the next 18 months.
