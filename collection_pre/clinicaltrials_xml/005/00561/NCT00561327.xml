	<brief_title>PPARgamma Activation by Losartan in Hypertensive Patients: The Importance of Losartan-Metabolites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The losartan metabolite EXP3179 potently induces the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) as a partial agonist in vitro. PPAR-γ is a nuclear hormone receptor and functions as a regulator of lipid- and glucose metabolism. PPAR-γ ligands improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Angiotensin II receptor 1-blocking and PPAR-γ-activating properties of losartan metabolites in patients would markedly improve the pharmacological profile of losartan by combining anti-hypertensive and highly beneficial metabolic actions. We developed the following hypothesis: 1. Hypertensive patients chronically treated with losartan exhibit sufficient plasma levels of EXP3179 to activate PPARγ. 2. PPARγ target genes are induced in monocytes from losartan-treated patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age: 1980 Sex: male or female Prior diagnosis of treated hypertension Treatment with losartan 100mg/daily during at least the past 2 months (n=20/ case); or: no prior angiotensin receptor 1blocker treatment during the last 2 months (n=10/ control). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (exception: Acetyl salicylic acid) for the past 21 days (due to structural homologies to glitazones, and activating effects on PPARγ) Therapy with glitazones for the past 21 days.</criteria>
