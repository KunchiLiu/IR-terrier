	<brief_title>Randomized, Parallel, Comparison, Double-Blind Efficacy &amp; Safety Study of APROVEL Versus Placebo in Chinese Patients With Hypertensive Type II Diabetic Patients With Microalbuminuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Irbesartan</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Fasting plasma glucose of untreated type II diabetes mellitus patients greater than or equal to 7.0 mmol/L, or the time between diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus and treatment &gt; 3 months The patients of normal BP, or hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medication, Seated systolic blood pressure (SeSBP) is between 120180mmHg and the Seated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) is between 80110mmHg; Evidence of albuminuria defined as an AER of 20 and 500 ug/minute on a single timed overnight collection. Before randomization the patient must quality with two AERs of 3 days intervals in the absence of confounding factors such as urinary tract infection, acute febrile illness and cardiac failure. The two AERs measurement should be in the above defined range and the variability between the two AERs measurement must be &lt;35%. Value of basal AER is calculated as the mean of the 2 measurements. The UAER measured using immunity nephelometer method (DCA2000); Serum creatinine &lt; 150umol/L(1.7mg/dl) and serum potassium in the normal lab range (3.55.5 mol/L); 18 Kg/m2less than or equal to BMI less than or equal to 35Kg/m2 The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
