	<detailed_description>High grade malignant gliomas are tumors grade III and IV according to WHO classification, that originate from oligodendroglia and astrocytes, where the latter are also known as anaplastic astrocytoma(WHO grade III) and glioblastoma(WHO grade IV). This also includes intrinsic pontine gliomas of adolescents, which are usually not documented histologically due to their localisation, but they have a similar clinical progress when compared to high grade malignant astrocytic tumors. Among various molecular alterations, malignant gliomas overexpress EGFR (epidermal growth factor) in nearly 50% of cases, which is particularly pronounced in glioblastoma.(Schlegel 2003) Standard therapy consists of radical surgery as extensive as medically responsible followed by radiotherapy dose of 60 Gy, which is aimed at the area with a safety margin. The long-term efficacy of additional chemotherapy has been a subject for controversy for several decades. The combination of all three treatment modalities in grade III tumors can lead to median survival times of 3-5 years in adults. For this treatment group reports of 5 year recurrence free periods in 33-50% of cases have been reported in children and adolescents. For glioblastoma(WHO grade IV) 5year recurrence free periods are 3% in elderly patients and 10-20% for adolescents.(Schlegel 2003) In German speaking territories chemotherapy with Cisplatin, Etoposid and Ifosfamid is used as a postoperative treatment option for adolescents and this disease.(Wolff HIT-GBM) In case of recurrence therapy choices are even more limited, thus if medically feasible the enrolment in clinical trials is an option. In this study the aim is to use an antibody directed against the EGF-receptor to effect the proliferation of the tumor cells negatively. Pilot studies conducted in adults indicate that the median survival time for patients with malignant glioma can be prolonged by the antibody treatment.</detailed_description>
