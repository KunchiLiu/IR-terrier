	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether doxorubicin HCL liposome injection, bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in combination, are effective in previously untreated multiple myeloma patients. Bortezomib inhibits the function of proteasomes, a novel mechanism of action.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Safety and Effectiveness of BORTEZOMIB Combination Therapy (Bortezomib + Doxorubicin Hydrochloride + Dexamethasone) in Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a single-arm, open-label, Phase II multi-centre study in Canada only. A total of 50 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who were eligible for stem cell transplant were targeted for recruitment to this study. Combination doxorubicin HCL liposome injection, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy was given for 4 cycles in preparation for stem cell collection and transplant. As remission status after induction and prior to the first or second auto-transplant has been shown to be the major determinant of both event free and overall survival in multiple myeloma patients, the goal has been to improve response rates through the use of various combinational approaches. As such, the objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with this regimen could result in a higher complete + near complete response rate (CR + nCR) prior to stem cell transplant, than obtained with current regimens, and then to confirm the response rate post-transplant. Safety was evaluated using adverse event reportings, clinical laboratory tests and tests for cardiac function (multiple-gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram and electrocardiogram). Four 21-day cycles of combination induction therapy consisting of 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib (given i.v. Days 1, 4, 8, 11) + 30 mg/m2 Doxil/Caelyx (given i.v. Day 4) + 40 mg Dex (given po Days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18 Cycle 1 only; Days 1-4 Cycles 2-4).</detailed_description>
