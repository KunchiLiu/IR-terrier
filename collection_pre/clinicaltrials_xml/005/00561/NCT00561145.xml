	<brief_summary>Over the past century life expectancy has risen rapidly. As a result, the proportion of elderly people continues to grow. Elderly people probably have an impaired regulation of energy balance (energy intake versus energy expenditure) whereby the underlying physiological mechanisms are not fully understood. The first objective of this study is to provide further evidence for an age-related failure to regulate energy balance in elderly. If the hypothesis of impaired regulation of energy balance in elderly is confirmed then the second objective becomes to elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms of the age-related failure to regulate energy intake in elderly.</brief_summary>
