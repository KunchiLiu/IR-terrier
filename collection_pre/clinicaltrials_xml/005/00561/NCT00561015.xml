	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of telaprevir on early hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) C virus (HCV) viral kinetics in treatment-naive participants who are chronically (lasting a long time) infected with genotype 2 or 3 HCV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2a Study to Evaluate Viral Kinetics and Safety of Telaprevir in Participants With Genotype 2 or 3 Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), partially blinded, randomized (study drug assigned by chance) stratified (arrange in groups for analysis of results e.g., stratify by age, sex, etc.) for genotype, multiple dose study. The trial will consist of Screening period (6 weeks), Treatment period (24 or 26 weeks) and Follow-up period (24 weeks). The Treatment period will include 2 weeks investigational treatment phase and a 24 week standard treatment phase. All the eligible participants who were never treated for HCV will be enrolled for the trial and will receive the investigational treatment regimen to which they have been randomly assigned for 2 weeks. After this in the standard treatment phase participants will receive the standard treatment of care consisting of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a 180 microgram once weekly and ribavirin (RBV) 400 milligram twice per day. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by HCV viral load quantification. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
