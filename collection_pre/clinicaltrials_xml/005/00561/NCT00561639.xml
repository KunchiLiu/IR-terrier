	<brief_summary>A SpetiFast multiplex PCR kit has recently been placed on the market witch can evidence the DNA of 90% of micro-organisms (bacteria and fungus) implicated in sepsis. However, the clinical impact of being able to detect the DNA of these various agents is unknown. We propose to assess the benefit to patient care of the SeptiFast multiples PCR by answering three questions : 1/in patients with septic immunosuppression, does this kit evidence etiologic agents not revealed by classical methods? 2/Does the use of PCR results permit different diagnostic hypotheses to be considered? 3/Does having the SeptiFast results entail changes to the therapeutic plan?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefit of SeptiFast Multiplex PCR in the Etiologic Diagnosis and Therapeutic Approach for Onco-hematology Patients Presenting Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has double purpose : 1. To compare the results obtained from the SeptiFast system with the results from classical microbiological sampling, in particular hemoculture, for immunosuppressed patients presenting sepsis. 2. To perform a blind assessment of the benefit of septiFast care of these patients.</detailed_description>
