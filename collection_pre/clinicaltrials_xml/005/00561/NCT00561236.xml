	<brief_title>Does Intravitreal Injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide Impairs the Adrenal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The normalcy of hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal axis (HPA axis) of enrolled subjects will will be assessed before intravitreal injection of 4mg of triamcinolone and again after one day, one week and two weeks. Patients with abnormal HPA axis will be re-tested after four weeks and later until the HPA axis function return to normal. The HPA axis will be assessed with low dose (1mcg) intravenous corticotropin(ACTH) stimulation test, in which cortisol levels will be sampled before , 30 minutes and 60 minutes after 1mcg ACTH IV injection.</detailed_description>
