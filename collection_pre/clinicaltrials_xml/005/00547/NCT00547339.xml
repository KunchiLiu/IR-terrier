	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To escalate the dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to a tumoricidal dose without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. (Phase I) - To determine the late, severe grade 3-5 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity occurring between 270-540 days (i.e., 9-18 months) from the start of the protocol treatment as assessed by CTCAE v3.0. (Phase II) Secondary - To determine the dose-limiting toxicity of SBRT in these patients. (Phase I) - To determine the 2-year biochemical (PSA) control (freedom from PSA failure), disease-free and overall survival, local control, freedom from distant metastases, and the incidence of high-grade adverse events of any type in patients treated with this therapy in order to determine if the therapy is promising enough for further clinical investigation. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II open-label study. - Phase I: Patients undergo 5 treatments of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). - Phase II: Patients undergo SBRT at the maximum tolerated dose as in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then once a year for years 5-10. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 97 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
