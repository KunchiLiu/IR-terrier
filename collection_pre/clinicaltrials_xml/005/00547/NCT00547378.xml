	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are: 1. To provide evidence from a randomized controlled trial that InterStim Therapy provides better relief of symptoms of OAB than standard medical treatments in current use. 2. To fulfill the requirements of the FDA-mandated post-approval study of the safety of the tined lead using a minimally invasive approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>InSite for Over Active Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 million Americans meet the criteria for overactive bladder (OAB). Urinary voiding dysfunction symptoms impose a significant physical and psychosocial impact on individuals, including loss of self-esteem and a decrease in the ability to maintain an independent lifestyle. These symptoms can substantially affect a subject's daily activities. Patients with OAB are managed with diet modification, bladder training or retraining, pelvic muscle rehabilitation, medication and biofeedback. Medications are used as the first-line therapy for urgency frequency and urinary urge incontinence. InterStim Therapy utilizes sacral nerve stimulation and is indicated in the US for the treatment of urinary retention and the symptoms of OAB, including urinary urge incontinence and significant symptoms of urgency-frequency alone or in combination, in subjects who have failed or could not tolerate more conservative treatments. InSite OAB Protocol 1634 consists of two phases; Phase I which is the randomized portion of the trail and Phase II the non-randomized portion. Phase 1: A minimum of 60 subjects randomized to InterStim and a minimum of 60 subjects randomized to SMT. Phase 2: Non-randomized, all qualified subjects will receive InterStim, approximately 297 enrolled Subjects previously enrolled in Protocol 1634 for Urinary Urge Incontinence and Protocol 1635 for Urgency-Frequency will be included in Phase I of the new Protocol 1634 of OAB.</detailed_description>
