	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if multiple doses of two inhaled drugs will help Cystic Fibrosis patients whose lungs are infected with a bacteria called Burkholderia dolosa. The names of these drugs are tobramycin solution for inhalation and amiloride solution for inhalation. Currently, treating patients with Burkholderia dolosa infections is challenging because the bacteria is resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, researchers are looking for drugs which, when taken with an antibiotic, will help the antibiotic to work more effectively.</brief_summary>
