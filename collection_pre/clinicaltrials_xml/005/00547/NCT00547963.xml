Patients who self-reported the use of both substances were asked to participate in the study. Recruited participants were given a baseline assessment and then randomized a treatment or a control condition. The treatment condition consisted of two 40 minute sessions of brief counseling. The first session took place in the ED the second session occurred within two weeks of being seen in the ED. Participants completed assessments three and twelve months after being recruited in the ED. The primary dependent variables for this study are 12 month injuries and self-reported levels of negative life consequences associated with alcohol and marijuana use.</detailed_description>
