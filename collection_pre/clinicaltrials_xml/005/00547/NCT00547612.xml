	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier, may be effective in finding disease in patients with pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well a PET scan using [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier works in finding disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography Using [18F]-Labeled Substance P Antagonist Receptor Quantifier in Finding Disease in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier positron emission tomography can identify pancreatic cancer evident on multiphase CT scan. OUTLINE: Patients undergo multiphase CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. No more than 15 days later, patients receive [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier IV and undergo positron emission tomography over 6 hours. Blood is collected periodically to measure the metabolism of the radiotracer by high performance liquid chromatography with radioactive detectors.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Primary or metastatic disease At least one site of measurable disease Enrolled in an NCI protocol (either a treatment or screening protocol) such as NCI05C0044 or NCI05C0141 PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Inclusion criteria: ECOG performance status 02 WBC ≥ 1,200/mm³ Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must agree to use effective contraception Not pregnant or nursing Exclusion criteria: Allergy to IV contrast Claustrophobia that would preclude completion of a scan or unable to lie on one's back for positron emission tomography scan PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Inclusion criteria: More than 4 weeks since prior abdominal surgery Exclusion criteria: Prior participation in other research protocols within the past year such that a radiation exposure together with the present study would exceed the annual limits Aprepitant within 72 hours of [18F]labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier positron emission tomography</criteria>
