	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observer blind study is to assess the safety in terms of fever &gt;39Â°C (rectal temperature) and the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response following a booster vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine GSK 1024850A at 12 to 18 months of age in children previously primed with the same vaccines including a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine co-administered with a diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis (DTPw)-combined vaccine and OPV or IPV vaccines. Subjects participating in this study should have received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the primary study. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00344318)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects for whom the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 1218 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination and who previously participated in study 107007 and received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (active phase and extended safety followup), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within one month preceding the booster dose of study vaccines, or planned use during the entire study period Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the booster dose of study vaccines. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol, during the period starting one month before the booster dose of study vaccines and up to the followup visit. Administration of any pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine other than the study vaccines from study 107007. History of, or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. History of seizures (this criterion does not apply to subjects who have had a single, uncomplicated febrile convulsion in the past) or progressive neurological disease. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months preceding the booster dose of study vaccines or planned administration during the active phase of the study.</criteria>
