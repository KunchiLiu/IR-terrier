	<brief_title>Promoting Physical Activity Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given the growing rates of type 2 diabetes and the documented benefits of physical activity in the treatment of this illness, further research is needed to examine methods of targeting this patient group to achieve improvements in physical activity behavior. The primary aim of this planning grant is to implement a pilot study examining the feasibility and efficacy of an individually-targeted, theoretically-based physical activity intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes. The physical activity intervention is compared to usual care, and the primary outcome is weekly physical activity at a one-month follow-up. These pilot data would demonstrate the feasibility of partnering with a community agency for participant recruitment and program implementation, as well as the potential efficacy of this intervention to promote physical activity in this high-risk population.</detailed_description>
