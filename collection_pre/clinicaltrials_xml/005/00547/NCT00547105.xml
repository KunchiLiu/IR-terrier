	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving erlotinib together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib together with stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Call Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the effect of erlotinib and stereotactic body radiotherapy on 6-month progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Secondary - To describe the actuarial rate of in-field local control and out-of-field disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. - To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients. - To evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - To evaluate the duration of erlotinib usage and time to initiation of third-line systemic therapy (chemotherapy or biologic agent) in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1-4 weeks after the initiation of erlotinib hydrochloride, patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Locally advanced or metastatic disease Measurable disease Failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen No more than 6 discrete active extracranial lesions (≤ 3 in the liver and ≤ 3 in the lung) identified by positron emission tomography (PET) and by correlative plain film, CT scan, or MRI within 8 weeks prior to the initiation of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) Residual PET activity is not considered a site of active disease if the CT scan appearance is stable or improved over a period of ≥ 3 months (for patients who received prior radiotherapy to the primary site in the lung) Patients who received prior radiotherapy to the primary site will be ineligible for the study if there is CT scan evidence of disease progression within the past 3 months Patients with unirradiated primary sites are potentially eligible for the study No more than 2 contiguous vertebral metastases will be considered a single site of disease No metastatic disease invading the esophagus, stomach, intestines, or mesenteric lymph nodes No cutaneous metastasis of NSCLC No known brain metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Karnofsky performance status 70100% AST and ALT ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 2 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 times ULN Granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm³ Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN FEV1 ≥ 1 L (for patients who will be receiving SBRT for lung tumors and who are known or suspected by the treating radiation oncologist to have compromised lung function) Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception No serious, uncontrolled infection(s) No significant weight loss (&gt; 10%) within the past 3 months No other carcinoma within the past 5 years except cured nonmelanoma skin cancer or treated in situ cervical cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics More than 4 weeks since prior participation in an investigational drug study No prior EGFR inhibitors</criteria>
