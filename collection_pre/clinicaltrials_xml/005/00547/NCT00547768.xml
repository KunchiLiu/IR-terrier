Use of any of the following drugs within the time indicated prior to the first dosing visit (Time prior to Visit 2): Systemic or injected corticosteroids (including oral, parenteral, intravenous, rectal)(30 days). Nasal or inhaled or ocular corticosteroids (30 days).

OTC ophthalmic decongestant, antihistamine, or decongestant/ antihistamine combinations (3 days). Other anticholinergic agents (3 days). Immunotherapy injection (1 day). Other drugs were to be permitted if they were not expected to interfere with the ability of the subject to participate in the study. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents were not allowed for 2 days prior to each treatment visit day through 24 hours postdose. Medications or agents not specified above that might confound the interpretation of the results were prohibited as follows: Caffeine within 6 hours prior to each visit (coffee, tea, cola, including Mountain Dew and Surge). Decaffeinated coffee, tea and colas within 6 hours of each visit Alcohol within 24 hours prior to each study visit. Chocolate within 6 hours prior to each visit. Antacids within + 2 hours of investigational product dosing. Any waiver of these inclusion and exclusion criteria required approval by the investigator and the sponsor on a casebycase basis prior to enrolling the subject. Approval had to be documented by both the sponsor and the investigator. No subject was to be allowed to enroll in this study more than once.</criteria>
