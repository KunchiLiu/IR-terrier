	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Cefditoren Pivoxil Versus Ciprofloxacin in Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most frequent reasons of surgery visits in Primary Care. More than 95 percent of UTIs are monomicrobial, although the microorganisms implied are varied, and the range of effective drugs could be extensive. The species most frequently isolated is Escherichia coli, with prevalence ranking between 85 and 90 percent of documented cases. E. coli has developed resistance to different antibiotics. Cefditoren is situated as a good candidate for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs due to its spectrum of activity against E. coli. The study has been designed in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations in force to assess the efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil against ciprofloxacin, a drug which despite the increasing rate of resistance in some countries, continues to be a drug of choice for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs.</detailed_description>
