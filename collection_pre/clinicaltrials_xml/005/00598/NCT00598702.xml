	<brief_title>Study of the Safety &amp; Efficacy of Intravenous Acetaminophen in Pediatric Inpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess the safety of intravenous acetaminophen (IV APAP) when used over one or more days for the treatment of acute pain or fever in pediatric (neonates, infants, children and adolescents) inpatients who are unable to take anything by mouth (NPO), require or would benefit from IV treatment, or are willing and able to stay on IVAPAP therapy for 1 to 7 days.</detailed_description>
