	<brief_summary>The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to be effective in preventing mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia. However, the expanding indications of this therapy will have an impact on the follow-up policy. Currently, regular follow-up visits are scheduled every 3 months. In this context, the recently-introduced "remote monitoring" devices constitute a promising new technique, allowing to transmit information about the status of the device and ICD therapies, without direct contact between patients and physicians. This monitoring by "tele-follow-up" might reduce the cost of care by avoiding useless visits to the implantation centre. The aim of our study is to assess the cost-benefit ratio of "tele-follow-up" assisted care as compared with the conventional ICD follow-up.</brief_summary>

Thanks to an open label, randomized, 2 arms study : one using a telephone follow up, the other a conventional follow-up.</detailed_description>
