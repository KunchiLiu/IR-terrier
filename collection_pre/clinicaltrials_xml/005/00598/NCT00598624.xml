	<brief_summary>This is a multicentric, non-randomized, non-controlled open-label phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treosulfan in a combination regimen with fludarabine as conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with haematological malignancies. The aim is to demonstrate a clinical benefit compared with historical data on intravenous busulfan (BusulfexTM, BusilvexTM), the only drug so far registered in the indication conditioning before allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with haematological malignancies, according to WHO classification, such as: acute myeloid leukaemia AML in CR1 except "lowrisk cases" defined by t(15;17), t(8;21), inv 16 or normal cytogenetics at diagnosis with FLT3ITD negative and NPM1 positive, with no high risk clinical criteria any AML beyond CR1 acute lymphoblast leukaemia ALL in CR1 only if at "high risk" defined by cytogenetics as t(9;22), t(4;11) or for persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) any ALL beyond CR1 chronic myeloid leukaemia CML in chronic phase (CP) or accelerated phase (AP) intolerant/not responsive to TKinhibitors myeloproliferative disorders MPD myelodysplastic syndrome MDS with intermediate or high risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) diffuse large cell lymphoma DLCL with a chemosensitive relapse or beyond CR1 lymphoblastic and Burkitt lymphoma with a chemosensitive relapse or beyond CR1 mantle cell lymphoma MCL with a chemosensitive relapse or beyond CR1 follicular lymphoma FCL with a chemosensitive relapse or beyond CR2 Hodgkin lymphoma HD with a chemosensitive relapse or beyond CR1 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia CLL at "poor risk" in CR1 or with a chemosensitive relapse CLL relapsing after high dose chemotherapy Tcell non Hodgkin lymphoma TNHL in CR1 or beyond multiple myeloma MM at high risk for cytogenetics or ISS stage 3 in CR1 following high dose chemotherapy MM at any relapse/progression except refractory disease 2. Availability of an HLAidentical sibling donor (MRD) or HLAidentical unrelated donor (MUD) HLAidentity defined by the following markers: A, B, DRB1, DQB1 or a single or double Cord Blood unit (CB) with at least a 4 out of 6 HLAmatching by the following markers: A, B and DRB. A) identity between the 2 CB units and the recipient; B) Two identical CB units with one or two mismatches with the recipient; C) Two CB units with one mismatch between them and two mismatches with the recipient. We will prefer mismatches either for class I or for class II antigens; we will avoid mismatches concerning both classes I and II together. 3.

Previous allogeneic transplantation 3. Hematopoietic cell transplantationspecific comorbidity index &gt; 4 (HCTCI Sorror et al, Appendix M) 4. Known and manifested malignant involvement of the CNS 5. Active infectious disease 6. HIV positivity or active hepatitis infection 7. Impaired liver function (Bilirubin &gt; upper normal limit; Transaminases &gt; 3.0 x upper normal limit) 8. Impaired renal function (Creatinineclearance &lt; 60 ml/min; Serum Creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper normal limit). 9. Pleural effusion or ascites &gt; 1.0 L 10. Pregnancy or lactation 11. Known hypersensitivity to treosulfan and/or fludarabine 12. Participation in another experimental drug trial within 4 weeks before day 6 13. Noncooperative behaviour or noncompliance 14.
