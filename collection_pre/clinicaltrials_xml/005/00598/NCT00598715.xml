	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Two Different Strategies for Restenosis in Sirolimus-Eluting Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of in-stent restenosis after implantation of a DES has poorly been studied. Although there are no data, it may be assumed that certain lesions might be resistant to a given drug and in need of a different DES. Thus, for lesions which develop restenosis after a DES, it is not known which the right strategy to use is, implantation of the same type of DES as the initial one or a DES with a different drug. This prospective, randomized trial will compare the anti-restenotic efficacy of PES or SES in patients with restenosis after initial implantation of a SES</detailed_description>
