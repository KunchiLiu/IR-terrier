	<brief_title>Molecular Markers in Treatment in Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multicenter study to investigate the predictive value of molecular markers in endometrial cancer for lymph node metastasis, prognosis and treatment. For the previously studied tumor markers p53, p16, ER, PR and HER2neu, we want to investigate the expression in curettage material in relation to lymph node metastasis and prognosis among endometrial carcinoma patients. We also want to investigate the distribution of genetic alterations in fresh frozen tumor tissue in order to design prospective randomized treatment trials of metastatic endometrial cancer based on molecular profile. There will be a special emphasis on disturbances in the pathways influenced by new targeted therapy, such as inhibitors of Her2/NEU, EGFR, receptor tyrosine kinase, mTOR, PTEN and hormone receptor pathways.</detailed_description>
