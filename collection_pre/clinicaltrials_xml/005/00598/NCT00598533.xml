	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Rapamycin- vs. Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents to Reduce Coronary Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, randomized trial will compare the efficacy and safety of a Rapamycin plus Probucol-eluting stent with a polymer based Zotarolimus-eluting stent. Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease without cardiogenic shock who will undergo coronary angiography and willing to participate in the trial will receive a loading dose of 600mg clopidogrel at least 2 hours before the procedure. They will be randomized to receive one of the above mentioned stents.</detailed_description>
