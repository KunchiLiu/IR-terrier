	<brief_summary>Doctors at MSKCC are doing this research study to see if smokers are interested in the idea that genes might be markers of cancer risk, and to see if smokers would want to learn this information about their risk if it were available. Different versions of the gene called UGT1A7 are found in different people. Certain versions of this gene can increase the risk of cancer in people. In this study, doctors will determine the different types of UGT1A7 in smokers and find out whether smokers show good interest and understanding. The information from this study will be used in future studies to identify smokers at increased risk for cancer, and to help smokers quit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers of Molecular Risk in Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of two arms; both of which are observational studies of molecular assessments of risk for tobacco related cancer. Arm A of the protocol is a pilot crosssectional study that evaluates the feasibility of obtaining and testing a genetic marker of cancer susceptibility (UGT1A7 polymorphisms) in smokers. It also explores smokers' interest in and comprehension of genetic risk assessments as possible tools for increasing motivation for smoking cessation. The second arm of this protocol, Arm B, is an observational prospective evaluation of a putative noninvasive biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure - urinary prostaglandin E-metabolite (PGE-M) - in smokers motivated to reduce and/or cease smoking.</detailed_description>
