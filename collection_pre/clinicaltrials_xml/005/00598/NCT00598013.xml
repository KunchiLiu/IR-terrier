	<brief_title>Effect of Pioglitazone on Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis in Renal Allograft Recipients Without Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, open-label study. The pioglitazone treatment group received 30mg pioglitazone at 2 weeks after renal transplantation for 12 months. After treatment, we estimated insulin sensitivity index for transplantation,first phase and second phase insulin secretion, secretion area under the curve,and carotid intima-media thickness.</detailed_description>
