	<brief_summary>Animal studies show that the breakdown of blood results in iron accumulation in the brain after brain hemorrhage (ICH); and that iron plays a role in brain injury in ICH patients. Deferoxamine (DFO) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years to remove excessive iron from the body, and has been shown to provide some benefit in animal studies of ICH. Therefore, we plan to undertake this study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with DFO in patients with ICH, and to determine the maximal tolerated dose to be used in future studies to determine if treatment with DFO can improve the outcome of patients with ICH. Our main objectives are: 1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of varying doses of DFO, by determining the treatment related adverse events, in patients with ICH; and 2) to determine the maximal tolerated dose to be adopted in subsequent studies to test the efficacy of DFO in improving outcome after ICH. We hypothesize that DFO is well-tolerated and has minimal serious adverse effects in patients with ICH; and that treatment with DFO will improve patients' outcome. The results can potentially bring into account new means to improve the outcome of patients with ICH. ICH is a frequent cause of disability and death. A successful study demonstrating the efficacy of iron-modifying therapy would be of considerable public health significance.</brief_summary>

Known pregnancy (or positive pregnancy test), or breastfeeding 14. Patients known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol due to alcoholism, drug dependency, incompliance, or any other cause. 15. Any condition which, in the judgement of the investigator, might increase the risk to the patient 16. Life expectancy of less than 90 days due to comorbid conditions 17. Concurrent participation in another research protocol for investigation of another experimental therapy 18. Preexisting Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order, or indication that a new DNR order will be implemented within the first 48 hours of hospitalization.</criteria>
