	<brief_summary>The primary endpoint is to evaluate the recurrence rate at 2 years in randomized patients with tumor histology Ta, G1-G2 who receive TUR-BT plus EOquin® versus those who receive TUR-BT plus placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Trial of Single-Dose Intravesical EOquin® as a Surgical Adjuvant for Noninvasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, study. Following TUR-BT, eligible patients will be randomized to receive either intravesical EOquin® (Apaziquone) or matching placebo instilled within 6 hours of surgery. Patients will be seen for a postoperative follow-up exam 21±10 days after the TUR. At this time, the pathology report will be reviewed. If the histology of the patient's tumor is Ta, G1-G2 (low grade [WHO/ISUP classification]), then the patient will receive no further treatment and will be observed cystoscopically every three months through year two for tumor recurrence and progression. If the histology of the patient's tumor is other than Ta, G1-G2 (low grade [WHO/ISUP classification]), then the patient will receive further treatment in accordance with current treatment guidelines, following which the patient will be followed up cystoscopically every three months through year two for tumor recurrence and progression.</detailed_description>
