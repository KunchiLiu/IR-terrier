	<brief_title>Adrenal Functions in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CONTEXT: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease and extrarenal manifestations may be observed in many organ systems. Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with ADPKD was not evaluated extensively. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in ADPKD patients. METHODS: Twenty two ADPKD patients and 27 healthy subjects were enrolled. Basal dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) levels and cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone responses to low dose short adrenocorticotropin stimulation test were assessed. Correlation analyses of these parameters with glomerular filtration rates, renal volumes and pain characteristics in patients with ADPKD were done.</detailed_description>
