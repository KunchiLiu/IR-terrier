	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who have received chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Have Received Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether adding imatinib mesylate as maintenance therapy improves progression-free survival in patients with c-kit positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with historical controls. Secondary - To assess the feasibility of administering imatinib mesylate as maintenance therapy after the completion of induction and consolidation therapy in these patients. - To evaluate potential mechanisms of relapse/resistance in c-kit positive AML by examining multidrug resistance gene expression and AF1q gene expression and to determine whether these levels correlate with c-kit expression. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for up to 12 months. Bone marrow and peripheral blood are collected at baseline. Laboratory endpoints are evaluated by flow cytometry; mutation and gene analysis by PCR.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Diagnostic bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy or peripheral blood confirming AML. At the time of diagnosis, patients must have ckit (also known as CD117) positive AML (20% or more of the blasts express ckit[CD117]). A flow scattergram (from the diagnostic AML specimen) must be available to calculate a ckit MFI. Patients must have received standard induction chemotherapy with ADE (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide) or with 7+3 (7 days of cytarabine continuous infusion and 3 days of an anthracycline (idarubicin, daunorubicin, or mitoxantrone). Patients with persistent leukemia on a Day 1028 marrow may have received a second course of chemotherapy. After the completion of induction therapy, patients must have attained a complete remission based on blood count recovery (neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/µL, platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL), and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (&lt; 5% myeloblasts). For patients &lt; 60 years of age, patients must have received at least 2 courses of postremission therapy with at least intermediate dose (400 mg/m2/day). *Patients with t(8;21) or inversion 16 at the time of diagnosis must have received at least 2 courses of high dose cytarabine. For patients &gt; or = 60 years of age, patients must have received 1 course of postremission therapy (the type of chemotherapy will not be specified). Patients must be registered on this study (maintenance Imatinib mesylate) within 60 days of the last dose of postremission therapy. A bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy must be done within 3 weeks of registration documenting CR. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use an effective method of contraception. Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7 days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study drug. ECOG Performance Status 02. Creatinine must be ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal. Total bilirubin must be ≤ 2 mg/dl and AST and ALT must be ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal. Previous treatmentrelated toxicities must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 excluding alopecia. Written, voluntary informed consent. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Acute promyelocytic leukemia. Patients with an autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant. History of HIV. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Serious or poorly controlled medical conditions that would interfere with the protocol. At the time of study entry, any medications which could significantly interact with imatinib mesylate must be discontinued. Patients with active extramedullary disease are not eligible. Patient has received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first day of study drug dosing. Patient is &lt; 5 years free of another primary malignancy except: if the other primary malignancy is not currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention, or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma in situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is not allowed. Patient with Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria. (i.e., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study) Patient has known chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis). Patient previously received radiotherapy to ≥ 25 % of the bone marrow Patient had a major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry. Patient with any significant history of noncompliance to medical regimens or with inability to grant reliable informed consent.</criteria>
