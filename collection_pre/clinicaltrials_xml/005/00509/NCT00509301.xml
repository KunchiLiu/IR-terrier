	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Cotara® is an experimental new treatment that links a radioactive isotope (iodine 131) to a targeted monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal antibody is designed to bind tumor cells and deliver radiation directly to the center of the tumor mass while minimizing effects on normal tissues. Cotara® thus literally destroys the tumor "from the inside out." This may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant type of brain cancer. PURPOSE: This trial is studying the safety and radiation distribution of Cotara® in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Radiation Distribution Study of Cotara® in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To confirm the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 131I-chTNT-1/B MAb (Cotara®) when given as a single 25 hour interstitial infusion in patients with recurrent GBM - To characterize the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of Cotara® OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose escalation study of Cotara®. All patients will receive 3 mCi of Cotara® for biodistribution and radiation dosimetry purposes. In addition, patients will receive escalating therapeutic dose levels of Cotara® for confirmation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for a minimum of 12 weeks and until disease progression.</detailed_description>
