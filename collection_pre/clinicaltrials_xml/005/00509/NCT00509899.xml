	<brief_summary>To determine the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of ruxolitinib (INCB018424), administered orally to patients with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), Post Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) and Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (PET-MF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Ruxolitinib (INCB018424) in Patients With Myelofibrosis and Post Polycythemia Vera/Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study of ruxolitinib, a small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, administered orally to patients with PMF, PPEV-MF or PET-MF. The study is comprised of 3 parts: Part 1: Dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (complete). Part 2: Exploration of alternative dosing schedules (complete). Part 3: Further evaluation of selected dose regimens, including additional response measures to explore effect of ruxolitinib on symptoms and other parameters including daily physical activity and long-term survival (ongoing).</detailed_description>
