	<brief_title>Evaluation of Effect of Combination With Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in Hypertensives Uncontrolled on Amlodipine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In hypertensive patients whose blood pressure (BP) does not reach less than 140/90 mmHg with 5mg/day of amlodipine are divided the following two groups and BP response, laboratory data, and adverse effects are compared. Group 1: 12 week combination therapy with telmisartan plus low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. Group 2: Amlodipine is continuously administered.</detailed_description>
