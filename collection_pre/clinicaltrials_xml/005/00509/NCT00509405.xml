	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Neutralization of acid production induced by the Western diet with oral administration of potassium citrate increases bone mineral density and bone mass as well as skeletal muscle mass and strength in elderly people (&gt; 65y).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Neutralization of Endogenous Acid Production on BMD and Bone Microarchitectural</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will perform a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of K citrate on bone mineral density, microarchitectural composition of bone,nutritional parameters, lean body mass, parameters of skeletal muscle mass and strength, 24h and exercise induced blood pressure changes in otherwise healthy, elderly ambulatory subjects of both genders. Potassium citrate (60 mEq) is supplied as tablets with a wax matrix (10 mEq of citrate per tablet) and ingested in three doses/day. All subjects will receive daily oral 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D to ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D supply.</detailed_description>
