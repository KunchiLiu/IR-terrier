Subjects must have had experienced one of the following: At least one documented relapse in the 12 months prior to screening At least two documented relapses in the 24 months prior to screening One documented relapse between 12 and 24 months prior to screening with at least one documented T1Gd enhancing lesion in an MRI performed within 12 months prior to screening. 5. Subjects must be between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive. 6. Subjects must have disease duration of at least 6 months (from the first symptom) prior to screening. 7. Women of childbearing potential must practice an acceptable method of birth control [acceptable methods of birth control in this study include: surgical sterilization, intrauterine devices, oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, longacting injectable contraceptive, partner's vasectomy or doublebarrier method (condom or diaphragm with spermicide). 8. Subjects must be able to sign and date a written informed consent prior to entering the study 9. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration of the study. 1. Subjects with progressive forms of MS 2. An onset of relapse, unstable neurological condition or any treatment with corticosteroids [intravenous (iv), intramuscular (im) and/or per os (po)] or ACTH between month 1 (screening) and 0 (baseline). 3. Use of experimental or investigational drugs, and/or participation in drug clinical studies within the 6 months prior to screening. 4. Use of immunosuppressive including Mitoxantrone (Novantrone®) or cytotoxic agents within 6 months prior to the screening visit. 5. Previous use of either of the following: natalizumab (Tysabri®), cladribine, laquinimod. 6.

Systemic corticosteroid treatment of ≥30 consecutive days duration within 2 months prior to screening visit. 8. Previous total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation. 9. Previous stem cell treatment, autologous bone marrow transplantation or allogenic bone marrow transplantation. 10. A known history of tuberculosis. 11. Acute infection two weeks prior to baseline visit. 12. Major trauma or surgery two weeks prior to baseline 13. A history of vascular thrombosis (excluding cathetersite superficial venous thrombophlebitis). 14.

Inability to successfully undergo MRI scanning. 22. Known drug hypersensitivity that would preclude administration of laquinimod, such as hypersensitivity to: mannitol, meglumine or sodium stearyl fumarate. 1. Subjects who suffer from any form of progressive MS. 2. Any condition which the investigator feels may interfere with participation in the study. 3. Subjects with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition that would preclude safe and complete study participation, 4. Subjects who received any investigational medication, immunosuppressives or cytotoxic agents within 6 months prior to screening 5. Previous treatment with immunomodulators within two months prior to screening 6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.</criteria>
