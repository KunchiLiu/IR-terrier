	<brief_summary>Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by the formation and growth of abnormal blood vessels (angiogenesis) in the retina. The new blood vessels have fragile walls and can leak fluid into the retina. The build-up of fluid (edema) under the macula can distort vision or cause vision loss. TG100801 is a topical (eye drop) therapy that has been shown to inhibit ocular angiogenesis, vascular leak, and inflammation in laboratory studies. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the ability of topical administration of TG100801 to reduce the amount of fluid in the retina in patients with AMD following 30 days of treatment. An additional objective is to evaluate the safety of TG100801 in patients with AMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label, Pilot Study of TG100801 in Patients With Choroidal Neovascularization Due to AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD is the leading cause of irreversible, severe vision loss in people 55 years and older in the developed world. TG100801 is a potent inhibitor of vascular growth endothelial factor (VEGF) and other kinases that contribute to CNV and macular edema. Animal models have demonstrated the ability of TG100801 to inhibit angiogenesis, vascular leak, and inflammation. TG100801 is being developed as a topical (eye drop) therapy for treatment of CNV due to AMD. The primary objective of this multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study is to evaluate the effects of 30 days of dosing with two dose levels of TG100801 on central retinal/lesion thickness, as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The safety of TG100801 in patients with AMD also will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
