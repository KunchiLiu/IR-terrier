	<brief_title>Implementation of a Pharmacy-Intervention to Enhance Prescription and Use of Lipid-Lowering Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in large parts of the world. Next to life style changes, pharmaceutical treatment is a keystone in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Despite the strong evidence for the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy, less than half of the people eligible are treated. With specific medication searches in the community pharmacy database, an easy tool for detecting patients who are undertreated is available. Based on this tool, a pharmaceutical care model for improving underprescription and treatment persistence regarding lipid-lowering medication in patients with cardiovascular disease was constructed. Moreover, it is not known yet how to implement this pharmaceutical care model in community pharmacies effectively. With multifaceted interventions the behaviour of health professionals can be changed. In this study the effectiveness of a maximal support strategy, including interactive educational meetings, reminders, audit and feedback, is compared to a minimal implementation strategy.</detailed_description>
