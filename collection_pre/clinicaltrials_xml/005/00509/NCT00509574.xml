	<brief_summary>The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, played an important role in lipid-lowering therapy and reduction of cardiovascular risks. However, it has been observed that the response to statin therapy varies from patient to patient, and gene polymorphism could have contributed to the variation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association of Genetic Polymorphisms With Lipid Lowering Effects of Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperlipidemic patients are retrospectively screened from 2006/1/1 to 2006/12/31. The patient is included if he or she had been receiving atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for at least 3 months and did not receive other lipid-lowering medications 4 weeks before starting atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Genomic DNA was collected from the blood sample of each patient using genomic DNA purification kit. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined afterward. The correlation between response of statin therapy, defined as changes in lipid profiles including triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and SNPs examined.</detailed_description>
