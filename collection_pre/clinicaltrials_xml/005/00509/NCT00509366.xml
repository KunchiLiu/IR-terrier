	<brief_summary>In this trial, subjects with chemo-naive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assigned to chemotherapy using a genomic-based predictor for platinum sensitivity. After an amendment dated 1/25/2010, subjects with squamous cell NSCLC sensitive to cisplatin received cisplatin/gemcitabine and if resistant to cisplatin received docetaxel/gemcitabine. Subjects with non-squamous cell NSCLC sensitive to cisplatin received cisplatin/pemetrexed and if resistant to cisplatin received pemetrexed/gemcitabine. The primary objective of this trial was to prospectively validate the genomic-based prediction model through separate evaluation of the one-year progression-free survival (PFS) of the cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cohorts. Secondary objectives included: assessment of overall time to progressive disease, quality of life and evaluation of drug sensitivity patterns of cisplatin and pemetrexed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Using a Genomic Predictor of Platinum Resistance to Guide Therapy in Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. The majority of patients with lung cancer have non-small cell type (NSCLC). The current standard of care for treating select stage IIIB and stage IV NSCLC is a doublet chemotherapy regimen, such as cisplatin plus gemcitabine, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, or a platinum agent plus vinorelbine. All of these regimens have comparable response rates as first-line therapy. In addition, the combination of cisplatin plus pemetrexed has recently been approved for non-squamous histology, based on results of a large randomized prospective trial in advanced stage NSCLC. Alternative doublet therapy for first-line treatment of NSCLC per ASCO and NCCN guidelines also include a non-platinum doublet or single agent therapy. An individual patient's response to chemotherapy is the result of complex interactions between the drug(s) and the patient's genetics and environment. Using Affymetrix gene expression data with corresponding drug response data for cisplatin from the NCI60 lines panel, a gene expression based model predicative of cisplatin-resistant has been developed. However, reevaluation of the genomics-based prediction model showed that it was irreproducible, suggesting inaccurate patient assignments into the two cisplatin cohorts. As a result, it would be inappropriate to separately analyze outcomes for the different treatment groups. Instead, information from both cisplatin cohorts will be combined to reflect the overall measure of one-year progression-free survival in this study. Secondary outcomes will also reflect the overall measures of median time to disease progression and quality of life.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suspected or histologic/cytologic select stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or XRT. Histologic/cytologic documentation of recurrence required in patients who were previously completely resected and now have metastatic disease. Fresh frozen tissue must be available to generate and apply the genomics predictor. If not obtained at the time of diagnosis, then subject must consent to another biopsy as a fresh tissue sample must yield adequate high quality RNA. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases must complete brain XRT and be neurologically stable (steroids permitted) prior to research biopsy. If patient had prior XRT therapy, fresh frozen tissue biopsy for genomics analysis must be outside XRT field. At least one, nonradiated, measurable lesion by RECIST criteria. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. NO prior chemo, biologic or targeted therapy for any malignancy. Prior therapy with low dose methotrexate or similar medications allowed if used for nonmalignant conditions. Prior XRT therapy is permitted if ≥1 week since completion of XRT (≥2 weeks for whole brain XRT). XRT must be &lt;25% of bone marrow reserve. Age ≥18 years. No previous or concomitant malignancy in past 5 years other than surgical management for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, NSCLC, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. No other serious medical or psychiatric illness. Signed informed consent. Required lab data within 2 weeks of enrollment: 1. ANC/AGC ≥1500 per uL 2. Platelets ≥100,000 per uL 3. Total bili ≤1.5 mg/dL 4. Creatinine ≤2 mg/dL; creatinine clearance ≥45 ml/min. 5. SGOT/SGPT ≤3x ULN except in presence of known hepatic mets (may be up to 5x ULN) unless receive docetaxel/gemcitabine than SGOT/SGPT ≤1.5x ULN. Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between menarche and 1 year post menopause) must test negative for pregnancy within 7 days prior to or at the time of enrollment based on a serum pregnancy test. Both sexually active males and females of reproductive potential must agree to use a reliable method of birth control, as determine by the patient and their health care team, during study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. Treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry. Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy (see #5 inclusion for exceptions). Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. Active infection requiring IV antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral agents, that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy. Untreated CNS metastases unless brain XRT completed and neurologically stable (steroids permitted). Major surgery within 2 weeks of study or other serious concomitant systemic disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or patient's ability to complete the study. MI having occurred less than 6 months before inclusion, any known uncontrolled arrhythmia, symptomatic angina pectoris, active ischemia or cardiac failure not controlled by meds. Contraindications to corticosteroids. Inability/unwillingness to take folic acid or vitamin B12. Unwillingness to stop taking herbal supplements while on study. Presence of clinically significant thirdspace fluid collections (for example, ascites or pleural effusions) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to treatment initiation and throughout study enrollment. Inability to discontinue aspirin at a dose &gt;1300 mg/day or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after the dose of pemetrexed (5 days for longacting agents such as piroxicam).
