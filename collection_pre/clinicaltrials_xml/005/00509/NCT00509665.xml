	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with doxorubicin works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the overall response rate (complete and partial response) produced by the combination of gemcitabine hydrochloride and doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with recurrent or progressive head and neck cancer. Secondary - To describe the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with the chemotherapy combination. - To describe the duration of response (complete and partial response) among patients who attain a response. - To evaluate the toxicity associated with the administration of the combination in previously treated head and neck cancer patients. - To establish a correlation of the cytotoxicity of these agents with cell cycle-arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, particularly involving the sphingolipid pathway. OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and after every 2 courses for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for plasma/serum sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramide, and other markers of the apoptotic pathway via LC/MS. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
