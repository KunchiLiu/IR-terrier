	<brief_summary>The purpose of the protocol is to induce a novel radiochemotherapy with enzastaurin as first-line treatment regimen in glioblastoma: Patients with active, unmethylated MGMT promoter will be treated with enzastaurin before, concomitant, and after radiotherapy to determine safety and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6) in phase II.</brief_summary>

Patients must be at least 18 years of age. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Tumor tissue specimens (paraffinembedded and/or frozen) from the GBM surgery or biopsy must be available for central pathology review and exploratory analysis of PKCbeta targets (for example, GSK3beta). Disease evaluated by GdMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) within 72 hours postoperatively Interval of greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4 weeks since surgery or biopsy ECOG Performance Status of less than or equal to 2 Adequate organ function including the following: adequate bone marrow reserve: white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to 3.0 X 109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 X 109/L, platelet count greater than or equal to 75.0 X 109/L, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL (greater than or equal to 6.2 mmol/L).
