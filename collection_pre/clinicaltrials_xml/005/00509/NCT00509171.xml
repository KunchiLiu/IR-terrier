	<brief_title>Effect of a Novel Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator on the Incidence of Fat Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current practice of reaming the medullary canal for the fixation of femur fractures is recommended, however, there is an associated increase in the level of embolic events which confers morbidity and, occasionally, mortality. The RIA is a single device which is able to ream the medullary canal, irrigate the canal and subsequently aspirate the reamed medullary contents in order to get rid of medullary fat and other contents responsible for these adverse embolic events. A novel Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator (RIA) (Synthes, Inc) will be evaluated in a randomized study, to determine its effect on the incidence of fat emboli events during reamed IM nail fixation of consecutive femoral shaft fractures as measured by intra-operative transesophageal echocardiogram and pulmonary function.</detailed_description>
