	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy With Cetuximab in Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Daily fractions of radiotherapy at 1.8 Gy to total of 45 Gy to tumor and draining lymph nodes and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy to the tumor are delivered concurrently with chemotherapy. Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 is given intravenously on D-6 (1 week before radiation), followed by 250 mg/m2 once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 &amp; 29). Administration of irinotecan and capecitabine starts on day 1 of radiotherapy. Capecitabine is administered orally at a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily during weekdays (Monday to Friday) during radiotherapy. Irinotecan 40 mg/m2 is given intravenously once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 &amp; 29). Four to eight weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, curative surgery is performed. Safety evaluation of the study will be performed after the first 6 patients treated. If more than 1 out of 6 patients received less than 70-80% of planned dose of capecitabine or irinotecan, the dosage of chemotherapy in the further study patients will be adjusted by a protocol amendment.</detailed_description>
