	<brief_title>Walking Aids in the Management of Hip Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disease in humans, is a significant cause of pain and disability. Non-pharmacological treatments for hip OA include education, exercise, appliances (walking sticks or insoles), and weight reduction if obese or overweight. Canes are often recommended to reduce adverse forces across joints although there is currently no research evidence regarding the efficacy of walking sticks for hip OA. Little information is available regarding the impact of walking aids on psychosocial function and quality of life in individuals with hip OA. This study will evaluate the effects of walking aids in hip OA by examining gait biomechanics, quality of life, pain, and opinions regarding using a cane. Comparisons: Compare gait biomechanics in people with symptomatic unilateral hip OA while walking with and without a cane at baseline and after 4 weeks of cane use. Compare gait biomechanics in people with symptomatic unilateral hip OA with and without a cane to those of healthy, age-matched controls. Compare pain and health-related quality of life in people with symptomatic unilateral hip OA following 4 weeks of cane use. Determine the association between changes in gait biomechanics, pain, and health-related quality of life in people with symptomatic unilateral hip OA following 4 weeks of cane use.</detailed_description>
