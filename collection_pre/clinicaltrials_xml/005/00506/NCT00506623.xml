	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy With Capecitabine Plus Irinotecan in Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized phase II study. Daily fractions of radiotherapy at 1.8 Gy to total of 45 Gy to tumor and draining lymph nodes and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy to the tumor were delivered concurrently with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy starts at day 1 of radiotherapy. Capecitabine is administered orally at a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily during weekdays (Monday to Friday) every week during radiotherapy. Irinotecan 40 mg/m2 is given intravenously once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 &amp; 29). Six Â± 2 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, curative surgery is performed. Post-operative chemotherapy with capecitabine will be given to all patients 3-6 weeks after surgery. Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 every 21 days will be administered for 18 weeks.</detailed_description>
