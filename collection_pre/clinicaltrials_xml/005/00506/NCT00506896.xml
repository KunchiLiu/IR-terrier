	<brief_title>Monoarticular Corticosteroid Injection Versus Systemic Administration in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized double-blind controlled study was conducted including 60 patients with RA. Patients were randomized to receive either a single intra-articular knee injection with triamcinolone hexacetonide 60 mg and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 mL) associated to a single intramuscular injection of 1 mL of xylocaine chloride 2% (IAI group) or 1 mL of xylocaine chloride 2% by intra-articular injection and a intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide 60 mg and xylocaine chloride 2% (1 mL) (IM group). Evaluations were performed at baseline and 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-intervention. The following instruments were used: the ACR 20%, 50 and 70% improvement criteria; VAS for knee morning stiffness, pain and edema; knee circumference and goniometry; Likertâ€™s scale of improvement (IVAS); daily use of oral glucocorticoid and NSAIDs, blood pressure and adverse effects.</detailed_description>
