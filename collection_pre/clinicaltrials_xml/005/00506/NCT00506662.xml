	<detailed_description>Novo Nordisk has decided to discontinue the trial as it will not be possible to recruit the required number of patients. The discontinuation is based on an analysis of the significant delay in recruitment of patients which is likely to have a negative impact on the validity of the trial.</detailed_description>
