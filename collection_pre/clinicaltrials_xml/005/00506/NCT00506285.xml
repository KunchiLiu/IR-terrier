	<brief_summary>This study will look at the effectiveness of Methylphenidate Transdermal System (MTS) in treating adult ADHD. MTS has received FDA approval for childhood ADHD but this is the first trial for adult ADHD. Subjects will experience two screening visits and one baseline visit. Those who meet admission criteria will enter the double-blind phase. This will involve two 4-week treatment periods one of which will involve the use of MTS and the other a placebo patch. Subjects who complete the double-blind phase will be allowed to enter a 180-day, open-label MTS phase designed to assess long-term effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methylphenidate Transdermal System (MTS) in the Treatment of Adult ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADHD affects from 3 to 5% of children, persists into adolescence in 40 to 70% of these children and continues into adulthood in at least 50% of affected adolescents. Methylphenidate was the first medication shown to be effective in treatment for adults with ADHD and continues to be widely used. While the extended release formulations represent an improvement over the immediate release versions, significant problems remain for many patients. In particular, most have been designed with the goal of providing medication only during school hours and a short time period after school. In adults, there is a frequent need for much more extended duration of treatment. MTS is a new form of methylphenidate that provides medication in a transdermal patch delivery system. It has a very even, slowly ascending pharmacokinetic profile. MTS's very stable slowly increasing blood level should overcome the problems noted above with a delivery system that is more convenient for many patients. It is currently approved for treatment of childhood ADHD, with effectiveness and safety profiles similar to other forms of methylphenidate. This study will be the first to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MTS in adult ADHD. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial comparing MTS with placebo patch. The double-blind trial will be preceded by an enrollment period consisting of two screening visits followed as quickly as possible by a baseline visit. Patients who continue to meet admission criteria at baseline will be randomized into the first of two 4-week treatment periods. We will attempt to reach the highest tolerated dose size of MTS within 2 weeks and then observe the response over the last two weeks of each crossover phase. The double-blind period will be followed by a 180 day open-treatment, flexible-dose phase designed to assess long-term effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults meeting DSMIVText Revision criteria for ADHD, the Utah Criteria for ADHD, and experiencing at least moderate impairment (a score of 4 or greater on the CGISeverity Scale for ADHD at both Screening and Baseline visits) will be enrolled. Other criteria include: 1. Subjects ages 18 to 65, inclusive; 2. Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in this study only if: 1. She is of nonchildbearing potential; has a male sexual partner who is surgically sterilized; is on implant of levonorgestrel, injectable progesterone, or an oral contraceptive; has an intrauterine device (IUD); or is sexually inactive with a male partner. 2. Or agrees to use a double barrier method of contraception (any combination of physical and chemical methods) and has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening interview. 3. Subject must be in general good health as determined by medical history, ECG, and other analysis that, in the judgment of the study physician, would confirm the patient's good health. 4. Subjects must read and write at a level sufficient to provide written informed consent and complete studyrelated materials. Subjects will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. Subjects with other current DSMIV Axis I Disorders including Current or lifetime history of psychosis, current bipolar disorder type I, current Major Depressive Disorder, and Current Anxiety Disorder (unless in the opinion of clinic physician ADHD is the primary disorder and causes the disability seen in the patient); 2. Subjects with any other DSMIV Axis II diagnosis so severe that it would suggest nonresponsiveness to pharmacotherapy for ADHD or noncompliance with the protocol; 3. Subjects at risk for suicide or a risk to harm others; 4. History of Substance Dependence according to DSMIV criteria within 3 months of screening; 5. Subjects currently abusing illegal drugs or alcohol are excluded from the study; 6. Positive urine screen for drugs of abuse at screening for patients who have a significant history of substance use but still meet criteria 4 and 5. Patients not at risk for substance abuse will not be given a urine drug screen; 7. Subjects in whom stimulants would represent a risk such as those with a history of stimulant abuse, 8. History of uncontrolled hypertension or significant cardiovascular disease; 9. Any known or suspected significant medical or psychiatric illnesses (e.g., hepatic or renal insufficiency, pulmonary (asthma, COPD, etc), gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological or metabolic disturbances that, in the judgment of the investigator, may impair interpretation of study results or constitute a significant safety concern in the context of the clinical trial; 10. Medications, including health food supplements judged by the investigator to be likely to have central nervous system activity (for example, St John's Wort, gingko leaf, and melatonin), are not permitted during the study. If the subject is taking the medication prior to study entry, there must be a 7 day washout period prior to Visit 2. We will ask for an honest report of all medications consumed between visits. In the event a medication with psychoactive properties is consumed, the patient will be counseled regarding the use of prohibited medications; 11. Use of any medication not considered acceptable by the clinical investigator or the medical monitor during the 7day period before the start of the study (Day 1); 12. Subjects with high BMI (&gt;38) and those with high adipose tissue concentrations in the hip as judged by the clinician.</criteria>
