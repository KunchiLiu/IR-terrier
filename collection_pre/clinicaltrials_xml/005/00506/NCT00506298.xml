	<brief_summary>This trial will assess the efficacy of CRx-401 in lowering FPG levels in patients taking metformin to treat their diabetes. In addition, this initial trial will evaluate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index), HgbA1c levels, glycated protein, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, as well as the safety of CRx-401.</brief_summary>
