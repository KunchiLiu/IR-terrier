	<brief_summary>This is a phase IV, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, comparative and forced- titration study to compare the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus simvastatin in patients with type 2 DM and dyslipidemia. When comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin 20 mg with simvastatin 40 mg for the treatment of type 2 DM with dyslipidemia, rosuvastatin 20 mg is superior to simvastatin 40 mg in achieving the combined goal of LDL-C (&lt;100 mg/dL) and non-HDL-C (&lt;130 mg/dL).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male and female between the ages of 2075 years. 2. Female patients post menopausal, hysterectomized or if of childbearing potential using a reliable method of birth control. 3. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 4. Fasting triglyceride ≧150 mg/dL ≦500 mg/dL or NonHDLC≧130,but≦200 mg/dL 5. Patients receiving stable antidiabetic treatment for 8 weeks before randomization (no change in the category of antidiabetic agents, but the dose is adjustable). 6. All patients give written informed consent. 1. A history of hypersensitivity to statins. 2. A history of rhabdomyolysis or hereditary muscle disorders. 3. Insulintreated patients. 4. Patient with any conditions of acute or chronic pancreatitis. 5. Creatine kinase ≧3fold upper limit of normal (ULN). 6. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance (see note)≦30 ml/min or bilirubin ≧1.5fold ULN, or chronic active hepatitis or liver function impairment (AST and ALT ≧3fold ULN). 7. Overt proteinuria (repeat spot urine protein &gt;300mg/dl by dipstick method). 8. Patients are taking cyclosporine. 9. A history of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. 10. Patients with alcohol and drug abuse in past 3 years. 11. Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions. 12. Hypothyroidism (TSH &gt; 5 μIU/mL). 13. In the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the patient's wellbeing or might confound the clinical trial.</criteria>
