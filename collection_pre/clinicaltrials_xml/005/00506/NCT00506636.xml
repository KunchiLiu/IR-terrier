	<detailed_description>Hair transplantation is an well-documented way of treating hair loss. Hair transplantation is based on redistribution of hair follicles without any new follicle formation. It has been long that a lot of researchers have focused on developing skills in regenerating hair follicles. However, cultured dermal papilla cells lose the ability of inducing hair follicle formation after several generations in vitro culture. Our study is aiming in culturing dermal papilla cells in vitro and maintain their spherical structure before transplanting into dermis in vivo. Meantime, this study may help clarify the actual mechanism of inducing hair follicle by dermal papilla cells.</detailed_description>
