	<brief_summary>Background: Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff may cause chronic pain at the shoulder. Sometimes the pain can lead to a serious impairment in the daily life. One of the most efficient treatments is percutaneous needle aspiration using ultrasound guidance. This treatment includes identification the tendonitis with US or screening , local anesthesia and then puncturing the calcium in the rotator cuff many times. The treatment is short 5-10 minutes, relatively cheap ,safe and usually with good outcomes. However in the literature there is a lack of controlled prospective trials. Our goal is to set a study that will evaluate this treatment between two groups: 1. Puncturing the calcium in the rotator cuff 15 times (the experiment group) 2. Puncturing the calcium in the rotator cuff twice (the controlled group)</brief_summary>
