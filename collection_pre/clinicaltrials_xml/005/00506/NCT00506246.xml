	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study to compare Propofol-MCT/LCT with LCT in terms of their efficacy and safety during total intravenous anaesthesia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Two Propofol Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol (chemical substance 2, 6-Diisopropylphenol) is a short-acting intravenous general anaesthetic which is used for induction and maintenance of a general anaesthesia, for long-term sedation of ventilated intensive care patients or for short-term sedation in diagnostic and surgical procedures. As an active substance propofol produces good and readily controlled anaesthesia with smooth and problem-free recovery both in adult patients and in children over 1 month of age. One potential advantage of this formulation is that the MCT/LCT-emulsion reduces pain on injection, a frequently reported adverse reaction with LCT-emulsions of propofol.</detailed_description>
