	<brief_title>Promoting Self Care to Prevent Urinary Incontinence (UI): A Four-Year Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was designed to determine the capacity of self-efficacy to predict maintenance of the practices of PFMT and BT. Women in the treatment arm of the RCT attended a Bladder Health Class (PFMT &amp; BT) to prevent UI. The class content emphasized self-efficacy. At 3-months post intervention the self-efficacy of participants was measured; these results were collected to analyze for predictive capacity of training adherence. For four years participants in both the treatment and control (no class) arms were followed with both questionnaires and 3-day bladder diaries (2/year) and clinic evaluations of (1/year). In addition, qualitative analyses of the narratives of Bladder Health Class participants identified individual attitudes and strategies that either facilitated or deterred adherence.</detailed_description>
