	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to show the frequency of endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from ectatic coronary arteries as compared to those who have normal coronary arteries. Should this frequency be significant we would recommend initiating conventional treatment in those patients with ectatic coronary arteries as is the practice in patients with endothelial dysfunction without ectatic arteries</brief_summary>
