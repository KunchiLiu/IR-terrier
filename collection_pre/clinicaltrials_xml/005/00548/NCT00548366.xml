	<brief_summary>To determine the relationship between degree of sodium restriction and dietary compliance with clinical outcome of diuresis of portal hypertensive ascites in cirrhotic patients from a county hospital population. Primary objective: Demonstrate that, when accompanied by the appropriate diuretic regimen, a No Added Salt diet (4 grams sodium per day) is as effective as a Low Sodium diet (2 grams sodium per day) in the management of cirrhotic ascites.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives: 1. Demonstrate that patient acceptance is greater and diuresis faster with a No Added Salt diet compared with a Low Sodium diet 2. Demonstrate that side-effects of diuretic therapy are the same or less when patients are on a No Added Salt diet 3. Determine if glomerular filtration rate estimated from the modified diet in renal disease equation differs from that obtained by a 24 hour urinary creatinine in patients with cirrhotic ascites</detailed_description>
