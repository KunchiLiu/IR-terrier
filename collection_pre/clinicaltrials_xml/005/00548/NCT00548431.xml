	<brief_summary>The present pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) study will explore the toxicity and antileukemic response during the initial 3 months of individualised therapy of children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The investigators will on an individual toxicity-titrated basis attempt to increase the dose intensity of the 6-mercaptopurine used in the two-months post-remission treatment phase of lower risk childhood ALL. This will be performed together with continuous PEG-ASP (every 2nd week) and interspersed HD-MTX (5 g/m^2) every 3rd week. Thus, the trial will also test the feasibility of this particular drug combination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition to the details above we will also explore - the relationship of the post-HD-MTX MRD-levels with the dose of 6MP, TPMT-activity, DNA-6TGN, E-6TGN, E-MeMP, E-MTX, and presence of ASP-antibodies, - the early development of anti-ASP antibodies during continuous PEG-ASP therapy. The study could improve the understanding of the pharmacodynamics of the 6MP/HD-MTX interaction in combination with PEG-ASP.</detailed_description>
