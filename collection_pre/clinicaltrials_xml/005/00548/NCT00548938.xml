	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of Gliadel wafers plus surgery and limited field radiation therapy with concomitant temozolomide followed by temozolomide given at an extended dose schedule (metronomic schedule) in patients undergoing initial surgery for newly-diagnosed high grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gliadel Wafer, Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy for Newly Diagnosed GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population in this Phase II clinical trial will be patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma undergoing initial surgery. Patients will receive Surgery + GliadelÂ® wafer implantation + Limited Field Radiation Therapy with concomitant daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2) followed by monthly temozolomide given at the same dose (75 mg/m2 per day for 21 days each month. Patients will have up to 8 wafers implanted into the tumor resection cavity (depending upon its size) after maximal tumor resection. Between Study Days 14 and 45 all patients will begin a standard course of post-operative limited field radiation therapy to the tumor site and a surrounding margin. Temozolomide will be administered concomitantly with radiation at a daily dose of 75 mg/m2 daily (7 days/week) and then beginning no later than 30 days following completion of radiation therapy on a 75 mg/m2 daily dose given 21 days out of each month for a total of up to 18 cycles.</detailed_description>
