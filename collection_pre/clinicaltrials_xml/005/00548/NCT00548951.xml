	<brief_title>Alzheimer Patients and the Snoezelen Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Snoezelen concept or program was originally thought up in Holland and comes from two Dutch words meaning to "sniff and doze". It was first introduced in the Netherlands in the 1970's. The first room was introduced in Snoezelen examines how a group of people react to an area that is private, relaxed and one that they trust. This program will bring out one's sense of taste, touch, smell, sight and hearing just by being in a specially designed room. Trust and relaxation will be looked at by those people with developmental disabilities (those that learn at a slower rate). Snoezelen originated with the belief that everyone needs nerve pulses (senses). Inside a Snoezelen room you will find, dimmed lights, a relaxed atmosphere and pleasant surroundings, soothing sounds, intriguing aromas, tasty puddings, candies, interesting light effects (fiber optic light spray), comfortable seating, opportunities for interaction and engagement, sense of control over environment, tactile objects (awareness box), bubble tube, solar projector wheel, water fountain, massage pillow, massage tube, tranquility and solitude. The Snoezelen room is an environment in which the primary senses (see, hear, taste, touch) are stimulated all to create an environment that is both relaxing and stimulating. The benefits of Snoezelen change per person but may include some of the following: - Increased resident and caregiver communication - Increased awareness and understanding of the environment The Snoezelen idea: client-controlled, safe comfortable atmosphere and freedom from pressure. Sensory Deprivation (loss) The average person touches 300 different surfaces every 30 minutes. The average person with a profound disability will likely touch 1-5 surfaces in the same time frame.</detailed_description>
