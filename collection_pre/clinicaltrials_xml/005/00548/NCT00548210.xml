	<brief_title>Effectivity of Dermatix in Promoting Scar Maturation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The healing of deep thermal injuries is always associated with scarring. The healing process can lead to the formation of large scar bundles (e.g. hypertrophic scars). The scars can be discomforting, disfiguring and restrict motion if situated over or near joints. Evidence for effectivity of treatment for reduction of hypertrophic scars or the prevention of them is limited. Different treatments are used such as intralesional injected steroids, topically used oily creams, silicone sheets or occlusive dressings. Compression garments are also frequently used. There is some evidence as to the effectivity of silicone sheets for recuction of hypertrophic scarring, however, these sheets cannot be used easily on all anatomical locations. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has developed a silicone based scar remodelling gel, DermatixÂ®, which has been empirically shown by others to have potential to reduce hypertrophic scars. Primary objectives are to demonstrate effectivity of Dermatix in promoting maturation of the scar, versus a control region that will be treated with an indifferent cream.</detailed_description>
