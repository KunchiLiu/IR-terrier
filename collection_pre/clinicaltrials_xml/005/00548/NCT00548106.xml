	<brief_summary>The study will be a randomized, double-blind, prospective trial. Newborn infants (enrollment age 0-14 days) will be assigned randomly to receive one of two products, provided in identical packages except for the lid color. Neither the investigators nor the parents will know which product the infant is receiving. The infants will be monitored at study enrollment, and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age. There will be two study groups, each receiving one of the following formulas: 1. The new partially hydrolyzed whey formula (NF) - Materna cow's milk infant formula containing partially hydrolyzed whey protein, produced and packaged by Materna Laboratories, Maabarot. 2. The currently marketed partially hydrolyzed whey formula (CF) - Nan HA, produced by Nestlé. In order to maintain blinding, the Nan HA will be repacked in packaging identical to the Materna product, except for the lid color</brief_summary>
