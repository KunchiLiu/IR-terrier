	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Including Sorafenib in Women With Previously Untreated Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel (EC/P) is a well tolerated regimen with high clinical activity. Histopathological complete remission after preoperative chemotherapy has a direct correlation with the disease-free and overall survival. The aim of combining a chemotherapy regime with sorafenib in the neoadjuvant setting is to increase the locoregional and systemic outcome of these patients</detailed_description>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test Negative HER2/neu status Karnofsky Performance status index &gt;= 80%; Normal cardiac function Laboratory requirements: Absolute neutrophile count (ANC) &gt;= 2,0 x 109/L and Platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L and Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 g/dL (&gt;= 6.2 mmol/L) INR ≤ 1.5 ULN and PTT ≤ 1.5 ULN within 14 days prior to enrolment ASAT or ALAT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 UNL. Patients with ASAT and/or ALAT &gt; 1,5 x UNL associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2,5 x UNL are not eligible for the study Total bilirubin &lt; 1 X UNL Creatinine ≤ 175 µmol/L (2 mg/dl). The calculated creatinine clearance should be ≥ 60 mL/min. Paraffin tumor tissue block and each one serum and one plasma sample centrally made available Complete staging workup within 3 months prior to registration. Patients must be available and compliant for treatment and followup. Patients registered on this trial must be treated and followed up at the participating or a cooperating center.

Evidence of distant metastasis; Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy; Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer; Preexisting rhagades at hand and feet and other skin problems (e.g. psoriasis) Pregnant or lactating patients. Preexisting motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity &gt;= grade 2 by NCI criteria; 7. Concurrent treatment with: Chronic corticosteroids unless initiated &gt; 6 months prior to study entry and at low dose (&lt; 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent); Sex hormones. Prior treatment must be stopped before study entry; Patients with increased risk of bleeding due to concurrent therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulative treatment. Low dose of coumarines are permitted. Other experimental drugs or any other anticancer therapy; Drugs recognized as being strong inhibitors or inducers of the isoenzyme CYP3A within the last 5 days or their expected need 8. Other serious illness or medical condition: Previous malignant disease without being diseasefree of less than 5 years (except CIS of the Cervix and nonmelanomatous skin cancer) Known or suspected congestive heart failure (≥NYHA II) and/or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of myocardial infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, un or poorly controlled arterial hypertension, rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment, clinically significant valvular heart disease Thrombotic or embolic events Hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior study entry Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders Patients with seizure disorders requiring medication such as steroids or antiepileptics Currently active infection History of HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C Serious non healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture Patients with prior immunosuppressive treatment Severe pulmonary condition/illness Disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, Patients with severe liver disease Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids Inadequate general condition (not fit for anthracycline/taxanecontaining chemotherapy)</criteria>
