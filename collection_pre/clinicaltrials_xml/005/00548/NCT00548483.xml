	<brief_summary>The specific objectives were to determine whether high dose dexamethasone are more effective than low dose dexamethasone in the reduction or prevention of post-extubation airway obstruction among patients with a cuff leak volume (CLV) &lt; 110 mL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of High Dose and Low Dose Dexamethasone in Preventing Post-Extubation Airway Obstruction in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Controversy currently exists regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic steroid therapy for patients considered at high risk for post-extubation stridor. Studies regarding the efficacy of prophylactic corticosteroids for intubated patients have yielded conflicting results due to differences in the number, dose, or type of corticosteroids administered. Only a limited number of prospective trials involving adults and evaluating the benefits and the dose of corticosteroid therapy prior to extubation have been conducted.The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of prophylactic dexamethasone therapy for a subset of high-risk patients who had been intubated for &gt; 48 hours and who were undergoing their first elective extubation in an ICU setting.</detailed_description>
