	<brief_title>Topotecan, Cisplatin and Bevacizumab for Recurrent/Persistent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. Chemoradiation has led to improvements in survival, but the prognosis for patients with recurrent, metastatic cervical cancer remains poor. There is the need for more effective treatments for the management of recurrent/persistent cervical cancer. Angiogenesis appears to play an important role in cervical cancer development and progression, therefore VEGF inhibition appears to be a rationale therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer. There is increasing evidence that combining an anti-angiogenic agent with either cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation enhances anti-tumor activity. This study combines the current most active chemotheraputic regimen for cervical cancer (cisplatin + topotecan) with an anti-angiogenic agent.</detailed_description>
