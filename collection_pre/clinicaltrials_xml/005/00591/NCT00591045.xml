	<brief_summary>This is a randomized phase II multicenter controlled study of oxaliplatin, calcium folinate, and 5-fluorouracil (mFOLFOX7) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable advanced gastric cancer. Hypothesis: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve 5 year overall survival compared with the control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Oxaliplatin, Calcium Folinate, and 5-Fluorouracil as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Resectable Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis is that the 5 year survival rate will reach 35% from 25% when neoadjuvant chemotherapy is carried out. With the alpha value to be 0.05 and beta value to be 0.80 as well as 10 percent of patients' lost-of-followup, the sample size will be 263.</detailed_description>
