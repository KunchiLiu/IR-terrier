	<brief_summary>Tinnitus is defined as the perception of sound in the absence of a external source. About 15 % of the population is believed to experience tinnitus and for about 20 % of them it may become a very serious problem. Total comprehension of tinnitus pathophysiology has not yet been achieved, but modern theories focus in brain hyperactivity following inner ear damage, with involvement of various neurotransmitters. Piribedil,a dopamin agonist, has been used to treat tinnitus, focusing in dopamine release, which is inhibitory. Electrophysiological methods,like acoustic otoemissions and electrocochleography may reveal the changes in peripherical and central auditory pathways and help to choose the specific patients who could benefit from piribedil treatment.</brief_summary>
