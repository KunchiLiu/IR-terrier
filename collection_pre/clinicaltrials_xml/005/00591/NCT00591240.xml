	<brief_title>A Biochip for Rapid Diagnosis of Complicated Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Point-of-care identification of pathogens and determination of antibiotic susceptibility will significantly improve the clinical management of urinary tract infection. We have previously developed a biochip based on microfabrication technology capable of rapid detection of pathogens. The specific objectives of the current proposal are: 1) Determination of microbial constituents in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and development of additional species-specific probes against these pathogens; 2) Development of a rapid antibiotic susceptibility and molecular pyuria assay using the electrochemical biochip; and 3) Clinical validation of the biochip as a diagnostic test for urinary tract infection. Within a single protocol, two non-interventional studies were conducted at different time points to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Sensitivity and specificity of the electrochemical biosensor based assay was demonstrated in each study.</detailed_description>
