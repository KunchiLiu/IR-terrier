	<brief_title>Ginsenoside-Rd for Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major contributor to brain injury after stroke is disordered inward flow of Ca2+ and its toxic accumulation in the nervous system following cerebral ischemia. Ginsenoside-Rd, a purified component from total saponins of Panax notoginseng, has a molecular formula of C48H82O18â€¢3H2O with a molecular weight of 1001.2. Ginsenoside-Rd has been shown to inhibit receptor-operated Ca2+ influx through receptor-and-store-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCC) , attenuate oxidative stress in stroke, reduce the size of the cerebral infarction and preserve brain functioning in animal models of acute ischemic stroke.</detailed_description>
