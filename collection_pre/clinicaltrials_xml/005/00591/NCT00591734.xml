	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized, open label Phase II study comparing bevacizumab and everolimus in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 Plus Bevacizumab in Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will begin treatment with the same doses of RAD001 and bevacizumab. Patients will receive 6 weeks of treatment, followed by re evaluation. Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment until disease progression. During the study, all patients will receive 10 mg of RAD001 orally daily and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks. Fifty-five patients will be enrolled in this multi-centered study</detailed_description>
