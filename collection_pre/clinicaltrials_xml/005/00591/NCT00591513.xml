	<brief_summary>This clinical trial tests the hypothesis that engineered human skin can reduce the requirements for harvesting of conventional skin autografts by providing more skin for grafting from the donor skin used to treat the wounds. In life-threatening burns (e.g., greater than 50% of the total body surface area), greater availability of skin may be definitive to patient survival, and may reduce scar formation at the donor site, and from use of widely-meshed skin autograft.</brief_summary>
