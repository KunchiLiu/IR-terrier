	<brief_summary>Decreased range of motion is common after fractures around the knee and can impact a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living such as rising from a seated position or getting in and out of a bathtub. A continuous passive motion (CPM) machine is a machine that continuously moves a joint (such as the knee) without the patient having to use the muscles in his/her leg. A goal of this therapy is to maintain as much motion as possible following this injury. This study is a randomized, prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of CPM in maintaining knee range of motion following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of fractures around the knee</brief_summary>

	<criteria>If the patient has an intraarticular distal femur or proximal tibia fracture Independent ambulatory prior to injury No previous knee injury limiting motion If the patients range of motion was decreased prior to injury (ex. Osteoarthritis, previous knee fracture or injury) Any contraindication to CPM (concomitant hip or ankle fracture) Open physis of tibia or distal femur Pathological Fracture Compartment Syndrome Neurovascular injury Fracture due to gunshot wound Greater than 21 days from fracture to definitive open reduction and internal fixation Fractures treated with definitive external fixation Open fractures Extensor mechanism injuries Likely problems in the judgment of the investigator with maintaining followup</criteria>
