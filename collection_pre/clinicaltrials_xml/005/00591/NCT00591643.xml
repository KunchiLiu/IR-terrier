	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if your adrenal glands are normal or abnormal. This can be determined by whether or not your adrenal gland concentrates more of a labeled building block of adrenal hormone, norcholesterol. This labeled material had been used as an investigative diagnostic tool for imaging adrenal glands for many years with success in our hands. This is a diagnostic procedure. CT, MRI and Ultrasound can determine the size and presence or absence of tumor but cannot assess the function of the adrenal glands. To determine hormone concentrations from blood samples would involve more invasive catherization.</brief_summary>
