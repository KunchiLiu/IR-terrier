	<brief_summary>This study will examine two questions: 1. Whether insulin treatment of high blood sugar in patients with diabetes while they are in the emergency room will improve how quickly they recover from illness if they need to be hospitalized. 2. Whether immediately beginning long lasting insulin detemir in patients with diabetes when they are admitted to hospital from the emergency room will improve how quickly they recover from the illness which necessitated hospitalization.</brief_summary>
