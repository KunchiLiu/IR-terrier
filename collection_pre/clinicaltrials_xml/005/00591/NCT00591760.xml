	<brief_title>Growth Hormone Deficiency in Chronic Heart Failure: A Preliminary Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, a wide range of alterations in the GH/IGF-1 axis have been described in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF): reductions in GH levels, reductions in IGF-1 and a pattern of peripheral resistance to GH, in particular in patients with severe heart failure and cardiac cachexia. Unpublished experience of our group support the concept that a considerable amount of CHF-patients have a coexisting Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD), defined by current guidelines(GH stimulation test). Our study hypothesis is that correction of GH deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure may exert a beneficial effect on their cardiac function and remodeling, performance status and quality-of-life. Since this was a preliminary study, no sample size calculation was performed; treatment effects from were sought in left ventricular function (as assessed by cardiac MRI), cardiopulmonary exercise performance, clinical status, vascular reactivity, biochemistry and neurohumoral markers of disease (NT-proBNP).</detailed_description>
