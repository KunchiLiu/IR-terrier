	<brief_title>Jarvik 2000 Heart as a Bridge to Cardiac Transplantation - Pivotal Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Jarvik 2000 Heart is a silent compact axial flow impeller pump of 1 inch diameter, weighing 90g with a displacement volume of 25ml. The pump is implanted into the apex of the left ventricle by left thoracotomy, or by mid-sternotomy, or by the subcostal approach. A vascular graft offloads to either the descending thoracic aorta, the ascending thoracic aorta, or the abdominal aorta. The impeller rotates at speeds of 8,000 to 12,000 rpm providing blood flow of up to seven L/minute. At higher speeds the pump can produce 10 L/minute. Power is provided through an abdominal drive line.</detailed_description>
