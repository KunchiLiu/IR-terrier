	<brief_title>The Effect of Exercise on Individuals With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson's disease (PD) negatively affects the quality of life for a million individuals in the United States. While medication and surgery are the most effective treatments for PD, physicians and people with PD often delay using these treatments because of their considerable adverse side effects. Until a cure for PD is discovered, there is a compelling need to develop interventions that provide relief of symptoms without causing negative side effects. Recent research suggests that exercise may provide symptom relief in some characteristics of PD. While various exercise interventions appear to effectively improve motor, functional, and quality-of-life issues, the research is mixed regarding the nature, extent and duration of these improvements. Understanding how multiple characteristics of PD change and whether they can be modified by different exercise programs is essential to determining if an exercise program is clinically effective for PD. This study is designed to compare the initial (six months), and then long-term (2 years) effect that 2 different exercise programs (progressive resistance program or flexibility program) have on neuro-physiological, motor, functional, and quality-of-life issues in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The goal is to determine which program is most beneficial. Results from this study will be used to determine which exercise program produces the most beneficial effects on neuro-physiological, motor, functional and quality-of-life measures. NOTE: Recruitment for Parkinson's disease participants is now closed.</detailed_description>
