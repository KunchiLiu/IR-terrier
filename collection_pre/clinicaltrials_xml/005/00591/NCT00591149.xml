	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel Followed by Cetuximab for Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to assess the effects of oxaliplatin and docetaxel followed by epidermal factor-antibody (EGFR-AB) cetuximab on patients with previously treated recurrent /metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
