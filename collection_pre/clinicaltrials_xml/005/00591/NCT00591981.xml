	<brief_summary>Our goal is to develop a reliable, physician and patient-friendly, pre-operative Thoracic Onco-Geriatric Assessment (TOGA) to predict surgical risk in geriatric oncology patients with thoracic neoplasms of the lung, esophagus, pleura and thymus, modeled upon existing CGA tools, including the Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thoracic OncoGeriatric Assessment (TOGA) Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our proposed TOGA wil consist of portions of the PACE and some additional screening tools, and will be applied prospectively to all patients 70 years old and above seen in the UWCCC for a thoracic oncology surgery. Residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities will be eligible for this study if they are thought to be appropriate surgical candidates; other institutionalized patients will not. The preoperative TOGA will be performed by either Drs. Weigel, Maloney, LoConte or Traynor or P.A. Block. The TOGA includes parts of the PACE, involving assessment of co-morbid illness, Activities of Daily Living [ADL], Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADL], Geriatric Depression Screen [GDS], Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/Zubrod Performance Status [PS], Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), in addition to an American Society of Anesthesiologists Score[ASA] and mini nutritional assessment (MNA), which were not done in the PACE. The TOGA should take up to 25 minutes to complete (Audisio, 2006), and will be done at only one time preoperativelOur hypothesis is that this novel, preoperative Thoracic Onco Geriatric Assessment (TOGA) will serve to predict outcomes for older patients going though thoracic oncology surgery, and thus will enhance geriatric patient care through the development of concise, validated, preoperative risk stratification. Our hypothesis is that this abbreviated geriatric screening tool will be a better predictor for surgical and oncologic complications after surgery than performance status alone (which is currently the only measure of fitness used in routine oncology care). In addition, we predict that parts of the TOGA, specifically the instrumental activites of daily living score (IADL), mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and the brief fatigue inventory (BFI), will be the strongest predictor(s) of outcomes in our thoracic surgery population. The outcomes data we generate will also be important in quality improvement and standardization of preoperative risk assessment for elderly patients with thoracic malignancies.</detailed_description>
