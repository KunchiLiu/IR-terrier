	<brief_title>A Bridging Trial Comparing Org 25969 at Reappearance of T2 in Japanese and Caucasian Subjects. Part A: Japanese Subjects (19.4.208A)(P05956)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For most surgical procedures a depth of neuromuscular block of 1-2 twitches after TOF-stimulation is sufficient to avoid unwanted muscular activity. At reappearance of T2, the anesthesiologist might decide to either give (another) maintenance dose of rocuronium or vecuronium when surgery continues, to await spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular block or to reverse the neuromuscular block. Org 25969 has been shown in previous trials to greatly reduce the time to full recovery when administered at reappearance of T2, both after rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The current trial 19.4.208A was conducted in Japan and set up to establish the dose-response relationship of Org 25969 given during sevoflurane anesthesia at reappearance of T2 after rocuronium or vecuronium in Japanese subjects. In addition to recovery time, also pharmacokinetics and safety of Org 25969 were to be evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects of ASA class 1 3; Subjects at least 20 years but under 65 years of age; Japanese subjects; Subjects scheduled for elective surgery in supine position and under sevoflurane anesthesia, in need of administration of NMBAs, with an anticipated duration of about 1.53 hours; Subjects who had given written informed consent. Subjects in whom a difficult intubation because of anatomical malformations was expected; Subjects known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders impairing the effect of NMBAs and/or significant renal dysfunction (for example a creatinine level &gt; 1.6 mg/dl) and/or severe hepatic dysfunction. Subjects known or suspected to have a (family) history of malignant hyperthermia; Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other medication used during general anesthesia; Subjects receiving medication expected to interfere with the rocuronium or vecuronium given in this trial, based on the dose and time of administration; Female subjects who were pregnant; Female subjects not using birth control or using only oral contraception as birth control continuously; Subjects who were breastfeeding; Subjects who had already participated in CT 19.4.208A, or in another trial with Org 25969; Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial within 6 months of entering into CT 19.4.208A.</criteria>
