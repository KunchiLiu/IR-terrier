	<brief_summary>Patients recovering from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery have high rates of depression, and depression is associated with higher risk of complications and death. Recent discoveries show that depression involves changes in certain molecules in the blood, which are also involved in progressive coronary artery disease (CAD) and its complications. This study will evaluate the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment for depression on these biological markers among CABG patients.</brief_summary>
