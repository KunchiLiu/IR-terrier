	<brief_summary>GW685698X is a novel glucocorticoid receptor agonist that is being developed as an orally inhaled treatment for asthma. In previous studies inhaled GW685698X was administered as a dry powder containing either lactose alone or lactose and cellobiose octaacetate. However, future dry powder GW685698X formulations will contain lactose and magnesium stearate. This study will be the first administration of this new GW685698X dry powder formulation in man and will provide safety and tolerability data to support the further development of this formulation.</brief_summary>
