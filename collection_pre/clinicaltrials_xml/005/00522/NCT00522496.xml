	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Determine the temporal course of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in patients wiht severe traumatic brain injury 2. Determine the temporal course of the expression of MMP-related inflammatory mediators of secondary injury in patients with severe traumatic brain injury 3. Describe the association of physiological changes and standard microdialysis analyte measures (lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, and glucose) to MMP and neuroinflammatory marker concentrations.</brief_summary>
