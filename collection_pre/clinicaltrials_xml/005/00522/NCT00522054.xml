	<brief_title>Tai Chi for Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory and systemic disease that mainly affects the musculoskeletal system. The disease is often progressive and may result in reduced physical function, pain, fatigue, and joint destruction. Exercise programs are reported to improve physical functioning in patients with RA. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese martial art that was developed in the 13th century, and combines slow and gentle movements with mental focus. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a 12 weeks standardized Tai Chi group exercise program on disease activity, physical function and health status in patients with RA attending. Further, the patients experiences of possible effects of Tai Chi were to be obtained in a focus group interview.</detailed_description>
