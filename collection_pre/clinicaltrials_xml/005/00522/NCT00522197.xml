	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of ACAPHA, a combination of six herbs, may prevent lung cancer from forming in former smokers with bronchial intraepithelial neoplasia. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well ACAPHA works in preventing lung cancer in former smokers with bronchial intraepithelial neoplasia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACAPHA in Preventing Lung Cancer in Former Smokers With Bronchial Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy and safety of multi-herbal agent ACAPHA in former smokers with bronchial intraepithelial neoplasia. - Evaluate whether ACAPHA can modulate other surrogate endpoint biomarkers of aberrant methylation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, as well as phase I and II enzyme regulation. - Establish a library of in vivo confocal microendoscopy images with corresponding histopathology, nuclear morphometry, and other biomarker information to assess the potential of confocal microendoscopy as a nonbiopsy method in assessing the effect of chemoprevention agents. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral multi-herbal agent ACAPHA twice daily for 6 months. Patients achieving a partial response receive an additional 6 months of ACAPHA. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. Patients achieving a partial response receive an additional 6 months of placebo. Patients with progressive disease receive ACAPHA twice daily for 6 months. Patients undergo sputum cytology, oral and bronchial brushings, bronchoalveolar lavage, and bronchial tissue biopsies at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Samples are analyzed for histopathological and morphometric cell changes; MIB-1 bcl-2, and TUNEL immunostaining; methylation biomarkers; and gene expression analysis of RNA. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
