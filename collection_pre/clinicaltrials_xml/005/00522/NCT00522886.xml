	<brief_summary>To determine the MTD toxicity of standard dose cetuximab together with concurrent individualized, isotoxic accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-vinorelbine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Cetuximab and Concurrent Radio-chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I trial with escalating doses of vinorelbine and standard doses of radiotherapy, cisplatin and cetuximab. Eligible patients receive 2 cycles of carboplatin (AUC 5) day 1 and gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2) days 1,8. One cycle duration is 21 days. Patients without progressive disease (PD) according to the RECIST criteria (appendix 1) will be entered in the phase I dose-escalation part of the study. Chest radiation is given concurrently with cetuximab, cisplatin and vinorelbine. The latter drug will be escalated in three steps until dose-limiting toxicity occurs. On day 43, i.e. 14 days after the last gemcitabine delivery, radiotherapy is started. Radiotherapy: In all patients in every dose-step, the radiation will be given as follows: first 3 weeks: 1.5 Gy BID to a dose of 45 Gy in 30 fractions, then 2 Gy QD to a mean lung dose (MLD, this is related to radiation-induced lung damage) of 19 Gy. Maximum dose: 69 Gy given in 5.5 weeks. Maximum dose to the spinal cord: 50 Gy. Cetuximab: All patients will receive a starting dose 400 mg/ m2 7 days before the beginning of radiotherapy (i.e. day 36), thereafter a weekly dose 250 mg/ m2 during the course of radiotherapy for 5 consecutive weeks. Cetuximab will be delivered at the same days as chemotherapy. Cisplatin: In all patients in every dose-step, cisplatin will be given as follows: Step 1, 2 and 3: 50 mg/ m2 days 43, 50; 40 mg/m2 day 64. Vinorelbine will be escalated in three steps: Step 1: 10 mg/ m2 days 43, 50; 8 mg/m2 days 66 and 73. Step 2: 20 mg/ m2 days 43, 50; 8 mg/m2 days 66 and 73. Step 3: 20 mg/ m2 days 43, 50; 15 mg/m2 days 66 and 73.</detailed_description>
