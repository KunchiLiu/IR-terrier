	<brief_title>Regulation of Intracerebral Pressure During Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Aim: 1. Our main objective concerning this study is to determine to what extent ECT does lead to an increase of the Pulsatility Index (as an indicator of intracerebral pressure) measured by a Transcranial Doppler Device (TCD). 2. As a secondary objective we want to compare the PI measurements with simultaneously measured systemic blood pressure. 2. Study design: a.Observational study: cohort study 3. Treatment: a. Treatment as usual, PI and blood pressure measurement at baseline, just before ECT, during and 5 minutes after ECT. Data will be collected during unilateral treatment during 3 consecutive ECT treatments. 4. Endpoints: 1. A minimum of sixteen patients are needed according to the power analysis.</detailed_description>
