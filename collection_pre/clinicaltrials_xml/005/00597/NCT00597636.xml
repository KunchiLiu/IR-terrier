	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help us better understand the cellular changes that may lead to the development of lung cancer. We want to compare people who have never smoked and yet have been diagnosed with lung cancer to never smokers who have not developed lung cancer. We hope to use the information obtained in this study as the basis for future studies and will not regard the results from this study as final.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cases will be eligible for inclusion if: They have been diagnosed with a lung cancer or have had previous surgical treatment for their lung cancer and have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, are/were not regular cigar or pipe smokers, and They have had no prior chemotherapy or radiation treatment within the last year (Exception: genotyping analysis/screening can be performed on specimens from individuals who had chemo/radiation treatment within the last year as germline DNA will not be affected) They speak and read English They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and They agree to give us a blood sample, and They agree to complete the study questionnaire, and They agree to have their pathology information reviewed by study personnel. Controls will be eligible for inclusion if: They have not been diagnosed with any type of cancer, exclusive of nonmelanoma skin cancer and have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, are/were not regular cigar or pipe smokers, and They speak and read English They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and They agree to give us a blood sample, and They agree to complete the study questionnaire. Subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria for either the case or control groups will not be eligible for this study. All individuals who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements above, but who have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 1 year of evaluation will be excluded (Exception: genotyping analysis/screening can be performed on specimens from individuals who had chemo/radiation treatment within the last year as germline DNA will not be affected).</criteria>
