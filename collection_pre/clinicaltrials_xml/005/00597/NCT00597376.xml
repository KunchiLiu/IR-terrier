	<brief_summary>The purpose of this six-month research study is to determine if Cerefolin NAC reduces levels of substances in the blood that may be associated with thinking ability and the health of brain cells in subjects with memory concerns when compared to a standard multivitamin. Cerefolin NAC is available as a dietary supplement via a prescription from a physician. The multivitamin used in the study contains the Recommended Daily Intake recommended for older persons.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of Cerefolin NAC on Inflammation Blood Markers in Older Individuals With Memory Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Phase: Exploratory Indication: Memory Complaints Study Design: A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 100 subjects with memory complaints followed for 6 months (4 visits)using Cerefolin® NAC or placebo once a day in addition to a standardized multivitamin. Sample Size: 100 subjects as follows: 1. 50 on Cerefolin® NAC + multivitamin; and, 2. 50 on Placebo + multivitamin. Primary Objective: To determine if Cerefolin® NAC (compared to multivitamin) decreases the blood level of homocysteine, increases the blood level of glutathione (a marker for oxidative stress), and increases the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 (a marker for beta-amyloid) that may be related to neuronal injury and inflammation. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine if Cerefolin® NAC reduces hs-CRP and TNF-α blood levels, and increases IL-6 blood levels. 2. To determine if Cerefolin® NAC (compared to Placebo) reduces plasma F2 isoprostane and increases potential antioxidant (PAO) levels. 3. To assess the tolerability of Cerefolin® NAC 4. To explore the effects of Cerefolin® NAC on a 6-month change in: (a)global and specific cognitive domains in a standardized neuropsychological test battery,(b) quality of life as measured by SF-36, (c)instrumental and basic activities of daily living, (d)MADRS; and (e)performance-based physical function. 5. To explore if a change in homocysteine level is related to a change in the plasma glutathione, hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, F2-isoprostane, and PAO levels and to a change in the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. 6. To explore the effects of MS AG2756, APOE and MFTHR on the relationship examined in Secondary Objective #5. 7. To explore the relationship of B12 status and status to cognition NOTE: For individuals successfully completing the 6-month blinded phase, there is an 12-month open-label extension of Cerefolin NAC + multivitamin. The primary purpose of the exploratory, open-label extension phase of the CERE-001 study is to systematically collect long-term safety data on CEREFOLIN NAC usage over an additional 12-month period.</detailed_description>
