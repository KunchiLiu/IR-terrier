	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect post-marketing data on patient outcomes and satisfaction following treatment with the Plicatorâ„¢. The outcomes will be tracked through analysis of patient Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires and medication use. The QoL and medication use questionaires will be administered and documented twice before the procedure and then again at outlined intervals following the procedure. Additionally, financial measures will be evaluated (i.e. pre-procedural and procedural time and costs, staffing/personnel needs during procedure, anesthesia and related costs, recovery time and associated cost, etc.) and post-procedure GERD-related medical history questionnaires will be completed. This post-market evaluation is a multi-center study design using the NDO Surgical, Inc. Plicator as the treatment device. Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by comparing QoL and medication use before and after treatment with the device. Patient follow-ups will be completed at 1 week and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post treatment.</brief_summary>
