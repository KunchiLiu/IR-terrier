	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how the brain re-learns to control the larynx in speaking and swallowing when undergoing surgical rehabilitation in the form of either thyroplasty or vocal fold augmentation for unilateral vocal cord paralysis. What is needed is information on how the brain re-learns to control speaking and swallowing so that we can eventually learn how to help patients re-learn faster after their procedure. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or fMRI) will allow us to image your brain as you speak and swallow. We will produce "brain maps" for speaking, swallowing and hand movements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Functional Outcomes in Patients With Unilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis: Assessment of Adaptation Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this investigation is to determine cortical mechanisms of adaptation to surgical rehabilitation of patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) undergoing either type I thyroplasty or unilateral vocal fold augmentation for the management of unilateral vocal cord paralysis. This study will use the non-invasive imaging technique, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to investigate cortical responses and responses in the larynx of patients with UVCP who have been deemed to be candidates for either type I thyroplasty or unilateral vocal fold augmentation for the purpose of rehabilitating this UVCP. Patterns of brain activity from the fMRI studies will be compared with the preoperative study with each patient serving as their own control for the purpose of evaluating the alterations in sensory motor organization of the brain in response to UVCP. In addition, responses in patients with UVCP will be compared to normal controls. This will allow us to identify the impact on speech and swallowing and the subsequent reorganization which we theorize will occur in response to the vocal cord medialization. Patients will undergo standardized voice evaluation with improvement in voice serving as a secondary endpoint. The results of the current investigation will provide needed information on both central and peripheral mechanisms of adaptation.</detailed_description>
