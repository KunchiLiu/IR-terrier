	<criteria>1. Be at least 18 years of age as of the date of evaluation. 2. Require lens powers between 0.50 and 6.00 diopters sphere with no more than 1.00 diopter of refractive astigmatism and be willing to wear lenses in both eyes. 3. Be correctable to visual acuities of at least 20/25 in each eye with spectacles. 4. Be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge. 5. Be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and able to keep all specified appointments. 6. Possess wearable and visually functional eyeglasses. 1. Previously unsuccessful with contact lens wear. 2. Rigid gas permeable contact lens wear within the past 12 months. 3. Previous refractive surgery; current or previous orthokeratology treatment. 4. Subject is wearing lenses in a modified monovision modality (multifocal lens in one eye). NOTE: subjects may not wear monovision lenses at any time during the study unless they are wearing spherical monovision lenses prior to enrollment. 5. Aphakia, keratoconus or an irregular cornea. 6. A known history of corneal hypoesthesia 7. Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated structures. 8. Ocular or systemic disease or need for medication which might interfere with contact lens wear. i.e., Sjögren's syndrome, type II diabetes, etc. 9. Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear, including but not limited to: History of corneal ulcer, corneal infiltrates or fungal infections. Pterygium, pinguecula or corneal scars within the visual axis Pathological dry eye or associated findings (examples: Sjögren's syndrome, lupus erythematosus, sclerodermia) Neovascularization or ghost vessels &gt; 1mm in from the limbus Seborrheic eczema, seborrheic conjunctivitis History of papillary conjunctivitis greater than Grade 2 (Mild) Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present) 10. Known sensitivity to the care systems used in this study. 11. Poor personal hygiene 12. Current pregnancy or is lactating (to the best of the subject's knowledge) or subject is planning pregnancy within the next 13 months. 13.
