	<brief_summary>Relatively few health promotion and disease prevention programs have included or targeted people with disabilities, and even fewer have focused on individuals with intellectual disabilities. The long-term objectives of the Healthy Lifestyles for People with Intellectual Disabilities Study (HLID) are to increase the health of persons with intellectual disabilities by establishing the efficacy of a health promotion program and promoting its adoption. The HLID Study is based in the Center on Community Accessibility (CCA) at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. The mission of CCA is to increase the health and health-related quality of life of persons with disabilities. A pilot study conducted by CCA has established the effectiveness of the Healthy Lifestyles (HL) intervention among a cross-disability population in increasing health behavior adoption. The specific aim of the HLID Study is to test the efficacy of the HL program specifically with adults with intellectual disabilities. The HLID Study uses a randomized control study design. The HL intervention will be administered to 75 adults and will compare results to those of an additional 75 adults who receive no intervention. Measurement will include anthropometric assessments to measure impacts on overweight and obesity, as well as self-report measures of healthy behaviors, health status, health care utilization, and secondary conditions. Results will be shared with research participants, presented through professional conferences and newsletters, and published in peer-reviewed journals with the assistance of community partners.</brief_summary>
