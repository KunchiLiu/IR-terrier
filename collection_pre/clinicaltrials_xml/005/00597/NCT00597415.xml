	<brief_title>Efficacy of Celecoxib 200mg in Relieving Pain and Walking Dysfunction in Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have developed a walking model that safely and reproducibly induces pain in subjects with knee OA in a manner that permits the comparison of the effect of different therapies on pain control. In a previous study, we demonstrated that a self-paced 20 minute walk followed by a one-hour rest and a second coordinator-paced 20-minute walk was well tolerated and generated moderate to severe pain in all participants within the time frame of the walk. We will now use this model, but with a crossover design to test the efficacy of celecoxib compared to placebo for the control of knee pain and improvement of walking function.</detailed_description>

Subjects who are not taking any pain medication must have a VAS pain score&gt;=40mm in the signal knee At baseline visit, must have a history of pain in the signal knee&gt;=40mm when walking on the flat within the previous 48 hours. In the Investigator's opinion, the patient requires and is eligible for therapy with an antiinflammatory analgesic. If on an NSAID or analgesic, patient must have completed a washout period prior to baseline assessments that is a minium of five half lives. The patient has provided written informed consent before undergoing any study procedures. Diagnosed as having inflammatory arthritis or acute trauma at the index joint.
