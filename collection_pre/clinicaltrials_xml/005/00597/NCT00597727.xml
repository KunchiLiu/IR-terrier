	<brief_title>A Study of Sublingual Immunotherapy in Peanut-allergic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite of increased recognition and understanding of food allergies, food-induced anaphylaxis remains the single most common cause of anaphylaxis seen in hospital emergency departments, accounting for about one third of anaphylaxis cases seen. It is estimated that about 30,000 food-induced anaphylactic events are seen in U.S. emergency departments each year and that about 200 fatal cases occur in the U.S. each year. Either peanuts or tree nuts cause more than 80% of these reactions. No treatments are available and avoidance is the only approved intervention. The goal of this study is to investigate peanut sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) as a treatment for children with peanut allergy. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of peanut SLIT compared to placebo after 12 months. Mechanistic studies will be completed concurrently to understand changes in the allergic immune response related to peanut SLIT. The remainder of the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of peanut SLIT in inducing lasting tolerance after discontinuation of the peanut SLIT.</detailed_description>
