	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Ammonul® in Patients With Grade 3 or 4 Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in patients with liver disease. The pathogenesis of HE is incompletely understood, but several pieces of evidence identify ammonia as a key factor in the development of HE. The liver normally detoxifies ammonia produced in the gastrointestinal tract. However, in patients with cirrhosis, portosystemic shunting allows ammonia to bypass the liver and reach the systemic circulation and the brain. The accumulation of ammonia in the brain, through mechanisms not yet fully defined, lead to changes of consciousness, intellectual function, and behavior. Ammonul is currently approved as adjuvant therapy for the management of hyperammonemia and associated encephalopathy in patients with deficiencies in the enzymes of the urea cycle. Ammonul removes nitrogenous ammonia in these patients through pathways alternative to the urea cycle. It is anticipated that in patients with HE, Ammonul may lead to the scavenging of ammonia through these alternative biochemical pathways taking place in tissues other than the liver. This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of IV Ammonul® as a treatment for acute episodes of elevated ammonia in patients with Grade 3 or 4 HE. Study was terminated due to lack of enrollment and business decisions.</detailed_description>
