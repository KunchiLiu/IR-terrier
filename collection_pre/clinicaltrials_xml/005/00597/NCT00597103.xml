	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effects of more frequent dialysis on cognitive function including the assessment of sleep apnea and restless legs. Our hypothesis is that more frequent dialysis improves cognitive function and may have important implications on clinical care of ESRD patients and help to emphasize the need for treatments that will allow patients to live "with dialysis" rather than live "for dialysis".</brief_summary>
