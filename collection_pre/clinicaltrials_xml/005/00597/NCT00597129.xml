	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of 90Y-hPAM4 at Different Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>radiolabeled anti-MUC1 humanized antibody) administered intravenously as a single dose to patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary objective is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-hPAM4 in this population. Secondary objectives include the assessment of tumor targeting, biodistribution, organ dosimetry and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 90Y-hPAM4 as determined by pre-therapy administration of 111In-hPAM4, the assessment of the antigenicity of 90Y-hPAM4, as determined by development of human anti-humanized antibodies (HAHA), and to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy of single dose 90Y-hPAM4 in this patient population.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female patients, &gt;18 years of age, who are able to understand and give written informed consent. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, Stage III or IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with Stage III (locally advanced) disease must have documented progression after failing primary therapy Patients with Stage IV (metastatic) disease must not have received more than one chemotherapy regimen. Measurable disease by CT, with at least on lesion &gt;1.5 cm in one dimension. Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % (Appendix A). Expected survival &gt; three months. At least 4 weeks beyond chemotherapy, radiotherapy, major surgery, other experimental treatments, and recovered from all acute toxicities. At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteroids, except low doses (i.e., 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) to treat nausea or other illness such as rheumatoid arthritis Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support (hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL, ANC &gt; 1,500 per mm3, platelets &gt; 150,000 per mm3) Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine and bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X IULN, AST and ALT ≤ 2.0 X IULN) Otherwise, all toxicity at study entry &lt;Grade 1 by NCI CTC v3.0. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men unwilling to use effective contraception during study until conclusion of 12week posttreatment evaluation period. Known metastatic disease to the central nervous system. Presence of bulky disease (defined as any single mass &gt;10 cm in its greatest dimension) Patients with &gt;Grade 2 anorexia, nausea or vomiting, and/or signs of intestinal obstruction. Prior treatment with nitrosureas, actinomycinD, radioimmunotherapy or other antibodybased therapies (murine, chimeric, humanized or human) Prior radiation dose &gt;3,000 cGy to the liver, &gt;2,000 cGy to lungs and kidneys or prior external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than 30% of the red marrow. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not excluded, but patients with other prior malignancies must have had at least a 5 year disease free interval. Patients known to be HIV positive, hepatitis B positive, or hepatitis C positive. Known history of active coronary artery disease, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure present within 6 months or cardiac arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmia therapy. Known history of active COPD, or other moderatetosevere respiratory illness present within 6 months. Known autoimmune disease or presence of autoimmune phenomena (except rheumatoid arthritis requiring only low dose maintenance corticosteroids). Infection requiring intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week. Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation</criteria>
