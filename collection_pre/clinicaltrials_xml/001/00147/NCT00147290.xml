	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy of RV and BiV ATP for the termination of ventricular arrhythmias in patients who are candidates to a cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) and have a Class I or IIA indication for ICD implantation. The hypothesis of delivering ATP from different sites (RV or BIV) has never been evaluated in a prospective, controlled and randomized study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADVANCE CRT - D: Antitachycardia Pacing (ATP) Delivery for Painless Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective: Compare efficacy of ATP therapy (Burst, 8 pulses, 88 %, 1 sequence) to terminate all types of ventricular tachycardia (all VTs (FVT+VT)) when delivered in the right ventricle (RV) only versus both ventricles (BiV) resulting in a 10 % difference in favour of BIV ATP Secondary objectives: - Compare efficacy of the first BiV and RV ATP (Burst, 8 pulses, 88 %) to terminate fast ventricular tachycardia (FVT) - Compare efficacy of the first BiV and RV ATP (Burst, 8 pulses, 88 %) to terminate slow ventricular tachycardia (slow VT) - Compare efficacy of BiV and RV ATP (all ATP therapies) to terminate slow ventricular tachycardia (slow VT) - Determine the rate of both FVT and VT episodes which are accelerated or degenerates into VF</detailed_description>
