	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate how well ferumoxtran-10, a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent, can detect cancer in the pelvic lymph nodes or malignant pelvic lymph nodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Validation Study of MR Lymphangiography Using SPIO, a New Lymphotropic Superparamagnetic Nanoparticle Contrast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The contrast agent, ferumoxtran-10, is made of ultra small iron oxide particles (USPIO). Once they are injected through vein, they are taken up mostly by liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. It takes about 24 - 36 hours to reach peak uptake in the lymph nodes. The ability of current imaging techniques to detect the lymph nodes disease is known to be less than perfect. Current techniques only use anatomic information (size). Previous studies have shown that this new contrast agent may be able to detect normal and abnormal lymph nodes, using MRI procedure, called MRI lymphangiogram. This new contrast agent is being evaluated to determine whether it can be used to detect normal and abnormal lymph nodes. The study includes 2 parts. The first part will involve you receiving a MRI examination before the contrast is injected. The second part will involve you receiving a MRI examination about 24 hours after the injection. It will take about 20 minutes for each part. If you are already scheduled to have a routine pelvic MRI, the first part of this study will be added at the end of the routine MRI. You will then be asked to return next day to complete the second part of the MRI. If you are not already scheduled to receive a MRI as part of your standard of care, you will come in to the MRI suite at M. D. Anderson and complete both parts over about a 24-hour interval. You will be lying on the MRI examination table during the scanning. At the end of the first part of the study, the contrast will be infused slowly through vein over about 30 minutes in the recovery area. You will then be observed for 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on your tolerance to the contrast agent. The images taken during the first part will be then be repeated 24-36 hours later. You will receive a follow-up telephone call from a member of the study staff on Day 3. Once the second part of the MRI is performed, your participation in this study will be over. This is an investigational study. This contrast agent is currently being evaluated by FDA and has not been approved yet. A total of 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
