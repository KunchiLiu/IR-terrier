	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate and quantify the difference in efficacy of two sequences of ATP therapies (burst 15 pulses, 88% versus burst 8 pulses, 88%) during an episode of spontaneous rhythms classified as fast ventricular tachycardia (FVT) via ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients who have a Class I or II A indication for ICD implantation, and thus to promote the "painless" therapy aspect of ICD treatment and improve quality of life outcomes for patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective: Compare &amp; quantify efficacy of two different sequences of burst ATP strategies for the termination of ventricular tachycardia (with Cycle Lenght (CL) of 240ms-320ms) from baseline to 12 months post randomisation in patients who are treated with ATP -8 pulses, 88% versus patients who are treated with ATP -15 pulses, 88% Secondary objectives: - Estimate the efficacy of ATP in successfully treating FVT episodes for patients in primary and secondary prevention - Estimate acceleration rate or degeneration of ATP therapy for treating spontaneous FVT episodes in the ATP 15 vs 8 arm - Compare the likelihood of syncopal events associated with spontaneous FVT episodes - Estimate the percent reduction in number of shocks delivered per patient for treating spontaneous FVT episodes - Evaluate different possible predictors of ATP success: VT rate, underlying disease, Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs (AAD), infarct zone, etc.</detailed_description>
