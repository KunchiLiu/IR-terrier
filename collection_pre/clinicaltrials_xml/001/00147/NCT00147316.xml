	<brief_summary>Based on previous studies comparing Duteplase[a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) very similar to alteplase] doses, we performed a clinical trial with 0.6mg/kg, which is lower than the internationally approved dosage of 0.9mg/kg, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of alteplase for the Japanese.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Japan Alteplase Clinical Trial (J-ACT): Efficacy and Safety Study of Tissue Plasminogen Activator (Alteplase) for Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on previous studies comparing Duteplase ( an rt-PA very similar to alteplase) doses, we performed a clinical trial with 0.6mg/kg, which is lower than the internationally approved dosage of 0.9mg/kg, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of alteplase for the Japanese. The primary endpoints were the rate of patients with mRS score of 0-1 at 3 months and the incidence of sICH within 36 hours. Thresholds for these endpoints were determined by calculating 90% confidence intervals of weighted averages derived from published reports. The protocol was defined according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) rt-PA stroke study with slight modifications.</detailed_description>
