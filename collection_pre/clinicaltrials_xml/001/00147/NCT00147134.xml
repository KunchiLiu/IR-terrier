	<brief_title>A Trial to Evaluate Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery for Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefits of laparoscopic surgery (LAP) in comparison to open surgery (OPEN) have been suggested with respect to decreased morbidity, decreased pain, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stay.1-4 However, the long-term survival of LAP for colorectal cancer is still unclear, especially for advanced colorectal cancer requiring extended lymphadenectomy. Thus, the investigators designed a study which investigates whether LAP is suitable for advanced colorectal cancer with respect to survival and post-operative morbidity.</detailed_description>
