	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Of An Intravenously Administered Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was prematurely discontinued due to the inability of the compound to adequately differentiate from other treatment options in the clinical endpoint and necessary product profile on April 13, 2007. Safety profile was not the reason that led to the discontinuation of the program.</detailed_description>
