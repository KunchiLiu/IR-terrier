	<brief_title>HEPMET-1: Evaluate the Feasibility, Mental Sideeffects and the Efficacy of Hepatitis C Treatment in a MMT Group.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a health problem worldwide. In Norway, there are about 3000 patients participating in Methadone Maintenance Treatment(MMT) programs. A prevalence study at the MMT treatment unit in Kristiansand, showed that more than 90 % of 177 patients have been infected with hepatitis C. A major problem with anti-HCV treatment for this group is the lack of compliance and retention in treatment. Further, due to the high incidence of psychological disorders in opioid dependent patients, this may also complicate anti-HCV treatment. Drug addicted in MMT treatments programs may find themselves excluded from Hepatitis C treatment. Due to better treatment efficacy with the new PEG-INF's and encouraging reports from 14 weeks studies, it may be easier to motivate opioid dependents to fulfill treatment. Weekly psychological follow-up of these patients will further increase the possibility of opioid dependents in MMT to be able to complete anti-HCV treatment. The aim of this study is to focus on this patients situation, and strengthen their possibility to have a real opportunity to get treatment. We therefore wish to make a pilot study to investigate the feasibility, efficacy and psycological side-effects of the treatment.</detailed_description>
