	<brief_summary>Morphea is very hard to treat. In a small number of adult patients, Imiquimod has proven to be beneficial in decreasing the thickness of the morphea plaques , while improving their appearance. There are no studies to date proving its safety and efficacy in children with this disease. We propose to conduct a pilot study to assess to potential efficacy and relative safety of Imiquimod in children with plaque morphea.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design: Prospective, open label, pilot study Settings: The Hospital for Sick Children, Specialized Morphea Clinic Study population: - Children 6-18 years of age - Plaque morphea measuring less than 10 cm2 in diameter ( for children with multiple lesions, only one will be treated) Intervention: Topical imiquimod applied 3-5 times a week for 6 months Outcome measures: Decrease in the thickness of the skin by clinical scores and ultrasonography Duration of the study: 12 months ( 2 baseline visits, 1 intervention visit, 5 follow-up visits)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age at diagnosis 6 to 18 years of age Morphea plaques Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test Signed consent/assent form Exclusion criteria: Children who received topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, vitamin D derivatives (calcipotriol, calcipotriolbetamethasone dipropionate) to the affected area in the previous four weeks Children who were previously treated with Imiquimod on the affected areas Children with no demonstrable ultrasonographic changes at the baseline evaluation Children with evidence of skin breakdown on the proposed area to be treated at the time of enrollment due to potential increased absorption of the medication through impaired skin barrier Female subjects of childbearing potential who do not agree to practice effective birth control methods for the duration of the study Children who are/were (in the past 6 months) treated with systemic medications such as methotrexate and/or systemic corticosteroids Comorbidities: systemic sclerosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, other systemic diseases</criteria>
