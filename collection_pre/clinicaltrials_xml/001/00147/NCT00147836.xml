	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate and evaluate the effects of different interventions (1.continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion,2.multiple daily injections, 3.anti-hyperglycemic agents) on glycemic control, B-cell function and the remission rate in newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effects of Different Interventions on Glycemic Control in Newly-Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ß-Cell dysfunction and decreased insulin sensitivity are the main pathophysiological defects responsible for the development of hyperglycemia. With continuous presence of insulin resistance, progressive loss of ß-cell function is the crucial defect. Hyperglycemia has deleterious effect on β-cell function, which is partially reversible by adequate glycemic control. In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with severe hyperglycemia, 2 weeks continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) can induce adequate glycemic control with improvement of β-cell function. Nearly half of the patients can maintain euglycemia longer than 12 months by transient CSII. The improvement of β-cell function, especially the restoration of the first-phase insulin response is related to sustained euglycemia in the newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. But it is unclear whether any other interventions (such as oral hypoglycemic agents and multiple daily injections) inducing optimal glycemic control in a short period of time can have the same effect. As a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study will be needed to further prove and clarify the findings.</detailed_description>
