	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Campath following Tacrolimus monotherapy is more effective in the prevention of renal graft rejection (considering an acute rejection rate of 5% for Campath-1H/Tacrolimus and of 22% for Tacrolimus/MMF/Steroids).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Safety of Campath in Combination With Tacrolimus Monotherapy to Prevent Kidney Graft Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major advances in immunosuppressive therapy have resulted in long-term graft survival by the use of various drug combinations.However, these combinations carry the risk of e.g. infection, malignancy, renal damage, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hirsutism, cushingoid facial appearance and bone necrosis.Therefore one of the major goals should be to reduce immunosuppression without increasing risk of rejections. Based on good results of a pilot study (not a single acute rejection episode during the 18-20 months observation period despite low level of Tacrolimus and absence of steroids) this randomised trial was designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Campath-1H.</detailed_description>
