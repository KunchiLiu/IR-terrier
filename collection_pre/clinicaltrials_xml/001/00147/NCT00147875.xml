	<brief_title>Study of Prednisone, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, and Gemcitabine in Elderly Patients With Advanced Stages Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine shows promising activity in patients with relapsed lymphoma either administered as single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic agents. No trial to date evaluated its role in patients with primary Hodgkin's lymphoma. We therefore developed a three-weekly regimen based on the standard ABVD regimen.</detailed_description>
