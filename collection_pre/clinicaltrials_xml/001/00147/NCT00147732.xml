	<brief_summary>TITLE: A multicentre, randomised, phase III clinical trial comparing accelerated radiotherapy with accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen and nicotinamide (ARCON) in clinical stage T2-4 laryngeal carcinoma. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Does the addition of carbogen and nicotinamide to a schedule of accelerated radiotherapy in patients with clinical stage T2-4 laryngeal carcinoma improve local primary tumour control? Definitive analysis will be performed on local control rates at two years after completion of radiotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Does the addition of carbogen and nicotinamide - increase the larynx preservation rate? - increase the regional control rate? - increase the toxicity of accelerated radiotherapy? - improve the overall quality of life? - improve the disease-free survival? - improve the overall survival? STUDY DESIGN: An open-label, randomised clinical trial assigning patients in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: - accelerated radiotherapy - accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen and nicotinamide PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND NUMBER: 344 patients with clinical T2-4 laryngeal carcinoma MEASUREMENTS: - time to local failure - time to regional failure - survival with functional larynx - overall and disease-free survival - frequency and severity of complications related to radiotherapy and carbogen and nicotinamide - quality of life assessment</brief_summary>
