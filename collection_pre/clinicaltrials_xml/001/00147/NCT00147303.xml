	<brief_summary>Sarpogrelate is an antiplatelet agent that decreases 5-hydroxytryptamine( 5-HT )levels in platelets via blockade of 5-HT2 receptors, has been used in atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. The present double-blind controlled clinical pharmacology study was performed on 45 patients with cerebral infarction, who were given 75, 150, or 300 mg three times daily of sarpogrelate for 7 days in order to evaluate the dose-response relationship in terms of the precisely measured inhibition of platelet aggregation.</brief_summary>
