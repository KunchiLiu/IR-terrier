	<brief_summary>ACE inhibitors are thought to modify the endothelium in a number of ways. Quinapril is an effective and well-tolerated ACE-I for the treatment of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure. Quinapril produces favourable haemodynamic changes and improves ventricular and endothelial function in patients with various cardiovascular disorders. These effects are mediated through the binding of quinaprilat to both tissue and plasma-ACE. Quinapril 10 to 40 mg once daily improved endothelial function (as measured by improved FMD or reduced vasoconstrictive/increased vasodilative response to Ach) in patients with CAD and hypertension over 2 to 6 months of therapy; improved endothelial function was also observed in patients with CHF receiving a single infusion of quinaprilat. In general, quinapril showed neutral or beneficial effects on lipid profiles, glycaemia and renal haemodynamics. (3) There are no data available considering effects of quinapril on endothelial dysfunction in post- menopausal woman with mild to moderate hypertension and with pathological endothelial function.</brief_summary>
