	<brief_title>Free Fatty Acids and Vascular Function in Subjects With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the past two decades, there has been a steady increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus, such that nearly 17 million people are now afflicted. The vast majority of these have type 2 diabetes. Over the next 40 years, the type 2 diabetic population in the United States is expected to increase to nearly 30 million. Diabetes substantially increases the risk of atherosclerosis, and thereby, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Indeed, cardiovascular disease causes more than 50% of the mortality in patients with diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes manifest two cardinal signs of dysmetabolism: hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a progressive phenomenon that occurs well before the onset of frank diabetes, and results in alterations in insulin signaling. Experimental studies suggest that insulin signaling is required for vascular homeostasis, and its impairment is associated with endothelial dysfunction. In the clinical setting, insulin resistance is associated with atherosclerosis and predicts cardiovascular events independent of hyperglycemia. Therefore, we will study the importance of insulin signaling in endothelial biology in humans and the effects of free fatty acids on endothelial function in people with type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
