	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to study the natural history of the ulcer healing while on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and the ulcer recurrence without acid suppression therapy of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) bleeding ulcer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug and Non-Helicobacter Pylori in Bleeding Peptic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), Non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) bleeding peptic ulcers are relatively common in the West (11%-44%). It is uncommon in Hong Kong (4%). Significant number of these patients with non-NSAID, non-Hp bleeding ulcers had co-morbid illness and many had life-threatening conditions. Our recent study showed that there is an increasing incidence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-Helicobacter pylori (Hp) bleeding peptic ulcers. There is no datum on the natural course of these patients and this is our aim to have this observational study.</detailed_description>
