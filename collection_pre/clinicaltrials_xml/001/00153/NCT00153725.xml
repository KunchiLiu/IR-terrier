	<brief_title>Intravenous Pantoloc In Aspirin-Induced Ulcer Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspirin is an effective treatment for acute stroke and heart attack. However, aspirin also induces ulcer and provokes acute ulcer bleeding. Thus, aspirin is often withheld in acute ulcer bleeding but this precipitate recurrent stroke or heart attack. We previously showed that intravenous infusion of a potent acid suppressant substantially reduced the incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding in patients who withheld aspirin. The aim of this study is to investigate whether intravenous infusion of an acid suppressant (Pantoprazole) is effective in preventing recurrent ulcer bleeding with continuous use of aspirin.</detailed_description>
