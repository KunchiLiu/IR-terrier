	<brief_summary>Hypothesis / aims of study The aim of this multicentre study is to evaluate anatomical and functional results of an innovative posterior tape in vaginal prolapse repair by vaginal route, in comparison to the sacrospinous suspension. Study design, materials and methods This study involves 5 centres in French Public Hospital. Patients will be randomly allocated to be operated by a sacrospinous suspension or by an posterior IVSTM (Tyco Healthcare, France). Prolapse severity will be evaluated using the POP-Q system. In order to evaluate the patient's quality of life, the validated PFDI and the PFIQ questionnaires will be used preoperatively and during follow-up, as well as a validated questionnaire on sexual problems. The difference on early post-operative pain should be 30% (40% for the sacrospinous suspension and 10% for the posterior IVS). Then the estimated number of patient is 40 in each arm.</brief_summary>
