	<brief_title>Cellulose Sulfate and HIV Transmission Among Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the availability of an effective HIV prevention method, i.e. the condom, the epidemic continues growing. There is thus an urgent need for additional HIV prevention methods. One of the possibilities is the use of microbicides, i.e. chemical products which may be used in the vagina or rectum with the potential to prevent HIV infection. Cellulose sulfate is an HIV entry inhibitor with an in vitro effect on N. gonorrhoeae (NG) and C. trachomatis (CT) and other sexually transmitted organisms. The study assess its effect on the vaginal transmission of HIV, NG and CT among women at high risk of heterosexual STI infection (defined as having had more than two partners in the last three months and an average of three sexual acts per week). The study is randomized, triple-blinded, placebo controlled.</detailed_description>
