	<brief_title>Relationship Between Topiramate Use and Ocular Angle Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and prophylaxis of migraine attacks. There were case reports of acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) associated with its use. AACG is particularly common in Asians because of a higher prevalence of narrow angle., we test the hypothesis whether topiramate narrows the angles which may render them more likely to suffer from AACG.</detailed_description>
