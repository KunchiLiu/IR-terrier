	<brief_summary>This is a web-based pilot study to evaluate the association between the treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa (aranesp) and the clinical benefits in symptom palliation, improved functional status and quality of life in patients with cancer. The feasibility of web-based assessments and data capture will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Web-based Study of Quality of Life Benefits Associated Aranesp in Anemic Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia associated with lung cancer and chemotherapy is an important factor effecting patient symptoms, functional status, and overall quality of life (Groopman and Itri 1999; Langer, Choy et al. 2002). Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) has demonstrated a significant effect upon ameliorating chemotherapy-induced anemia in lung cancer (Vansteenkiste, Pirker et al. 2002; Vansteenkiste, Poulsen et al. 2002). This trial is designed to evaluate the association between the treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa and direct electronic capture of clinical benefits in cancer-related symptoms, functional status and overall quality of life. This trial uses a secure web-based design to capture the patient-associated symptoms, functional status and quality of life. This novel secure web-based system was selected to improve the efficiency and quality of clinical data capture. If our hypothesis is correct, treatment with darbepoetin alfa will be associated with improved palliation of cancer-related symptoms, improved functional status, and result in overall benefits to the patient's health-related quality of life. The development of a web-based system to directly capture patient-related symptoms, functional status and quality of life will permit us in the future to conduct a national or international trial addressing the effects of darbepoetin alfa on these factors. If our hypothesis is incorrect, it may be that these parameters are not affected by the correction of anemia with darbepoetin alfa or the measures are not sensitive enough to detect these differences. A notable finding would be a clearly defined improvement in symptom palliation, functional status, and quality of life associated with darbepoetin alfa therapy.</detailed_description>
