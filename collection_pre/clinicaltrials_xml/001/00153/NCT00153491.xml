	<brief_summary>This is a study of how well caregivers of children with malaria adhere to the recommended regimen for lumefantrine-artemether (LA). Children were randomly assigned to either a group receiving directly observed treatment in hospital or to a group treated at home by the routine caregiver (typically, patient's mother). Clinical/parasitologic, hematologic, pharmacologic and qualitative parameters were monitored over a 28-day follow-up period and are used to evaluate drug adherence.</brief_summary>
