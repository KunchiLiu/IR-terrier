	<brief_summary>The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination wiht Ramipril Global Endpoint trial (ONTARGET): The primary objectives are to determine if (a) telmisartan 80mg daily and ramipril 10mg daily combination therapy is more effective in reducing the composite endpoint of Cardiovascular Death (CV) death, Myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) compared with ramipril 10mg alone; and (b) telmisartan 80mg daily is at least as effective as (i.e. not less effective than) ramipril 10mg daily, on this endpoint. Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in Angiotension converting Enzyme inhibitor intolerant subjects with Cardiovascular Disease. (TRANSCEND): The primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with telmisartan 80mg daily is superior to placebo reducing the composite endpoint of Cardiovascular Death (CV), Myocardial Infarction ( MI)I, stroke or hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in patients who are intolerant to Angiotension Converting Enzyme inhibitors.</brief_summary>

Any other major noncardiac illness expected to reduce life expectancy or interfere with study participation. 7. Patient is simultaneously taking another experimental drug. 8. Patient with significant disability that precludes regular attendance at clinic for followup. 9. Patient has sufficient disability or other incapacity that precludes regular attendance at clinic for followup. 10. Unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent.</criteria>
