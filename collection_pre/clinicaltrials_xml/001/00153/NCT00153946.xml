	<brief_summary>Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, is a novel neuroprotective agent, and argatroban is a selective thrombin inhibitor. Both the drugs were approved by the Japanese Government, and have frequently been used for the treatment of acute brain infarction in Japan. The effect of combination therapy of these drugs, however, has not yet been elucidated. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with these agents in patients with acute non-cardioembolic and non-lacunar ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
