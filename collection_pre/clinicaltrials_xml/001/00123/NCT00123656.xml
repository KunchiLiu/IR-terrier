	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a recently recognized entity. It has been thought to be related to both allergies and acid reflux. There have been reports that both swallowed, aerosolized steroids and proton pump inhibitors have been effective treatments. The researchers propose to directly compare the efficacy of aerosolized fluticasone to esomeprazole in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. The hypothesis is that aerosolized fluticasone (Flovent) will be more effective in relieving symptoms of EE than esomeprazole (Nexium) treatment. Patients will undergo endoscopy, pH monitoring and manometry for diagnosis. Following diagnosis of EE by pathology (biopsy of esophagus), patients will be randomized to esomeprazole or swallowed fluticasone for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, subjects will be asked to repeat upper endoscopy with biopsies. Three questionnaires (dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], and allergy) will be completed by the patient at the first endoscopy and at the end endoscopy. The primary objective is to measure change in eosinophil infiltration of the esophagus in response to treatment of allergy (swallowed fluticasone) versus treatment for reflux (esomeprazole) in EE patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Esomeprazole to Aerosolized, Swallowed Fluticasone for Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, non-blinded, multicenter treatment trial to demonstrate and compare the efficacy of esomeprazole and fluticasone in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Following the initial diagnostic EGD with four quadrant biopsy, serum eosinophil count and serum IgE levels will be measured. Patients will undergo 24 hour pH study to determine the incidence of reflux in this population. Clinical assessment will be performed with validated questionnaires quantifying dysphagia, GERD, and allergy/atopy. Patients will be randomized to 8 weeks of either esomeprazole versus swallowed aerosolized fluticasone. After 8 weeks of therapy, upper endoscopy will again be performed. Eosinophils per high power field will be quantified, and biopsies will be stained for major basic protein. Dysphagia, GERD, and allergy/atopy questionnaires will be repeated, as will serum eosinophil counts and IgE measurements.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients aged 1880 with EE, defined as: a) dysphagia, food impaction or other upper gastrointestinal symptoms (chest pain, heartburn, regurgitation); b) multiple esophageal rings or furrows; c) the presence of &gt;20 eosinophils/high power field in the squamous epithelium or deeper tissues of the esophagus Ability to undergo esophageal manometry and ambulatory pH monitoring No history of bleeding diathesis, significant cardiopulmonary disease, or other contraindication to upper endoscopy Those who have had a one month holiday from either esomeprazole therapy or fluticasone if they have been prescribed this prior to enrollment Contraindication to proton pump inhibitors or swallowed fluticasone Need for immediate esophageal dilation at enrollment due to food impaction at the discretion of the performing endoscopist Inability to pass endoscope Pregnancy Incarceration Inability to provide informed consent History of esophagogastric surgery or prior history of abdominal surgery with subsequent strictures or symptoms of obstruction such as abdominal pain and bloating Presence of other esophageal pathology that could account for patients' symptoms as determined by histological interpretation by the pathologist History of esophageal spasm resulting in trouble swallowing foods larger than 1 cm in diameter</criteria>
