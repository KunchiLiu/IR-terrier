	<brief_summary>Our 4-year project uses public domain software and content developed by a University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) team and updates, refines, and tailors it to the unique clinician populations and electronic educational applications of VAMCs We are testing an innovative, web-based intervention adapted specifically for the VA to increase syndromic recognition, treatment, and post-exposure prophylaxis of biological warfare agents at multiple VA sites via a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Ultimately, we will disseminate the intervention throughout the entire VA system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VHA Clinicians and Bioterror Events: Interactive Web-based Learning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Because of VA's long history in disaster preparedness, and the crucial role VA providers will play, the VA medical system has the potential to make an enormous difference in outcomes following a bioterror attack or infectious outbreak. A 2002 AHRQ report reviewed 60 studies and found that very few bioterrorism preparedness training programs were rigorously evaluated. Our project was the first effort to formally test and implement a bioterrorism preparedness intervention in the VA healthcare system. Because Internet-delivered interventions have the potential for wide dissemination, we used the Internet to implement the Intervention. Objectives: 1. To develop, tailor, and continuously update and validate evidence- and scenario-based electronic teaching and testing modules to increase VA clinicians' knowledge of Category A biological warfare agents. We refer to these instruments as Bioterrorism Case Analysis and Skills Enhancement Sessions (BioCASES) and Bioterrorism Skills Test Sessions (BioTESTS). 2. To test the effectiveness of the BioCASES teaching modules by way of a randomized controlled trial of VAMCs using the BioTESTS to evaluate their effectiveness for increasing and sustaining VA clinician knowledge, skills, and ability to respond to bioterrorism events. 3. To continue to develop and adapt BioCASES and BioTESTS for use in VA CME programs. Ultimately, we will disseminate the intervention throughout the entire VA system. Methods: Our project team developed or refined and updated a total of 12 educational modules focusing on CDC's Category A agents and other emerging infectious diseases. We developed post-test instruments and case-based scenarios germane to the VA patient population for anthrax and smallpox. Materials were designed specifically for the unique clinician populations and electronic educational applications available in VAMCs. Website functionality and content were refined using the nominal group technique and "thinking aloud" protocols. We tested our innovative, web-based educational intervention at fifteen VA facilities via a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Status: The intervention has been completed. Fifteen sites were randomized and completed the study processes.</detailed_description>
