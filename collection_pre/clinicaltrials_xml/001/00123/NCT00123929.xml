	<brief_summary>After a core biopsy of the tumor is obtained, patients with locally advanced breast cancer are randomized to receive 4 cycles of full dose doxorubicin (75 mg/m2 e3w) or docetaxel (100 mg/m2 e3w). After the fourth cycle, patients are submitted to surgery to ascertain pathological response. They then receive the opposite drug, hormones, Herceptin, and radiation as indicated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Expression and Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Docetaxel or Doxorubicin in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to define the genetic signature which predicts the response to single drug doxorubicin versus docetaxel. 250 patients will be included. cDNA microarrays will be produced and the genetic pattern will be correlated with the response to doxorubicin and docetaxel. Secondary aim is the prediction of response by means of IHC determinations (her2, ER, PgR, Ki67, protein TAU), FISH (topoisomerase II alpha, her2) and PCR (topoisomerase II alpha).</detailed_description>
