	<brief_summary>In the United States, the incidence of biliary tract cancer and gallbladder cancer has been estimated to be 6,000-8,000 patients per year. Currently, there is no standard therapy for these tumors once the disease has spread and is inoperable. Recent small studies with gemcitabine have shown a positive response rate. The investigators plan to test the combination of gemcitabine with cisplatin for biliary tract and gallbladder cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for Gallbladder and Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine and cisplatin will be administered weekly for two weeks (on day 1 and day 8) followed by a one week rest period (1 cycle is 3 weeks). On day one and eight of each cycle the patient will have a physical exam and blood work. During the first two cycles, additional blood work will be drawn on day 15 as well. Reassessment of the tumor will be performed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients will remain on treatment until further evidence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects occur.</detailed_description>
