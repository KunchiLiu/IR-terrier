	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of HectorolÂ® (doxercalciferol) capsules in treating patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with secondary hyperparathyroidism who have vitamin D levels in the normal range. Previous studies with doxercalciferol were conducted in patients who had low levels of vitamin D.</brief_summary>
