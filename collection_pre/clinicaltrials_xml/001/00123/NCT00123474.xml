Subjects with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) (or BCR/ABL+) chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia whose disease has primary or acquired hematologic resistance to imatinib mesylate or who are intolerant of imatinib mesylate. Men and women, 18 years or older Adequate hepatic function Adequate renal function Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for a period of at least 1 month before and at least 3 months after the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Subjects who are eligible and willing to undergo transplantation during the screening period A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease Medications that increase bleeding risk Medications that change heart rhythms Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to CML Concurrent incurable malignancy other than CML Evidence of organ dysfunction or digestive dysfunction that would prevent administration of study therapy Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must not be enrolled into this study</criteria>
