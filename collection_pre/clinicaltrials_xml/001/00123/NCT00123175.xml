	<brief_title>Treatment of Endometrial Hyperplasia With an Intrauterine Device (IUD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia is a condition usually caused by excessive stimulation of the uterine lining (endometrium) by estrogens, and may cause irregular bleeding as a presenting symptom, but rarely may progress to endometrial cancer, which makes treatment important. The only treatment approved so far is medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets (progesterone), also known as Provera.</detailed_description>
