	<brief_summary>Clinical Problem: Renal insufficiency after heart transplantation caused by cyclosporine medication was addressed. Current therapeutic approaches include cyclosporine reduction or discontinuation. It is unclear whether discontinuation of low dose cyclosporine also has a beneficial effect, i.e. is there a threshold effect for cyclosporine nephrotoxicity? Study Design: Heart transplant patients with a moderate degree of renal failure on low dose cyclosporine were randomized to either a) no change; or b) discontinuation of cyclosporine and initiation of rapamycin immunosuppression. Read-Out: Renal function after 6 months; tolerability; and safety were assessed.</brief_summary>
