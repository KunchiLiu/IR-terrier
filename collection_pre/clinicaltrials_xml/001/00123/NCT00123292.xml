	<brief_title>Intra-arterial Microplasmin Administration in Patients With Acute Peripheral Arterial Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is designed as an open-label, dose-escalating, single-centre trial of weight-adjusted dose regimens of microplasmin administered intra-arterially as an infusion to patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be administered study drug for up to 4 hours. Different dose regimens will be evaluated in an ascending-dose fashion; an infusion will be administered for up to 4 hours.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients presenting within 14 days of onset of acute thrombotic or embolic arterial occlusion of a lower extremity (native vessel or bypass graft). Complete occlusion of infrarenal vessel or bypass graft, as determined by angiography. Lower extremity ischemia graded as SVS/ISCS (Society of Vascular Surgery/ International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery) class I or II (a or b). Negative urine pregnancy test (pregnancy test only required for females of childbearing potential not using an accepted method of contraception). Profound ischemia with permanent motor paresis or sensory loss (or ischemic process deemed irreversible, i.e. class III). Occlusion not penetrable by the infusion guide wire. Known or suspected allergy to contrast agents or heparin sodium. Active bleeding or known hemorrhagic diathesis. Stroke in the previous 6 months or transient ischemic attack in the previous 2 months.</criteria>
