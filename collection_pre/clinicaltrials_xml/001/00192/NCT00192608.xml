	<brief_summary>Saquinavir and Atazanavir are drugs used in combination therapy to treat HIV disease. Saquinavir is currently available in a 200 milligram capsule. Most individuals currently on saquinavir require to take 5 tablets twice a day. In an attempt to reduce this number of pills, a new capsule has been developed containing 500 milligrams of saquinavir. This study will assess: i) blood drug levels in individuals taking both saquinavir formulations, ii) blood drug levels in individuals taking both saquinavir formulations when given with atazanavir, iii) 48 weeks of follow up for individuals receiving the new saquinavir formulation with atazanavir as HIV therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 48-Week, Randomised, Study to Describe the Pharmacokinetic Profile and Durability of Atazanavir-Saquinavir-Ritonavir Once Daily and Describe the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Saquinavir-Ritonavir Using Saquinavir 500mg Formulation: the ASK-500 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The development of anti-HIV therapy for the treatment of HIV disease has improved the quality of life and survival of many people with HIV. However the treatments do not always work over long periods, as medications are often difficult to take due to side effects and a large numbers of pills to be taken. This has lead researchers to look for new ways to treat HIV with medications that require fewer numbers of pills and have fewer side effects. Atazanavir and saquinavir are two drugs used to treat HIV and come from the same class of drugs known as the protease inhibitors. Atazanavir has the advantage of being taken only once a day. Saquinavir is available in a new formulation (type of pill), which will require fewer numbers of pills to be taken daily. AIM The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of these two drugs used together with ritonavir as a once daily HIV treatment, which will consist of 6 tablets. Furthermore this study will look at blood drug levels in individuals on atazanavir, saquinavir and ritonavir with and without the new saquinavir formulation to ensure blood levels of these drugs are adequate. For individuals currently on the old saquinavir formulation, this study will also look at blood drug levels before and after changing to the new formulation.</detailed_description>
