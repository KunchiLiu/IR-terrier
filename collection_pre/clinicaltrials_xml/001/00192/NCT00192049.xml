	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine has been shown to be highly effective and well tolerated in the first and second line therapy, as a single agent or in combination therapy for treatment of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. On the basis of Gemcitabine clinical activity and good tolerability this drug has been recently tested in intravesical therapy. we consider Gemcitabine as a good therapy candidate for patient with intermediate risk superficial bladder cancer. Based on the phase I/II clinical trials w are going to explore the efficacy and tolerability of Gemcitabine in this setting, and compare it to Mitomycin C which is widely used in this group of patients.</brief_summary>
