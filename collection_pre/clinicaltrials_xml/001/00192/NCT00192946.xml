	<brief_summary>In patients with broad QRS complexes on electrocardiogram (ECG), the delayed electrical activation of the left heart chamber will cause abnormal contraction.This has been shown to be possible to treat by a special pacemaker treatment which includes pacing of the left heart chamber (= CRT treatment). In this study the researchers will investigate the effect of acute CRT treatment in the early phase after open heart surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CRT-KIR Study (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy [CRT] in the Early Phase After Heart Surgery)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with bundle branch block have a delayed electrical activation of the left ventricle causing abnormal contractility of the left ventricle. We hypothesize that patients may benefit from short term (= 72 hours) CRT (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) in the early phase after open heart surgery. Patients: reduced LV function and bundle branch block. Study type: randomisation to CRT versus standard postoperative treatment Study variables: cardiac output, echocardiographic measures, p-BNP and hours with inotropic therapy.</detailed_description>
