	<brief_title>Does a Nitrofurazone Coated Bladder Catheter Reduce the Number of Urinary Tract Infections in Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infection occurs in one in five patients as a complication following severe trauma. A new and approved urinary bladder catheter (Releen NF) has been introduced by the Danish company Coloplast A/S.
