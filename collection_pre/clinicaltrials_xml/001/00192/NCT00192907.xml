	<brief_title>Inflammation and Infection in Trauma, Role in Posttraumatic Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immune system plays a role in the development of complications after severe trauma, but we do not know how. Equally, biochemical changes measured in the blood after trauma (eg. bloodglucose, GC-globulin, coagulation parameters etc.) may predict the prognosis and the degree of complcations. Two significant complications are infection and organ failure, which may prolong hospitalisation and increase mortality. In the study we collected samples from blood and body surfaces to determine changes in cytokines, biochemistry, bacterial flora, and subsequent complications. We compare the changes in between groups of the cohort.</detailed_description>
