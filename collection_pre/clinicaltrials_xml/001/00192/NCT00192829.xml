	<brief_summary>The association between cancer and thrombosis is well known and the occurrence of thrombotic complications is commonly associated with poor prognosis. The aim os this study is to determine the possible value of hypercoagulable parameters as prognostic parameters in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
