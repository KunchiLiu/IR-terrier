	<brief_summary>To perform a variety of assays on blood, nasal washes, and cells obtained from healthy children for the purposes of further investigation of immune responses generated by influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A and B, live, cold-adapted (liquid CAIV-T; Wyeth Lederle Vaccines, Marietta, PA). â€¢ To assess nasal swab specimens to detect vaccine virus shedding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Investigate Immune Responses Elicited by a Liquid Formulation of Influenza Virus Vaccine (CAIV-T) in Healthy Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase II, prospective, randomized, partially-blinded, placebo-controlled, outpatient study conducted at multiple sites throughout the US in healthy children aged 6 months to less than 36 months. Parents/guardians of subjects were asked to read and sign the informed consent before any study-related procedures were performed. Subjects at each study site were sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 separate blood sample groups referred to as "cellular immunity" or "antibody secreting cell". Subjects within each blood sample group were then randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single intranasal dose of CAIV-T 10^7 FFU per dose, CAIV-T 10^5 FFU per dose, placebo or a commercially-available injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV).</detailed_description>
