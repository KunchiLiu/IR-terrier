	<criteria>Stable, or unstable angina and/or objective signs of myocardial ischaemia Informed consent Optimal result (&lt; 35% residual stenosis and &lt; type C dissection) after balloon angioplasty Lesions should be de novo and located in native vessels with a diameter &gt; 2.25 mm. Complex lesions to be included should have at least one of the following characteristics: ostial in location (&lt; 5 mm from ostium) total occlusions with a length ≥ 15 mm bifurcational (side branch &gt; 1.75 mm in diameter) angulated (&gt; 45° within lesion) Exclusion criteria: Patients: Other severe disease with an expected survival &lt; 1 year Other significant cardiac disease Known allergy against paclitaxel, clopidogrel (or ticlopidine), Myocardial infarction within 3 days of the index procedure Linguistic difficulties needing an interpreter Renal insufficiency (pcreatinine &gt; 200 micromol/l) Gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 month Childbearing potential or pregnancy Participation in another study Lesions: Unprotected left main disease Restenosis Lesions containing visible thrombus Treatment with other modality than balloon or stent (ablation, brachytherapy, ultrasound) in connection with the index procedure Diffuse coronary disease distal to the treated lesion Heavily calcification Lesion located in saphenous vein graft</criteria>
