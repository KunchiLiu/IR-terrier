	<brief_title>From Compliance to Alliance: Engaging Psychiatric Patients in Illness Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medication non-compliance, estimated to affect 50% of all psychiatric patients, was shown to be strongly associated with an elevated risk for relapse, readmission to psychiatric inpatient care, longer length of stay and suicide, resulting in elevated costs across the health care system. The proposed project seeks to bridge the gap between the significant progress of recent years in psycho-pharmacology that produced more efficient ‘newer generation’ medications, and the continuing unanswered problem of non-compliance, by applying knowledge from clinical decision-making theories and recent evidence-based research on the management of severe mental illness. In Phase I of the project, an epidemiological survey will be conducted to evaluate the magnitude and correlates of the problem in patients attending walk-in crisis clinic , using Treatment Compliance Assessment and Decision-Making Assessment Tools, both developed by the researchers. An 8-module psycho-educational intervention protocol emphasizing illness management and optimization of health care decision-making will then be designed and implemented. In Phase II, eligible outpatient clients will be randomly assigned to either Intervention or Standard Care conditions, and followed for a period of 15 months. Repeated assessments will include pre-post measures of knowledge, treatment compliance, and decision-making, and on outcome measures of relapse such as hospitalizations and symptoms, functioning, self-efficacy, quality of life, and satisfaction with services.</detailed_description>
