	<brief_summary>This study is an investigation to compare the efficacy of two different intermittent sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) treatment regimens and intermittent sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) + artesunate (SP/AS) treatment of HIV negative and positive mothers in clearing placental parasitemia at delivery. If intermittent protective SP/AS treatment is equally efficacious and safe as intermittent protective SP, such a regimen could be adapted for programmatic use as a potentially more durable alternative to SP monotherapy in areas of increasing SP resistance.</brief_summary>
