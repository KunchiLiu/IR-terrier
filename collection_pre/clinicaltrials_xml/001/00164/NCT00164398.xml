	<brief_summary>The purpose is to encourage Provider participants to evaluate high risk HIV transmission behaviors and offer prevention messages to their HIV+ patients which will, in turn, reduce rates of unprotected anal and/or vaginal sex with partners of known HIV sero-negativity or unknown HIV serostatus. It is hypothesized that patients of providers participating in the HIP intervention will report higher reduction in sexual risk practices, when compared to the patients of the providers who were randomized into the control condition.</brief_summary>
