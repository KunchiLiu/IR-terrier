	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Curcumin and Ginkgo for Treating Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind, randomized, clinical trial of 30 subjects will be carried out to develop procedures for testing the effectiveness of curcumin on slowing Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Curcumin is a polyphenolic molecule extracted from turmeric and is widely and safely used as a yellow food coloring. Because of its strong anti-inflammatory activity, curcumin was tested in animal models of AD, where it significantly reduced levels of brain amyloid, oxidized proteins, and isoprostanes, and prevented cognitive deficits. AD patients will receive placebo, 1 g, or 4 g of curcumin daily for six months. All patients will also receive 120 mg ginkgo leaf extract daily. At 0, 1, 3, and 6 months of the study, a cognitive test will be performed, and blood samples will be analyzed for levels of isoprostane, amyloid beta protein, metals, and cholesterol. Curcumin and its metabolites will be measured in blood at 1 month. The primary objective for this first human study of curcumin in AD is to examine safety and procedures for a possible larger trial testing curcumin against AD. The secondary objective is to determine whether curcumin affects biochemical measures, and, if so, which dose is most effective. The tertiary objective is to determine whether curcumin slows cognitive decline in AD. This study may lead to inexpensive treatment that delays progression of AD.</detailed_description>
