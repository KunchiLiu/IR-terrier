	<brief_title>Legacy for Children, an Early Intervention Study to Promote Optimal Child Development in Low-income Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early years of life (birth to age 5 years) are crucial in a child's development. Parents play a critical role in their children's development and are responsible for the environment in which they grow up. Past research shows that the personal characteristics of successful children consistently correlate to parental influences and behavior. Thus, the theoretical foundation in the Legacy study is that parents can positively influence their child's development. Also, parents are more likely to maintain positive parenting behaviors if they are part of a community greater than themselves. Legacy intervention activities are designed to enhance sensitive and responsive parenting, parent/child interaction, and promote a sense of community. Other activities include verbal and cognitive stimulation through parent and parent/child group meetings, visits to the home, and participation in community events. Legacy has both a pilot phase and a main study phase. There are 180 intervention and 120 comparison families in the main study phase and 60 of each in the pilot phase at each study site, Miami and Los Angeles. The 720 participating families are those whose children, on average, would be expected to fall below national norms on a range of developmental outcomes. Process, cost, and short- and long-term outcome data are being collected. Comparison group: In addition to the current standard of care, the comparison families receive regular comprehensive child development and maternal assessments at 6 months, 1 yr, 2 yr, 3 yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr.</detailed_description>
