	<brief_title>Limb Loss Self-Management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 1.2 million Americans are living with the loss of a limb and the incidence is increasing due to increases in the prevalence of diabetes. Pain, emotional distress, reduced functional abilities are common conditions following limb loss and reduce quality of life. Self-management interventions have been found to be effective in reducing the secondary conditions associated with arthritis and diabetes. Self management uses the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy including education, self monitoring, problem solving, and skill acquisition. The goal of the project is to develop and test the efficacy of a community based self management intervention for reducing pain, depression, and improving self efficacy and function in persons with limb loss using a randomized controlled design. 50 groups of 8-10 persons will be randomized to either a control group or a treatment group.</detailed_description>
