	<brief_summary>The primary objective of Adolescent Impact is to develop and evaluate a developmentally targeted intervention designed to minimize secondary transmission risk behavior and enhance adherence to care and treatment. The intervention is delivered in 12 sessions (five one-to-one, 7 group) over a 3 month period of time. Intervention is delivered in addition to standard of care treatment at the participant's respective clinic. Participants are randomized to either an intervention or control arm; the control group receives standard of care treatment and control group participants are offered the Adolescent Impact intervention following the completion of the nine-month follow up. It is hypothesized that compared to control group participants, intervention group participants will evidence (1) improved or stable virologic and/or immunologic status, mediated by (a) adherence to prescribed antiretroviral medication and/or (b) adherence to HIV care appointments, and (2) reduction/minimization of secondary transmission risk behaviors to include (a) unprotected sex and/or needle sharing, and (b) sexual and drug use behaviors that increase risk for unprotected sex.</brief_summary>
