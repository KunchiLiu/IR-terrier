	<brief_summary>To evaluate if intravenous PPI infusion, when administered prior to endoscopy, hastens resolution of bleeding stigmata and thereby facilitates endoscopic examinations and reduces the need for endoscopic treatment. Clot stabilization may itself sustain control of bleeding before endoscopy. These may translate into improved patientsâ€™outcome and survival. To determine the therapeutic effect of high-dose PPI infusion in upper gastrointestinal bleeding from causes other than peptic ulcers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration of High-Dose Intravenous Proton Pump Inhibitor for Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Prior to Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A placebo-controlled randomised study is being proposed. We hypothesize that early administration of intravenous omeprazole infusion stabilizes clots overlying arteries and hastens resolution of bleeding stigmata in peptic ulcer, and facilitates subsequent endoscopic examinations and reduces the need for endoscopic treatment. This may translates into clinical benefits in those who receive early intravenous omeprazole. Consecutive patients with overt signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding will be randomised to receive omeprazole or its equivalent placebo (80mg i.v. bolus followed by 8mg/hr) until next scheduled endoscopy. Patients with circulatory instability or fresh hematemesis will undergo endoscopic examinations urgently after initial stabilisation. The infusion will continue until endoscopic examination with or without therapy. Next scheduled endoscopy is performed within 24 hours from admission by experienced endoscopists with expertise in therapeutic endoscopy. At endoscopy, actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with non-bleeding visible vessels are to be treated by endoscopic therapy. Omeprazole infusion 8mg/hr is to be continued for 72 hours after endoscopic hemostasis. Patients will be followed-up for 30 days from the time of admission or if patients stay longer than 30 days, the time to hospital discharge or death.</detailed_description>
