	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use the Squid magnetometer (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) to help diagnose electrical and mechanical abnormalities of the stomach and intestines.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomagnetic Characterization of Gastric Dysrhythmias:Study 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Squid magnetometer is a non-invasive investigational device that measures the electrical activity in the smooth muscle of the intestines. Volunteers with normal bowel activity, those with gastric problems, and diabetics with gastric problems will be studied under the SQuid to determine normal and abnormal activity. Diabetics with an abnormal gastric emptying study will be asked to participate.</detailed_description>
