	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if pelvic exercises can reduce the occurrence of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) before and after delivery. We would also like to see if performing pelvic exercises before birth has an effect on labor and/or delivery, and if there are any specific characteristics for developing urinary incontinence during pregnancy and after delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Intensity Physical Therapy for Prevention of Pre and Postpartum Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The studies investigating physiotherapy for prevention of urinary incontinence during and after pregnancy used intensive pelvic floor muscle training. While physical therapy appears to be effective in preventing urinary incontinence, extensive physical therapy is too costly to be implemented as a preventive measure for the general population. Thus, we want to asses if non-intensive pelvic floor therapy decreases the urinary incidence of incontinence during pregnancy and postpartum. We propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to obtain baseline data on the effect of non-intensive pelvic floor muscle training of urinary incontinence in primigravid women.</detailed_description>
