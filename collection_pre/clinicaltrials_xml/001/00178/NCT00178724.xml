	<brief_summary>The NACTN Spinal Cord Injury Registry is a network of clinical centers collecting de-identified data from patients admitted through the Emergency Department of a NACTN center at the time of injury with an initial (first time) spinal cord injury (SCI). Information will be collected on the natural history of SCI and course of treatment through the first 12 months from the date of injury or long as medically indicated. Data collected includes imaging information from CT or MRI scans, neurological and general medical outcome and rehabilitation evaluation. No intervention is given other than standard of care for spinal cord injury.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participating centers include: Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston; University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston; University of Toronto, Toronto; University of Virginia, Charlottesville; University of Louisville, Louisville; University of Maryland, Baltimore; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Thomas Jefferson University,Philadelphia; University of Miami, Miami; Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston; Stanford University, Palo Alto Louisiana State University, New Orleans The Center for Biostatistics is located at: Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston The Data Management Center is located at: The University of Louisville, Louisville Preliminary work has been completed on the selection of data elements, data collection protocols, case record form design, and the design of a computer system for clinical data management and data quality control. In the first phase of the network, data will be collected on the natural history of SCI. Although there is considerable data in the literature about the natural history of SCI, current changes in treatment appear to be modifying the natural history. In particular very early surgery, including decompression of the spinal cord and vertebral stabilization with instrumentation appears, in some cases of SCI, to be improving outcomes. No treatment is given other than standard of care for SCI. Data is collected in hopes to help SCI patients in the future.</detailed_description>
