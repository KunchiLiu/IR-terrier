	<brief_summary>This project is focused on acoustical, sound, analysis of speech in order to identify vocal characteristics of speech that are associated with suicidality. Speech samples will be collected from four populations with different mental health status: suicidal, ideational suicidal, depressed and those in remission from depression, (the control group). Speech of subjects will be recorded during routine diagnostic interview sessions. The speech samples will be acoustically analyzed via digital computer algorithms. The acoustical differences among those groups will be determined based on the statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
