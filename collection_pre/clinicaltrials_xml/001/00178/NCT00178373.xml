	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of modafinil with regard to reducing cancer-related fatigue in cancer patients following chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Secondarily, the effect of modafinil on cognitive dysfunction in the same population will be assessed. The researchers hypothesize that administering modafinil (PROVIGIL®) to patients experiencing fatigue following completion of cancer treatment will lead to reduction in patient fatigue and prevention of or improvement in patient cognitive dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modafinil to Reduce Persistent Fatigue in Patients Following Treatment for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue is a very common and troublesome side effect experienced in cancer patients before, during and after chemotherapy and radiation treatment. This protocol will increase knowledge about the occurrence and treatment of fatigue that develops during cancer treatments with the rationale that: 1. better control of the fatigue reported by patients during and following cancer treatment is needed, 2. there are few systematic data on the etiology of fatigue following cancer treatment, and 3. there is evidence indicating that chemotherapy is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Comparisons: In this randomized, placebo-controlled study of cancer patients following their chemotherapy or radiation therapy, we will assess the efficacy of modafinil for relieving cancer-related fatigue by actigraphy and for preventing or improving cognitive dysfunction by computer-generated tasks that have previously been utilized to examine drug-induced changes in performance (CDR Cognitive Assessment). Additional outcome measures will include the Fatigue Symptom Checklist, POMS, Fatigue Severity Scale, sleepiness measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, cytokine blood levels, depression measured by the CES-D, and psychological adjustment to cancer measured by the Mini-MAC. The primary objective is to: - compare changes in patient reported fatigue following completion of chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment for cancer in patients who receive open-label modafinil (PROVIGIL®) for 4 weeks Secondary objectives are to: - assess the persistence of any effect found with a randomized trial of responders to modafinil or placebo for 4 weeks (responders are those who report at least a 1 point decrease in fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory) - assess the degree to which modafinil can prevent or reduce cognitive dysfunction following treatment for cancer - investigate potential relationships among depression, fatigue, cytokines, and cognitive dysfunction Anticipated results could provide potentially important new information with regard to clinical, theoretical, and methodologic applications; that is, improved pharmacologic and perhaps behavioral control of the debilitating fatigue commonly experienced by patients undergoing treatment for cancer.</detailed_description>
