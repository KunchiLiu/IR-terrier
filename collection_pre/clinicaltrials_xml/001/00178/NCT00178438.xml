	<brief_title>Wireless Capsule Endoscopy in Small-Bowel Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved technology that allows viewing of the entire small-bowel. Capsule endoscopy involves swallowing a pill-sized camera that sends images to a data recorder worn on a vest. Because Crohn's disease (CD) often involves the small bowel, we would like to find out if capsule endoscopy is useful in diagnosing small-bowel Crohn's disease. Current methods for diagnosing small-bowel Crohn's disease include colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), enteroscopy (ENT), single contrast barium small-bowel follow through (SBFT), and double contrast small-bowel enteroclysis (SBE), but these tests are unable to identify the presence or extent of small-bowel disease in many patients.</detailed_description>
