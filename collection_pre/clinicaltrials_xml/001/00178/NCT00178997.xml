	<detailed_description>The Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID)is a large cylinder machine located in a large shielded room that measures magnetic activity of the intestines. Subjects will be asked to lie underneath and get recordings of the electrical activity of their intestines. They will also be asked to have a CT scan done. From these two procedures, the mathematical and computer models will be developed to determine the difference between normal bowels and those that do not have adequate blood supply.</detailed_description>
