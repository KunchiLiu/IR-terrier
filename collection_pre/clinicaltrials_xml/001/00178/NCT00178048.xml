	<brief_title>Paroxetine in the Treatment of Chronic Primary Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the role of paroxetine in the acute treatment of chronic primary insomnia. Paroxetine taken on a nightly basis in combination with sleep hygiene therapy will produce a greater number of diagnostic responders in acute treatment, compared to a placebo and sleep hygiene control condition, in a randomized, double-blinded, six-week acute treatment trial. EEG sleep, sleep quality, and daytime well-being, and daytime functioning will also show superior treatment effects during acute treatment with paroxetine plus sleep hygiene, as compared with the placebo control condition. A total of 66 patients with primary insomnia, as defined by DSM-IV criteria, will be randomized (1:1) to receive paroxetine plus sleep hygiene therapy (P+SH-a) or placebo plus sleep hygiene therapy (PL+SH-a) in weekly acute treatment sessions evolving over a six-week interval in a double-blinded, parallel group design.</detailed_description>
