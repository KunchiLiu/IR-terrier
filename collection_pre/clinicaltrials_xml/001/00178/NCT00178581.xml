	<brief_summary>Glutamine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid during critical illness. After severe trauma, glutamine supplementation into the gastrointestinal tract may help maintain bowel function. We hypothesize that for the major torso trauma patient, high dose glutamine given enterally during resuscitation from shock and continued during enteral nutrition support is absorbed, available systemically and preserves gut integrity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteral Glutamine Supplementation for the Patient With Major Torso Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial of patients with major torso trauma, high-dose enteral glutamine and enteral nutrition will be given to research subjects while controls will receive isocaloric, isonitrogenous enteral support. Enteral tolerance, bowel integrity and permeability will be evaluated. The systemic appearance of glutamine will be measured.</detailed_description>
