	<brief_title>Reducing Caregiver Stress and Sleep Disturbances in Patients With Progressive Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general aim of this study is to characterize stress-related sleep disturbances in spousal caregivers of patients with progressive dementia and to test the efficacy of an intervention designed to reduce stress and sleep disturbances. We will compare the efficacy of a Stress Management Plus Health Sleep Practices (SM+HSP) intervention to an attention-only control condition in spousal caregivers of patients with progressive dementia. Specific Aims for this study are: Aim 1: To characterize stress-related sleep disruptions in spousal caregivers of patients with progressive dementia. Aim 2: To test the short-term efficacy of a Stress Management Plus Healthy Sleep Practices (SM+HSP) intervention versus an attention-only control for improving sleep and health outcomes in caregivers of patients with progressive dementia. Aim 3: To test the durability of the SM+HSP intervention among spousal caregivers of patients with progressive dementia. Aim 4: To characterize: 1. the impact of stress-related sleep disruptions on health in older adults, and 2. the effects of sleep interventions on health and functioning.</detailed_description>
