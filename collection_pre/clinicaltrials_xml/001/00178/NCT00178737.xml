	<brief_summary>In this research we propose to develop a comprehensive model to explain how users process persuasive messages. We then propose to experimentally test varying the persuasiveness of message content in various domains, and assess their impact on adherence by both physicians and patients. Finally based on our conceptual model and results from the experimental data we propose to develop preliminary guidelines to assist developers in designing effective messages.</brief_summary>
