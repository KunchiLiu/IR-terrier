	<brief_summary>An original cohort of 43 patients were recruited for analysis of anthropometrics, metabolic profile, skeletal muscle biopsy, echocardiogram at baseline, 3 months and 9 months post bariatric surgery. While all 43 patients reportedly completed 3 and 9 month evaluations, only 15 patients completed 24 month evaluations due to 28 patients unwilling to return. The overarching purpose appears to have been not only evaluation of weightloss, but normalization of metabolic profile over time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subjects in this study will represent both male and female patients with clinically severe obesity (BMI &gt; 40kg/m2 or 35kg/m2 with significant obesity related comorbidities), who have chosen to undergo elective bariatric surgery. Patients are screened through the University of Texas Houston Bariatric Surgery Center (UTHBSC) and are evaluated for bariatric surgery, defined in this study as small pouch gastric bypass with RouxenY (SPGB), or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Adults (&gt;18)from diverse ethnic backgrounds, with clinically severe obesity, are eligible to be evaluated for bariatric weight loss surgery in the UTHBSC. Candidates considered for the study are patients who not only fulfill the criteria for weight loss surgery, but also demonstrate a high likelihood of complying with the longterm followup that is required for a successful study. Patients who have components of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) will be included if these complications do not preclude a safe operation. . Exclusion criteria include age over 70 years, current history of smoking, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, known peripheral vascular disease, severe psychiatric disease, any medical problem or physical contraindication for surgery (as determined by the physician) and pregnancy. This study will be limited to adults since the safety of gastric bypass surgery has not been shown to be safe in children in large clinical trials</criteria>
