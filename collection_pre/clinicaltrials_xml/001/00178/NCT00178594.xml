	<brief_summary>The objective of this study will be to assess the coagulation system in-vitro in a variety of bleeding and clotting disorders using the ROTEG analyzer and the thrombin generation assay.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Hemostasis in Bleeding and Thrombotic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory study involving blood coagulation assays in a select group of individuals. The ROTEG is a newly developed coagulation analyzer which allows the continuous assessment of whole blood coagulation from the formation of the first fibrin fibers and activated platelets, to the formation of a three-dimensional whole blood clot until the eventual dissolution of the clot. This device will not be used as a diagnostic or procedure tool. No recommendations regarding interpretation of the results or implications for future treatment will be provided.</detailed_description>
