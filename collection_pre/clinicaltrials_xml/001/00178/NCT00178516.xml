	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine whether there is a correlation between the levels of Vitamin E in sperm and sperm DNA fragmentation. Previous research has shown that damage to the DNA in sperm may cause infertility or increase the chances of miscarriage, if the damage is extensive (eg. present in the overwhelming majority of sperm). Some studies suggest that DNA damage can be caused by oxidative stress. Antioxidants, such as Vitamin E, which are present in some foods, can prevent damage to cells from "free radicals", which are naturally present by-products of metabolism. We ask whether there is a correlation between sperm DNA damage and Vitamin E</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin E and Male Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sperm DNA damage is an emerging cause of male infertility that is likely to be more common among men with increased reactive oxygen species in the ejaculate. Vitamin E can protect the sperm membrane from oxidative damage and increased levels are associated with low levels of reactive oxygen species. This is a study of Vitamin E levels in the spermatozoa and sera of 48 infertile men, and 20 fertile men as a control group, to look for correlations between sperm vitamin E levels and the degree of sperm DNA fragmentation. Dietary intake of antioxidants will also be included.</detailed_description>
