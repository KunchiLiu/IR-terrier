	<brief_summary>A treatment study is being conducted by the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) in which patients with non-small cell lung cancer will be treated with radiation therapy and a drug called paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is a natural product with anticancer properties. The first purpose of this study is to determine the dose of paclitaxel which, when given in combination with radiation therapy, will provide the greatest effect have the least side effects. To determine this, patients will be put on the study in groups of 3. The dose for each additional group will be higher than the previous dose until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. The second purpose is to determine if radiation therapy with paclitaxel is more effective in treating lung cancer than radiation therapy alone.</brief_summary>
