	<brief_title>Covalent Tolerance Induction to Factor VIII-Prediction of Inhibitors in Hemophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the most serious complications of treatment in patients with hemophilia A or hemophilia B is the development of an inhibitor, which is an antibody that neutralizes the factor VIII or IX coagulant activity. Up to one fourth of patients with severe hemophilia A develop an inhibitor but at present it is not possible to predict which patients will develop such antibody. The ability to predict an inhibitor development at an individual level would greatly improve therapeutic approach to this serious problem</detailed_description>
