	<detailed_description>Music therapy interventions will be used as supportive therapy for patients undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation. The music will support the procedure by serving as a stimulus for relaxation and/or pain and anxiety management. The intervention will consist of 40 - 50 minutes of active music therapy and improvisation in which the music is used as a distraction from the hospital setting and the procedure taking place. The intervention will end with 5 to 10 minutes of discussion of music activities/selections to be used between music therapy sessions. The intervention is individualized and can be modified accordingly to the subject's preferences.</detailed_description>
