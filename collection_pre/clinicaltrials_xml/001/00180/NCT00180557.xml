	<brief_summary>In this study the difference between screw in leads actively fixed in the septum and tined leads passively fixed in the apex concerning electrical parameters and implantation time will be evaluated. In addition the influence of the stimulation location by type of lead on QRS width, ejection fraction and NYHA class will be evaluated using and electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.</brief_summary>
