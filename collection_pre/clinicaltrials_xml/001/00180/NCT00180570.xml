	<brief_title>SALT - Success of Active Versus Passive Lead Fixation of Atrial Pacing/Sensing Electrodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigation will study and compare 3 types of electrically identical, commercially available FineLine II Sterox leads with different fixation mechanisms. This trial has been designed to primarily study the difference in repositioning rate between active and passive fixation (straight and J-shaped) leads, if any. It will also monitor and document the behavior of the study leads, with special reference to electrical parameters and handling. Normal measurements are taken at pre-dicharge, 1-month 3-month and 12-month follow-up</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients selected for participation in this investigation should be candidates for permanent pacemaker implantation chosen from the investigator's general patient population without regard for race or sex. Furthermore, these patients should, in the physician's general opinion, benefit from permanent pacemaker implantation with one of the study leads. Patients should be geographically stable and available for routine followup visits throughout the duration of the study. Patients must also be able and willing to provide informed consent. Patients who previously went through heart surgery should be excluded from the study.</criteria>
