	<brief_title>Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) Study: Implantation of a Hip Resurfacing Endoprosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High volumetric wear of polyethylene was the main factor in periprosthetic bone resorption and failure of historic hip resurfacing prosthesis. Metal-on-metal devices reduce the wear substantially and may solve this problem. The purpose of this study is the investigation of the functional and radiological result and subjective patient outcome after implantation of a hip resurfacing endoprosthesis (Birmingham Hip Resurfacing) during the first two years after surgery.</detailed_description>
