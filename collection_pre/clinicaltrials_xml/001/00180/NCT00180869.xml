	<brief_summary>There is evidence to suggest that red blood cell concentrate (RBC) transfusion may have immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this randomized single-center trial is to compare immune responses in patients undergoing cancer surgery and given either an unmodified RBC (UN-RBC) or a leuko-reduced RBC (LR-RBC) transfusion perioperatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unmodified Versus Leuko-Reduced Allogeneic Red Blood Cells Transfusion in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center study is conducted to compare the effect of peroperative transfusion of allogeneic unmodified RBC (UN-RBC) versus leuko-reduced RBC (RED-RBC) on recipient immunity. Patients undergoing cancer surgery are randomly assigned peroperatively to receive UN-RBC or RED-RBC. Groups are stratified for age, sex, tumor characteristics, prior transfusion and prior cancer treatment. Blood sampless are collected before anesthesia (d0) and at days 3, 7, 14 , 28 after transfusion/surgery and analyzed for complete cell blood count, lymphocyte subsets, cytokine production (IL4, IL10, IFNgamma, IL12), T-cells repertoire (TCR) analysis and detection of circulating donor cells. Main study endpoint is the influence of the treatment arm on IL4/IFNgamma ratio. The effect of transfusion type on any given biological parameters is also tested (peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotyping (PBMC), cytokine production by stimulated PBMC, T cell repertoire analysis and microchimerism assessment).</detailed_description>
