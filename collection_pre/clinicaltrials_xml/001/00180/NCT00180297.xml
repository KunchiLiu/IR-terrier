	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the implant of a ICD lead of defibrillation in the septum of the right ventricle</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Septal - Success Rate and Clinical Outcome of Septal Implant of Ventricular Defibrillation Lead</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate of success at implant and the positive clinical outcomes for the patients implanted with a lead of defibrillation at the septal site would make it possible to recommend this site as a "new standard" for implant of the defibrillation lead in the RV for ICD.</detailed_description>
