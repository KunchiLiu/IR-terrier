	<brief_title>ASSESS Study: Evaluation of ABSOLUTE™ Stent System for Occluded Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of stenosis in superficial femoral arteries and/or proximal popliteal arteries with stenting is associated with high restenosis rates, especially with the first generation stents (stainless steel). Currently, self-expandable nitinol stents are commercialized which lead to higher primary patency rates as compared to the first generation stents, even in longer lesions. However, until now most data available are retrospective and uni-center. The ASSESS study is a prospective multi-center study investigating the performance (restenosis rate, patency rates) of the ABSOLUTE™. 035 peripheral self-expandable stent in longer lesions (lesion length from 4.00 mm to 200.00 mm). Moreover, literature shows stent fracture in nitinol stents, with a possible clinical relationship. For this reason, the ASSESS study will analyze the stent fractures of the ABSOLUTE™ stent, and a possible relationship between stent fracture and restenosis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>De novo lesion of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) or proximal popliteal artery within the following parameters: 10 mm distal to the origin of the profunda femoris (= 10 mm from the femoral bifurcation in the SFA) and 20 mm from the proximal margin of the intercondylar fossa. Patients must have symptomatic leg ischemia, requiring treatment of the superficial femoral/proximal popliteal vessel Target vessel reference diameter visually estimated to be &gt; 4.0 mm and &lt; 7.0 mm Target lesion length visually estimated to be &gt; 40 mm and &lt; 200 mm If the patient has a contralateral SFA or contralateral proximal popliteal lesion, this lesion can be treated as a nontarget lesion. The time and way of treatment of the nontarget lesion will be left up to the discretion of the investigator At least onevessel runoff to the foot confirmed by baseline angiography Patent common iliac artery, common femoral artery and profunda confirmed by baseline angiography. The patent common iliac artery can be obtained during the index procedure by a successful treatment prior to the treatment of the target lesion. Successful treatment being defined as attainment of final residual diameter stenosis of &lt; 30% without death, stroke, bleeding requiring &gt; 2 units transfusion, or any other complication which was device or procedure related. Patient is acceptable candidate for femoralpopliteal artery bypass surgery Previous ipsilateral femoropopliteal or femorotibial surgery Presence of a stent in the target vessel Prescheduled staged procedures of multiple lesions within the ipsilateral iliac or ipsilateral popliteal arteries within 30 days after the index procedure Coexisting aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta or iliac or popliteal arteries Acute thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombus Any immunosuppressive disorders, groin infection, or acute systemic infection due to any cause or any viral or bacterial infection Significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past month that would contraindicate the use of antiplatelet therapy Hemodynamic instability Target lesion is restenotic from previous intervention</criteria>
