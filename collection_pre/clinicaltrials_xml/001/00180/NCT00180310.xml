	<brief_summary>Prospective, randomized, active-control, single blind, parallel two-arm multi-center clinical trial comparing XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System to the approved commercially available active control TAXUS™ EXPRESS2™ Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Stent System. TAXUS™ EXPRESS2™ Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Stent System is manufactured by Boston Scientific.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPIRIT II: A Clinical Evaluation of the XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SPIRIT II trial was a randomized, single blind, active control, multi-center clinical evaluation. Subject eligibility criteria were similar to SPIRIT III and enrollment duration overlapped between studies. In this study, 300 subjects (3:1 randomization XIENCE V® EECSS: TAXUS™ PECSS were enrolled at 31 sites outside the United States. The primary endpoint was in-stent late loss at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included clinical outcomes at months 1, 6, and 9 months and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years; angiographic results at 6 months and 2 years; and IVUS results at 6 months and 2 years. Follow-up through 3 years is currently available.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>De novo Target lesion(s) must be located in a native epicardial vessel with diameter between 2.25 mm and 4.25 mm by visual estimate The target lesion(s) must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis of &gt;= 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of &gt;= 1 Nonstudy, percutaneous intervention for lesions in a nontarget vessel is allowed if done &gt;= 90 days prior to the index procedure or if planned to be done &gt; 9 months after the index procedure De novo target lesion(s) located in a major epicardial vessel or a side branch that has been previously treated with any type of percutaneous intervention (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) &lt; 9 months prior to index procedure Target lesion(s) restenotic from previous intervention Target lesion(s) located in a major epicardial vessel that has been previously treated with brachytherapy Target vessel(s) contains visible thrombus Patient has a high probability that a procedure other than predilatation, stenting and postdilatation will be required at the time of index procedure for treatment of the target vessel (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon or brachytherapy) Patient has additional clinically significant lesion(s) (&gt; 50% diameter stenosis) in a target vessel or side branch for which an intervention within 9 months after the index procedure may be required</criteria>
