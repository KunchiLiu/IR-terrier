	<detailed_description>Currently the optimal programming of the pacemaker output considers both pacemaker efficiency (prolonging battery longevity) and patient safety (adequate safety margin). A decrease in the programmed output can be used to increase the projected battery life or to eliminate diaphragmatic or pectoral muscle stimulation. An increase in programmed output may be required to account for increasing thresholds after lead implantation. The ability of an implanted pacemaker to automatically adjust the ventricular output above the pacing threshold while maintaining the appropriate safety margin has been explored since the early 1970s. The Automatic capture feature in the INSIGNIA I Ultra/AVT pacemaker automatically adapts the ventricular pacing output to ensure capture of the ventricle while optimizing the output voltage. The primary objective of this study is to document the success rate of the automatic threshold test in a normal pacemaker patient population by following normal pacemaker follow-up results for 1 year.</detailed_description>
