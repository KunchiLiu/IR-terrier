	<brief_summary>For implantation of developing conceptus, placental cells need to invade mother's uterus to access maternal blood supply in a control manner. We have found a combination of maternal immune genes (the KIR family) and fetal genes (HLA-C) strongly associated with pre-eclampsia where placenta does not implant adequately. The aim of this research is to investigate these two genes family in women suffering with recurrent miscarriages and find a possible link between them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal KIR and Fetal HLA-C Genes in Recurrent Miscarriages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about reasons for early pregnancy failures. It is believed that some pathology leading to defective implantation of fetus in maternal uterus may lead to recurrent early miscarriages. This project arises from previous work on pre-eclampsia where we found combination of maternal immune genes (KIR) with their ligand (HLA-C) in the fetus was strongly associated with the disease. We will tissue type the fetus, mother and father in cases of unexplained miscarriages. We hope that genetic findings in recurrent miscarriage will lead to new insights, prevention and treatment.</detailed_description>
