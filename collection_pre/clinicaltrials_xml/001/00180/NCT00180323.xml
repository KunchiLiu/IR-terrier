	<brief_summary>This prospective study will evaluate in patients, fulfilling implant criteria for Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) implant, the optimal atrial contribution to the resynchronised ventricles in the event of right atrial pacing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACC - Atrial Contribution to CRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will undergo advanced echocardiographic examination pre-operative, pre-discharge after implantation and at 3 and 6-months follow-up. AV-delay optimization will be performed using aortic VTI measured by continuous wave Doppler in a modified 4-chamber view. During optimisation aortic VTI will be measured at different heart rates reached by increasing atrial pacing 10, 20 and 30 beats above intrinsic heart rate (IHR).</detailed_description>
