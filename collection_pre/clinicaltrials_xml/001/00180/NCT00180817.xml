	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study of the Clinical and Haematological Cause of Women With Antiphospholipid Antibodies.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association between APA and thrombosis is well documented. Both LA and ACA are often detected in individuals with SLE but there is no prospective data on the risk of thrombosis in women who present with recurrent miscarriages in association with APA. This study should significantly advance medical knowledge of the natural history of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) which is essential to enable optimal management of relatively young women who may be at risk of complications, some of which are potentially life threatening.</detailed_description>
