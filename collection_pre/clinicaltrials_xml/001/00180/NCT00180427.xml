	<brief_title>VERRARI - "Are Ventricular Arrhythmic Episodes Reduced by Rate Response in ICDs?"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"Background: Studies have shown that bradycardia and irregular heart rates may increase the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Regularizing the heart rate and avoiding bradycardias by rate responsive pacing may be a way to reduce these arrhythmias. This is a prospective, open-label, randomized multicenter study. Inclusion criteria: Patients with an indication for an ICD according to the AHA/ACC-guidelines who get a rate response system and have more than 5 % rate adaptive pacing during a one month screening phase may be included if they have given written informed consent. Rate adaptive pacing must not be contraindicated, patients must be able to perform a 6 min walk test, must not be NYHA IV and should have a life expectancy of more than 18 months. Patients will be randomly assigned to 6 months of rate responsive pacing followed by 6 months of no rate responsive pacing, vice versa respectively. At 6 and 12 months follow ups, ICD stored data, arrhythmic episodes, medication, anamnesis, quality of life, 6 min walktest, echocardiographic parameters and optionally spiroergomatry will be evaluated and compared."</detailed_description>
