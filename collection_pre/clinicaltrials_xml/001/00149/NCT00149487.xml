	<brief_title>Enhancing Treatment Adherence in Pediatric Asthma With a Problem Solving Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents who are unable to adhere to their medical regimen for the management of chronic illness present considerable challenges to health care providers and researchers. Pediatric asthma is a chronic illness where the consequences of non-adherence are particularly detrimental and widespread, especially among economically disadvantaged minority children and their families. Studies of intervention of asthma management are needed for this population. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The aim of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a problem solving intervention that is tailored to the observed adherence behaviors and identified barriers to increasing adherence in African American children and adolescents with asthma, and their families. Patients are randomized to either a Tailored Problem Solving Intervention, or a control group who will receive Family Education Intervention. Duration of the intervention is four months.</detailed_description>
