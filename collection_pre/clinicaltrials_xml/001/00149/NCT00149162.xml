	<brief_title>Treating Patients With Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Interleukin-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We designed an open randomized study to evaluate the interest of maintenance treatment with interleukin-2 by randomizing the patients being not allogeneic transplanted in complete remission after induction and consolidation chemotherapy concerning the event free survival. A total of 580 patients will be accrued over 7 years. Treatment consists in subcutaneous application of interleukin-2 in treating patients with complete remission by a monthly regimen of 5 days during 1 year after having received a chemotherapy consisting of 1 induction and 3 consolidation treatments.</detailed_description>
