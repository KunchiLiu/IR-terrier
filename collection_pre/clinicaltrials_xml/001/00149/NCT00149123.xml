	<brief_summary>Major burns trigger the release of circulating mediators, as cytokines and endotoxin that induces a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The cardiovascular effects are similar to those seen in septic shock. After the initial hypovolemic phase, patients with extensive burns often present a shock with increased cardiac output and reduced systemic vascular resistances. As described in septic shock, we test the hypothesis that low-dose hydrocortisone could decrease the duration of the shock period.</brief_summary>
