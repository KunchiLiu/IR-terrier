	<brief_title>A Study of 5-FU Versus MTX+5-FU in Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal metastasis is common in advanced gastric cancer and is considered an incurable disease state. Peritoneal metastasis may cause serious complications, such as intestinal obstruction, massive ascites, and hydronephrosis associated with the clinical presentation of abdominal pain and fullness, vomiting, constipation, malnutrition and renal dysfunction.5-FU continuous infusion remains the mainstay for chemotherapy against gastric cancer. On the other, sequential MTX+5-FU was reported to be effective in advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis in some phase II studies. Therefore, the randomized phase III study of 5-FU versus sequential MTX+5-FU in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis was conducted.</detailed_description>
