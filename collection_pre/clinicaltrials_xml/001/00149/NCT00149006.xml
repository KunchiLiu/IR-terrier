	<brief_summary>The present protocol is designed to investigate the potential application of allogeneic cell-mediated immunotherapy in metastatic solid tumors similarly to the well established graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects in patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients with metastatic solid tumors resistant to conventional modalities will be eligible to participate in a treatment program based on the administration of non-myeloablative immunotherapy (i.e. fludarabine, Cytoxan) followed by interferon injections; subsequently the patients will be treated with mismatched alloreactive donor lymphocytes activated in vitro and in vivo with rIL-2. The aim of this study is based on the recognition of foreign tumor cell surface alloantigens.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Consenting patients (age &lt; 70) will be eligible for participation in the study involving selective antitumor immunotherapy provided the following criteria are met: Evidence of cancer not expected to be cured with conventional modalities Pediatric patients: Chemotherapyresistant neuroblastoma stage 4 and sarcomas. Adult patients: Metastatic breast cancer, malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer and selected cases of ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, smallcell and nonsmall cell lung cancer with nonbulky metastatic disease, and metastatic prostate cancer. Patients with measurable disease evaluable for response with anticipated life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Patients must be &gt; 2 weeks off of anticancer or potentially immunosuppressive treatment. Adequate ambulatory performance status (Karnofsky &gt; 80%; ECOG 01) to enable outpatient treatment. Compliant and cooperative patients anticipated to be evaluable for response according to the investigator's assessment. HLAcompatible (fully matched or single locus mismatched) donor available for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients with bulky disease or patients with brain metastases resistant to chemoradiotherapy. Patients with a significant history or current evidence of potentially severe cardiovascular or lung disease, or other disease or clinical condition that may not permit accomplishing the planned treatment or drawing conclusions. Hepatic and/or renal failure. Evidence of serious active infection requiring antibiotic therapy. Pregnancy. Contraindication for donation due to donor disease: HIV1; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity.</criteria>
