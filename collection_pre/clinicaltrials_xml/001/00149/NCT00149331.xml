	<brief_summary>This study compared the impact of two educational strategies (an education program versus a pamphlet) on participants preferences for insulin and their perceptions about insulin and injections after attending an educational session with a diabetes educator about insulin. Main research question: Among adults with type 2 diabetes who are potential candidates for insulin therapy, does an education strategy that involves a personal letter from the family physician, a presentation about insulin, and information about giving an injection, versus a pamphlet education strategy, effect: preference to accept insulin therapy; perceptions about insulin therapy; or perception about the injection?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Two Education Strategies About Insulin on Patient Preferences and Perceptions About Insulin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many people with type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy are often reluctant to start using insulin to manage their diabetes. This may be because they are worried about giving an injection and do not know enough about insulin to make an informed choice. This research is important because it will help researchers and health care providers better understand the feelings and educational support that patients need when they are thinking about starting insulin. This can help health care providers to better tailor the care they give to patients.</detailed_description>
