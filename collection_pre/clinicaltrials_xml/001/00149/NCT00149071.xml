	<brief_summary>A doubleblind randomised trial with active versus sham rTMS in combination with escitalopram in patients with prior treatment resistant depression in an acute 12 weeks trial with subsequent 24 weeks study phase with active versus placebo citalopram</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Accelerates the Response to Escitalopram in Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we aimed at investigating to what degree rTMS applied over the left dorsolateral cortex relieves depressive symptoms when the treament is combined with antidepressive medication. The study will also be able to supply knowledge on how long any possible effect of the rTMS treatment lasts. In the first 12 weeks of the trial participants are randomised to either rTMS combined with escitalopram or sham rTMS combined with escitalopram. rTMS is given daily for the first 3 weeks. The next phase is a relapse prevention study where the responders from the initial phase are randomised to either active or placebo escitalopram for 24 weeks.</detailed_description>
