	<brief_title>Combining Antidepressant Medication and Psychotherapy for Insomnia to Improve Depression Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Difficulties falling and/or staying asleep are common in people who suffer from depression. Persistent insomnia can hinder response to treatment. In addition, individuals whose insomnia does not resolve with standard antidepressant therapy are at increased risk for recurrence of their depression. Between 60% and 84% of people who have major depressive disorder report symptoms of insomnia. This study will assess the efficacy of combining antidepressant medication and sleep-focused psychotherapy to simultaneously treat sleep difficulties and depression. Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either desensitization therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy to target insomnia. All participants will also receive escitalopram oxalate, an antidepressant medication. The study will last 12 weeks. The severity of participants' depression and insomnia will be assessed. Study visits will occur weekly for the first 6 weeks, bi-weekly for the last 6 weeks, and once 6 months post-intervention.</detailed_description>
