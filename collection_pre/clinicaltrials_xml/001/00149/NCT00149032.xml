	<brief_summary>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only effective treatment to patients resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) serve as a routine treatment of choice for patients relapsing following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The present proposal is presented for introducing the use of immune rather than naive donor lymphocytes for patients with resistant relapse and resistant to DLI. DLI primed in-vitro against tumor cells of host origin or against host alloantigens presented by parental alloantigens in one way mixed lymphocytes culture can induce much more than potent graft-vs-leukemia and graft-vs-tumor effects, while down-regulating graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with hematologic malignancy or metastatic solid tumor relapsing following allogeneic bone marrow or blood stem cell transplantation (alloBMT) or nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation resistant to DLI with no GVHD when taken off antiGVHD prophylaxis. Patients with documented chimerism to confirm induction of hostvsgraft transplantation tolerance. Patients not consenting to participate in the study, or minors without approved parental consent. Patients with other diseases or complications that may limit their life span other than their basic disease. Pregnant or lactating women. Noncompliant patients or patients with poor performance status with life expectancy, e.g. 6 weeks.</criteria>
