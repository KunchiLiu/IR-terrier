	<brief_summary>Taken together, studies of the value of pre-emptive analgesia are inconclusive. This randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study was therefore designed to test that a reduction in post-operative morphine consumption can be achieved by a single-dose of etoricoxib before induction of anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Emptive Analgesia Efficacy of Etoricoxib for Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy were randomized to a group taking a single dose (orally) of etoricoxib 120 mg (n = 18), etoricoxib 180 mg (n = 17) or placebo (n = 15) 2 hours before surgery under the same standardized general anesthesia. At the post-anesthetic care unit, intravenous morphine titration was given before starting self-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Morphine consumption, pain relief score, sedative score, global evaluation score, and side-effects were recorded at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-operatively. The primary end points were morphine consumption within 24-hr post-operatively and total pain relief over 8 h (TOPAR8). Patient global satisfaction was also assessed.</detailed_description>
