	<brief_title>Peak Flow Monitoring in Older Adults With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: We propose a five-year Demonstration and Education project to assess the incremental value of peak flow monitoring (PFM) over symptom monitoring (SM) as a management tool for asthma control in adults greater than or equal to 50 years with moderate-severe asthma. We will develop three parallel asthma education programs for older adults using as our base an existing asthma education program (AIR/Kaiser Adult Education Program) of demonstrated efficacy for adults ,50 years of age. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Primary outcome Frequency and cost of health care utilization for asthma, and asthma-specific quality of life Key secondary outcomes Prebronchodilator FEV1; diurnal variability in PEF The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.</detailed_description>
