	<brief_summary>Serum HBV DNA is a referent but insufficient marker of therapeutic follow-up in chronic hepatitis B treatment. Intra hepatic cccDNA disappearance reflects HBV eradication in the liver. Intra lymphocyte cccDNA could be a new marker of HBV eradication after treatment. The major interest of this marker is that it can be measured by a simple blood test instead of a liver biopsy.</brief_summary>
