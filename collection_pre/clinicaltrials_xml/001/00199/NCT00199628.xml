	<brief_summary>Problems of compatibility between a mother and her child are frequent. The most well-known case can be illustrated by the fetomaternal blood group incompatibility (rhesus factor) which can induce severe anemia of the fetus. The investigators recently proved that incompatibility between mother and child can concern an organ leading to a tissular alloimmunization. For example, neonatal membranous glomerulonephritis (a kidney disease) can result from this mechanism. The purpose of this network is to detect and study neonatal diseases induced by tissular fetomaternal alloimmunization. The detection of these diseases will be performed by the mother's serum analysis.</brief_summary>
