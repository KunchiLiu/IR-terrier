	<brief_summary>The optimal strategy in advanced non small cell lung cancer with stable disease is not well known. There is no published study assessing an early change of chemotherapeutic drugs in these patients.Accordingly, we conduct this trial with the objective to improve the rate of objective responses by the switch to another doublet after 2 cycles of CDDP-gemcitabine association for patients with stable diseases (SD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of an Early Change of a Chemotherapeutic Doublet Versus Four Cycles of Chemotherapy in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with stage IV NSCLC and measurable disease are included in a randomized phase II trial comparing for patients with stable disease after 2 cycles of a platin (P)-gemcitabine doublet (P d1: 75 mg/m2, gemcitabine 1 250 mg/m2 d1, d8 every three weeks) two subsequent cycles of this doublet (arm A) to a switch to another doublet (arm B) : paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 d1, d8, d15, gemcitabine 1 250 mg/m2 d1, d8, every four weeks.Platin, gemcitabine and paclitaxel are administered according nadir and pre-cycle haematologic evaluations (with dose decrease if needed). Response criteria are assessed with RECIST classification by the investigator panel.</detailed_description>
