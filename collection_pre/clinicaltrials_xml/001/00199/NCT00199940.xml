	<brief_title>Safety And Efficacy Study Of Ziprasidone In Pediatric Psychotic Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ziprasidone is a recently FDA approved antipsychotic, and it holds promise in the treatment of pediatric psychosis due to its low liability for weight gain and other side effects. This is important because early intervention in persons with a psychotic illness is important for their long-term treatment and outcome. Unfortunately, pediatric samples are often more sensitive to the side effects of psychotropic medications. Because psychotropic medications are often used by clinicians long before they are studied in pediatric populations, it is important to further study these agents. Twenty subjects with the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria, will be recruited for the study. If subjects have completed baseline evaluations, labs, EKG, and rating scales and are still eligible to participate, subjects will start on 20mg of Ziprasidone at night. The second week this will increase to 20 mg twice a day. At visits that occur at 2,4,6,and 8 weeks, the subject's dose of medication can be increased in 20mg per day increments. This allows for a maximum possible dose of 100mg. Dosage may be decreased at any time secondary to side effects. The potential benefits are that new information will be added to the field of pediatric psychiatry and the possibility that the medication may result in improved symptoms of psychosis. The potential benefits of this study outweigh the possible risks.</detailed_description>
