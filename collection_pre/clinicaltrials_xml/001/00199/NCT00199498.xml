	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether RV (right ventricular)septal pacing has any effect on LV ( left ventricular) function than RV apical pacing in patients who require ventricular pacing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Right Apical Versus Septal Pacing Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of RV pacing site on LV systolic function as measured by LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction). Secondary objectives of this trial include: 1. to compare the effect of RVSeptal(RVS) versus RVApical(RVA)pacing on other indices of systolic and diastolic LV function 2. to compare the rate of heart failure-related hospitalization between RVS versus RVA pacing 3. to compare new-onset atrial fibrillation and stroke rates between RVS versus RVA pacing 4. to assess the effect of RVA versus RVS pacing on quality of life and functional capacity 5. to compare the rate of successful pacemaker lead implantation, complications and chronic electrical performance of RVS versus RVA pacing</detailed_description>
