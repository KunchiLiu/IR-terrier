	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral effect and durability of antiviral response (HIV-1 RNA PCR) and safety of a triple NtRTI/NsRTI therapy in antiretroviral naive patients. Patients will receive TDF plus FTC plus AZT for at least 48 weeks. Further objectives are to evaluate resistance pathways in failing patients treated with TDF/FTC/AZT and to evaluate a treatment strategy of sparing PIs and NNRTIs for later treatment.</brief_summary>
