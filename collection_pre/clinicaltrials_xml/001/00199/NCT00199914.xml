	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Shortwave Diathermy for the Treatment of Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, resulting in significant morbidity and health care expense. It affects more than 60% of Western World adults over the age of 65 years. It causes pain and dysfunction in 20% of elderly persons. It can affect any joint containing hyaline cartilage; knee is the most commonly affected joint. There are many strategies for the treatment of knee OA but a curative method has not been found. Treatment is therefore aimed to relief symptoms and to prevent further functional deterioration. It is unclear whether any of the treatment modalities is efficacious. Shortwave diathermy (SWD) is one of deep heat widely applied to alleviate the symptoms associated with OA. The efficacy of SWD for the treatment of OA knee is still inconclusive. The outcome of treatment in previous reports varies from null to positive effect. This discrepancy is largely due to the different research methodology, the inadequate sample size, the methods used in outcome assessment, and the treatment protocols. Comparison(s): Peri- or postmenopausal women with OA knee are randomized into two groups, receiving a course of either therapeutic SWD or sham SWD. The main outcome measured is the change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index.</detailed_description>
