	<brief_summary>Tracheal intubation is a frequent procedure in intensive care units (ICU). Post-extubation laryngeal edema is a frequent complication with potential morbidity and mortality, and may lead to urgent tracheal re-intubation. Corticosteroids have been proposed to reduce the incidence of post-extubation laryngeal edema. A few clinical studies have been conducted in adult ICU patients and have led to discrepant results. These discrepancies may be related to the time lag separating the administration of the corticosteroids and the planned extubation. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with corticosteroids initiated 12 hours before a planned extubation may efficiently prevent the occurrence of postextubation laryngeal edema in critically-ill adults who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 36 hours in the ICU.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of 12-hour-pretreatment by methylprednisolone before a planned extubation in adult patients ventilated for more than 36 hours in the ICU. Methylprednisolone (20 mg) or placebo was first administered intravenously 12 hours before extubation and continued every 4 hours until tube removal. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of laryngeal edema within 24 hours of extubation. Laryngeal edema was clinically diagnosed and considered as major when requiring tracheal reintubation.</detailed_description>
