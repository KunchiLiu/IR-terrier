	<brief_summary>- To evaluate the impact of nightly sildenafil vs placebo use on diabetic men with and without proven endothelial dysfunction and coexisting erectile concerns. - To determine if chronic sildenafil use compared to placebo positively impacts endothelial function among a cohort of diabetic mend with erectile dysfunction - To assess the salvage rate of sildenafil - failures who demonstrate improved response rates over time with chronic use - To assess if microalbuminuria predicts flow-mediated dilation (FMD) response - To measure and identify if other patient specific characteristics predict for sildenafil erectile response and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) response over time (patient specifics; blood pressure, HBA1c, weight, BMI, age IIEF score at baseline)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Sildenafil (Viagra) in Diabetic Men With Erectile Dysfunction: the Impact on Blood Vessels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 type II diabetic men with erectile dysfunction will be enrolled in this trial, evaluated over a 12 week period. Randomization into one of two arms (placebo, daily sildenafil 50mg) will be a doubly blinded. Subjects will be followed by IIEF, diaries and brachial forearm medial dilatation duplex scans, urinary microalbuminuria and serum chemistry. Study time-points are at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Study participants will be instructed to use the study medication at the specified frequency but will be allowed flexibility to suit their erectile needs.</detailed_description>
