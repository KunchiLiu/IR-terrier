	<brief_title>Bipolar vs Monopolar Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Bipolar TURP using the Vista Controlled Tissue Resection System is safe and efficacious as a surgical treatment for men with symptomatic BPH, allowing a reduction in the post-operative hospitalization. It is expected that bipolar TURP will be safe and efficacious for the surgical treatment of BPH and will allow a &lt; 24 hour post-operative hospital stay in &gt; 50% of patients undergoing this procedure.</detailed_description>
