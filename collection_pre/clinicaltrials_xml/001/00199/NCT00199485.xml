	<brief_summary>Men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer may experience significant side effects including symptoms of intense heat, facial flushing, and sweating. These so-called hot flashes are similar to those experienced by women during menopause. A traditional Chinese herbal preparation, Dong Quai, has been used for thousands of years to reduce the incidence and severity of hot flashes. Anecdotal evidence exists to support the use of Dong Quai in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Recently, the awareness and use of herbal remedies and over-the-counter preparations for a number of different conditions have increased dramatically. This trial was, therefore, designed to determine if Dong Quai significantly reduces the incidence and severity of hot flashes in men following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
