	<brief_summary>In this study the efficacy and tolerability of two approaches to treat and prevent hyperuricemia is tested in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or high-grade lymphoma with high risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Both arms are compared by randomisation. In one arm patients receive during pre-phase chemotherapy conventional prophylaxis with allopurinol whereas in the other arm Rasburicase is used.</brief_summary>
