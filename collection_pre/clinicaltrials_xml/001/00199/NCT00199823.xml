	<brief_summary>Objectives Intracoronary transplantation of different cell populations have been used in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with promising results. The primary objective of the ASTAMI study is to test whether intracoronary transplantation of autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells (mBMC) improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after anterior wall AMI. Design The ASTAMI study is a randomized, controlled, prospective study. One hundred patients with acute anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with acute PCI are randomized in a 1:1 way to either intracoronary transplantation of autologous mBMC 5-8 days after PCI or to control. Left ventricular function, exercise capacity, biochemical status, functional class, quality of life and complications are validated at baseline and during a 12-month follow up.</brief_summary>
