	<brief_title>Hypertonic Saline Dextran in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After major cardiac surgery in small children, extravasation of fluid due to increased capillary leak has negative effect on haemodynamics and respiration. Inflammation cascades are activated by surgery and the use of cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB). We want to test whether a small infusion of 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran solution before and after CPB reduces inflammatory activation by measuring the levels of interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8). We also measure extravascular lung water, fluid balance and weight during the first 24 hours post CPB.</detailed_description>
