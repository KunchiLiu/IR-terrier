	<brief_summary>Renal blood flow is inversely related to obstruction. We propose that this imaging will be as effective as the diuretic renogram in the functional diagnosis of obstruction. Furthermore, dynamic contrast CT scanning may also add anatomic information necessary for the surgical treatment.</brief_summary>
