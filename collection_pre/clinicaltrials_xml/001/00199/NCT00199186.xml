	<brief_summary>The aims of the study are to determine whether single agent imatinib (STI571; Glivec) is more effective as up-front remission induction therapy than conventional multi-agent induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph+)ALL, whether this treatment is better tolerated, and whether subsequent combination therapy with imatinib and chemotherapy of approximately a 1 year duration is tolerable and effective with respect to maintaining remissions.</brief_summary>
