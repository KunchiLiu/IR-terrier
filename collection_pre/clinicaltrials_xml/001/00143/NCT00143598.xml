	<brief_title>The SOX Trial: Compression Stockings to Prevent the Post-Thrombotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent, burdensome and costly condition that occurs in about one third of patients after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Affected patients have chronic leg pain and swelling, and sometimes develop skin ulcers. At present, there is little to offer for the treatment of this condition. Prevention of PTS is the key to reducing its burden on patients and society. Elastic compression stockings (ECS) could be helpful in preventing PTS, however data on their effectiveness are scarce and conflicting. Comparison(s): Knee-length, 30-40 mm Hg (Class II), graduated ECS worn on the DVT-affected leg daily for 2 years compared to knee-length, inactive (i.e. no compression) stocking, identical in appearance to active ECS, worn on the DVT-affected leg daily for 2 years.</detailed_description>
