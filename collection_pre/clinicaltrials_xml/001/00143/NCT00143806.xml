	<brief_title>Transitioning From Cyclosporine to Alefacept in Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to devise a safe and effective method for transitioning patients from cyclosporine to alefacept. Patients in the study are well controlled on cyclosporine and desire to switch to alefacept. The study is done in three phases. In Phase 1 (12 week duration) the two drugs will be overlapped, with cyclosporine slowly tapering. Both drugs will be discontinued after 12 weeks. In Phase 2 (12 weeks duration), patients are off both drugs. In Phase 3 (24 weeks long), patients are on a second course of alefacept alone for 12 weeks and then off for 12 weeks. Topical and UV light treatments are allowed throughout the study. Total length of study is one year.</detailed_description>
