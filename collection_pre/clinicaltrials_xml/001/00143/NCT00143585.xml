	<brief_summary>To demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF165)when delivered by direct myocardial injection through the NOGA navigational catheter to improve myocardial perfusion in patients with severe angina pectoris for whom conventional PCI or CABG are either not possible or not ideal.Secondary objective will be to determine the effects of VEGF gene therapy on angina symptoms, patient perceived quality of life and exercise capacity</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess efficacy of VEGF and promote myocardial angiogenesis in patients with CCS III-IV angina symptoms,treated with maximal anti anginal medications who are not amenable to or not ideal candidates for conventional revascularization.</detailed_description>
