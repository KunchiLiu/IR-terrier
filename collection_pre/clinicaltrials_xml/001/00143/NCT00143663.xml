	<brief_title>Effect of Lapaquistat Acetate on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Subjects With Elevated Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) compared to placebo in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia. Subjects who have signed the informed consent will undergo necessary evaluations to determine eligibility for a dietary run-in phase. Subjects who meet randomization criteria will enter treatment with one of the following randomized treatments: lapaquistat acetate or placebo.</detailed_description>
