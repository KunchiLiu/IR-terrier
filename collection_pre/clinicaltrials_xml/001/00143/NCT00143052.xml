	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how the bones of hirsute women are different from bones of healthy women. The change in hormone content in the blood will also be investigated. The study can be used to evaluate whether it will be relevant to bone scan all newly referred hirsute women. Hirsute women are often over-weight and often have an increased amount of the male sex hormone in their blood. Their blood tests often show changes reminding of the ones seen in diabetic patients. All hirsute women referred to the department will undergo an investigation revealing the reason for the increased hair growth. The investigation includes clinical investigation (height, weight and degree of hair growth), blood tests (for hormone status and bone status analysis) and bone scanning of the abdomen (body composition). The trial includes a group of 50 strongly hairy women and a control group of 50 healthy women with normal hair growth. They are matched by body weight, since weight has great importance for the bone mineral content and thereby for osteoporosis in the long run.</brief_summary>
