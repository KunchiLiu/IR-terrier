	<brief_summary>This is a follow-up research study to determine if there are any differences in the long-term maintenance of two diet groups, the Atkins' diet (low-carbohydrate) or the LEARN program (low-fat). The Atkins' diet continues to get a significant amount of popular attention and very little scientific evaluation. Due to the small amount of scientific data to support a low-carbohydrate diet and given the wide spread use of this type of diet, it is important to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Atkins' diet. We will evaluate whether there are any differences between these two groups 3-years after participation in the initial 1-year study period. We will specifically assess weight, cholesterol levels, glucose and insulin levels, and eating habits and mood as we did originally.</brief_summary>
