	<brief_summary>This study will compare a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing (NRTI-sparing) regimen (Kaletra + nevirapine) to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens (Combivir + nevirapine and Combivir + Kaletra). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following drug combinations: - lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) and nevirapine (Viramune) twice a day; - Combivir (Zidovudine (AZT) plus lamivudine (3TC)) and nevirapine twice a day; - Combivir and lopinavir/ritonavir twice a day.</brief_summary>
