	<brief_title>Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Response During Exercise and Sexual Activity in Normotensive and Hypertensive Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical exertion will be measured by a standardized treadmill test. Sexual activity will be performed in the study subject's home with his/her spouse or regular partner. Each study subject will wear a blood pressure and heart rate monitor at home during their sexual activity and will be asked to complete a one page diary upon completion of the activity. Normotensive and subject with mild hypertension will be studied to determine if hypertensive subjects have a relatively greater increase in their blood pressure during either physical exercise or sexual activity.</detailed_description>
