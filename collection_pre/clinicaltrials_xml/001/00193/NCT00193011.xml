	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of standard adjuvant treatment with CMF chemotherapy versus treatment with weekly docetaxel in patients with high-risk breast cancer who are 65 years of age and older or are poor candidates for anthracycline-containing regimens. This CMF regimen has decreased dose intensity and may be slightly less active in patients with metastatic breast cancer; however, the patient population in this trial has tolerated more intensive CMF regimens poorly in other trials.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: - Docetaxel - Cyclophosphamide + Methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil This is not a blinded study so both the patient and the investigator will know which treatment has been assigned. Chemotherapy will be followed by breast and/or regional radiotherapy in appropriate patients, and by hormone therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years in patients who are estrogen-receptor positive. Patients who are considered poor candidates to receive tamoxifen may receive hormonal therapy with anastrazole.</detailed_description>
