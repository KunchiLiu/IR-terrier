	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial will evaluate the bevacizumab/erlotinib combination with the addition of imatinib (Gleevec). The combined inhibition greatly enhances the anti-tumor effects. Although the safety of the bevacizumab/erlotinib/imatinib combination has not yet been demonstrated, the mild to moderate side effects of all of these agents are not predicted to cause prohibitive toxicity. A brief phase I portion will be included in this trial, to optimize doses of the 3 agents prior to proceeding with the phase II trial.</brief_summary>
