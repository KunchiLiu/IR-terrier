	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to study the role of docetaxel/gemcitabine, an active and relatively non-toxic combination in advanced NSCLC. This study will help to better define optimal preoperative regimens for patients with resectable NSCLC. Since both of these drugs are potent radio-sensitizers, the concurrent use with radiation therapy at these weekly doses may produce not only radio-sensitization, but also considerable antitumor efficacy.</brief_summary>
