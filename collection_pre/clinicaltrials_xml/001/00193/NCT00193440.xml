	<brief_summary>In this trial, we will evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and effectiveness ibritumomab tiuxetan, when incorporated into combination first-line treatment for follicular lymphoma. Addition of the ibritumomab tiuxetan to our previously evaluated, well tolerated combination of rituximab and short course chemotherapy will allow the use of additional active agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxicity. In addition, "debulking" of lymphoma prior to 90Y Zevalin administration may minimize the myelotoxicity of this agent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab and Chemotherapy Followed by Ibritumomab Tiuxetan as Treatment for Low Grade Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive: - Rituxan + CHOP or CVP + Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Patients who are considered medical candidates for doxorubicin should receive CHOP chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone). Patients who are not considered medical candidates for doxorubicin should receive CVP chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, and prednisone)</detailed_description>
