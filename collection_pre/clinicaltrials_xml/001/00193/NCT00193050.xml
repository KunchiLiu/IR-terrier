	<brief_summary>Treatment strategies that include induction chemotherapy have several potential advantages: early initiation of systemic chemotherapy, in vivo assessment of response, and down-staging of both the primary tumor and regional lymphatic metastases, making breast conservation an option for many. The aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy and toxicity of induction combination chemotherapy with the triplet, gemcitabine, epirubicin, and docetaxel, in patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer. Clearly, it is in the upfront treatment as well as in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, that effective new agents and combination of agents are likely to have the greatest potential impact.</brief_summary>
