	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety of adding bevacizumab to rituximab compared to rituximab alone in patients with previously treated follicular non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) whose disease has progressed following at least one previous chemotherapy regimen and not more than 2 previous chemotherapy regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Rituximab and Bevacizumab in Patients With Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon determination of eligibility, patients will randomly be assigned to one of two treatment arms: - Rituximab - Rituximab + bevacizumab For every 2 patients randomized, 1 will receive treatment number 1 (rituximab), and 1 patient will receive treatment number 2 (rituximab + bevacizumab). This is not a blinded study, so both the patient and doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.</detailed_description>
