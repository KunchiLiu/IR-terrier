	<brief_summary>In this randomized study, we plan to address the important question of optimum local treatment for patients with localized esophageal cancer. All patients will receive our previously studied neo-adjuvant regimen including paclitaxel, carboplatin, infusional 5-FU, and radiation therapy to 45 Gy. At the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy, patients will be randomized to undergo surgical resection, or to continue radiation to a total dose of 60 Gy, along with one additional course of chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
