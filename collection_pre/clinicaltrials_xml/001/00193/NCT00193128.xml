	<brief_summary>In this phase I/II trial, we will evaluate a novel combination of chemotherapy, used concurrently with radiation therapy, in the preoperative therapy of locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. In the brief phase I portion of this trial, we will determine whether 2 drugs (docetaxel/oxaliplatin) or 3 drugs (docetaxel/oxaliplatin/capecitabine) can be used concurrently with radiation therapy. If the 3-drug regimen is tolerated, the phase II portion will proceed with this regimen. If the 3-drug combination is considered too toxic, the phase II study will proceed with docetaxel/oxaliplatin in combination with radiation therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive: Oxaliplatin + Docetaxel + Capecitabine + Radiation therapy If the three-drug chemotherapy regimen, with radiation therapy, is tolerable, this regimen will be taken forward into the phase II portion of the trial.
