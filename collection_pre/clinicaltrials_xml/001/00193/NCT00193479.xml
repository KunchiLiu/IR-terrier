	<brief_summary>The purposes of this trial are to decrease toxicity and improve treatment effectiveness elderly patients. With a short course of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and prednisone with concurrent administration of rituximab it is likely to be as effective as longer programs, and will certainly be better tolerated by this patient group. The addition of maintenance therapy may result in substantial prolongation of remission duration.</brief_summary>
