	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the combination of modified infusional 5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6), bevacizumab, and cetuximab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. FOLFOX6 has proven to be a safe and effective regimen in first line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. The role of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitors in an earlier treatment setting in combination with optimal chemotherapy regimens is an important emerging question.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab and Cetuximab in Combination With FOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients received cetuximab: 400 mg/m2 (first cycle only) administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 and 250 mg/m2 IV on day 8 with all subsequent cycles 250 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8. Day 1 cetuximab was immediately followed by bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV, and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 IV bolus, followed by 2400 mg/m2 administered as a continuous infusion over 46 hours via a pump (outpatient) and leucovorin 350 mg IV (modified FOLFOX6). Cycles were 14 days.</detailed_description>
