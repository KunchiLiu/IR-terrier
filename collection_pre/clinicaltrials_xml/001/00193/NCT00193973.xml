	<brief_summary>Idarubicin combined with high dose methotrexate and moderate dose radiotherapy will achieve similar survival outcomes but with reduced neurotoxicity compared to regimens using methotrexate with high dose radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Idarubicin Based Combined Modality Therapy in Primary CNS Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combined modality therapy in PCNSL has improved survival outcomes but at the cost of unacceptable rates of neurotoxicity when high dose radiotherapy is used. Idarubicin has activity in systemic lymphomas and crosses the blood brain barrier and may add to the efficacy of methotrexate. By combining these 2 drugs with moderate dose radiotherapy survival outcomes should be optimal but with lower rates of neurotoxicity. Comparison: TROG has previously performed a phase 2 study using methotrexate with high dose radiotherapy and this will allow comparison of survival and neurotoxicity rates.</detailed_description>
