	<brief_summary>In this trial, we plan to evaluate further the role of arsenic trioxide in the treatment of patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Arsenic trioxide will be used in combination with thalidomide. Although both drugs have a similar mechanism of action, it is likely that the mechanisms may be additive or synergistic. Since neither drug produces much myelosuppression, this combination regimen should be tolerable in patients with compromised marrow function due to involvement with myeloma and/or previous cytotoxic chemotherapy</brief_summary>
