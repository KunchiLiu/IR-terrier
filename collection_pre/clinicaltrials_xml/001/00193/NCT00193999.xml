	<brief_summary>Gastric emptying is delayed after cardiac surgery, but the efficacy of the nasogastric (NG) tube in preventing distension and reducing vomiting is unclear. Nasogastric (NG) tubes are routinely used in patients undergoing surgery. They are presumed to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and to lessen the risk of aspiration by reducing residual gastric volumes; however, their insertion and use is not however without potentially serious complications. Existing literature does not address their efficacy in reducing PONV after cardiac surgery. However, current evidence suggests that up to 50% of patients in this group suffer significant nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study is to determine whether NG tubes should continue to be inserted routinely during cardiac surgery to reduce PONV.</brief_summary>
