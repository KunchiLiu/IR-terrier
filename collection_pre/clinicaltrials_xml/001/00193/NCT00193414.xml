	<brief_summary>This study is designed to study the role of an active and well-tolerated non-platinum agent, gemcitabine, in a combination regimen with pemetrexed in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. This study will serve to define the role of next generation agents in a new combination regimen in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. This combination regimen may ultimately be important in further expanding treatment options for patients while improving survival, quality of life, and symptom control compared with platinum-based combination regimens - and with acceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
