	<brief_summary>Pre-clinical data suggests that combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin is synergistic, and both drugs may be synergistic with trastuzumab. Additionally, recent clinical data suggest that the combination of gemcitabine with platinum is an active regimen in metastatic breast cancer. This study will test the combination of gemcitabine with carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients with Her2/neu overexpression will be stratified to receive trastuzumab in addition to gemcitabine and carboplatin.</brief_summary>
