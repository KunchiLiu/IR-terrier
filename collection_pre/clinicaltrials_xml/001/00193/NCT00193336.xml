	<brief_summary>Because of the demonstrated single agent activity and excellent tolerability in patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer, ZD1839 may be of benefit in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have poor performance status. In this phase II trial, we will investigate the single agent activity of first-line ZD1839 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with poor performance status</brief_summary>
