	<brief_summary>Patient tolerance of pain from discharges of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD's) is highly variable. It can be influenced by psychological factors, physical condition and the number of shocks delivered. It has been shown that cutaneous pain perception can be reduced by delivery of a weak , low voltage pulse (prepulse)prior to the delivery of a stronger shock. A prepulse delivered before a high voltage ICD shock will decrease discomfort compared to a shock of equal energy without a prepulse.</brief_summary>
