	<brief_summary>Early detection of lung cancer may improve treatment outcomes. Risk factors have been identified, suggesting a population which might benefit from regular screening. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has experienced a recent renaissance with reported sensitivity for detection of lung cancer of 2.7% in high-risk populations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of LCDT for the early diagnosis of lung cancer in Ontario.</brief_summary>
