	<brief_summary>Standard treatment for gynecological cancer is radiation therapy in two phases; whole pelvic radiation and then an internal radiation boost, also called a brachytherapy boost, to treat any remaining tumour. The purpose of this study is to test an alternative radiation boost treatment called conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy or IMRT. Currently, we do not have complete information on the overall effectiveness of IMRT compared to brachytherapy or conformal radiotherapy. We know that IMRT allows the radiation beams to be more accurately focused on the tumor, thereby sparing more normal tissue from radiation damage and lowering risks of side effects. We are investigating the extent to which IMRT can be used to protect normal tissues in patients with cervix, uterine or vaginal cancer from the radiation beams and how much the side effects of radiation are reduced.</brief_summary>
