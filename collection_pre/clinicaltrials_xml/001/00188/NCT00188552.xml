	<brief_summary>Patients with radiation induced injuries experience significant pain and negative effects on quality of life. Currently, no standard therapy for these patients exists, with some patients treated symptomatically, and others treated with hyperbaric oxygen or pentoxifylline/Vitamin E. This study will examine prospectively the safety and efficacy of using a regimen of pentoxifylline and vitamin E in patients with late radiation induced injuries.</brief_summary>
