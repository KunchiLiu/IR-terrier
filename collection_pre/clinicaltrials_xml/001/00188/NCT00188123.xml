	<brief_title>Rapid Diagnosis of Myocardial Damage and Coronary Stenosis With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 outpatients in Jonkoping County with a diagnosis of in-hospital myocardial infarction, are asked to participate in this study comparing segmented true FISP late enhancement with single-shot trueFISP late enhancement for the diagnosis of myocardial damage. The study does not intervene regarding treatment but is a comparison of the diagnostic power of the two MRI techniques.</detailed_description>
