	<brief_summary>To examine the impact of cognitive-behavioural therapy on both the episodic and functional outcome of bipolar disorder, in combination with pharmacotherapy. Primary Hypothesis is twofold: 1. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy will reduce the total symptom burden, as measured both by percentage of time spent ill (both syndromic and subsyndromal) and number of episodes, as compared to psychoeducation 2. Cognitive behavioural therapy will reduce social and occupational disability to a greater extent than psychoeducation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To compare the impact of cognitive -behavioral therapy to that of properly structured psycho education on the 'illness burden' and functional outcome of bipolar disorder, in combination with pharmacotherapy. Interventions: Subjects will be randomized to either a "control" treatment group cosisting of 6 sessions of group psycho-education (topics include illness recognition, treatment approaches, and monitoring and coping strategies; based on manual by Bauer &amp; McBride, 2002: Life Goals Phase I) or they will be randomized to the "experimental" treatment group: 20 sessions of individual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Bipolar Disorder (topics include limited psychoeducation, activity scheduling/behavioural interventions, cognitive techniques, including thought monitoring and challenges to dysfunctional assumptions and other coping techniques; based on manual by Lam et al., 1999: Cognitive Therapy for Bipolar Disorder)</detailed_description>
