	<brief_summary>Prostate cancers, in common with many other tumours, are often hypoxic; that is, they have low levels of oxygen. It is thought that tumour hypoxia may hasten the progression of cancers and make them more resistant to treatment. One previous study has suggested that hormone therapy, such as Casodex, may improve the prostate oxygen level. This study is designed to test that finding.</brief_summary>
