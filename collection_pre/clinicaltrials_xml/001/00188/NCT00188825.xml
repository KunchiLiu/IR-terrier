	<brief_title>Study Comparing Simulect Plus Standard Immunosuppression to Standard Immunosuppression Alone for the Prevention of Acute Rejection and Bronchiolitis Obliterans in Lung Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of basiluximab for the prevention of acute allograft lung rejection when used in addition to Neoral, corticosteroids and azathioprine. Acute rejection episodes will be evaluated during the first 6 months post-transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) will be evaluated at the end of 1 year after transplant and at additional follow-up visits at 2 and 3 years after transplant.</detailed_description>
