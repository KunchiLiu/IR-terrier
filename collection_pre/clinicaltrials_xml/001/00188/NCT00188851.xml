	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the virologic impact of switching treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with virologic failure to a salvage regimen with or without a 12 week STI prior to the switch. Hypothesis: A STI prior to starting a salvage regimen will result in an improved virologic response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Structured Treatment Interruption for HIV Patients With Virologic Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To prospectively determine the virologic impact of switching treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with virologic failure to a salvage regimen with or without a 12 week STI prior to the switch. Hypothesis: By withdrawing ARV drug pressure, resistant HIV virus will revert to wild-type. In treatment-experienced HIV patients who experience virologic failure, a STI prior to starting a salvage regimen will result in an improved virologic response and more prolonged vral suppression compared to immediate switching to a new regime. Interventions: Immediate Switch to Salvage Therapy: Patients randomized to the control arm will be switched immediately to a salvage regimen using the information from the treatment history and genotype results. Structured Treatment Interruption: Patients randomized to the STI arm will have their present regimen stopped for 12 weeks and will have a genotype repeated in the 12th week. A salvage regimen will be started at week 12 using the information from the treatment history and baseline genotype results.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years. On therapy with a triple ARV that includes a protease inhibitor and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the past 3 months with no changes in any agent of the combination in the past 14 days. Virologic failure while on the combination as defined by a plasma HIV RNA &gt; 1000 copies/mL measured on 2 occasions at least 4 weeks apart. HIV RNA &lt;500,000 copies/mL. CD4 cell count must be &gt; 50/mm3 Patients must not have a present history of opportunistic infections or acute illness requiring treatment within the preceding 30 days. The patient has at least two new ARV available based on history, and at least two of these new agents will be included in the new salvage regimen. Active substance abuse which would interfere with the patient's ability to participate in this trial, or declared noncompliance. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Patients with any of the following abnormal laboratory test results at screening:· Hemoglobin&lt;80 g/L, neutrophil count&lt;750 cells/mL, Platelet&lt;20,000 /mL· AST or ALT &gt; 5X Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)· Creatinine &gt; 250 umol/L End stage organ disease Patient with malignancy receiving systemic chemotherapy Patient has need for immune modulators (interleukin, interferon, GMCSF etc) or prednisone. This excludes a short course of inhaled or oral steroids for asthma exacerbation)</criteria>
