	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether or not a new contrast agent called Combidex, a contrast agent formulated from ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) improves the ability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to see lymph nodes in the pelvis. It might also help doctors tell whether or not cancer has spread to these lymph nodes. It might allow radiotherapy to be delivered more accurately.</brief_summary>
