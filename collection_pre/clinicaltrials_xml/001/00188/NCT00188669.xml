	<brief_summary>An estimated 20 - 45 % of women treated with breast conserving treatment experience chronic pain in the treated breast. The aetiology of this is poorly understood. Some of these women have signs of chronic radiation mastitis. There is no accepted treatment for this condition. The combination of pentoxifylline and vitamin E has been shown to be effective in reversing radiation fibrosis in this region. Many of these patients have had a benefit in pain response in a time period of a few benefits. This study is a phase II study of these drugs for a 6 month trial period to assess the effect on chronic breast pain in breast cancer patients who are 3 months to 3 years post radiation treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>UICC TNM stage 0 (i.e. in situ disease), 1 or 2 breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy with chronic breast pain or tenderness, with or without fibrosis, within 3 months to 3 years following completion of radiotherapy Age 18 to 75 years of age Chronic symptoms localised to the breast treated with radiation, i.e. any one or more of the following pain (not attributable to infection) or tenderness with or without associated oedema, fibrosis, necrosis or ulceration. Breast pain (maximum in the previous 24 hours) measurable on a Linear Analogue Scale with a length of 3cm or greater Prior treatment with radiation to the affected area i.e. in tangential breast fields or boost area Radiation completed at least 3 months and no longer than 3 years prior to study entry Informed consent Active cellulitis in the breast Active malignant disease Any medical illness or condition judged likely by the local investigator to preclude safe administration of protocol treatment Contraindication to treatment with pentoxifylline (i.e. previously exhibited intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthines such as caffeine, theophylline or theobromine; recent cerebral and/or retinal haemorrhage; ischaemic heart disease; hypotension Pregnant or lactating women</criteria>
