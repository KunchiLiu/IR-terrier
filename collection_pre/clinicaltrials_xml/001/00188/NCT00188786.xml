	<brief_summary>Conformal dose escalated radiation therapy (CRT) is standard treatment for patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. CRT requires accurate daily localization of the prostate prior to treatment to correct for prostate motion and set-up errors. Cone beam computed tomography (CT) can accurately localize fiducial markers within the prostate. Cone Beam CT also provides important information on daily position of organs within the pelvis. This study aims to assess the feasibility of cone beam CT for daily localization of the prostate as well as document changes in size and location of pelvic organs during an entire course of CRT.</brief_summary>
