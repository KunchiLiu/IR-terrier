	<brief_summary>This trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ixabepilone when given together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating women with advanced ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer or metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone and Liposomal Doxorubicin in Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of ixabepilone when combined with pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCl) liposome (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) in women with previously treated advanced ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer or metastatic breast cancer. II. To determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine the clinical efficacy of this regimen in patients with platinum- and taxane-resistant advanced ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of ixabepilone followed by a phase II study. Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21-28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
