	<brief_summary>SRI's are considered first-line treatments for OCD, however many patients continue to have significant symptoms despite an adequate trial of an SRI. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the glutamate neurological system is involved in OCD. This study will test the safety and efficacy of topiramate, a drug, which targets glutamate, in the treatment of OCD, where the OCD has been un-responsive, or partially responsive to regular SRI treatment.</brief_summary>
