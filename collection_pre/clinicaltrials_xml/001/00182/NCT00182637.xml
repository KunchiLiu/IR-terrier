	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rates (complete response and partial response) and duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with bortezomib. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then at least every 3 months for 2 years or until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
