	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating patients with metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable kidney cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixabepilone in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Recurrent, or Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable renal cell carcinoma treated with ixabepilone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression-free and overall survival rates in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate VHL gene mutations with response in patients treated with this drug. IV. Correlate VHL pathway protein expression with response in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 9 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
