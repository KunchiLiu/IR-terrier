	<brief_title>American Ginseng in Treating Patients With Cancer-Related Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the efficacy of American ginseng, administered at 3 different doses, vs placebo in patients with cancer-related fatigue. Secondary - Determine the toxic effects and tolerability of American ginseng in these patients. - Determine the impact of American ginseng on quality of life-related variables (e.g., sleep, vitality, and quality of life domains) in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (I or II vs III or IV vs unknown), gender (male vs female), baseline fatigue score (4-7 vs 8-10), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), and concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.</detailed_description>
