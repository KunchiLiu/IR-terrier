	<brief_summary>SSRI's are considered first-line treatments for GSP, however many patients continue to have significant symptoms despite an adequate trial of an SSRI. Topiramate, a drug, which targets the glutamate system in the brain, has been shown to improve symptoms of social phobia when used on its own and has also been used as an additive treatment in other anxiety disorders. This study will test the efficacy of adding topiramate to a subject's current SSRI in cases of GSP which are considered to be treatment-resistant.</brief_summary>
