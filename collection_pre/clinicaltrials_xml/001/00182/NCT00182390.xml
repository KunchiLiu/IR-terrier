	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: That a high hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants is associated with a lower rate of survival without severe morbidity (defined as one or more of retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or periventricular leukomalacia/ventriculomegaly). Primary Objective: To determine whether either a liberal or more restrictive threshold of hemoglobin level for red cell transfusion in ELBW infants is safer, by randomizing to either a high transfusion hemoglobin threshold or a low transfusion hemoglobin threshold. Follow-up at a corrected age of 18 months represents a conventional age at which to first assess neurodevelopmental outcomes, and to predict long-term outcomes.</brief_summary>
