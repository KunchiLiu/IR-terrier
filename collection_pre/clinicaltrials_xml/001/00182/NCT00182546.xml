	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to determine whether D-dimer testing combined with assessment of Pre-Test-Probability (using a standardized clinical model) can be used to markedly simplify the diagnostic process for PE. It may be safe to omit additional diagnostic testing in selected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who have a negative D-dimer test</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To assess the value of the D-dimer in the diagnosis of PE, we had two sub-groups of patients with suspected PE, low and high pre-test probability. Patients could be randomized either to further or no further testing.</detailed_description>
