	<brief_summary>Trichotillomania (TTM) or hair-pulling has been considered as part of the obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) spectrum, although treatment with OCD medications has largely been unsuccessful. Tics/Tourrettes’ Syndrome (TS) is a disorder, which appears to be related to TTM, but is treated with a different class of medications than used in OCD, namely antipsychotics such as olanzapine. This is a study of the safety and efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of hair pulling.</brief_summary>
