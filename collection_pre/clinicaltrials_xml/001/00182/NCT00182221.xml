	<brief_summary>To determine whether D-Dimer testing, using the MDA D-Dimer assay, can be used to simplify the diagnostic process for pulmonary embolism (PE). This will be assessed by performing a cohort study in 1000 patients with suspected PE. To ascertain if an MDA D-Dimer result of less than 0.75 ug/mL FEU obviates the need for further testing and therapy in patients with suspected PE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of a Diagnostic Strategy With D-Dimer Testing for PE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective cohort study of 1000 patients in which those with a negative D-Dimer result undergo no further testing and are followed for 3 months for venous thromboembolism. Patients with a positive D-Dimer undergo standardized testing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or older Suspected PE Treatment with fulldose anticoagulants for 24 hours or more OR an ongoing requirement for anticoagulants Other tests for PE performed prior to eligibility assessment (e.g.other DDimer, V/Q scan, pulmonary angiogram, spiral CT, compression ultrasound, venogram). Cardiorespiratory instability requiring immediate performance of other tests to diagnose or exclude PE (i.e. inability to wait 3060 minutes for MDA DDimer result) Comorbid condition limiting survival to less than three months Patient has been asymptomatic for seven days prior to presentation Current pregnancy Contraindication to contrast (e.g., allergy, renal failure). Geographic in accessibility which precludes followup Presence of central venous catheter (permanent or temporary, including PICC line) at the time of eligibility assessment</criteria>
