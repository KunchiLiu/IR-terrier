	<brief_summary>Many women are turning to the Internet to meet their health information needs, but the large amount of information available, as well as the unknown reliability and applicability of information can be overwhelming.

None of these studies have looked at whether this type of patient education would be helpful for pregnant women. This study is being done to determine whether pregnant women who have access to their own health records and personalized health information over the Internet are more satisfied with their prenatal care, and if they are more compliant with health visits and tests, compared to pregnant women who receive only generic pregnancy information on the Internet and from pamphlets</brief_summary>
