	<brief_title>POISE Trial: Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The POISE Trial is a large multi-centre, blinded, randomized controlled group trial of metoprolol vs placebo in 10,000 at risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The POISE Trial will determine the impact of perioperative administration of metoprolol on cardiovascular events (defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal cardiac arrest) during the 30 day post-operative period in at risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Assuming a control group event rate of 6% for our primary outcome, we determined randomization of 8000 patients would provide 85% power and 10,000 patients 92% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% (two-sided alpha = 0.05). We set a goal to randomize 10,000 patients recognizing that we would have adequate power if we randomized 8000 patients. Without knowledge of the trial results and knowing that we had randomized more than 8000 patients and had a higher than predicted event rate, the Operations Committee decided to terminate recruitment on July 31, 2007 primarily because the remaining study drug expired in September 2007.</detailed_description>
