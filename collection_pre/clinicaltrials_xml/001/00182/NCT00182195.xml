	<brief_summary>A multinational, randomized trial comparing two lung protecting strategies of respiratory life support among critically ill patients with severe lung injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Open Ventilation to Decrease Mortality in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare an innovative Lung Open Ventilation strategy with a proven low tidal volume strategy, hypothesizing that the Lung Open Ventilation strategy may reduce mortality, other organ dysfunction, and the duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and hospital stay.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Invasive mechanical ventilation Acute respiratory insufficiency (within past 28 days) Bilateral infiltrates on frontal chest radiograph Hypoxemia, defined as PaO2/FiO2&lt;=250 Primary cause of respiratory failure is cardiac Anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation &lt; 48 hours Inability to wean other experimental ventilation strategies Severe chronic respiratory disease Neuromuscular disease that will prolong mechanical ventilation Conditions where hypercapniainduced intracranial hypertension should be avoided Morbid obesity (&gt; 1Kg per cm body weight) Pregnancy Very unlikely to survive and lack of commitment to life support Underlying irreversible condition with 6 month mortality &gt;= 50% Greater than 48 hours elapsed since first eligible Current participation in competing trial Lack of physician, patient or proxy consent</criteria>
