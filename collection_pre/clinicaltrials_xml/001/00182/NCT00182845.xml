	<brief_title>Donepezil in the Prevention of Post-Operative Cognitive Decline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 65% of elderly patients undergoing hip or knee surgery suffer from declining brain function known as post-operative cognitive decline (POCD). These individuals often stay in the hospital longer, have more complications, and are more likely to die. Recent clinical studies have shown the potential benefit of enhancing the cholinergic system among patients with both Alzheimer's disease and / or vascular dementia. Donepezil is currently being used to treat memory loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This study will recruit 30 cognitively impaired adults aged 65 or older who are scheduled to have elective hip or knee replacement surgery at University Hospital. Participants will be randomized to receive either a three to six week supply of Donepezil or a matching placebo approximately 4 weeks prior to surgery. This study will evaluate the effect of Donepezil on delirium incidence and severity during hospitalization, global cognitive function, length of hospitalization, site of discharge, and adverse drug effects. All material to be collected will be from interviews, questionnaires, and medical chart review. Some will be at baseline, during hospitalization, and 12 weeks post hospitalization and others will be daily during hospitalization. The International Study of Post-Operative Cognitive Decline battery of tests will be used in assessment, as will the CogHealth computerized battery.</detailed_description>
