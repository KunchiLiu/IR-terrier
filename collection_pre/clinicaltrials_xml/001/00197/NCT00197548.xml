	<detailed_description>Fetal loss, low birth weight and preterm birth are major public health problems worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Birth outcomes are also major predictors of child health and survival in infancy and beyond. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of multivitamin supplementation on fetal loss, low birth weight and severe preterm birth in healthy (HIV negative) women. We also aim to determine whether the potentially protective effect of multivitamin supplements on the risks of low birth weight and preterm birth translate into a sustained reduction in infant mortality.</detailed_description>
