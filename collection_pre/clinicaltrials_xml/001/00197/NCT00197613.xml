	<brief_summary>The "Adult Antiretroviral Treatment and Resistance Study," hereafter referred to as "The Tshepo Study," is the first large-scale research study of antiretroviral therapy to treat AIDS and HIV infection in Botswana. The Tshepo Study is an open-label, randomized study comparing: (1) the rate of development and specific types of drug resistance mutations with various antiretroviral combination therapies to HIV-1C, the subtype of HIV found in southern Africa, and (2) the short and long-term effectiveness of two operational modifications of Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) medication adherence strategies for antiretroviral therapy. Specifically, treatment follow-up via the Standard of Care, the national standard of care as it evolves in Botswana, with intensive clinic-based follow up including regular adherence education sessions, will be compared to Community-Based Directly Observed Therapy (Com-DOT). Com-DOT involves the SOC with added community or family-based DOT. This Com-DOT component would involve a trained, community or family-based Medication Partner ("mopati") who observes the patient take his or medications daily.</brief_summary>
