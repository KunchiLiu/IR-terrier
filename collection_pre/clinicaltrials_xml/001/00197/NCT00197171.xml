	<brief_title>Long Term F/U Studies at Y5&amp;6 to Demonstrate the Equivalence of 2 Vaccination Schedules of Combined Hepatitis A &amp; B Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open, randomised, long-term antibody persistence studies, conducted in 2 centers. Immune persistence was compared between subjects who received two doses of GSK Biologicals combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine at either 0, 6 month schedule or 0, 12 month schedule. These long-term follow-up studies involved taking blood samples at approximately 5 and 6 years after the primary vaccination of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine, to assess antibody persistence and a retrospective safety follow-up.</detailed_description>
