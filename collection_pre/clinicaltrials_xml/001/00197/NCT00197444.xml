	<brief_title>Low-Dose Nedaplatin (CDGP:Cis-Diammine-Glycolatoplatinum)/5-FU Combined With Radiation for Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The tumor stages and disease grades were classified according to the TNM classification (sixth edition) of the International Union against Cancer (UICC). These were determined conventionally by computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest and abdomen, bone scan, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), endoscopy and esophagography. Low-dose of Nedaplatin (CDGP) 10 mg/body/day was daily administered on day 1-5, 8-13, 15-19, 22-26 and 5-FU 500 mg/body/day was continuously administered on day 1-5, 8-13, 15-19, 22-26. Fractionated radiotherapy was performed from day 1 and a total dose of 50-60 Gy was delivered at the rate of 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction. Serotonin receptor antagonist was preventively given as an antinauseant just before the administration of Nedaplatin. Tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (UICC, 2002). Toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE). Survival was calculated from the start of chemoradiotherapy.</detailed_description>
