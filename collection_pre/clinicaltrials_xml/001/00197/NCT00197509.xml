	<brief_title>Sit-to-Stand Training for Survivors of Stroke in a Long-Term Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The implementation of a sit-to-stand protocol and extra practice has been previously validated in a rehabilitation setting, where 68% of survivors of stroke who received the training, learned to stand safely and independently from a 16" surface (the height of a regular toilet). Our findings have been supported by other research that have shown that rising from sitting is a maneuver that has been advocated for strengthening the lower extremities of elderly individuals and patients with specific disorders such as stroke. During the acute care and rehabilitation phases, considerable effort is spent to maximize a person's functional abilities following a stroke; however, continued strengthening and activity appears to stop once an individual is admitted to a LTC facility. The main purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of implementing the Sit-to-Stand (STS) protocol with or without extra sit-to-stand practice for survivors of stroke residing in Long-Term Care (LTC) facilities on (1) their ability to learn how to stand safely and independently from a 16" surface; (2) the number of staff injuries; (3) the number of residents' falls; (4) the quality of life of the residents and staff; and (5) the translation and maintenance of knowledge of the STS protocol by staff into their daily routines.</detailed_description>
