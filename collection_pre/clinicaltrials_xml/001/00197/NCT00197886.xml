	<brief_summary>Norepinephrine is a drug used to increase blood pressure in patients with life-threatening infection. However, norepinephrine may limit the bloodflow to the gut, thereby causing relative lack of oxygen to the cells. This leads to increased formation of lactic acid. This study examines whether increasing the dose of norepinephrine leads to higher concentrations of lactic acid in the rectum and stomach in patients with life-threatening infection.</brief_summary>
