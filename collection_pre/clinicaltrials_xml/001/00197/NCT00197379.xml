	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is exploiting the new drugs for androgenetic alopecia because there are still no effective and safe topical drug for androgenetic alopecia. Roxithomycin is one of the macrolide antibiotics that has immunomodulatory effects. We firstly found that roxithromycin increases the rate of murine and human hair follicle elongation in vitro. Therefore, we apply this drug on this disease therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of 0.5% Roxithromycin Lotion for Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The topical therapy for androgenetic alopecia is still not enough to improve cosmetically. Thereforem we try to find new effective and safe topical therapy for this disease. Roxithromycin has not only antibacterial action but also immunomodulatory and anti-inflamatory potency. For example, roxitromycin inhibits T cell responces to mitogens and production of cytokines, IL-2 and IL-5. We firstly found that roxitromycin increased human and murine hair elongation in vitro to inhibit apoptosis of hair bulb. Then, we wish to apply roxithromycin on the therapy for androgenetic alopecia.</detailed_description>
