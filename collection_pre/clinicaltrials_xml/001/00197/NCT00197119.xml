	<detailed_description>Open, randomized, long-term antibody persistence studies. Immune persistence was compared between subjects who received one of the two formulations of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine according to a two-dose or three-dose schedule. These long-term follow-up studies involved taking blood samples at approximately 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after the primary vaccination of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine, to assess antibody persistence and a retrospective safety follow-up. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</detailed_description>
