	<brief_summary>The purpose of this non-significant risk study is to establish initial baseline infection rates for the Codman BACTISEAL External Ventricular Drainage (B-EVD) System (Antibiotic impregnated catheter) and to compare relative rates of ventriculostomy-related infection between Subjects with BACTISEAL or conventional EVD catheters in a prospective, randomized open label study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Infection Rates for the Codman BACTISEAL TM External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>External ventricular drainage catheters are widely used in the management of Subjects with elevated intra-cranial pressure (ICP) secondary to acute hydrocephalus due to sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, intra-cerebral hemorrhage, intra-ventricular hemorrhage and other causes that obstruct the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. However, this mode of treatment could be compromised by the increased risk of catheter related CSF infection. B-EVD is manufactured using a patented process to impregnate silicone catheters with two antibiotics, rifampin and clindamycin. These antibiotics are impregnated throughout the silicone matrix. After implantation, slow release of both antibiotics at the extra- and intra-luminal catheter surfaces minimizes the likelihood of bacterial colonization. The B-EVD Catheter System has, to date, been well accepted by domestic and European customers. Currently there exists sound scientific rationale and promising bench-top in vitro data to anticipate low levels of ventriculostomy-related infection in Subjects using this system. Published BACTISEAL shunt data and direct feedback from U.S. market experience also support this notion. There are no published clinical studies reporting infection rates with the use of the B-EVD System, making all statements regarding its propensity to minimize clinical risk for catheter-related infection mere speculation and anecdotal. Therefore, Codman proposes to undertake a controlled clinical evaluation of this product to demonstrate its influence on EVD catheter-related infections, using a conventional EVD catheter as a standard of reference. Immediately following successful screening, the Subject will be randomized to test or control group and will have the appropriate EVD system implanted. The Treatment Phase will cover the duration of the implanted EVD system. Subjects will be monitored for 2 weeks post-explant. This study is expected to enroll 600 evaluable implanted Subjects at up to 15 Investigational Sites in US, Europe and Asia-Pacific</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The Subject is 18 years or older. The Subject (family member/legal representative) has given written Informed Consent prior to enrollment into this trial OR, where the Subject is unable to consent and no relative/legal representative is available to offer consent, appropriate legal and ethical practices are employed and thoroughly documented according to the laws and policies of the respective country and institution. The Subject (family member/legal representative) is willing to participate in this trial for the duration of the implanted EVD system and is willing to comply with the protocol requirements. Within the preceding 30 days, the Subject has enrolled or participated in another trial utilizing an antimicrobial drug or medical device implanted in or directly influencing the CNS and/or spinal cord. The Subject is pregnant or lactating. The Subject has a suspected or documented allergy to the materials of the EVD system, including silicone, rifampin and clindamycin. The Subject has a positive CSF culture prior to EVD implant. The Subject is immunocompromised. The Subject requires more than one ventricular catheter concurrently. The Subject has had an EVD catheter within the previous 30 days. The Subject has sepsis, ventriculitis, meningitis, a skin infection/inflammation at or near the implantation site, an ear infection on either side, or a severe respiratory tract infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would most likely compromise the effectiveness of the EVD system. The Subject is known to have received systemic antibiotic therapy within a 14day period preceding screening for inclusion in this trial. The Subject has an uncontrolled coagulopathy or any other known bleeding diathesis. The Subject is otherwise determined by the Investigator to be medically unsuitable for participation in this trial. The Subject is a prisoner.</criteria>
