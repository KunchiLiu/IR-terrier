	<brief_summary>This study studies labor epidural analgesia and compares dilute (0.0625%) with concentrated (0.25%) bupivacaine. We hypothesize that patients randomize to receive the concentrated drug will require more drug, will have a more profound motor block, will be more likely to require instrumental delivery and will be less satisfied than those receiving dilute epidural drugs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examines the effect of two different local anesthetic concentrations used for epidural analgesia in labor. Patients are randomized to receive epidural bupivacaine, either as a concentrated (0.25%), or a dilute (0.0625%) solution, both administered by patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).</detailed_description>
