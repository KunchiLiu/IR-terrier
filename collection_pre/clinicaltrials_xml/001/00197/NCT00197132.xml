BMI = Weight/height², (where weight is in kg, height in m). Male or female aged 30 to 65 years, inclusive, at screening. Female subjects must be postmenopausal (i.e. &gt;6 months without menstrual period), surgically sterile, or using effective contraceptive measures (oral contraceptives, Norplant DepoProvera) or intrauterine devices (IUD) (a diaphragm with spermicide or a condom with spermicide). Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures for at least 1 month prior to visit 1, and should continue to use the same contraceptive method during the study and for 30 days after discontinuing study treatment. Willing and able to provide a signed and dated written informed consent. Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus defined as an HbA1c level &gt;6.5% or a fasting plasma glucose of &gt; 7.0 mmol/L. If fasting plasma glucose is between 6.1 and 7.0 mmol/L then a 75 g oral glucose test will be performed to exclude diabetes mellitus. Subjects who have initiated lipid lowering therapy within the last 6 months and subjects who have increased the dose of these therapies within the last 3 months prior to study start. Subjects who are taking Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs, fibrates, anticoagulants or cardiovascular medications (βblockers, nitrates, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, alpha blockers, diuretics, centrally acting antihypertensives, directly acting antihypertensives e.g., diazoxide, digoxin, antiarrhythmics) and are unable to stop these medications for the duration of the study. Exposure to a thiazolidinedione (TZD) or other PPARγ agonist (e.g. rosiglitazone, troglitazone, pioglitazone, G1262570) within the last 4 months or participation in a clinical study involving a TZD or PPARγ agonist. Subjects who have required the use of any antidiabetic medication at any time. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days preceding the first dose of medication at the start of the study. Subjects with a documented history of significant hypersensitivity (e.g. difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, tachycardia or skin reaction) to thiazolidinediones or PPARγ agonists. Systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg or receiving antihypertensive therapy. Subjects with unstable or severe angina (requiring continual therapy) or congestive heart failure. Presence of clinically significant hepatic disease. Clinically significant anaemia. Subjects with creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/min. Women who are lactating, pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study. Alcohol or drug abuse within the last 6 months.</criteria>
