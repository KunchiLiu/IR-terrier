	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial to Improve Quality of Life Outcomes in Asthma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this study are to develop and implement a multi-component intervention to improve quality of life and decrease urgent resource utilization in adult asthma patients followed in a primary care practice. Specifically, the intervention involves a two-component self-directed self-management workbook. The first component focuses on increasing knowledge by providing patients with factual information about asthma and self-management. The second component focuses on asthma self-efficacy using case vignettes and making a contract to adopt a behavior to improve asthma. Asthma-related social support is achieved through interval telephone contact.</detailed_description>
