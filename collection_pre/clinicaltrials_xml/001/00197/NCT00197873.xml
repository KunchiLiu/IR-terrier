	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy may cause diarrhoea, which may be associated with treatment delay and infections. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether oral supplementation with lactobacilli will alleviate chemotherapy related diarrhoea. Patients diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer and who will receive chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to receive either lactobacilli or placebo during chemotherapy. The study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome measure is frequency of moderate/severe diarrhoea. The study will also address safety and tolerability of chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy, and serum growth factor levels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer with overt distant metastases and who will receive chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, given as 3-weekly cycles, will be randomly assigned to receive either lactobacilli (GefilusR) or placebo during the first 3 cycles of chemotherapy (for 9 weeks). Following this, the groups will be crossed over and those study participants who were allocated to lactobacilli will receive placebo for 9 weeks, and vice versa. Lactobacilli and placebo are administered twice daily. The total daily dose of lactobacilli is 20 billion CFU. The primary outcome measure is frequency of moderate/severe diarrhoea (grade 2-4). Adverse effects (including the frequency of diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating, constipation, and nausea) will be longitudinally monitored based on a patient diary and study visits. The study will also address safety and tolerability of chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy, progression-free survival, resectability of liver metastases, and serum growth factor levels. A total of 84 patients are planned to be entered.</detailed_description>
