	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with peptides or tumor lysate in combination with adjuvant cytokines and Cyclophosphamide can induce a measurable immune response in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma, and to evaluate the clinical effect (objective response rate) of the vaccination regime.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patients receive vaccination with tumor antigen pulsed autologous monocyte-derived mature dendritic cells with a fixed interval. The dendritic cells are generated from leukapheresis products and frozen after antigen loading. HLA A2 positive patients are treated with PADRE and oncopeptide pulsed DC; p53, survivin and telomerase peptides. HLA A2 negative patients are treated with KLH and tumorlysate pulsed DC; autologous or allogeneic. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106 peptide/lysate pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week intervals. Those patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response after 6 injections will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is applied by intradermal injection near the inguinal region. IL-2 2 MIU s.c. day 2-6, Cyclophosphamide (Sendoxan®, Baxter A/S) 50 mg twice a day bi-weekly and 200 mg Celecoxib (Celebra®, Pfizer) daily are used. Scans and re-staging tests are performed at scheduled intervals throughout the study.</detailed_description>
