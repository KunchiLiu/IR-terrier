	<criteria>HIVinfected. Screening viral load at least 5000copies/mL. R5tropic only virus at screening. Total prior antiretroviral experience of at least 3 months and documented resistance to at least one drug in each of the following classes: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI). Stable antiretroviral regimen (or no antiretroviral treatment) for at least 4 weeks before screening. Able to receive a ritonavirboosted protease inhibitor during treatment studies. Women of childbearing potential must use specific forms of contraception. Exclusion criteria: Acute laboratory abnormalities. History of pancreatitis or hepatitis, hepatitis B or hepatitis C coinfection, or any chronic liver disease. Screening liver function tests will be used to determine eligibility.
