	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to investigate whether in childhood salmeterol/ fluticasone propionate 50/100 bd delivered via the Diskus® inhaler and fluticasone propionate 200 mcg bd delivered via the Diskus® inhaler are non- inferior in terms of symptom control. Additionally we aim to show that salmeterol/ fluticasone propionate 50/100 bd is at least as good in terms of lung function improvement and bronchial hyperreactivity and enables a steroid-sparing management of asthma in children.</brief_summary>
