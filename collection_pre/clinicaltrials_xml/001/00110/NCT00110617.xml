	<criteria>Age greater than or equal to 2 years Male or female patients with sickle cell disease (SS, SC, SD, Sβo or Sβ+ thalassemia) Iron overload from repeated blood transfusion, as defined by one of the following: 1. For patients &gt; 16 years old receiving simple transfusions: lifetime history of receipt of at least 120 ml/kg or 30 adult units of packed red blood cells, OR 2. For patients ≤ 16 years old receiving simple transfusions: lifetime history of receipt of at least 120 ml/kg of packed red blood cells, OR 3. For all patients receiving exchange transfusions in the absence of a previous attempt to achieve negative iron balance: lifetime performance of at least 20 procedures, OR 4. For all patients: liver iron content ≥ 7 mg Fe/g dry weight as measured by biopsy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or magnetic susceptibility performed within 3 months prior to entry into screening For entry into the screening period: serum ferritin of ≥ 1000 µg/mL on at least two occasions during the prior year obtained in the absence of concomitant infection. Body weight &gt; 10 kg No known allergy or contraindication to the administration of deferoxamine Ability to comply with all studyrelated procedures, medications, and evaluations Sexually active premenopausal female patients must use doublebarrier contraception, oral contraceptive plus barrier contraceptive, or must have undergone clinically documented total hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy, tubal ligation or be postmenopausal defined by amenorrhea for at least 12 months. Written informed consent by the patient or for pediatric patient's consent of the patient's legal guardian. The definition of the term 'pediatric' for enrollment and study conduct will be in accordance with the local legislation. Serum creatinine above the upper limit of normal Significant proteinuria History of nephrotic syndrome Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 250 U/L at screening Clinical evidence of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C History of HIV Fever or other signs/symptoms of infection within 10 days prior to the screening visit Uncontrolled systemic hypertension History of Myocardial Infarction, Congestive Heart Failure or unstable cardiac disease not controlled by standard medical therapy Clinically relevant cataract or a previous history of clinically relevant ocular toxicity related to iron chelation Presence of a surgical or medical condition that might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of any study drug History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to enrollment Pregnant or breast feeding patients Patients treated with systemic investigational drug within 4 weeks prior or with topical investigational drug 7 days prior to the screening visit Randomization in a previous clinical trial involving ICL670 Other protocolrelated inclusion / exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
