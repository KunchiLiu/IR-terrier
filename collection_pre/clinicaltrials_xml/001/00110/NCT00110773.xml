	<brief_summary>Pulsed dye laser (PDL) on the face is painful. For this reason, local anesthesia is commonly used to eliminate or minimize the pain. S-Caine™ Peel (lidocaine 7% and tetracaine 7% cream) is a eutectic formulation of lidocaine and tetracaine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of S-Caine Peel for induction of local dermal anesthesia for PDL therapy in adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S-Caine™ Peel (Skin Numbing Cream) to Treat Pain During Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) Therapy in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multi-center (5 centers), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study that included 80 adults who met all the eligibility criteria and who were undergoing PDL therapy for the treatment of vascular lesions on the face. During the screening visit, the study, including potential risks and benefits, was clearly explained to each patient, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The screening visit also included: evaluating eligibility criteria, obtaining a medical history (including skin type, demographic data, and concomitant medications), a brief physical examination, and a urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential). The screening visit could be completed on the same day as the procedure visit. At the procedure visit, eligible patients were assigned the next available sequential patient number. By having a patient number assigned to them, patients were randomized to receive S-Caine Peel or placebo on the facial treatment area. The surface area of the intended treatment area was determined (up to 200 cm2). A thin layer (approximately 1 mm or the thickness of a dime) of the study drug was applied evenly across the area to be treated. The study drug was applied for 20 minutes (±2 minutes). Immediately following removal of the study drug, the investigator performed an evaluation of skin reactions, assessing the treatment area for erythema, edema and blanching or any other adverse skin reaction.</detailed_description>
