	<brief_summary>Patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency are at increased risk of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, particularly during certain high risk procedures. The trial focused on patients with confirmed hereditary antithrombin deficiency who were undergoing a surgical procedure or induced/spontaneous labor and delivery, and/or caesarean section. The study assessed the incidence of thromboembolic events following prophylactic intravenous administration of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) to patients with hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency in situations usually associated with a high risk for thromboembolic events.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GTC Biotherapeutics established clinical trial sites in Europe, Canada, Australia, Austria and Canada. GTC Biotherapeutics provided an international clinical team to support site registration requirements once a patient was identified for treatment. GTC Biotherapeutics also provided consultation to help evaluate patient eligibility. In September 2006, GTC Biotherapeutics modified exclusion criteria 1 (below) to allow for the participation of previously excluded patients with the hereditary thrombophilic disorders Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have hereditary antithrombin deficiency (HD) with a personal history of venous thromboembolic events. 2. Have a history of HD that includes 2 or more plasma AT activity values â‰¤ 60%. 3. Be scheduled to have an elective procedure(s) known to be associated with a high risk for occurrence for DVT. This will include nonpregnant surgical patients or pregnant patients scheduled for caesarean section or delivery induction. 4. Be at least 18 years of age, not exceeding 80 years of age. 5. Have signed an informed consent form. 6. Have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline. This applies only to female nonpregnant surgical patients of childbearing potential. 7. Are able to comply with the requirements of the study protocol. In addition, hospitalized pregnant HD patients in active labor and eligible HD patients previously treated with rhAT were allowed entry into the study. 1. Patients who have a diagnosis of another hereditary thrombophilic disorder (e.g. activated protein C(APC) resistance/Factor V Leiden, Protein S or C deficiency, prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A), or acquired (lupus anticoagulant) thrombophilic disorder). 2. Patients who have a baseline bilateral ultrasound positive for acute DVT or baseline diagnostic testing (if required) that is positive for a thromboembolic event other than acute DVT. 3. Patients who have a known allergy to goats or goat products. 4. Patients who have participated in a study employing a different investigational drug within 30 days of the start of their participation in the current trial. 5. Patients using fondaparinux sodium or the oral thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran, or are expected to be treated with fondaparinux sodium or ximelagatran during the study period (up to 7 days after stop of treatment).</criteria>
