	<brief_title>Effects of Sage on Memory and Mental Performance in Alzheimer's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The herb sage has been shown to enhance memory and mental function in healthy, young adults. However, studies assessing the herb's effectiveness in older adults with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are limited. This study will determine the effect of sage extract on the cognitive function of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. This study will last 6 weeks and will comprise 4 study visits, approximately 10 days apart. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sage pills or no treatment during each 10-day period. The treatment assignments will be switched in 10-day intervals, so that during the course of the study, each participant will undergo two periods of sage treatment and two periods without treatment. At each study visit, participants will undergo cognitive testing, including tests to determine attention, memory, and visual cognition. Participants will also undergo an electroencephalogram (EEG) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) at each visit.</detailed_description>
