This study will also examine the way tai chi influences mental, physical, and social functioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tai Chi Mind-Body Therapy for Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HF is a major public health problem in the United States, affecting approximately 5 million adults. Despite recent advances in pharmacologic therapy and technologic devices, HF is the most common reason for hospitalization among Medicare patients and is reaching epidemic proportions as the population ages. New and inexpensive interventions that can improve functional capacity and quality of life and can delay disease progression are needed. Tai chi is a popular mind-body exercise that is a potential treatment for heart disease. This exercise incorporates both gentle physical activity and meditation, and it may be particularly suited to frail patients with HF. This study will examine the effects of a tailored tai chi program on functional capacity and quality of life in patients with HF. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a tai chi program or heart health education for 12 weeks. Participants in both groups will undergo a bicycle stress test at study entry and will receive weekly training sessions of their assigned intervention. Self-report scales and questionnaires will be used to assess participants at study start and at the end of 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
