	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PN2034 administered to type 2 diabetics on concomitant rosiglitazone and metformin (or Avandamet) therapy as measured by change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from baseline to Week 12. Also the study will evaluate the effect of PN2034 on glucose control as measured by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and on fasting lipid levels: triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).</brief_summary>
