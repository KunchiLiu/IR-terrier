	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized trial is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention involving education, self-efficacy, and social support in improving quality of life outcomes among 296 adult asthma patients treated in the emergency room. The main outcome will be a comparison of within-patient change in quality of life between enrollment and 8 weeks. Secondary objectives will be to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing the need for rescue inhaled beta agonists, in improving peak flow meter rates, and in decreasing the number of days lost from work or school due to asthma. These outcomes will be measured again at 16 weeks to determine if benefits are sustained. Additional outcomes at 16 weeks and 1 year will be to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing urgent resource utilization for asthma and cost effectiveness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma Patient Education in the Emergency Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Many urban asthma emergency room patients lack effective self-management. Most current training programs are administered in outpatient settings and have low attendance rates for emergency room patients. There is a great need to develop effective programs that can be easily administered in the emergency room for patients who, in many cases, are not present in other settings to receive education. This proposal builds on preliminary studies and is tailored to provide emergency room patients with basic education during "a teachable moment" when they may be most receptive to asthma information. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Patients will be recruited from two New York City urban emergency rooms or inpatient settings and randomized to the intervention or control groups. Intervention patients will receive a protocol focusing on asthma self-management, education, self-efficacy, and social support, with telephone reinforcement for 8 weeks. Control patients will receive standard emergency room education about asthma.</detailed_description>
