	<brief_title>TMC114-C214: Trial of TMC114 Administered With Low Dose Ritonavir (RTV) in HIV-1 Infected Treatment Experienced Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study TMC114-C214 is a randomized (patients are assigned to different treatment groups based on chance), controlled, open-label trial to compare the efficacy (effectiveness), safety and tolerability of TMC114 boosted with low dose ritonavir (RTV) versus Kaletra (LPV)/RTV in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. This research study will look at the safety of TMC114 and effectiveness in reducing the amount of HIV(viral load) in the blood. People included in this study will have received either Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) or Protease Inhibitors (PIs) or both. The duration of the study will be approximately 106 weeks, which includes a 4 to 6 week screening period, 96-week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. TMC114 300mg are orange tablets where 2 tablets are taken by mouth twice a day with 1 tablet of Ritonavir. Kaletra (LPV/RTV) is either a tablet or capsule taken twice a day. The oral capsule contains 133.3 mg LPV, 33.3 mg RTV and the film-coated tablet is available for oral administration in a strength of 200 mg of lopinavir and 50 mg of ritonavir. Dosing for all medication will occur for 96 weeks and you will be randomly assigned to either TMC114 or Kaletra.</detailed_description>
