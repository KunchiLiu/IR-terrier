	<brief_title>Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a worldwide epidemic of diabetes and the number of individuals with diabetes is set to increase further. As individuals with diabetes are at high risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular events, the significant proportion of the cardiovascular disease burden is projected to be among this population. JPAD is a multicenter study with a prospective randomized open, blinded end-point (PROBE) design. The doses administered are aspirin 81 mg/day or 100 mg/day, the latter being enteric-coated Aspirin. The primary objective was to compare the effect of aspirin on atherosclerotic events including cardiovascular events, cerebral vascular event, and other vascular events. We also analyze hemorrhagic events in this RCT.</detailed_description>
