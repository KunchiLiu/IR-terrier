	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of non-ablative (non-cutting) laser therapy, a technique that uses laser energy to try to improve the appearance of the skin. In this study, we are interested in learning how well such a laser works to improve the symptoms of acne. The laser used in this particular study will be the CoolTouch II® laser, manufactured by ICN Photonics, Inc., and has not been FDA-approved for the treatment of acne.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of non-ablative (non-cutting) laser therapy, a technique that uses laser energy to try to improve the appearance of skin. This type of laser treatment creates changes in a layer of the skin called the dermis without causing an open wound in the skin. It is not yet clear how much improvement can be seen with these treatments or exactly how the skin's response causes these improvements. In this study, we are interested in learning how well such a laser works to improve the symptoms of acne. The laser used in this particular study will be the CoolTouch II® laser, manufactured by ICN Photonics, Inc., and has not been FDA-approved for the treatment of acne.</detailed_description>
