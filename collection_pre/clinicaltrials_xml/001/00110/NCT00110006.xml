	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using fludeoxyglucose F 18, may help in learning how well chemotherapy works to kill cancer cells and allow doctors to plan better treatment. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before, during, and after chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying positron emission tomography using fludeoxyglucose F 18 to see how well it works in predicting response to treatment in patients who are receiving rituximab and combination chemotherapy for newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography Using Fludeoxyglucose F 18 in Predicting Response to Treatment in Patients Who Are Receiving Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy for Newly Diagnosed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the positive and negative predictive values of early positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using fludeoxyglucose F 18 in terms of the probability of patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who achieve or do not achieve complete remission, after treatment with 1 course of rituximab and combination chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. - Determine event free and overall survival of patients with an early positive and negative PET scan treated with this regimen. - Determine the predictive value of early PET scan response ratio as a continuous variable in terms of response to therapy (assessed at the end of therapy), disease-free survival, and overall survival, in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate International Prognostic Index score at presentation with early PET scan results and overall outcome in patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate the degree of neutropenia 7 to 10 days after the first course of treatment with rituximab and combination chemotherapy with PET scan response and pre-treatment blood CD34-positive cell concentration in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) IV. Beginning 1 hour later, patients undergo whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Patients also undergo conventional radiographic staging of their disease. Patients then receive standard R-CHOP (or an alternative regimen) comprising rituximab IV over 3-6 hours, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes, and vincristine IV over 5 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 14-21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo repeat ^18FDG-PET scanning between days 7-10 of course 1, between courses 3 and 4, and then at the completion of R-CHOP. Patients also undergo radiographic restaging of their disease between courses 3 and 4 and at the completion of R-CHOP. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
