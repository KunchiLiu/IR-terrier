	<brief_title>The Effect of Folic Acid on Atherosclerosis, Cognitive Performance and Hearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low levels of B vitamins, in particular folate, and high levels of plasma total homocysteine, have been associated with a variety of age-related diseases and disorders, including cardiovascular disease, dementia and hearing impairment. Extra folate, for example in the form of folic acid, is known to decrease the concentrations of plasma total homocysteine. We examined whether 0.8 mg/d folic acid could slow down atherosclerotic progression and the above mentioned age-related processes.</detailed_description>
