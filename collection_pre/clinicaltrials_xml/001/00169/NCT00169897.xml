	<brief_summary>Short term efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation for improving functional capacity and quality of life of chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) patient is well known. However, there is an important gap between the scientific knowledge and the clinical use of pulmonary rehabilitation since a a very small number of patients benefit from this therapeutic intervention. We estimate that less than 1% of the 750 000 canadians suffering from COPD have access to a pulmonary rehabilitation program. We want to study the efficacy of a home-based rehabilitation program as a way to facilitate the access to rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
