	<brief_summary>Epidemiologic studies suggest that low dietary intakes and low plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins and minerals are associated with increased risks of cancer, especially for epidermoid tumors. Patients with stage I or II head and neck cancer have a good prognosis, with a 5-year relative survival of 60% to 90%, depending of the tumor site. However, the benefit of treatment is often compromised by the occurrence of second primary cancers, which develop in 20% of patients during the first 5 years after diagnosis. We conducted a randomized chemoprevention trial among patients with head and neck cancer treated by radiation therapy to determine whether supplementation combining two antioxidants, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, could reduce the incidence of second primary cancers in this patient population (primary objective of the trial). This study was conducted with funds from the NCIC (#008176,004738,013211) and was completed. In this cohort of head and neck cancer patients, we evaluated whether nine potential prognostic serum markers measured at the time of diagnosis were related to recurrence, occurence of second primary cancers and survival. This study was conducted with funds from the NCIC (#018100) and was completed. Presently, we evaluate genetic polymorphisms(GWAS) associated with prognosis (NCIC grant #019502). We also assess the relationship between vitamin D (dietary intake, serum level, and genetic polymorphisms of key vitamin D-related genes) and head and neck long-term outcomes (NCI grant #1R03CA141615-01).</brief_summary>
