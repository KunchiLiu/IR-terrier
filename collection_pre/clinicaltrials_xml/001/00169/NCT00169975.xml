	<brief_summary>A magnetocardiograph (MCG) is a device capable of recording of magnetic fields arising from the electrical activity of the heart with traces similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG). This system was developed as a noninvasive, non-contact diagnostics of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), and especially of lack of oxygen in the heart as in a heart attack. The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of this MCG device for the detection and diagnosis of lack of oxygen of the heart in patients with chest pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of the CMI Magnetocardiograph in Diagnosing Acute Coronary Syndromes in Patients Presenting With High Risk Unstable Angina.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary Artery Disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. The non invasive detection of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS's) remains a clinical challenge. Electrocardiogram (ECG) may only diagnose myocardial infarction in 50 % of the cases. Magnetocardiography is a new and noninvasive method capable of measuring and mapping the magnetic field that is generated during the cardiac cycle. The electric current is affected by ischemic damage, which in turn alters the magnetic field. The magnetic field is not affected by body tissues, unlike the surface current measurements in ECG. Comparisons: The diagnostic accuracy of the CMI-Magnetocardiograph will be compared to that of the ECG in diagnosing High Risk Unstable Angina.</detailed_description>
