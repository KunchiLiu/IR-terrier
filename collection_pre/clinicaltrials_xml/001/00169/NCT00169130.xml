	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ASCT as consolidation in case of bcl-2 overexpression in non previously treated patients aged 60 years or less with low-intermediate risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who responded to ACVBP regimen. Our goal is to obtain a 15% increase of event-free survival at 2 years.</brief_summary>
