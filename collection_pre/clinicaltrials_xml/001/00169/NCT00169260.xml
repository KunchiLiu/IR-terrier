	<brief_title>Proactive Health Intervention for Tobacco Users (Get PHIT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study will test a community-based, tobacco intervention. The project will compare the effects of a proactive, personally-tailored, biologically-based motivational intervention to those of a proactive, generic motivational intervention for smoking cessation. The biologically-based motivational treatment will include feedback on participants' carbon monoxide (CO) exposure (expired CO and estimated carboxyhemoglobin levels), pulmonary functioning assessed via spirometry, and self-reported smoking-related symptoms. All participants will be given equal access to action-oriented treatment.</detailed_description>
