	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease is a frequent neurodegenerative disorder. Genetic forms of the disease have been recently identified. The monogenic form due to parkin mutation is responsible for many familial cases and sporadic forms. However, the relationship between the mutation and the genotype of patients is not fully established. The aim of this study is to compare clinical, metabolic and neuropsychological characteristics obtained in patients with parkin mutation with those of patients without parkin mutation.</brief_summary>
