	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Rituximab After ASCT in High-Risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentric, open-label, randomized clinical study, evaluating the efficacy and the safety of Rituximab After ASCT in patients aged 18 to 59 years with previously untreated High-Risk (aa-IPI 2 or 3 ) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma . The duration of the treatment period is approximately 25 weeks and patients are followed until Death. From 10/99 to 05/03, 476 patients were enrolled. 235 patients were assigned to receive ACE and 241 to ACVBP. Among the 331 patients, in Complete response (CR+CRu) after induction, who received HDC, 269 were randomized (R2) after hematological recovery to receive either rituximab (n=139) or nothing (n=130). The final analysis was performed in June 2005.</detailed_description>
