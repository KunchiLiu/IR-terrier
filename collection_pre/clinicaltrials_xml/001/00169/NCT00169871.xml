	<brief_title>Hs-CRP as Clinical Marker of Inflammatory Atherogenic Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in the developed world. Cholesterol screening has been used as a tool to identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing future coronary events, but almost one-half of patients who develop myocardial infarction have either normal or only moderately increased serum cholesterol concentrations. In the last years, experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that atherosclerosis is not simply a disease of lipid deposits. Rather, there is growing recognition that CHD has an inflammatory component which plays a critical role in the arterial plaque rupture that triggers most episodes of coronary thrombosis. In the last years, C-reactive protein (CRP), an exquisitely sensitive marker of systemic inflammation, has emerged as a powerful predictor of cardiovascular diseases, in particular of CHD, beyond what can be estimated by traditional risk factors. The availability of high-sensitivity (hs) CRP assays has enabled the detection of even low-grade inflammatory responses that have previously been regarded as clinically not meaningful. However, for hs-CRP to make the transition from epidemiological and clinical research to the routine clinical setting, several important issues must be satisfactorily addressed. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to study the applicability of the hs-CRP assay in the assessment of CV risk in daily clinical conditions where hyperlipidemic population with or without CHD are currently evaluated and to evaluate hs-CRP response to statins.</detailed_description>
