	<brief_summary>The gold standard for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the open pyeloplasty. As a minimally invasive alternative, many centers are currently offering laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) as primary therapy for UPJOs. Recent data has shown that laparoscopic pyeloplasty has comparable success rates to open pyeloplasties and produces durable results. The researchers are compiling a registry and database to review outcomes of laparoscopic pyeloplasty patients.</brief_summary>
