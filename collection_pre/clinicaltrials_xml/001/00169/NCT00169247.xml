	<brief_summary>Larynx preservation remains a very challenging approach in patients with larynx/pharynx cancer. A first attempt consisted of induction chemotherapy followed in good responders by irradiation. This approach allowed to preserve 60 % of the larynx without any significant difference in survival. The second attempt consisted of concurrent chemo-irradiation. This approach provided a higher larynx preservation rate but survival remained unchanged and mucosal toxicity was also higher. A third approach is currently under evaluation: induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemo-irradiation in good responders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Radiotherapy With Cetuximab After Induction Chemotherapy for Larynx Preservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At ASCO 2004 there were 3 major presentations issuing an increasing in survival: - the update of the MACH-NC meta-analysis showed that actually only concurrent chemo-irradiation trials found a significantly improved survival (in particular the addition of cisplatinum alone to radiotherapy) - the addition of docetaxel to the cisplatinum-5FU regimen (TPF) when compared with cisplatinum--5FU (PF) - the addition of cetuximab to irradiation On this basis we decided to carry-out a randomized phase II for previously untreated patients requiring a total laryngectomy: All patients after a complete work-up including a CTscan will receive 3 cycles of TPF(T: 75 mg/m², P: 75 mg/m² and 5FU 750 mg/m²). Patients with response over 50 % (endoscopy and CTscan) will be randomized to receive either irradiation (70 Gy) and cisplatinum (100 mg/m² on D1, D22 and D43) or irradiation (70 Gy) with cetuximab (loading dose of 400 mg followed by weekly 250 mg for a total of 8 cycles. Patients with less than 50% decease in tumour volume after TPF, patients with residual or recurrent disease after either RT-CDDP or RT-cetuximab will get salvage total laryngectomy.</detailed_description>
