	<brief_title>Organized Self-management Support for Chronic Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to adapt and pilot test two core elements of an organized care program (systematic telephone outreach and monitoring to improve quality and continuity of pharmacotherapy, and structured psychoeducational group programs focused on patient activation and self-management) in a population-based sample of patients with chronic or recurrent depression. Two forms of group self-management training will be evaluated: a Peer-Led Chronic Disease Self-Management Group (after that developed by Lorig and colleagues) and a Therapist-Led Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Group. Approximately 100 patients with chronic or recurrent depression were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) usual care; 2) phone care management; 3) phone care management plus peer-led self-management group; or 4) phone care management plus therapist-led CBT group. Blinded assessments will examine clinical outcomes (SCL depression score, depression diagnosis by SCID), functional outcomes, and process variables (self-efficacy for managing depression, use of coping strategies) over 12 months. If patients choose not to participate in treatment, reasons for dropout were assessed. The data collected will provide:1) an evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability (including recruitment, intervention uptake and continued participation) of the intervention programs; 2) preliminary evaluation of effectiveness, i.e., the effects of each intervention on patient outcomes and process of care; and 3) information to inform the design and implementation of a full-scale effectiveness trial (refinement of intervention programs and measurement strategy, necessary sample size).</detailed_description>
