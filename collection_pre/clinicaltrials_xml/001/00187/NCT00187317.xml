	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Balance-recovery Specific Falls Prevention Exercise Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity and exercise have been shown to prevent falling in older adults, although the exact mechanisms by which exercise prevents falls is unclear. Compensatory stepping and grasping reactions are frequently used to prevent a fall to the ground following a loss of balance. Age-related impairment in these reactions may be related to an increased risk of falling. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate means for reversing age-related impairment in compensatory stepping and grasping reactions. A training program involving perturbation-evoked reactions will be evaluated. Comparison(s): Balance recovery ability before and after a 6-week training program will be assessed. Performance of the training group will be compared to a control group not receiving stepping and grasping training.</detailed_description>
