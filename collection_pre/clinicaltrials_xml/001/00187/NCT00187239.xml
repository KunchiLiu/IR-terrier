	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if patients implanted with a St. Jude Medical (SJM) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) will benefit by using AutoIntrinsic Conduction Search (AICS) rather than only a programmed AV/PV delay. This study will compare the two methods of programming with respect to intrinsic activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduce Ventricular Pacing in Dual Chamber Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators Using AutoIntrinsic Conduction Search Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patient has been implanted with a dual chamber SJM ICD with AICS for 1 month (± 2 weeks). At the time of enrollment, patient is paced in the right ventricle (RV) ≤25% of the time as determined by the device diagnostics. Patient is medically stable. Patient has evidence of atrioventricular (AV) block (first, second or third degree) such that ventricular pacing would be required as part of the patient's routine management Patient is unable to comply with the followup visits due to geographical, psychological, or any other reasons. Patient is younger than 18 years of age. Patient is pregnant.</criteria>
