	<brief_summary>This is a single center, randomized, investigator-masked study to determine the efficacy and safety of latanoprost and bimatoprost ophthalmic solutions in promoting eyelash growth in patients who have lost their eyelashes due to alopecia areata. These medications are FDA-approved as eyedrops for patients with glaucoma who have been noted to grow longer, darker, and thicker eyelashes with their use. In this study, patients will be asked to apply these solutions to the affected eyelid margins of one eye with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator once a day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Latanoprost and Bimatoprost Solutions in Promoting Eyelash Growth in Patients With Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot, single-center, randomized, investigator-masked study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of latanoprost (Xalatan) ophthalmic solution compared to bimatoprost (Lumigan) ophthalmic solution in patients with eyelash loss due to alopecia areata. This is a collaborative study between the Departments of Dermatology and Ophthalmology at UCSF. Patients will be randomized to receive either latanoprost or bimatoprost. Patients will be instructed to apply latanoprost or bimatoprost to the affected eyelid margins of one eye using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator once a day (similar to the application of eyeliner). The untreated eye will serve as a control. When substantial eyelash growth is noted in the treated eye, patients will be instructed to decrease application to once a week. Patients will be seen every four weeks in the Department of Dermatology. In addition, eyelash growth will be assessed in the Beckman Vision Center where eyelash length will be measured, and photographs will be taken at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Intraocular pressure will be documented at baseline and at each visit to the Beckman Vision Center. The study will be conducted over four months.</detailed_description>
