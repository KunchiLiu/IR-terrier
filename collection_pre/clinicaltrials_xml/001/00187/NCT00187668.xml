	<brief_title>Study Of PHarmacogenetics in Ethnically Diverse Populations (SOPHIE Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DNA and plasma will be used to identify and determine allele frequencies of genetic variants in membrane transporters and other genes relevant to human disease or drug response, including drug metabolizing enzymes, collagen, race/ethnicity, neurovascular disease, asthma/allergy/lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. This phase of the study will serve as the hypothesis-generating phase for future studies by identifying genetic variants and determining allele frequencies among an ethnically diverse cohort of healthy volunteers. Future investigations (separate IRB applications) will attempt to correlate genotypes to phenotypes among this cohort of volunteers. The allele identification and frequency data from this group of healthy volunteers will also be used to design association studies in relevant disease populations. Determine if identified sequence variants are associated with gain or loss of in vitro biologic function using lymphocytes obtained from patients.</detailed_description>
