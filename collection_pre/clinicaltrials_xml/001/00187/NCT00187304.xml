	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare two different regimens of therapy, AVK and ASA (aspirin), in the early postoperative period after aortic valve replacement with SJM Epic™ or SJM Epic™ Supra Porcine Bioprosthetic Heart Valve by establishing the adverse event free survival rate at 3 month post intervention follow-up of the 2 groups(with special focus on thromboembolic events and bleedings).</brief_summary>
