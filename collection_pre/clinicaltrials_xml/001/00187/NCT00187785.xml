	<brief_title>Doctor-Patient Communication in Spanish</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spanish speaking drop-in patients will be consented then randomized to receive care by a native Spanish speaker, an English speaker using a translator, or an English speaker with intermediate Spanish skills using Spanish. After the visit, the researcher will enquire about patient satisfaction, when the next appointment is, whether medication has been changed, and what instructions their provider gave them. Each provider will do a similar questionnaire. A blinded researcher will score a concordance of plans between provider and patient to see if there is a significant difference in retained information between the groups.</detailed_description>
