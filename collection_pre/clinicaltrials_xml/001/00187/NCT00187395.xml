	<brief_summary>Prior to undertaking CHIPS which will be a large and difficult trial, we believe we need to first determine whether clinicians will comply with the interventions of 'less tight' and 'tight' control of dBP, and whether the interventions will result in differences in mean dBP between groups. A pilot will also allow us to confirm the ability of centres to identify eligible women and the willingness of women to join CHIPS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHIPS (Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study): A Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine whether 'less tight' control of mild-moderate non-proteinuric maternal hypertension, aiming for a diastolic blood pressure (dBP) of 100mmHg, can decrease the risks of adverse perinatal outcome without increasing maternal risk compared with 'tight' control, aiming for a dBP of 85mmHg.</detailed_description>
