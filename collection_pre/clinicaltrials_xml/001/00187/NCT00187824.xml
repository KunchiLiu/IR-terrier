	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that bioenergetic failure in human sepsis, related to endocrine, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, is a major determinant of defective host immune responses, increasing disease severity and risk of death. The objectives of this study are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness, and temporal changes in the activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and consequent immune dysfunction in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ failure in the Intensive Care Unit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regulation of Endocrine, Metabolic, Immune and Bioenergetic Responses in Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of this study are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness, and temporal changes in the activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and consequent immune dysfunction in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ failure in the Intensive Care Unit. This study will be undertaken using sequential blood sampling (until ICU discharge) and muscle biopsies (to a maximum of 5) in critically ill patients (a) with or (b) without sepsis plus a comparator group undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. A variety of hormonal, cytokine, immune and mitochondrial measures wil lbe then made to assess whether any relationship exists between alterations in these different pathways, and whether eventual survivors and non-survivors can be distinguished.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group 1: healthy control patients Patients undergoing elective total hip replacement will be eligible for enrollment in Group 1 after written informed consent has been obtained. Only 1 blood sample and 1 fat and muscle biopsy will be taken intraoperatively Group 2: nonseptic, critically ill patients Patients requiring intensive care within 48 hours of admission to hospital from home, for a nonseptic/noninflammatory pathology will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement has been obtained from the closest family member (see Consent below). At enrolment, Group 2 patients must have received mechanical ventilation commencing within 48 hours of admission to intensive care, should be likely to require mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours, and must not fulfil the 2001 International Sepsis Definition Conference criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock Group 3: patients with severe sepsis or septic shock Patients requiring intensive care within 48 hours of admission to hospital from home, and evidence of severe sepsis (organ dysfunction due to infection) or septic shock as defined by the 2001 International Sepsis Definition Conference criteria, will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement has been obtained from their nextofkin. Patients with underlying chronic liver disease are excluded from this group, and will be enrolled separately into Group 4. Group 4: patients with severe sepsis and underlying chronic liver disease Patients requiring intensive care admission, with underlying ChildPugh Class A or B, biopsyproven liver cirrhosis, within 24 h of the onset of severe sepsis (organ dysfunction due to infection) or septic shock as defined by the 2001 International Sepsis Definition Conference criteria), will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement has been obtained from their nextofkin Age &lt;18 years ChildPugh Class C liver disease Chronic dialysisdependent renal failure Hepatitis B or C infection Immunosuppression (e.g. haematological malignancy, neutropenia, HIV infection) Immunosuppressive drug therapy within past 6 months Patient receiving oral or IV steroid therapy for greater than 1 week, within 6 months prior to ICU admission Muscle biopsy contraindicated in presence of coagulopathy (INR &gt;2, platelet count &lt; 30,000)* Nextofkin declines agreement / patient declines consent Patient receiving thyroid hormone therapy prior to ICU admission *This does not exclude enrolment into the study, particularly in the case of Group 4 patients who frequently develop a coagulopathy as part of their underlying liver dysfunction</criteria>
