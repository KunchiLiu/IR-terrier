	<criteria>Males ≥18 years; Written informed consent/authorization; Histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic prostate cancer with documented progression on hormonal therapy (objective progressive disease [PD], new bone lesions, or stable soft tissue or bone lesions with PSA increase); Patients must have either measurable disease or bone metastasis. Patients with measurable disease are preferred; Rising PSA, with a minimum study entry PSA of ≥5 ng/mL; Karnofsky performance status of ≥80%; Life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks; For patients treated with antiandrogens, elevation of PSA must be demonstrated after cessation of antiandrogen treatment; Three lines of hormonal therapy are permitted prior to study entry (antiandrogen withdrawal is not considered as a second hormonal treatment); Serum testosterone level of &lt;50 ng/mL in patients without surgical castration; Patients must have serum potassium levels &gt;4.0 mEq/L and serum magnesium levels &gt;2.0 mg/dL. Concomitant use of any anticancer therapy, except for continued use of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antiandrogens, or bisphosphonates or steroids initiated at least 4 weeks prior to study entry; Concomitant use of any investigational agent, including PCSPES; Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks of study entry; Concomitant use of warfarin (due to a potential drugtodrug interaction with depsipeptide); Major surgery within 2 weeks of study entry; Prior treatment with chemotherapy; Patients with known cardiac abnormalities such as: Congenital long QT syndrome; QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds; Patients who have had a myocardial infarction within 12 months of study entry; Patients who have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) e.g., angina Canadian Class II IV (see Appendix K). In any patient in whom there is doubt, the patient should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present; Patients with an ECG recorded at screening showing evidence of cardiac ischemia (ST depression of ≥2 mm). If in any doubt, the patient should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present; Patients with congestive heart failure that meets NYHA Class II to IV (see Appendix J) definitions and/or ejection fraction &lt;40% by MUGA scan or &lt;50% by echocardiogram and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Patients with a history of sustained VT, VF, Torsade de Pointes, or cardiac arrest unless currently addressed with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD); Patients with hypertrophic cardiomegaly or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior treatment or other causes (in doubt, see ejection fraction criteria above); Patients with uncontrolled hypertension i.e., ≥160/95; Patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmic medication; Concomitant use of medications which may cause a prolongation of QT/QTc (see Appendix D) interval; Concomitant use of medications that are inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP 3A4 (see Appendix E); Clinically significant active infection; Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; Previous extensive radiotherapy involving 30% of bone marrow (e.g., whole of pelvis, half of spine); Clinical or radiological imaging evidence of brain metastasis (computed tomography [CT] or MRI scans are required only if brain metastasis is suspected clinically); Inadequate bone marrow or other organ function, as evidenced by: hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL (transfusions and/or erythropoietin are permitted); absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1.5 x 109 cells/L; platelet count &lt;100 x 109 cells/L; total bilirubin &gt;1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution or &gt;2.0 x ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastases; aspartate transaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) and alanine transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) &gt;2.0 x ULN or &gt;5.0 x ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastases; serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL; Serum potassium levels &lt; 4.0 mEq/L and serum magnesium levels &lt;2.0 mg/dL; Coexistent second malignancy or history of prior malignancy within previous 5 years (excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated curatively); or Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that might prevent the patient from complying with all study procedures.</criteria>
