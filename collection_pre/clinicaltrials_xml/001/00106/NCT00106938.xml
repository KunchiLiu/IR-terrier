	<brief_summary>The study is being conducted to demonstrate the non-inferiority of carotid artery stenting (CAS) using the Emboshield® Embolic Protection System with the Xact® Carotid Stent System to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting Versus Endarterectomy in Asymptomatic Subjects Who Are at Standard Risk for Carotid Endarterectomy With Significant Extracranial Carotid Stenotic Disease (ACT I)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization for ACT 1 employs a 3:1 ratio of CAS versus CEA. A lead-in phase of up to 400 carotid stent subjects will provide investigators experience with the study devices prior to pivotal enrollment.</detailed_description>
