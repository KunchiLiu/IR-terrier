	<brief_title>School- and Home-Based Early Intervention for Toddlers With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism is a condition that affects brain development, often leading to difficulties in social, emotional, and educational functioning. This study will determine whether early intervention can improve such functioning in toddlers with autism. Each treatment session will last 6 months. Children with an autism spectrum disorder will be enrolled in one of two parallel classes and will receive one of two treatments 4 days a week for the duration of the session. Children in each class will receive the same amount and level of intervention, but with a different goal focus. Treatments will be school- and home-based; parents will receive instruction on administering the at-home part of the treatment. The intervention will include environmental engineering, developmental approaches, adaptations of traditional behavioral approaches, and contemporary behavioral approaches that apply principles of applied behavior analysis in more naturalistic teaching frameworks. A series of measures including scales, interviews, and observations will be used to assess the children at baseline, study completion, and 6 months after study completion. The children will be videotaped during the school-based intervention.</detailed_description>
