	<brief_title>Tenofovir DF (Disoproxil Fumarate) in Combination With Emtricitabine in HIV-1 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is as follows: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tenofovir following administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg for 48 weeks in HIV-infected patients experiencing various degrees of renal impairment. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of emtricitabine following administration of emtricitabine 200 mg for 48 weeks in HIV-infected patients experiencing various degrees of renal impairment. - To evaluate the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with emtricitabine in renally-impaired HIV-infected patients. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir and emtricitabine in renally-impaired HIV-infected patients.</detailed_description>
