	<brief_summary>This 3 arm study will compare the safety and efficacy, with regard to reduction of signs and symptoms, of tocilizumab versus placebo in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) currently on MTX therapy, and who have had an inadequate response to prior therapy with an anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent. Patients will be randomized to receive tocilizumab 4mg/kg iv, tocilizumab 8mg/kg or placebo iv, every 4 weeks. All patients will also receive methotrexate 10-25mg/week. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
