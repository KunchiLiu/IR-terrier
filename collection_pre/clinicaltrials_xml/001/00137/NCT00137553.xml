	<brief_summary>Children participating in a study evaluating the efficacy of chloroquine and amodiaquine for the treatment of malaria will, if getting malaria during follow-up, be re-treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in accordance with the recommendations of the National Malaria Programme. To compare the actual efficacy of SP with that in 1995 - 1996 we, the investigators of the Bandim Health Project, will visit these children once a week for 5 weeks. A finger prick blood sample will be collected for a malaria test. Children with malaria during follow-up will be treated according to the guidelines of the Bandim Health Centre.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Re-treatment With Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Bandim Health Project studies the efficacy of different treatment regimens for malaria in children. If the included children during follow-up get malaria again they are, according to the recommendations of the National Malaria Programme, treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). In 1995 - 1996 the efficacy of this re-treatment regimen was evaluated in the same area. To evaluate if treatment with SP is still efficient we want to follow children included in a study comparing treatment with chloroquine and amodiaquine having recrudescent malaria for 35 days following the re-treatment with SP. Children with reappearing parasitaemia will be treated with SP. If accepting to participate in this study the children will be visited once a week and a capillary blood sample will be drawn. The blood sample taken on the day of reappearing parasitaemia in the chloroquine/amodiaquine study will be used as the day 0 blood sample in the SP-study. If the child gets malaria during the follow-up he will be treated according to the guidelines of the Bandim Health Centre. All treatment during follow-up will be free.</detailed_description>
