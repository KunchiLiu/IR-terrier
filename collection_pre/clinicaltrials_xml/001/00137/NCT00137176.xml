	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to determine the changes in gene expression induced by IFNb-1a (Rebif) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) combination therapy in patients with an isolated clinical syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), to identify markers of therapeutic response, and to predict patients' clinical response based on their in vitro response to this combination therapy measured by the gene expression levels in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EARLY IFNb-1a and Atorvastatin Combination Therapy of Isolated Clinical Syndrome Suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disease, characterized pathologically by focal areas of inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and degeneration in the central nervous system. MS follows several different disease courses. Approximately, 90% of patients have a relapsing form of the disease. We propose that atorvastatin (Lipitor) may enhance the immunomodulatory effects of INFb-1a (Rebif) in patients with clinically isolated neurological syndrome suggestive of MS. This combination may be more effective in preventing development of definitive relapsing-remitting MS if administered early in the course of the disease. The study will identify markers of disease activity that are selectively affected by this combination therapy. Identified markers may be used in future clinical trials to predict patient's clinical response and to monitor the response to treatment as a secondary outcome measure.</detailed_description>

Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 05.5 18 to 60 years of age At least one relapse in previous 12 months Patients with a diagnosis of clinically definitive relapsingremitting (RR) MS, secondary progressive, or primary progressive MS. Patients who have ever been treated with mitoxantrone, cytoxan, cyclophosphamide, or total lymphoid irradiation (TLI). Patients treated with IFNb1a, IFNb1b, glatiramer acetate, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), plasma exchange, methotrexate, or azathioprine in the previous 3 months. Patients treated with intravenous or oral steroids within 30 days prior to baseline MRI. Patients who have been treated with statins in the previous 3 months. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Patients with a history of severe cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or renal disease. Abnormal baseline blood tests including alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice the upper limit of normal</criteria>
