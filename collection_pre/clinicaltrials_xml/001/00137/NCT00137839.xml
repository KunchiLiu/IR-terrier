	<brief_title>Erlotinib in Women With Previously Untreated Adenocarcinoma of the Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will start taking Tarceva daily by mouth on Day 1 and will continue taking this medication daily at home, until participation in the study ends. Every 28 days (one cycle) while the patient is taking Tarceva, they will be examined in the outpatient clinic (blood test and physical examination) and the doctor will determine if they should continue taking Tarceva. After every two cycles of treatment (every 8 weeks) standard radiological testing (CT scans, MRIs, and/or x-rays) of the cancer site(s) will be done to assess the response to the Tarceva treatment. While the patient is on this study and at the end of the study, the patient will undergo blood and urine tests, medical history evaluation, physical exams including measures of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiration), bone scans, tumor biopsy sample, and various radiological tests to monitor the cancer and the patients health. The length of time on the study depends upon how the cancer responds to Tarceva and whether or not the patient experiences unacceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
