	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine what effects (good and bad) bevacizumab and temozolomide have on patients with neuroendocrine tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab in Combination With Temozolomide in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive temozolomide orally once daily for one week, followed by a one-week rest period. This one-week on/one week off schedule will continue for the duration of treatment unless significant side effects develop. Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously every other week. After eight weeks (two cycles), a CT scan will be performed to see how treatment affected tumor growth. Bactrim, an antibiotic, and acyclovir, an antiviral medicine, will be given in order to help prevent infection. Blood tests will be done every other week to evaluate any side effects. Once the study has been completed, a physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, and CT scan will be performed. Patients will remain on the study as long as they continue to receive benefit from the treatment and there are no serious side effects.</detailed_description>
