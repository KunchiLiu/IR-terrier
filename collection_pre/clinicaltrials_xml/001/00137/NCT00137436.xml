	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate Patients must have progressive hormonerefractory prostate cancer (HRPC): patients must have undergone primary hormone treatment (e.g. orchiectomy or gonadotropin releasing hormone analog with or without antiandrogens).
