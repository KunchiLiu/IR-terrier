	<brief_summary>Three protocols are used to treat ectopic pregnancies: medical treatment by methotrexate, conservative surgery or radical surgery. There are no data about subsequent fertility except in a cohort study. The investigators propose to evaluate the true subsequent fertility with a follow-up of 2 years, in a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first group includes non active ectopic pregnancies defined by score or algorithm. In this case, we propose a randomized controlled trial between medical and conservative surgery. In all others clinical situations, we proposed surgery treatment. In a randomized controlled trial we compare conservative versus radical treatment. The patients are followed-up during 2 years with phone contact every 6 months.</detailed_description>
