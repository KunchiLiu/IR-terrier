	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug OSI-774 is less toxic and potentially as good as or better than standard chemotherapy drugs, when given to subjects with non-small cell lung cancer, who are 70 years of age or older.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of OSI-774 (Tarceva) in Previously Untreated Elderly Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive OSI-774 once daily without interruption. There are no pre-determined number of cycles or planned dose interruptions. For the purposes of evaluation, toxicity and efficacy, a four week (28 day period) will be considered 1 cycle. Patients will continue to receive OSI-774 until they develop progressive disease, unacceptable side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study. Patients will have radiographic evaluations after every two cycles of therapy. After cycle 2, patients will also be evaluated by FDG-PET scanning. Patients will also be asked to fill out a Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) on the first day of each cycle. Bloodwork will also be performed on day 1 of each cycle as well as at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
