	<brief_title>Post Burn Pruritus Study in Patients Undergoing Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clear mechanism or cause for pruritus in patients recovering from burn has not been delineated. While the exact mechanisms/pathways for itching are currently unclear, histamine antagonism appears to be the most popular treatment. Whether histamine antagonism works predominantly via peripheral inhibition or central sedation is uncertain. By treating another intermediary in the pruritus cascade, it may be possible that an alternate treatment could be used while eliminating some of the unwanted side effects of antihistamine at the same time.</detailed_description>
