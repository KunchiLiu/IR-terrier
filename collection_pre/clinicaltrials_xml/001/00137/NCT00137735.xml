	<brief_title>Gabapentin for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A variety of treatment options exist at present for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) with no universal agreement. Recent reports suggested that untreated CTS might improve or remain stationary. In this respect, treatment directing towards symptom suppression alone may have a role in the initial management of CTS. Gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl]-cyclohexaneacetic acid; Neurontin, Pfizer) is an effective drug for treatment of neuropathic pain and has been reported to be effective in case series for the treatment of CTS with relatively benign side effects profile. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of CTS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sensory symptoms over median nerve distribution for more than three months. Confirmatory electrophysiologic results defined as prolonged median nerve distal motor latencies (DML) &gt; 4 ms or medianulnar palmer sensory latency differences &gt; 0.5 ms. Patients with evidence of severe CTS: fibrillation potentials or reinnervation on needle examination of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle or clinical examination showing wastage of the thenar muscles. (These patients were referred for surgical decompression on presentation.) Clinical or electrophysiological evidence of accompanying conditions that could mimic CTS or interfere with its evaluation, such as proximal median neuropathy, cervical radiculopathy, or significant polyneuropathy. Known epilepsy. Patients who have received previous steroid injection or oral steroid therapy for CTS.</criteria>
