	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine what effects (good and bad) bevacizumab (Avastin) and docetaxel (Taxotere), used in combination, have on metastatic gastric and esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avastin and Taxotere for Esophagogastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously in an outpatient clinic once a week, every other week. Docetaxel will also be administered intravenously in the outpatient clinic once a week for three out of four weeks. Blood tests and vital signs will be performed weekly. After the first eight weeks of therapy a CT scan will be performed to determine and assess the progress of the disease. If therapy is continued, radiological procedures will be performed at week 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Treatment will be given for a minimum of 8 weeks, as long as the patient does not experience unacceptable side effects. Chemotherapy will continue for a year and a half as long as the cancer is responding and there are no unacceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
