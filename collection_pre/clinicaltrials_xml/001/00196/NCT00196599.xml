	<brief_summary>In 1999, when initiating antiretroviral treatment in HIV infected adults, a triple combination with protease inhibitor is recommended. Such therapy induces side effects and the number of pills may reduce therapy adherence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a once daily FTC, ddI, efavirenz combination, in HIV patients with CD4 cell count over 100/mm3, antiretroviral naive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study on Once Daily FTC, ddI, Efavirenz Combination in Antiretroviral Naive HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1999, when initiating antiretroviral treatment in HIV infected adults, a triple combination with protease inhibitor is recommended. Side effects of this products and the number of pills may induce a lower adherence, and thus a lower efficacy. 40 patients with a CD4 count over 100/mm3, a HIV RNA over 5,000 copies/ml and antiretroviral naive, take the once daily combination of FTC, ddI, efavirenz during 24 weeks. The primary end-point is the viral success maintained from 12 weeks until 24 weeks. Secondary end-point is the adherence to the association and safety. The trial is prolonged during a total of 72 weeks.</detailed_description>
