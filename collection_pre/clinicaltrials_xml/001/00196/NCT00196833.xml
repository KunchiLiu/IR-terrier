	<detailed_description>Breast cancer is the most common cancer malignancy in women of childbearing age after the age of 25 years. Since the incidence of breast cancer under the age of 40 is increasing, and women tend to delay pregnancy into later reproductive years, the coincidence of pregnancy and breast cancer is increasing. About 1 in 1,000 pregnancies is complicated by breast cancer. Nevertheless, little is known about the right therapy for the mother and the unborn child. We are therefore carrying out a trial, collecting prospective and retrospective data about pregnant women, with histological confirmed breast cancer. Data on the biology of the tumour and placenta tissues is also collected. The anonymous data is collected in a database.</detailed_description>
