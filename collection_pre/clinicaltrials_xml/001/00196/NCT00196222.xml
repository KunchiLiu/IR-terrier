	<detailed_description>The ablation of AV nodal reentry tachycardia with radiofrequency (RF) energy delivering catheters is a standard procedure and in experienced EP laboratories, the safety and efficacy of this approach is very high. However, the potential complication of higher degree AV conduction block, requiring in some instances implantation of a pacemaker, is a major drawback of this approach. We want to compare in this randomized study the safety and efficacy of standard RF ablation with the cryo-ablation technique. This relatively new technique is thought to offer more safety concerning higher degree AV conduction block.</detailed_description>
