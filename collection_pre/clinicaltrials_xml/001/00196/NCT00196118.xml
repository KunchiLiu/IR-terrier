Patient has given informed consent. Patient is less than 18 years. Patient has a preexisting filter Patient had indications for a permanent filter at the time of the initial evaluation. Patient has uncontrollable coagulopathy. Patient has a short life expectancy &lt; 6 months. Patient has metastatic malignancy. Patient has a vena cava diameter over 30 mm, measured by vena cava sizing catheters. Patient has a contrast allergy that cannot be adequately premedicated. Patient is at risk of septic embolism. Patient has sepsis. Patient has a hypersensitivity to any of the components of the GT filter, specifically cobalt, nickel, and chromium. Patient has impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 2.0).
