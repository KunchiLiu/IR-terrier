	<brief_title>Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Ovarian Failure With Goserelin in BC Patients (ZORO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Prospective, randomized, open phase II trial Schedule: All patients will receive an anthracycline-containing polychemotherapy. Patients randomized to Goserelin will receive their first injection of 3.6 mg at least 2 weeks before start of chemotherapy. Goserelin will be given as a subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall every 4 weeks (28 ± 3 days) until the end of the last chemotherapy cycle. Primary objective: •To increase the percentage of patients with normal ovarian function at 6 months after application of (neo)adjuvant, anthracycline-containing polychemotherapy in parallel with Goserelin compared to chemotherapy alone. Secondary objectives: To compare the two treatment groups regarding - Compliance to treatment - Toxicity - Quality of life - Menopausal Symptoms Score - Ovarian function at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months - Duration until recovery of regular menstrual period - Pregnancy rate</detailed_description>
