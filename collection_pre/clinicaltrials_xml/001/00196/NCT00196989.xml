To be eligible for Randomization into the trial, a subject must satisfy all of the following glycemic criteria: HbA1c level via central laboratory at the prescreening visit If HbA1c ≥ 8.0% but ≤ 10.0%: subject may proceed to Randomization; If HbA1c ≥ 7.8% but &lt; 8.0%, subject not eligible to proceed, but may be retested once to establish eligibility (or lack thereof). If HbA1c level ≥ 8.0% upon retest, subject is eligible to proceed; otherwise they should be withdrawn. If HbA1c &lt; 7.8%, subject not eligible to proceed (no retest allowed). FPG level via central laboratory at the prescreening visit must be &lt; 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L). FPG may be retested within a week to confirm eligibility (or lack thereof).

Males and females who are 18 to 70 years of age inclusive at the time of Screening. If female, eligible to enter and participate in this study: If of nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant (tubal ligation), including any female who is postmenopausal [&gt;1 year without menstrual period]); or, If of childbearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at Screening (serum), at Randomization (urine) and: Has a male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual partner for that female subject, or Uses doublebarrier methods of contraception; condoms with the use of caps (with spermicide) and IUDs are acceptable, or Uses hormonal contraceptives (oral, depots, patches etc) with double barrier methods of contraception as outlined above, or Abstains from sexual intercourse, or Is with a same sex partner and does not participate in bisexual activities where there is any risk of pregnancy. Body Mass Index (BMI): ≥25 and ≤40 kg/m² and weigh at least 50 kg at Screening. If subject is a smoker, must be able to abstain while in clinic at each visit. Subject has given full written informed consent prior to any study related procedures are performed. Exclusion criteria: Metabolic Disease including: Diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus Uncorrected thyroid dysfunction.
