	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of two different approaches for conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation, the non-invasive one (external electrical cardioversion) and the invasive one (catheter ablation).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardioversion vs. Catheter Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized study compares two treatment strategies in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion vs. catheter ablation. Cardioversion is a low risk standard treatment option for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. However, mid- and long term efficacy (regarding the maintenance of sinus rhythm) is low. Catheter ablation is an invasive treatment which has been reported to result in up to 60-70% of patients in stable sinus rhythm. However, it is a potentially dangerous invasive procedure with potentially fatal complications. Comparison: External cardioversion vs. catheter ablation</detailed_description>
