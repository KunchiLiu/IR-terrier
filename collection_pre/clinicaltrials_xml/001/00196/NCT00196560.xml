	<criteria>skeletally mature patients less than 30 years of age sustained an acute, firsttime, traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder as defined by; i. Mechanism of abduction, external rotation ii. Sudden pain in the shoulder iii. Manipulative reduction required or iv. Radiograph documenting a dislocated joint willing to participate in followup for at least two years incompetent or unwilling to consent inability or unwillingness to comply with rehabilitative protocol or required followup assessments previous instability of the affected shoulder significant associated fracture (exception Hill Sachs or Bankart lesions) concomitant ipsilateral upper extremity injuries which may affect the patient's ability to participate in, or benefit from, a rehabilitative program a history of significant ligamentous laxity or demonstrated multidirectional instability of the contralateral shoulder neurovascular compromise of the affected limb a medical condition making the patient unable to wear a brace or sling</criteria>
