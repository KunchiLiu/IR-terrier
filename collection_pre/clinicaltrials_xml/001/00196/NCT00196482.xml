	<brief_summary>Double-blind randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of two human milk fortifiers on acid-base status and longitudinal growth and weight gain in preterm infants. Two different compositions are tested, main difference is in electrolyte composiiton.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Milk Fortifiers and Acid-Base Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups each consisting of 15 infants with a birth weight below 2000g are studied.randomization is startified by three birth weigth classes (&lt;1000g, 1000-1500g,1500 - 2000g) human milk fortifier is introduced in two steps after oral feeding is achieved. two acid-base status and electrolyte concentrations are measured. when metabolic acidosis, defined as BE &lt; -6 mmol/l, occurs fortifier feeding is stopped, and after a wash-out period of three days the alternative product is used.again, occurence of metabolic acidosis, need for oral bicarbonate and effect on longitudinal growth an weight gain are registered.</detailed_description>
