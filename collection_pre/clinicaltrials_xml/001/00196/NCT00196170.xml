	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Radiofrequency- vs. Cryo-Ablation for Typical Isthmus-Dependent Atrial Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized study compares two energy sources for the catheter based ablation of typical isthmus-dependent atrial flutter: The (standard) radiofrequency (RF) ablation technique and the cryo-ablation technique. The RF ablation of typical atrial flutter has become a standard approach with very high curing rates and low complication incidence. However, ablation with RF is painful since the underlying cardiac tissue heats up (up to 70-80°C inside the tissue) and especially the target of ablation in typical atrial flutter, the so-called cavo-tricuspid isthmus, is a very pain-receptive area. Cryo-ablation, which destroys tissue by freezing it down to -80 to -90°C, is thought to be less painful or even painless with the same efficacy than RF ablation. The acute and long term (6 months follow-up, non-invasive) efficacy and safety is the combined endpoint.</detailed_description>
