	<brief_title>HIV Immune and Virological Responses Following the Administration of IL-2 Either Alone or Combined to ALVAC-HIV 1433 and HIV Lipopeptides in Patients Treated Early With HAART During Primary Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-specific immune responses are preserved in patients treated early during primary infection. The trial evaluated whether the addition to HAART of IL-2 alone or combined with an immunization procedure might enhance HIV immune responses and improve viral control after HAART discontinuation.Patients treated with HAART are randomized to 3 arms:arm1 HAART alone; arm2 with 5 cycles of IL-2 at wk0 ,8 ,16 ,24 and 32;arm3 4 injections of Alvac-HIV 1433 and LIPO-6T at wk0,4,8 followed by 3 cycles of IL-2 at w 16, 24 and 32. HAART is stopped at wk 40 in patient with undetectable plasma viral load. Viral loads and HIV-specific responses are monitored during the therapeutic period and after HAART interruption until w52. HAARTis rei-initiated with viral failure.</detailed_description>
