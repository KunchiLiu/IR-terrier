	<brief_summary>This study is designed to test an incidental finding of a previous trial in which post hoc analysis showed that the rate of intensive care newborns requiring mechanical ventilation was lower in the group receiving heparin with the continuous infusion as compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
