Will have a serum phosphorus level &gt;1.76 mmol/L(5.50 mg/dL) after 2 weeks washout from their usual phosphate binder. Will have serum calcium measurement adjusted for albumin within the range (2.102.60 mmol/L (8.4010.40 mg/dL) following 2 weeks washout from their usual phosphate binder. Willing to maintain the prescribed sevelamer or calcium acetate for the duration of the study. Considered compliant with phosphate binders and dialysis. On a stable doses of medication to treat hyperparathyroidism (Vitamin D or its analogues or calcimimetic agents) for the month prior to screening.
