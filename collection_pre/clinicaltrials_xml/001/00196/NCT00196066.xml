	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a vascular stent to maintain an open iliac (leg) artery. The Zilver Vascular Stent is made of nitinol, a flexible metal with a long history of use in medical devices. The stent self-expands once inside the artery where it is intended to hold the vessel wall open. Within a few weeks, a layer of cells will grow over the stent helping to hold it in place.</brief_summary>
