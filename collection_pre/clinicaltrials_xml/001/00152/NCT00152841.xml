	<brief_summary>Hypothesis:In patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease diagnosed with mild or moderate anaemia: 1. iron supplementation will increase disease activity and oxidative stress 2. the addition of antioxidant vitamin will reduce this detrimental effect</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Iron and Vitamin E Supplementation on Disease Activity in Patients With Either Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To maintain site/extent of disease and medication consistent among groups, the design is a double blind crossover placebo-controlled trial. 1. If mild anaemia, patients are randomized to 300 mg of ferrous fumarate or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of washout period after which patients will crossover the opposite treatments for another 4 weeks. 2. If moderate anaemia, patients will receive 600 mg of ferrous fumarate for 10 weeks. They are randomized to either vitamin E (800 IU) or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of washout period after which patients will crossover the opposite treatments for another 4 weeks</detailed_description>
