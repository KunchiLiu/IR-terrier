	<brief_summary>Our previous data demonstrated that premature infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide at birth had improved neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years corrected age. We now wish to determine whether this benefit continues through school age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up at School-age of Children Who Participated in the Efficacy Study of Nitric Oxide for Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two questionnaires (truncated versions of previously validated surveys), one for parent and another for teacher, for which written consent was previously obtained are being sent to parents. The teacher questionnaires will be delivered via parents. A clinic visit will accompany age appropriate neurodevelopmental examination, administration of the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM) survey, and hearing and visual screening exams (if appropriate).</detailed_description>
