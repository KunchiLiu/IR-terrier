	<brief_summary>Experimentally high dose of hyperoncotic human serum albumin improve neurological recovery after head injury reduce cerebral edema and normalize apparent diffusion coefficient of water after ischemia reperfusion. The main hypothesis is that early administration of hyperoncotic serum albumin is able to reduce intracranial pressure for several days after severe head injury and thus reduce mortality and morbidity.</brief_summary>
