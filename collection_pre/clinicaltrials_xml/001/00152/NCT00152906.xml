	<brief_summary>A minority of patients with colorectal liver metastases and hepatobiliary cancer (primary liver cancer) are candidates for surgery, but there are no curative treatment options for these patients. Their median survival time is 3 to 12 months. Stereotactic radiation (SRT) (highly conformal radiotherapy (CRT)) is a treatment option for these patients with unresectable liver cancer, now possible due to improvements in our ability to localize and immobilize liver tumors and an improved understanding of the partial liver volume tolerance to radiation. SRT should permit liver tumors to be treated to tumorcidal doses while sparing the uninvolved liver, decreasing the risk of treatment related normal tissue toxicity. With such conformal radiation, it is possible to deliver radiation in fewer fractions than traditionally required, which should be more convenient for patients. In this study, CRT will be delivered during shallow breathing or breath hold to minimize organ motion due to breathing, decreasing the volume of normal liver that must be irradiated.</brief_summary>
