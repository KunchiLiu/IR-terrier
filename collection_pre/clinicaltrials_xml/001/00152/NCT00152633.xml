	<brief_summary>Essential hypertension is commonly associated with impaired endothelial function. The retinal vasculature is morphologically and functionally related to the cerebral vessels because of the common origin from the internal carotid artery. A recent study in hypertensive patients demonstrated that endothelial function of the retinal vasculature is impaired in hypertensive patients and that it can be restored by treatment with an AT1-receptor antagonist. It is not clear whether this effect is due to blood pressure lowering or whether this is a blood pressure independent effect. The present randomized, double blind study with a cross over design addresses this issue by comparing the effects of losartan and metoprolol on retinal endothelial function in patients with essential hypertension.</brief_summary>
