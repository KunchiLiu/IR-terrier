	<brief_summary>This study is based on previous observation that, in men with localized prostate cancer, non-cancerous prostate tissue is hypoxic, and on the known contribution of hypoxia to the progression of cancer. Patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 10ng/ml and who have given informed consent will have oxygen measurements of the prostate and peri-prostatic tissue taken with the Eppendorf electrode at the time of biopsy. The oxygenation of normal prostate tissue will be compared to that of cancerous prostate tissue. In men with negative biopsies, the prostate tissue oxygen measurements will be compared with the peri-prostatic tissue oxygen measurements.</brief_summary>
