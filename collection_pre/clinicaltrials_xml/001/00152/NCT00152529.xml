	<detailed_description>Our study goal is to develop a prototype combination primary care-web based depression intervention for young adults ages 18-24years in urban community and university settings. The content development will include: (1) two brief (15 minutes) primary care counseling sessions, (2) one introductory web based module, (3) four web-based cognitive behavior teaching modules, (4) three web-based modules discussing relationship building skills (IPT), and (5) a final web module discussing self-recognition, evidence-based treatment, and stigma. Eight young adult volunteers will evaluate the program in three loops of evaluation and revision in a modified focus group approach. This protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins Joint Committee on Clinical Investigations. Primary Outcomes: The primary outcome variables relate to the functionality and acceptability of the intervention. These variables include readability, ease of understanding, acceptability, and helpfulness of each component of the intervention, and a global rating of each Secondary Outcomes: Process measures (time on site, exercise completion), outcomes (mood and intermediate outcomes-social adjustment, dysfunctional thinking), and knowledge and opinions of current treatments for depression. These data will be helpful in planning for a future Focus groups of 5-10 individuals have been used successfully to provide initial product evaluations or to develop general themes in attitude research. Summary statistics will be collected.</detailed_description>
