	<brief_summary>Microvascular dysfunctions are critical events in several diseases including diabetes. This study will develop a methodology for microvascular investigation in human skin. The purpose of the study is to investigate the physiological response of the cutaneous microcirculation to physical, thermal, mechanical or chemical stimulations.</brief_summary>
