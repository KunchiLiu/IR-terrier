	<brief_summary>Surgical resection of the affected liver offers the best chance for disease-free survival in patients with Hepatoma (HCC). Unfortunately, most hepatoma patients present with disease which is multi-focal and thus not resectable. Fewer than 15% of HCC patients are resectable. The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to selectively administer a dose of radioactive material directly to neoplastic tissue in the liver. Systemic therapy is largely ineffective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Non-Randomized Study of Internal Radiation Therapy to the Liver in Patients With Primary Liver Cancer for Whom Surgery is Not Possible.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Objectives include: - Determine the proportion of patients with HCC in whom the treatment plan can be completed - Evaluate the response to therapy - Evaluate toxicities and adverse experiences associated with TheraSphere treatment - Evaluate survival time</detailed_description>
