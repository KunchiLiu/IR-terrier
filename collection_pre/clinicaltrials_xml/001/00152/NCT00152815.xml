	<criteria>Baseline liver biopsy with macrovesicular fatty degeneration with inflammation (lobular or portal), with or without Mallory bodies, hepatocyte damage, and/or fibrosis diagnostic of NAFLD Convincing evidence of negligible alcohol consumption (&lt; 20 grams of ethanol per day) obtained from a detailed history, confirmed by at least one close relative If hyperlipidemia or diabetes, stable drug regimen required for the 6 months prior to and during the study Willingness to maintain stable weight and normal exercise program for the duration of the study, if randomized to vitamin E or betaine Liver disease of other etiology diagnosed as per routine medical investigation (e.g., chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune chronic hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or genetic liver disease such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, or biliary obstruction) Complications of liver disease such as recurrent variceal bleeding, resistant ascites, spontaneous portosystemic encephalopathy, or bacterial peritonitis Concurrent medical illness contraindicating a liver biopsy, history of unexplained bleeding, hemophilia or abnormal coagulation results as per routine laboratory workup or other reason judged by the hepatologist to contraindicate a percutaneous liver biopsy Medications known to precipitate steatohepatitis (corticosteroids, high dose estrogens, methotrexate, amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, spironolactone, sulfasalazine, naproxen, oxacillin or ampinovire) in the 6 months prior to entry Antioxidant vitamin supplementation, ursodeoxycholic acid, or any other experimental drug 6 months prior to study entry Pregnant or lactating</criteria>
