	<brief_title>The Effect of Sirolimus on the Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The controlled clinical trial held in NTUH in 2001 revealed that the bioavailability of tacrolimus when combined with sirolimus is lower than that reported in the literature where tacrolimus was not combined with sirolimus. To determine if the difference was due to the drug interaction between sirolimus and tacrolimus, a controlled clinical trial was proposed. The purpose of this study is to understand whether the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus is influenced by the concurrent use of sirolimus.</detailed_description>
