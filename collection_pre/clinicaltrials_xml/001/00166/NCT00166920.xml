	<brief_summary>All images in this study were acquired on a 1.5 T Sonata whole body scanner (Siemens Medical Inc., Erlangen, Germany) using 2D multi-echo gradient echo/spin echo sequence and 2D single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging sequence plus intravenous magnetic susceptibility contrast medium. The quantitative estimates and mapping of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization were calculated and plotted in all subjects.</brief_summary>
