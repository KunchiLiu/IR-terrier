	<brief_summary>In patients with coronary artery disease and a LDL-C level between 2.5 mmol/L and 5.0 mmol/L on a stable (&gt; 4 weeks) statin starting dose (simvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg), investigate what the LCL-C lowering efficacy is of doubling the statin dose (to 40 mg simvastatin or 20 mg atorvastatin) versus a combination tablet of ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg once daily for 12 weeks. It is postulated that more patients reach their LDL-C treatment goal with the combination tablet compared to doubling the starting dose. Furthermore, the effect of both treatment regimens on other lipid parameters, safety and LDL-subfractions will be measured.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with simvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg were randomized to (1) double statin dose (to 40 mg simvastatin or 20 mg atorvastatin) or (2) switch to a combination tablet of ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg once daily for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is male or female 18 years of age. Patient is on a stable daily statin starting dose for the past 4 weeks of either: atorvastatin 10 mg or; simvastatin 20 mg lipid values while on statin monotherapy treatment: LDLC level of &gt; 2.5 mmol/L to * 5.0 mmol/L, triglycerides &lt; 4.0 mmol/L and total cholesterol &lt; 7.0 mmol/L. Patient with established coronary artery disease such as stable angina; history of myocardial infarction; history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PTCA with or without stent placement); coronary stenosis on angiography; history of unstable angina or nonQ wave myocardial infarction; history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG); positive MIBI scan. Patients have to be in a stable medical condition. Patients in whom cholesterol lowering medication regime has changed in the previous 4 weeks. Patients who have been treated with any other investigational drug within 3 months of Visit 1. Patients who are pregnant or lactating. Any condition or situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose a risk to the patient or interfere with participation in the study.</criteria>
