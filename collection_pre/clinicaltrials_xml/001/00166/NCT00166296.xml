	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Escitalopram for Prevention of Depression Induced by Peg-Interferon in Hepatitis C Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C is a prevalent condition, and the main cause of chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis and cancer. Nowadays, interferon-alfa in combination with ribavirin is the main treatment option for this condition. In the last years, interferon molecule has been modified in order to improve tolerance into pegylated interferon. Interferon-alfa has been associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric side effects, especially major depression (up to 25% of the cases), which is one of the main concerns about using this treatment. In fact, major depression is one of the main reasons of treatment withdrawal and treatment failure. Major depression induced by interferon-alfa can be successfully treated with antidepressants, but we don't know if antidepressants can also prevent the development of major depression, and if this can be a safe intervention. In the literature, there is only one controlled trial about this issue, in cancer patients, and some open studies in hepatitis C. In order to evaluate the efficacy, and safety, of an antidepressant (escitalopram) for preventing peginterferon's induced depressive episodes in patients with chronic hepatitis C, we have designed this 14-weeks placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Study interventions will be started two weeks before peginterferon + ribavirin's treatment onset. Subjects included in the study will be patients with chronic hepatitis C who are going to be treated with peginterferon-alfa2a + ribavirin, and without mental disorders requiring active psychotropic treatment. The main variables studied will be the appearance of a major depressive episode, following Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria, and the total score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, along three assessment points at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment with interferon. There will also be a follow-up period of up to 6 months after treatment with interferon is completed.</detailed_description>
