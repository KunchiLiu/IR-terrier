	<brief_summary>Breast cancer can cause focal temperature increase on the breast skin due to vasodilatation mediated by NO secretion from cancer cells. Our study is to evaluate this situation and to assess the diagnostic efficacy of infrared imaging (thermography)on breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Infrared Imaging on Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant breast neoplasms can secrete NO to induce focal vasodilatation and increased blood flow and angiogenesis to the tumor, thus increase the focal temperature, which can be evaluated by breast thermography (infrared imaging). We will evaluate the efficacy of infrared imaging for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, and if infrared imaging can effectively differentiate malignant from benign breast dieases and the sensitivity, specificity, false-negative rate will also be estimated.</detailed_description>
