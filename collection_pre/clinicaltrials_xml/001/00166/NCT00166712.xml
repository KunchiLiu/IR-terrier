	<brief_summary>This is an open label, single-center, randomized phase IV pilot study of steroid and calcineurin inhibitor avoidance in renal transplant recipients. All patients will receive two doses of alemtuzumab to achieve peripheral T-cell depletion. Intravenous glucocorticoids will be administered prior to alemtuzumab administration to limit cytokine release syndrome in association with this monoclonal antibody, and continued for the first two days post-transplant. Thereafter, steroids will not be used for immunosuppression. All transplant recipients will be started on oral immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) prior to transplant. Pretransplant, these patients will be randomized to receive, in addition, either tacrolimus (Tac) or sirolimus. After six months, patients in the tacrolimus arm who do not experience rejection will be randomized to continue on tacrolimus or to be converted to the combination of sirolimus and MMF. Individuals in this arm of the study who do not experience acute rejection, and demonstrate evidence of donor specific hyporesponsiveness at 9 months post-transplant (those staying on Tac + MMF) or 3 months post-conversion (those converted from Tac + MMF to sirolimus + MMF) will be weaned to MMF monotherapy. Individuals in the sirolimus + MMF arm who do not experience acute rejection and demonstrate evidence of donor specific hyporesponsiveness at 6 months post-transplant will be weaned to MMF monotherapy.</brief_summary>
