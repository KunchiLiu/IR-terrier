	<brief_summary>Melasma is an acquired discoloration of the skin characterized by brown patches. Chemical peels using agents such as Jessner's solution and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) are commonly used to treat melasma. A chemical peel involves applying the peeling agent to the skin for a short period. The skin will peel similar to a sunburn, and moisturizers are applied to the skin. Although both agents are well-accepted, there have been no good comparisons of the two agents. The purpose of this study is determine if there is a difference in the effectiveness of these two agents.</brief_summary>
