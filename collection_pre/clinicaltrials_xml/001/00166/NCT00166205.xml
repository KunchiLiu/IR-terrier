	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of The Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) in the Treatment of Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment of morbidly obese patients is considered a reasonable option for achieving weight loss when more conservative measures, such as diet and exercise have failed. Not only can weight loss be achieved, but also reduction / resolution of a patient's co-morbidities associated with excess weight. Adjustable gastric banding provides a less invasive, reversible bariatric surgery option. The SAGB has been commercially available outside the United States for this indication since 1996. Commercial availability has led to extensive literature supporting the safety and effectiveness of the SAGB. Given the available literature, a prospective, single arm, multicenter, study in a heterogeneous population of morbidly obese subjects in the U.S. is being conducted.</detailed_description>
