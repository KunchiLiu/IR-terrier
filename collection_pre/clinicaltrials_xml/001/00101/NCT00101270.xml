	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oxaliplatin when given together with irinotecan in treating young patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Oxaliplatin may help irinotecan kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving oxaliplatin together with irinotecan may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan in Treating Young Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when administered with irinotecan in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients. II. Correlate UGT and BCRP genotype with the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.</detailed_description>
