	<brief_summary>This study is not being conducted in the United States. Key long-term clinical studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes should try to achieve overall blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to placebo in lowering overall blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated with drug therapy to lower their blood sugar and whose blood glucose levels are close to normal.</brief_summary>
