	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of celecoxib may prevent or treat head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying celecoxib to see how well it works compared to placebo in preventing head and neck cancer in patients with oral leukoplakia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the clinical efficacy of celecoxib vs placebo, in terms of inducing regression of oral leukoplakia lesions, in patients with hyperplastic or dysplastic oral leukoplakia. Secondary - Determine the effect of this drug in modulating multiple intermediate biomarkers (e.g., COX-2, PPARγ, or PPARδ) in normal and hyperplastic or dysplastic oral epithelia of these patients. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the cost-effectiveness of this drug as a chemopreventative agent in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Patients are stratified according to the pathology of the leukoplakia lesion (dysplasia vs hyperplasia). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 months. All patients undergo biopsy. Patients then cross-over to the opposite treatment arm for 3 months. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed at 1 month. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-60 patients (18-40 for study drug, 9-20 for placebo before cross-over) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
