	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety and toxicity of autologous CD4-positive antigen-specific T cells in patients with stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cavity cancer. - Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the antitumor effect of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo leukapheresis for collection of T cells. Responder T cells are stimulated in vitro with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived dendritic cells pulsed with NY-ESO-1 immunogenic peptides. Patients receive autologous CD4-positive antigen-specific T cells IV over 30 minutes. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous CD4-positive antigen-specific T cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then periodically thereafter for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
