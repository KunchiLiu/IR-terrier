	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also help cisplatin work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cetuximab together with cisplatin may be a better way to block tumor growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with cisplatin works in treating patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced, Persistent, or Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of cetuximab and cisplatin, in terms of objective tumor response (partial and complete), in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor expression with progression-free survival, overall survival, and response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-20 months.</detailed_description>
