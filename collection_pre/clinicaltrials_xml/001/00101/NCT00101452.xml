	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) for the Treatment of Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAMe is a substance that is naturally produced by the body and is also sold as an over-the-counter drug. Although SAMe has not yet been approved for treating depression, evidence suggests that it has antidepressant properties. This study will determine whether SAMe is safe and effective in treating major depression. This study will last 24 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the antidepressant escitalopram, SAMe, or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants who respond to treatment at the end of 12 weeks will stay on their regimen for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who do not respond to treatment will enter an open treatment phase where they will receive SAMe and escitalopram for 12 more weeks. Depression scales and self-report questionnaires will be used to assess participants. All participants will receive 3 months of follow-up care, including free medication and clinic visits as necessary.</detailed_description>
