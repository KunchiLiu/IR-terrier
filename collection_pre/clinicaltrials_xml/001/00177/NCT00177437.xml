	<brief_title>Home Screening for Chlamydia Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase III randomized controlled trial. We enrolled 403 young women from a variety of clinical settings and neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh, PA region. Women completed a baseline questionnaire and then were randomized to either an intervention group (receive home testing kit every six months) or to a control group (receive a letter suggesting a clinic visit for screening). Participants were followed for 2 years, and medical chart abstraction was done to document tests done in clinical settings. The final study end points were number of tests completed, number of screening tests completed, number of STDs detected, and incident cases of pelvic inflammatory disease.</detailed_description>
