	<brief_summary>We propose to examine the efficacy and tolerability of Aldara Cream 5% for the treatment of extensive alopecia areata. Aldara is a immune-response modifier. The drug induces the production of cytokines which are small, hormone-like proteins involved in cellular communication during immune responses. We hypothesize that this drug will effect the inflammatory cells present around hair follicles in patients with alopecia areata.</brief_summary>
