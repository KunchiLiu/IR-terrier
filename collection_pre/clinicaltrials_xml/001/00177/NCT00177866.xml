	<brief_summary>The investigators will select 60 people who are 18-70 years of age with Crohn's disease and randomly assign them to receive an 8-week trial of celecoxib and an 8-week trial of a placebo. There will be a 1-week interval or "wash-out" between trials when the participant does not take any study medication. The investigators will monitor the participants for 18 weeks after they start the medication and observe their Crohn's disease activity, assessing for flare-ups or exacerbations in the disease and other possible side effects of celecoxib. Based on these observations, a determination will be made by the investigators as to the safety of celecoxib. If celecoxib is found to be safe, then it may provide physicians with a medication that they can prescribe for people who have Crohn's disease and experience chronic pain from arthritis and arthralgia.</brief_summary>
