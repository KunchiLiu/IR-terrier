	<brief_title>Topical Hydromorphone for Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is based on our published data that morphine is a powerful stimulant of angiogenesis and our preclinical study of wounds in rats which demonstrate that topical opioids (morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl) hasten healing of punch biopsy wounds. This study will focus on hydromorphone which was more powerful than morphine as a wound-healer in the rat study.</detailed_description>
