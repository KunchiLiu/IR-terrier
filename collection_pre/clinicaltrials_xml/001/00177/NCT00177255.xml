	<brief_title>A Study of Docetaxel in Combination With Capecitabine in Stomach and Esophagus Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II study that will investigate weekly dosing of docetaxel in combination with capecitabine in advanced gastric and gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas. Docetaxel 30mg/m2 will be administered on days 1 and 8 of each cycle and capecitabine 825mg/m2 bid (total daily dose 1650mg/m2) will be administered orally for 14 days (days 1-14) of each cycle. Each cycle is 21 days. Subjects will receive unlimited cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine until there is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
