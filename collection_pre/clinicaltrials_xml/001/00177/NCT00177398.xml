	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the early initiation of a long acting insulin (i.e. glargine) with supplemental doses of short acting regular (SSR) insulin in hospitalized patients with diabetes who are fed using tube feedings reduces the frequency of high and low blood sugar levels when compared to use of SSR insulin alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Glargine Insulin on Glucose Control in Hospitalized Patients Who Receive Tube Feedings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperglycemia is one of the most frequently encountered complications of enteral nutrition therapy in the hospital setting. However, there is no standardized approach directed towards the identification and management of patients who develop hyperglycemia while receiving enteral nutrition. The primary aim of the study is to determine if the early initiation of subcutaneous glargine insulin with supplemental doses of sliding scale human regular (SSR) insulin in hospitalized subjects with diabetes receiving enteral nutrition reduces the frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia when compared to use of SSR insulin alone. In this proposal, we plan to investigate a strategy of early insulin therapy in the management of hospitalized subjects with diabetes mellitus who develop hyperglycemia defined as two blood glucose (BG) measurements greater than 130 mg/dl within 48 hours prior to or within a 48 hour period during enteral nutrition therapy. The study is a phase IV, investigator initiated randomized, parallel group clinical trial. Potential subjects will include those subjects with written orders for initiation of enteral feedings using a formula containing carbohydrates. Consented subjects will have bedside glucose monitoring performed every 6 hours for the first 48 hours following initiation of enteral nutrition to determine if hyperglycemia occurs. To determine a difference in mean plasma glucose of 25 mg/dl and hospital LOS of 4 days between the two groups with an of 0.01 with power of 0.9, 25 subjects will be randomized to each group (total of 50 subjects). Baseline and outcome variables between the two groups will be compared using Student's t-testing, chi-square analysis, and the Mann-Whitney U test. Group 1 will receiving a single daily dose of glargine insulin along with sliding scale regular human (SSR) insulin titrated according to blood glucose results. Group 2 will receive only sliding scale human regular (SSR) insulin titrated according to an algorithm. Both groups will be followed daily until enteral feedings are discontinued or for a maximum of three weeks.</detailed_description>
