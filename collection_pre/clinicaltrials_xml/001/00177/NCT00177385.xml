	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of restricting time in bed and education in healthy sleep practices for maintaining or even enhancing sleep consolidation and depth in subjects aged 75+ who are at risk for decay in sleep quality and daytime well being; to determine the associated benefits for health; and to examine the persistence of such effects for 12 months beyond the end of the 18-month intervention. This project focuses not on pathology but on prevention of sleep decay and preservation of sleep in individuals who have already evidenced successful aging.</detailed_description>
