Women who are currently pregnant, pregnant within the previous six months, or planning on becoming pregnant within the next 18 months. (Pregnancy during initial screening will be based on selfreport and will be included on the detailed medical history that is completed by subjects) 4. Nonmedicated resting systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or nonmedicated resting diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg, or taking medication that would affect blood pressure. 5. Taking medication that would affect resting heart rate or the heart rate response during exercise (e.g., beta blockade). 6.
