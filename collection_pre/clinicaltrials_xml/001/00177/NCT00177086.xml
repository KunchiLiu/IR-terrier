	<brief_summary>This study will assess improvement in the percentage of spontaneous stone passage for distal ureteral calculi for alfuzosin compared to placebo, decrease of pain and narcotic/analgesic use associated with stone passage, decrease of the time to spontaneous stone passage, shift in the size distribution of stones passed towards larger sizes.</brief_summary>
