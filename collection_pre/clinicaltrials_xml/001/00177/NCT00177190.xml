	<brief_title>In Vitro Evaluation of Immune Responses in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an in vitro evaluation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma using patients blood and tissue to evaluate immune responses related to identified tumor populations and dendritic/ CD 8 cells with the following objectives: - Objective I: Evaluate the feasibility of the preparation of dendritic cells (DCs), CD8 and Sezary cells (all CD4 positive) in vitro, obtained from the buffy coats or a skin biopsy from an area with tumor involvement of subjects with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and Sezary syndrome (leukemic stage of CTCL) undergoing an approved FDA therapy, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP). - Objective II: Evaluate antigen loading of the DCs. - Objective III: Test the functional capacities of the DCs derived from CTCL subjects to overcome immune tolerance to the tumor cells ex-vivo, by using modified Elispot assay in conjunction with Granzyme B Elispot assay as a measurement of cytotoxicity.</detailed_description>
