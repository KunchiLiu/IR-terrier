	<criteria>1. Males and females aged 1875 years. 2. Recipients of first or secondary cadaveric, living unrelated or living related kidney transplant. 3. Recipients who are at least 4 weeks post renal transplantation. 4. Patients currently receiving MMF (all dosages are allowed), cyclosporine microemulsion, its generic equivalent, cyclosporine USP (modified) or tacrolimus with or without corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for at least 2 weeks. 5. Patients with mild and/or moderate GI complaints (e.g. upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting) with or without diarrhea. 1. Multiorgan patients (e.g. kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any other organ different from kidney (secondary kidney transplant is allowed). 2. Evidence of graft rejection, treatment of acute rejection or unstable renal function within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit. 3. Patients who have received an investigational immunosuppressive drug within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
