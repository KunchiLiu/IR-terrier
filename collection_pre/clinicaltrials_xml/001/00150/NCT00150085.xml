	<brief_summary>New onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) post- transplantation decreases patient and graft survival. Some immunosuppressive agents are associated with a higher incidence of NODM. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of converting patients with NODM from tacrolimus to cyclosporine micro-emulsion as a primary immunosuppressant for kidney and liver recipients.</brief_summary>
