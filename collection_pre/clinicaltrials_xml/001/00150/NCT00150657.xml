	<brief_summary>- this study is being done to find out if the combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine will be more effective in the the treatment of advanced lung cancer if bevacizumab, an agent that blocks tumor blood vessel formation, is added - the study will measure the time to progression of patients treated with the combination; we hope to show that the addition of bevacizumab improves the time to progression (increases the amount of time before the disease begins to worsen) - all patients receive all three drugs; there is no placebo</brief_summary>
