	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Asoprisnil(J867) in Women With Uterine Fibroids Who Are Scheduled for a Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of uterine fibroids. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of asoprisnil in uterine fibroid growth suppression. Full thickness biopsies obtained from surgical procedures will allow the assessment of asoprisnil's effects on the basalis, the myometrium, and on endometrial angiogenesis. Various other exploratory immunohistological and biochemical specimens will be collected to evaluate the mechanisms of action of asoprisnil in the endometrium, the myometrium, and in uterine fibroids.</detailed_description>
