	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study To Assess The Pharmacokinetics, Safety And Toleration Of VfendÂ®; Following Multiple Dosing With Vfend</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was put on hold after the first subject was enrolled and experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of renal failure chronic after receiving his I.V. dose on Day 1. The study was taken off hold after the subject recovered and an independent consultant had deemed the SAE as not treatment related; however, the site was unwilling to enroll additional subjects. Another site, based in New Orleans, was damaged by hurricane Katrina and was unable to enroll any subjects. A decision was made by the sponsor to terminate the study on 11 Apr 2006 due to poor study enrollment. There were no safety or efficacy concerns regarding the study in the decision to terminate the trial.</detailed_description>
