	<brief_title>Utilization of Oral Sucrose to Decrease Pain in Infants During Immunizations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pain during early life may alter infant pain responses, cognitive development, and behavioral outcomes. Immunization injections represent a relatively brief exposure to acute pain, yet assessment studies demonstrate that infants respond with significant distress during the injections. This study will examine the analgesic potential of oral sucrose in diminishing the pain associated with immunization injections in 6 week to 4-month-old infants. The proposed mechanism of action is via the activation of endogenous opioids that attenuate nociceptive information at the level of the dorsal horn. Comparison: Administration of oral sucrose 2 minutes prior to immunizations compared to administration of sterile water 2 minutes prior to immunizations</detailed_description>
