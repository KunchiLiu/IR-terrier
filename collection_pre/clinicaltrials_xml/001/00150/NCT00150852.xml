	<brief_title>Prevention of Gastrostomy-Related Wound Infection by Vancomycin in Carriers of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) provides an enteral route for long-term nutrition in patients unable to swallow. Peristomal wound infection occurs in 5 - 30 % of patients. Systematic antibiotic prophylaxis by cephalosporins or ampicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to prevent this complication efficiently. MRSA-positive patients have been suggested to be at higher risk of PEG-related wound infection due to MRSA. However, recommendations about vancomycin-prophylaxis before surgical procedures have not been extended to PEG insertion. This might be due to the fact that the exact route of contamination is unknown. It is assumed that contamination occurs when gastrostomy tubes are passed through the oropharynx. However, oropharyngeal carriage appears less frequent than nasopharyngeal or cutaneous carriage. Furthermore, patients who receive PEG are particularly vulnerable to vancomycin toxicity because of older age and multiple comorbidities. The aim of this study is to compare the rate of infectious complications after PEG insertion in patients colonized with MRSA who received either standard intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis associated with vancomycin or standard prophylaxis with placebo.</detailed_description>
