Subjects with at least 2 unprovoked seizures separated by a minimum of 48 hours in the year preceding randomization out of which at least 1 unprovoked seizure in the 3 months preceding randomization. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. Male/female subjects (≥16 years). History or presence of seizures of other types than partial (IA, IB, IC, with clear focal origin) and generalized tonicclonic (without clear focal origin) seizures. History or presence of seizures occurring only in clustered patterns, defined as repeated seizures occurring over a short period of time, i.e. &lt; 20 minutes, with or without function regained between 2 ictal events. History, clinical or EEG finding suggestive of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) at randomization.</criteria>
