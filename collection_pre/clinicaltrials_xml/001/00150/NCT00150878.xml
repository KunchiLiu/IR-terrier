	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the study is to show that the treatment-related mortality of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation an be significantly reduced by using a combination of 8 Gy total-body-irradiation and fludarabine in comparison to the conventional combination of 12 Gy TBI and 120 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transplant-related deaths because of extramedullary toxicity and graft-versus host disease remain the major causes for treatment-failure in patients with AMl receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In phase II study, M . Stelljes and coworkers could show, that a reduced dose of total-body- irradiation and fludarabine can be safely used in patients with AML at various disease stages. The best results could be achieved in patients who had been in complete remission by the time of inclusion. Therefore this prospective trial was initiated to compare the new conditioning regimen with the standard regimen of 12 Gy TBI/Cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg in patients ith AML in first remission. After having achieved complete remission, and giving informed consent, patients are stratified according to marrow cytogenetics, age and type of induction therapy and subsequently randomized to receive on of the mentioned conditioning therapies. The primary end-point will be non-relapse mortality. The hypothesis would be, that the one-year mortality can be reduced from 25 to 15%. Given a power of 0.8 and a first-error of 5%, 252 patients will have to be randomized. Secondary endpoints include: 3 year overall-and disease-free survival Rate of grade II-IV acute GvHD Rate of grade 3-4 extramedullary toxicity</detailed_description>
