	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better understand a new type of radiology test called positron emission tomography (PET) with carbon 11 methionine to determine which patients have a beneficial effect from anti-cancer therapy with the drug docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effects of Chemotherapy on the Uptake and Retention of Carbon 11 Methionine in Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the week before the patients first dose of chemotherapy they will receive a C11 methionine PET scan which takes about 90 minutes. C11 methionine is a radioactively labeled amino acid that is given to the patient intravenously. Eighteen to twenty days after the patients first dose of docetaxel chemotherapy, they will have another C11 methionine PET scan which is identical to the first scan. At the end of three cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy (about 2 and 1/2 months on study) another C11 methionine PET scan will be done. The PET scans will show how well the tumor is taking up methionine.</detailed_description>
