	<brief_summary>To determine whether a new Orally Disintegrating Tablet of Reglan (metoclopramide) is metabolized faster than the conventional Reglan tablet in patients with diabetic gastroparesis, pharmacokinetics following a single 10 mg dose of each formulation are being compared. Subjects must be 18 or older, have Type 1 or 2 diabetes with documented gastroparesis and agree to withhold medications for gastroparesis for 3 days prior to each dosing. Exclusion criteria include serum glucose &gt;300 mg/dL, Hb1Ac &gt;10%, and concurrent illness interfering with gastrointestinal motility. Subjects will stay in the clinic overnight, and pharmacokinetic sampling will continue for 8 hours after the first morning dose. The time (Tmax) and amount (Cmax) of peak concentration and the area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to 8 hr will be compared for the 2 formulations.</brief_summary>
