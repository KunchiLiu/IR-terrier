	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common and underrecognised condition. The diagnosis of OSA is typically made after an in-lab polysomnography (PSG) which requires an overnight stay in a sleep laboratory. Many sleep laboratories have long waiting lists for PSG. There are a number of portable devices which may be useful in home diagnosis of OSA, however there is limited data on outcomes of OSA diagnosed and treated at home. In this study we propose to compare diagnostic accuracy of a home monitoring device with a PSG and outcomes of OSA therapy when implemented at home vs in the sleep laboratory.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will randomise patients suspected to have OSA to either home evaluation and treatment (using a portable monitor and auto-CPAP) or in-lab evaluation with a PSG and manually-titrated CPAP. We will obtain sleep, sleepiness and quality of life questionnaires, vigilance testing and blood pressure at baseline and after 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks of therapy. We will also assess and compare compliance with CPAP therapy in each arm of the study.</detailed_description>
