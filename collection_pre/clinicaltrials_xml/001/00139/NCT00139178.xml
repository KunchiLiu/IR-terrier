	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy. The main hypothesis of the study is that switching from thymidine-analogue based HAART will reverse lipoatrophy. We plan to perform an observational study recruiting up to 100 HIV-infected patients receiving Trizivir (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir). The patients will be offered an NRTI or lopinavir/ritonavir instead of zidovudine or they can choose to continue with Trizivir. The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by DEXA-scanning.</brief_summary>
