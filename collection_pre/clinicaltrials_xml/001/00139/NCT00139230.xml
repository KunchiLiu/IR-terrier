	<detailed_description>- Patients will be admitted to hospital and receive a one hour infusion of taxotere. Approximately 2 hours after taxotere is finished they will receive cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin continuously over a 4 day period. - Approximately 6-12 hours after the chemotherapy ends patients will be given growth factor support and ciprofloxacin until the patient's ANC level is greater than 10,000. - Infusion of chemotherapy will be repeated every 28 days (1 cycle is 28 days). - During each cycle patients will have blood tests performed weekly and may be asked to return to the Head and Neck Clinic for examination around the middle of each cycle. - At the end of each cycle the impact of the chemotherapy will be assessed. If after 2 cycles, the cancer has not responded sufficiently the patient will not receive any more chemotherapy. However, if significant reduction in the size of the patients tumor is observed, a third and final cycle will be performed. - During the fourth or fifth week of cycle 3, patients will undergo re-staging evaluation under anesthesia with primary-site biopsies and planning of radiotherapy. - Within 2 weeks of completion of chemotherapy cycle 3 all patients will receive twice daily radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
