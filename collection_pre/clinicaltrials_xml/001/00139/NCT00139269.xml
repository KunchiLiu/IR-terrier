	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the appropriate dose, that dose which is found to give maximum effect with limited toxicity, of cisplatin in combination with docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil and then to further define the safety and effectiveness of this combination of medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Docetaxel in Combination With Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil in Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Treatment begins with a one hour infusion of docetaxel followed by a 1/2 hour infusion of cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil will be administered through continuous IV infusion through a portable pump for four days at home. A cycle is twenty-one days long ( 4 days of chemotherapy and 17 days of recovery). - During each cycle blood tests will be performed weekly. A physical exam will be performed and the impact of the chemotherapy will be assessed at the end of each cycle. - If after 2 cycles the patients cancer has not responded sufficiently they will be removed from the study. - If significant reduction in the size of the tumor is observed after cycle 2, a third and final cycle will be performed. Followed by radiation therapy twice daily for approximately 6-7 weeks.</detailed_description>
