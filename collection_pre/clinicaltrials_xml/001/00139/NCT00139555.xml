	<brief_summary>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with high blood pressure, compared to those without LVH. Reduction of left ventricular mass (LVM) with antihypertensive agents is associated with improved clinical outcome. This study will evaluate the effects of amlodipine/benazepril in reducing LVM in patients with high risk hypertension.</brief_summary>
