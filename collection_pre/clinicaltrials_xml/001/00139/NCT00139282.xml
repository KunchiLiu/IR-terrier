	<brief_summary>Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative eye disease of the retina that causes a progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of blindness among adults age 50 or older in the Western world. AMD presents in two different types: "dry" and the more severe "wet" form. Wet AMD is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the macula. Squalamine lactate is an investigational drug that may prevent the growth of these abnormal blood vessels. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Squalamine lactate in the treatment of AMD in patients, the exact number of which will be determined based on data from the sponsor's ongoing Phase 2 trials. The trial objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of Squalamine lactate for Injection administered as intravenous infusions weekly for 4 weeks followed by maintenance doses every 4 weeks through week 104 compared with the safety and efficacy in the control group.</brief_summary>
