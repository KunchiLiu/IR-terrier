	<brief_summary>Introduction. Lymphatic filariasis is a devastating mosquito-transmitted parasitic disease that causes lymphedema or elephantiasis of the leg in 15 million persons, the majority of whom are women. In these persons, frequent bacterial infections ("acute attacks") of the legs adversely affect physical health, economic well-being, and quality of life. Prevention of bacterial infections through hygiene and skin care can result in significant improvements in lymphedema and patient well-being. Methods. To determine the extent to which antibacterial soap can help reduce the incidence of acute bacterial infections of the lower limbs in persons with filarial lymphedema, 200 patients of the Ste. Croix Hospital lymphedema treatment clinic in Leogane, Haiti randomly assigned to receive either antibacterial (Safeguard) or placebo (Camay) soap and acute attacks monitored monthly for 12 months. Both groups received specific instructions on washing and skin care.</brief_summary>
