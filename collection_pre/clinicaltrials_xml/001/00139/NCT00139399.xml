	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the radial artery (artery in the arm) or saphenous vein (vein in the leg), when used as bypass grafts for coronary artery bypass surgery, have a greater patency rate (degree of opening)at 5 years after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radial Artery Versus Saphenous Vein Patency (RSVP) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arteries differ from veins both in morphology and physiology. Thus the way they behave as in vivo conduits when used in coronary artery bypass grafting is also likely to be different. This may partly explain the predisposition of veins used as coronary conduits to accelerated atherosclerosis in comparison with the internal mammary artery grafts. There are presently few data describing the properties of the radial artery as an in-vivo coronary conduit over the longer-term. The study will compare angiographic patency of the radial artery or saphenous vein graft anastomosed to the native left circumflex coronary territory at 3 months and 5 years after surgery. A substudy will compare 5-year post-surgery diameter and blood flow of in-vivo radial artery and saphenous vein grafts in response to endothelium-dependent and non-endothelium-dependent stimuli when patients attend for their scheduled follow-up angiogram.</detailed_description>
