	<brief_summary>To evaluate and compare Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in adolescent Depo-Provera Contraceptive Injection (DP150CI) users during depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) therapy and following discontinuation of DMPA. Another group electing non-hormonal contraception or abstinence will be recruited as a reference population, across all study sites. The primary variable is BMD, measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary variables are: Total Body Composition&amp; Total Body Calcium (TBC), measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and surrogate biologic BMD markers. Safety will be evaluated by adverse event reporting, laboratory evaluations, pregnancies, weight and vital signs.</brief_summary>
