	<brief_summary>This prospective study was designed to assess the outcomes (survival and failure patterns) of therapy for localized esophageal cancer with conventional dose radiation (RT; 50.4 Gy) with concurrent continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel. Patients with less than complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) received dose escalation of radiation to 59.4 Gy with the same chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>we prospectively enrolled patients with T1–4, N0–1, M0–1a esophageal carcinoma to receive paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour and carboplatin AUC 2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. 5-FU 225mg/m2 was delivered as a continuous infusion on days 1–38. RT was given 1.8Gy 5 days/wk for 5.5 wks (50.4Gy in 28 fx). After 6–8 weeks, patients underwent repeat staging with computed tomography (CT) scan, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and biopsy. Patients with a positive biopsy, or less than PR by CT and EUS, received a boost of 9 Gy with the same concurrent chemotherapy. Patients were followed every 4 months with CT/EUS first year, every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
