	<brief_summary>Tegaserod is an aminoguanidine indole compound and a member of a new class of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonists. Activation of 5-HT4 receptors triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the enteric nerves which in turn stimulate contractility and peristalsis. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of tegaserod against chronic constipation in a Chinese population of adult men and women</brief_summary>
