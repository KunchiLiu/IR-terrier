	<brief_title>Effects of Cyclosporine A on Pancreatic Insulin Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary aim is to investigate if cyclosporine A may reduce insulin secretion by 20% or more. In order to get cyclosporine A na√Øve patients we will perform this investigation in dialysis patients on the waiting list for a renal transplantation. In addition we will investigate if also the peripheral insulin sensitivity and endothelia function is affected by cyclosporine A treatment in these patients. Since these patients will be treated with cyclosporine A we will also measure cyclosporine pharmacokinetics at the time of investigation and repeat this investigation at the time of the first week following transplantation in order to evaluate if a pretransplant cyclosporine dose can be of value in predefining the dose to be used at the time of transplantation.</detailed_description>
