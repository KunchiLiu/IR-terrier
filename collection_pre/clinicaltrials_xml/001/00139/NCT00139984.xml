	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether in patients with arterial hypertension, treatment guidance using 24-hour blood pressure measurement results in better blood pressure control compared to treatment guidance using office blood pressure measurement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring for Antihypertensive Treatment Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood pressure control in arterial hypertension remains poor, despite the availability of effective drug treatment. Therefore, strategies to increase blood pressure control are urgently needed. 24 hour blood pressure is a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than office blood pressure. Furthermore, the lower variability of measurements over time of 24 hour blood pressure could allow better adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. However, there are only scarce data about antihypertensive treatment adjustment using 24 hour blood pressure instead of office blood pressure. Aim: To test the hypothesis that a 24 hour blood pressure guided therapy is is more effective in reaching blood pressure control when compared to conventional office blood pressure guided therapy.</detailed_description>
