	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to apply allogeneic tumor cell vaccination for immunotherapy in patients with micro-metastatic disease and/or in patients at high risk disease progression. The present study will use allogeneic tumor cell lines for tumor cell vaccines that share MHC determinants with the patient aiming to overcome possible restriction of antigen presentation.</brief_summary>
