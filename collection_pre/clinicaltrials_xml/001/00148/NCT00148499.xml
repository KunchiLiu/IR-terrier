	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Ambroxol Lozenge 20 mf in Relieving Pain of Sore Throat in Pat. With Acute/Viralpharyngitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled parallel group study in adult pat ients, suffering from acute viral pharyngitis and throat pain of at least moderate intensity. The whole study will last for up to 4 days, on each of test days patients will take one lozenge cont aining Ambroxol hydrochlorid 20 mg/ or placebo/ or benzocaine lozenge 3 mg up to 6 lozenges per day. Using Patient Diaries the assessment of tolerability and efficacy by the patient will be obtained. Study Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis to be tested is the test of superiority of ambroxol 20 mg in comparison to placebo. If and only if the corresponding test of superiority to placebo is statistically significant, the hypothesis of non-inferiority of am broxol 20 mg in comparison to benzocaine 3 mg will be tested. Comparison(s): For the primary comparison the placebo lozenges will be used, for the secondary comparison the benzocaine 3 mg lozenges will be used.</detailed_description>
