	<brief_summary>This study wants to assess different intensive therapy sequences for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. It claims less on the efficacy of different chemotherapy combinations, than more on the comparison of different strategies of sequential single-agent, sequential double-agent or sequential triple-agent therapy.</brief_summary>
