	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the ZoMaxx drug-eluting stent in patients with blockage of native coronary arteries. The study is designed to demonstrate non-inferiority to the TAXUS Express2 Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent that has proven superior to bare metal stents and is a recognized standard of care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the ZoMaxx™ Drug-Eluting Stent System in Coronary Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in Europe as a whole, and while mortality rates for cardiovascular disease have decreased in most western European countries, due to expanded use of prevention strategies and better treatment, coronary heart disease mortality in the middle age groups is increasing rapidly in most of the countries in Eastern Europe. The number of procedures performed to treat cardiovascular disease in Europe is constantly increasing, although different types of procedures are exhibiting different trends. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) procedures, for example, totaled 430,000 in the European Union (15 countries) and 520,000 in Europe as a whole (33 countries) in 2000, as reported by the Euro Heart Survey, and growth is continuing at a rate of more than 20% per year. Despite the effectiveness of intracoronary stents in maintaining a larger luminal diameter as compared to angioplasty alone, 15 - 35% of in-stent restenosis occurs within 6 to 9 months after stent placement. While stents can reduce restenosis by blocking vascular recoil and remodeling, mechanical intervention alone is incapable of treating the biological problem of neointimal hyperplasia. Various approaches have been used to treat in-stent restenosis, including balloon angioplasty, repeat stenting, rotational and directional atherectomy, laser and local use of radiation at the time of stenting (brachytherapy). However, these techniques add complexity to the interventional procedure and have not had documented success in preventing restenosis. Drug-eluting stents (DES) using antiproliferative agents delivered via a polymer based stent platform have shown significant success in the reduction of restenosis in de novo lesions over the traditional bare metal stents in randomized clinical trials. Local delivery of the pharmacological agent allows for controlled delivery of high drug concentrations to the targeted tissue while maximizing systemic drug effects. The ZoMaxx I Trial is a study of the ZoMaxx Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System (ZoMaxx DES) to evaluate the potential benefits of the local application of the zotarolimus drug in combination with a phosphorylcholine (PC)-coated tri-metal stent. ZoMaxx™ Drug-Eluting Stent System is an Investigational device. Limited by Federal (U.S.) law to investigational use only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria include all of the following: Subject is ≥ 18 years old. Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment and utilize reliable birth control for nine (9) months after enrollment. Subject is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and has a single lesion requiring treatment. Subject is an acceptable candidate for CABG. Subject has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a positive functional study. Subject has documented stable angina pectoris Exclusion Criteria include all of the following: Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or CKMB &gt; 2x upper limit of normal within 72 hours of the intended treatment (refer to WHO definition). Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®) or ticlopidine (Ticlid®), heparin, stainless steel, tantalum, contrast agent (that cannot be adequately premedicated), paclitaxel, or drugs similar to ABT578 (i.e. tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus). A platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L or &gt; 700 x 109/L (&lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3); a WBC &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3; or a hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dl. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl or &gt; 150 µmol/L). Subject has had any previous or planned brachytherapy in the target vessel. Target vessel has evidence of thrombus or is excessively tortuous (&gt; 60 degree bend) that makes it unsuitable for proper stent delivery and deployment.</criteria>
