	<brief_summary>"The aims of this trial are to demonstrate the consistency of three manufacturing lots of GSK Biologicals' DTaP-IPV candidate vaccine in terms of immunogenicity and to evaluate non-inferiority of GSK Biologicals' DTaP-IPV vaccine with respect to immunogenicity and safety compared to the control vaccines (separate injections of GSK Biologicals' DTaP vaccine [Infanrix] and Aventis Pasteur's IPV vaccine [IPOL]) when administered as a 5th dose of DTaP and a 4th dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in subjects 4 to 6 years of age. Vaccines will be co-administered with the second dose of M-M-RII, which is recommended at this age. Concomitant administration of a US-licensed influenza vaccine will be allowed according to seasonal availability of vaccine and at the discretion of the investigator."</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response &amp; Safety Comparison of 3 Lots of GSK Biologicals' DTaP-IPV Candidate Vaccine to DTaP + IPV Vaccine.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Investigational groups: 3, each receive one of 3 lots of DTaP-IPV vaccine. - Control: US-licensed DTaP (Infanrix) + US-licensed IPV (IPOL) vaccines administered in separate injections. - Two study visits one month apart for a subset of subjects (Safety and Immunogenicity subset) with a blood draw at each visit. All other subjects will have one visit. - A telephone contact 4-6 days after vaccination for all subjects, a telephone contact 31-38 days after vaccination for the Safety only subset and a telephone contact for all subjects during the extended safety follow-up phase (5 months following the active phase).</detailed_description>

Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the administration of study vaccines, or planned use during the study period. Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days of study vaccination and ending at Day 30. Chronic administration or planned administration of immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs within six months prior to study vaccination or planned administration during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products within 3 months prior to vaccination or planned administration during the study period.</criteria>
