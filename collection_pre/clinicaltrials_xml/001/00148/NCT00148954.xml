	<brief_summary>RIGHT is a randomized, prospective, two-arm study that will assess the differential efficacy of VITALITY 2 implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) using Rhythm ID™ versus selected Medtronic ICDs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RIGHT: Rhythm ID Going Head-to-Head Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RIGHT will compare the incidence of Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation (VT/VF) therapies delivered for Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) episodes using VITALITY 2 devices with Rhythm ID™ to that of ICDs employing other rhythm discrimination algorithms. Appropriateness of therapies will be assessed after independent adjudication of all VT/VF events leading to therapy. Comparisons will be made between device manufacturers across patient populations receiving either a dual- or single-chamber device.</detailed_description>
