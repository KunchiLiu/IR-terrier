	<brief_summary>INTRINSIC RV is a two-armed randomized trial that will compare the effects of innovative dual-chamber pacing with AV Search Hysteresis to standard VVI among ICD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INTRINSIC RV - Inhibition of Unnecessary RV Pacing With AV Search Hysteresis in ICDs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of study is to assess whether AVSH will provide benefits of a dual-chamber ICD without the deleterious effects of unnecessary RV pacing. This study will aim to demonstrate that DDDR-AVSH is equal to VVI with respect to mortality and HF hospitalizations.</detailed_description>
