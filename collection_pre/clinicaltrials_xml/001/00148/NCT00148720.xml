	<brief_title>Capecitabine in Women With Operable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a small metal clip inserted into the tumor bed to identify the tumor site to the surgeon. At that time, a needle biopsy of the breast tumor or a sentinel (underarm) lymph node biopsy will also be performed. - Patients will take capecitabine orally twice daily for 14 days. This treatment will repeat every 21 days (1 cycle). Patients will receive 4 cycles of this treatment. - A physical exam and blood work will be done every three weeks after starting therapy to monitor side effects. - After two weeks of capecitabine a biopsy from the tumor will be done to generate information about the characteristics of the tumor that may respond to capecitabine. - After completing 4 cycles (12 weeks) of capecitabine, patients will then undergo surgery to remove any remaining breast cancer (lumpectomy or mastectomy). Post-surgical treatment (radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy) is at the discretion of the patients physician.</detailed_description>
