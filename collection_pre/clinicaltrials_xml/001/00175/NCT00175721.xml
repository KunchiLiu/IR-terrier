	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits of a combined cardiac, kidney, and diabetes clinic versus multiple clinics. Hypothesis: Attendance at multiple clinics by one individual patient has multiple problems which may be overcome by the introduction of a combined care clinic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Care in Multiple Clinics Versus Care in a Cardiac, Diabetes and Kidney Care Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized control trial to compare health care resource utilization, and achievement of stated targets of therapy (BP, Hgb, glucose control, use of preventive medications) as well as patient and health care team satisfaction, and longer term patient outcomes in patients with kidney disease who have either or both diabetes and heart disease, and currently attend either a diabetic or heart function clinic (or both) in addition to a kidney care clinic. In addition, we will also establish and refine the specialized cross-disciplinary care model, within a framework in Vancouver, and evaluate its functioning from the perspectives of allied health and medical professionals. This is a systematic evaluation of health care delivery methods to a complex group of patients, which will serve as a nidus for ongoing research in both health outcomes research, and biomedical research. The creation of this multifaceted clinic in an organized manner would permit evaluation of all of the components of it, and also demonstrate the importance of collaboration between disciplines and between public health care initiatives and industry partners, who would fund this clinic infrastructure and research components in the initial phase.</detailed_description>
