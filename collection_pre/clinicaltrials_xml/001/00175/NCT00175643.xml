	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Imiquimod Applied in Dose-Cycle for Actinic Keratoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream applied to actinic keratoses on the head to reduce the size of lesions. The objective is to analyze the effect of dose cycling with respect to the complete clearance rate when imiquimod 5% cream is applied 3 times per week for 4 weeks in 1 or 2 cycles. The complete clearance rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area at the end of cycle 1 or the end of cycle 2.</detailed_description>
