	<brief_title>Effect of Dietary Amino Acid Profile on Lipoprotein Metabolism, Vascular Reactivity and Inflammatory Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Findings from early studies in a variety of experimental models of atherosclerosis on the effect of dietary protein suggested that proteins from vegetable sources are less cholesterolemic and atherogenic than proteins from animal sources. Throughout the later part of the 20th century there has been sporadic interest in the effect of protein type and amino acid profiles on blood lipid concentrations and atherosclerosis. A major focus for this evaluation has been to compare proteins based on their amino acid profile, often expressed as lysine (Lys) to arginine (Arg) ratio (Lys:Arg). While animal studies have provided important information regarding the significance of the Lys:Arg in determining the cholesterolemic response to a dietary protein, interpretation of these data must be done with caution since most of the studies have been conducted in animal models that have a different lipoprotein distribution and metabolism than humans. Moreover, the mechanistic insights of this response are yet to be determined. While the favorable effects of Arg on endothelial function appear to be consistent when Arg is administered using a supplement, the effects of dietary Arg naturally present in protein rich foods has yet to be determined. The aim of this proposal is to explore the significance of the Lys:Arg ratio on responses of lipids and lipoprotein concentrations to dietary proteins and to evaluate the effects of dietary Lys:Arg on cardiovascular disease risk factors and endothelial function.</detailed_description>
