	<brief_title>Soybean Based Diets and CVD Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent data suggests that the magnitude of the effect of soy protein on lipid and lipoprotein levels is variable and less dramatic than originally reported. This discordance might be attributable to the forms of soy protein used, as well as subtle unrecognized shifts in the fatty acid, cholesterol and fiber content of the diets.The aim of the present investigation is to assess the effects of different forms of soybeans (whole bean and products made thereof), products derived from soy flour (textured soy protein) and products made from a soybean extract (i.e. tofu, yogurt) relative to animal protein, independent of alterations in the fatty acid profile of the diet on CVD risk factors in hypercholesterolemic subjects. The intent is to isolate any potential impact of processing on the plasma lipid lowering efficacy of the soy product or soy protein relative to animal protein.</detailed_description>
