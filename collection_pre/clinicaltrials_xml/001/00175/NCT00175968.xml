	<brief_title>Influence of Bedrest and Hypocaloric Nutrition on Endothelium-Dependent Vasoreactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomized, four-phase cross-over study the effect of simulated microgravity (13 days of bed rest), energetic restriction (-25%, fat reduced), and their combination on endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation will be compared with ambulatory control conditions. Using venous occlusion plethysmography cumulative intraarterial dose-response curves to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilators will be constructed in 10 healthy male volunteers before and on day 13 of each of the four intervention periods.</detailed_description>
