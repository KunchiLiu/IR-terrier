	<brief_summary>This randomized placebo-controlled double-blind, multi-centre trial will determine the efficacy of the probiotic VSL#3 in the prevention of Crohn's disease development following surgical resection and re-anastomosis. A total of 120 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive VSL#3 or placebo for 90 days. Patients who respond to study treatment, as defined by the absence of a severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90, will be offered open-label VSL#3 for an additional 9 months.</brief_summary>
