	<brief_summary>About ten percent of revision hip replacements will dislocate. Although dislocation is not a life-threatening problem, it is stressful and costly and requires hospitalization to treat. Subjects who have repeated dislocations live with the constant fear of another dislocation. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a large ball prosthesis in preventing post-surgical dislocation. A large diameter ball has greater freedom of movement before it impinges; therefore, theoretically, it should not dislocate as easily.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Eligible patients will be those undergoing revision hip arthroplasty, either first revision or subsequent rerevision. 2. Revision must require replacement of both the acetabular component and femoral component, except when revising femur only with wellfixed Trilogy socket. 3. The acetabular component must have a minimum outer diameter of 50 mm. 4. The femoral component inserted should be a Zimmer Versys™ beaded fullcoated stem or Zimmer ZMR™ stem or collarless polished taper (CPT™) 5. Patients must be able to reply to questionnaires in either French or English. 1. Patients who are undergoing revision for recurrent dislocation. 2. Revision of the acetabulum requiring structural allograft or reconstruction ring. 3. Revision of the acetabulum requiring the use of cemented allpolyethylene cups. 4. Revision of the acetabulum using a liner cemented into an existing metal shell. 5. Intraoperative decision to use a constrained liner.</criteria>
