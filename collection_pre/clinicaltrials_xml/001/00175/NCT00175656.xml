	<brief_title>Titanium Elastic Nails in the Treatment of Pediatric Femur Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted as a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents treated with TEN for a femoral shaft fracture. All children and adolescents presenting to the Emergency department of a participating center with a femur fracture will be approached for inclusion in the study. The primary outcome for this study will be functional recovery, as measured using a pediatric specific generic QOL measurement tool. The clinical outcome measure which will be used will be the performance version of the ASK (ASK-p) which has been previously tested and shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive in children and adolescents with acute and chronic Orthopaedic disorders. The first time point for data collection will be at four months. Clinical data which will be obtained over the course of follow-up will include clinical evaluation of hip and knee range of motion, limb rotation, clinical measurement of limb length, fracture union, and the presence of complications, including the need for nail removal in the group in which it was not planned. The second time point for data collection will be at one year. Again, the ASK-p will be mailed to all subjects in advance to allow completion at the desired time. The return of questionnaires and process for reminder notifications will proceed in a similar fashion to the four month time point. Clinical and radiographic data will be collected in a similar fashion to the four month time point. No subjects will be excluded on the basis of failure to return questionnaires at the one year time point since this represents a secondary outcome.</detailed_description>
