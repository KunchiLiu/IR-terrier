	<brief_summary>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) predicts mortality at start of dialysis. Prevention of of LVH is important. It is not known whether secondary hyperparathyroidism might induce LVH. In the present study patients are randomised to 1.25 dihydroxycholecalciferol or no treatment to study the effect on LVH.</brief_summary>
