	<detailed_description>Phase 2, open label, multi-center, 2-period study to compare the pharmacodynamics of IV lansoprazole 30 mg to oral lansoprazole 30 mg in subjects with erosive esophagitis (grade &gt;or= 2)diagnosed by endoscopy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects were required to have Grade 2, 3 or 4 esophageal findings according to the TAP Grading Scale during the pretreatment endoscopy. Subjects must discontinue histamine H2receptor antagonists, proton pump ® inhibitors, prokinetic agents, antacids and Carafate before the first dose of drug and during the study. Gastric or duodenal ulcer (a lesion with appreciable depth ≥3 mm) or a hiatal hernia &gt;5 cm. Subjects could not have a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (with or without dysplastic changes). Coexisting systemic disease affecting the esophagus, (ie, scleroderma, viral or fungal infection), radiation therapy to the region of the esophagus, or caustic or physiochemical trauma to the esophagus. Current esophageal stricture requiring dilatation. The endoscope had to pass freely into the stomach during endoscopy. Any strictures could not have been dilated within 12 weeks before beginning the Pretreatment Period. Positive H pylori by rapid urease test (CLO® test KimberlyClark Corporation). Uncontrolled, clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological or endocrine disease or other abnormality (other than the erosive esophagitis disease being studied). Diagnosis of ZollingerEllison syndrome, esophageal varices, symptomatic pancreaticobiliary tract disease, cholecystitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma).</criteria>
