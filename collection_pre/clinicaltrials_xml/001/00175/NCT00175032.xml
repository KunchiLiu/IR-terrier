	<brief_title>A Comparison of Safety and Treatment in Subjects With Osteoarthritis Taking Low Dose Aspirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of reducing the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers between lansoprazole 30mg QD + naproxen 500mg BID vs celecoxib 200mg QD in subjects with osteoarthritis taking low dose aspirin. Approximately 100 sites across the U.S. will enroll subjects with normal endoscopic findings and negative H.pylori. The duration of the study will be a maximum of 14 weeks including a screening period of up to 2 weeks and a 12 week treatment period. Gelusil will be provided for dyspepsia symptom rescue.</detailed_description>
