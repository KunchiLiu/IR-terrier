	<brief_summary>Short description of the primary purpose of the protocol intended for the lay public. Include brief statement of study hypothesis Pre-eclampsia (toxemia of pregnancy) is the most cause of death among pregnant women in North America. It also causes many complications for fetuses (unborn children) and neonates (newborn children). Pre-eclampsia is defined by high blood pressure (hypertension), the loss of protein into the urine (proteinuria), and disorders of many body systems, including the blood clotting (coagulation) and inflammation. What is needed is a compound that will safely prolong pregnancies, to give babies more time to grow inside their mothers, and will help the recovery in those mothers after delivery. We are going to investigate a compound (recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC)) that has the potential to modify disease activity in pre-eclampsia by reducing coagulation and inflammation disorders. rhAPC is effective in patients suffering from septic shock. We will test rhAPC in women who develop severe pre-eclampsia in two ways. First, in women with severe pre-eclampsia remote from term who are carrying small babies (intent: safely prolong their pregnancies). Second, in women who have had severe pre-eclampsia before their baby delivered (including women in the first group), or whose disease develops/worsens after delivery (intent: switch off the disease so dangerous complications do not arise). This study is a preliminary one to look for possible risks and benefits for these women. Only 40 women will be studied to provide initial evidence on which to base a larger international trial which is planned. We will study their pregnancy outcomes as well as markers of disease activity, to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which these women become unwell.</brief_summary>
