	<brief_summary>Our experience suggests that further research with alemtuzumab is attractive in islet transplantation. Therefore, in this study we propose to combine alemtuzumab induction pre-transplant, with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil maintenance immunosuppression post-transplant. In the critical early phase post transplant, we anticipate that this regimen will prove to be more effective in control of autoimmunity or rejection events, and have a more desirable side-effect profile, than previously tested combinations of induction and immunosuppressive agents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Induction in Islet Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is a single-center, prospective, open-label study in 12 Type 1 diabetic participants receiving an islet-alone transplant along with alemtuzumab induction therapy followed by combination tacrolimus and MMF maintenance immunosuppression. Participants will receive 1 to 3 infusions of pancreatic islets of sufficient quantity to attain insulin independence. The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of a treatment regimen utilizing alemtuzumab induction and a combination of tacrolimus and MMF maintenance immunosuppression in adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet transplant.</detailed_description>
