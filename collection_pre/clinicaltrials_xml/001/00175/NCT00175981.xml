	<brief_title>Interaction Between Fluvoxamine and Sildenafil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in healthy men we will assess the effect of oral fluvoxamine (50mg qd on day 1-3; 100mg qd on day 4-10) on sildenafil kinetics (single oral 50mg dose on day 11). Sildenafil plasma concentrations will be determined by LC/MS. We will also assess the effect of sildenafil on venodilation induced by a constant dose-rate of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) during preconstriction with phenylephrine (dorsal hand vein compliance technique).</detailed_description>
