	<brief_summary>In this study, treosulfan is evaluated for conditioning in allogenic stem cell transplantation. The procedure and the follow-up are the same as in standard allogenic transplant. The donor is unrelated (identical HLA). The graft is haematological peripheral blood stem cell. The conditioning with reduced intensity is: fludarabine (from day -6 to day -2), treosulfan (from day -6 to day -4) and thymoglobuline (from day -2 to day -1).</brief_summary>
