	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether there is a change in 123iodine-2ß- carbomethoxy-3ß-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]ß-CIT) uptake after short-term treatment with levodopa compared to either dopamine agonist or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of Dopaminergic Medications on Dopamine Transporter Density in Subjects With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label study of short-term treatment with levodopa or cabergoline on striatal DATscan uptake in early Parkinson's disease. Approximately 120 Parkinson's disease subjects will be randomized to receive either carbidopa/levodopa, cabergoline or no treatment during a twelve week period. Subjects will undergo SPECT imaging with DATscan at screening and after 12 weeks. After twelve weeks carbidopa/levodopa and cabergoline treatment will be withdrawn and all subjects will undergo SPECT imaging with DATscan after 8 weeks (20 weeks after baseline).</detailed_description>
