	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the combination Myocet®/Taxotere®/Herceptin® as primary treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer patients. HER2 status will be confirmed centrally by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Phase I: Initial doses will be: Myocet: 50-60 mg/m² day 1 every 3 weeks; Taxotere 60-75 mg/m² day 1 every 3 weeks; and Herceptin (4) 2 mg/kg weekly. Sample size will depend on the number of patients recruited during dose escalation. Three patients must be recruited in each dose level. If one out of three experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more patients must be recruited in the same dose level. Considering that there are 4 dose levels to be tested, the estimated number of patients is 9 to 24. Patients receiving the recommended dose (RD) will be incorporated into phase II of the study. Phase II: The average pathological complete response rate reported in other trials is around 11%. The investigators expect to achieve an increase of 14% on this rate; that is, they expect a pathological response rate of 25%. With a= 0.05 and β=0.2, 18 patients are initially needed. If at least 3 pathological complete responses are achieved, recruitment will continue to up to 53 patients. At least 10 pathological complete responses are needed to probe the hypothesis. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out rate, a total of 59 patients must be recruited for the trial.</brief_summary>
