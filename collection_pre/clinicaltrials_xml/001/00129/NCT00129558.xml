	<mesh_term>Leukemia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Relapsed/refractory leukemias including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CMLBP) for which no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission; or poorrisk myelodysplasia (MDS) patients to include refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or excess blasts in transformation (RAEBT) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who are either relapsed/refractory or who refuse/are not eligible for frontline therapy. Only patients with refractory ALL or CML in lymphoid blastic phase are eligible for phase II. ECOG performance status 0 2. Adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from the time of major surgery. Use of appropriate contraceptive method. Signed patient informed consent. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure. Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their leukemia other than corticosteriods, hydroxyurea, and 6mercaptopurine. Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.</criteria>
