	<brief_summary>Each year a large number of patients are hospitalized at Shock Trauma Centers with severe head injuries. Bleeding into and swelling of these patients' brains may cause compression of vital structures, disability and death. Sometimes surgery is needed. Unfortunately, the investigators have no medication to treat the bad effects of head trauma. Part of the brain damage is due to toxic chemicals (including one called glutamate) that are released by the damaged nerves. Dexanabinol may prevent some of the bad effects of glutamate on the brain and may protect the brain against uncontrollable swelling and death.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexanabinol in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dexanabinol is a synthetic, non-psychotropic cannabinoid derivative that because of its dextro-configuration is compatible with activation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain. It combines the ability to block NMDA receptors and neuroinflammatory cascades in the same molecule. Dexanabinol scavenges free radicals, protects neurons from toxicity of free radical generators and inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced production of prostaglandin E2, NO and TNF-a by macrophages in culture.</detailed_description>
