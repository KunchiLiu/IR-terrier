	<brief_summary>The study aims at comparing virtual reality therapy (VRT) with a usual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program for agoraphobia. A waiting list represents the control condition. The investigators' purpose is to test a pure VRT compared with a pure CBT, as previous works suggest that the combination of the two methods are clinically effective. Patients receive a two-page information leaflet about the trial and sign an informed consent. After the first evaluation, they are randomized, in three centers (Lyon, Paris, Luxemburg), either to VRT (12 sessions) or CBT (12 sessions), or a waiting-list control condition for three months. After three months the waiting list is randomized to VRT or CBT. The follow-up is one year from entry into the active part of the trial.</brief_summary>
