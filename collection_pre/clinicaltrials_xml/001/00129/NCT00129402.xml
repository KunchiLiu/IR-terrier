	<brief_title>Effects of Ezetimibe With Simvastatin in the Therapy of Adolescents With HeFH (Study P02579)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 3 distinct periods. In Period 1, subjects received daily treatment for 6 weeks as part of either the ezetimibe with simvastatin group or part of the simvastatin monotherapy group. Subjects in the ezetimibe with simvastatin group received one of three treatments: coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus simvastatin 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or 40 mg/day. Subjects in the simvastatin monotherapy group received one of three treatments: ezetimibe placebo plus simvastatin 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or 40 mg/day. The primary and key secondary efficacy analysis were based on the evaluations performed during Period 1 and were presented as data for subjects pooled from either the ezetimibe with simvastatin treatment groups compared with data for subjects pooled from the simvastatin monotherapy treatment groups. In Period 2, subjects received ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus simvastatin 40 mg/day or ezetimibe placebo plus simvastatin 40 mg/day for 27 additional weeks maintaining the same treatment assignment (coadministration vs monotherapy) as in Period 1. In Period 3, all subjects received ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus open-label simvastatin daily for 20 weeks.</detailed_description>
