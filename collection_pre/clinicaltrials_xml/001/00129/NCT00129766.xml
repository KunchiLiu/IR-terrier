	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of motavizumab to palivizumab when administered monthly by intramuscular (IM) injection for the reduction of the incidence of RSV hospitalization among children at high risk for serious RSV disease. A secondary objective was to compare the incidence of medically-attended lower respiratory infections (LRIs) between treatment groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of MEDI-524 (Motavizumab) for the Prophylaxis of Serious Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Disease in High-Risk Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multi-center, multi-national trial conducted during 2 Northern Hemisphere RSV seasons with an intervening season in the Southern Hemisphere. Each child only participated during a single RSV season. Approximately 6,600 children at risk for serious RSV disease were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 15 mg/kg of palivizumab or motavizumab by IM injection every 30 days for a total of 5 doses.</detailed_description>
