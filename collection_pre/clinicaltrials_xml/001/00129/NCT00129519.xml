	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess whether basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions surgically treated with curettage, followed by imiquimod 5% cream as postsurgical adjuvant therapy, will have an improved cure rate over the ED/C historical norm of approximately 70% at 1-year posttreatment follow-up. A secondary objective is to assess cosmetic outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Imiquimod 5% Cream for Basal Cell Carcinoma Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, phase IIIb, multicenter, single arm, historical-controlled study. Biopsy-confirmed BCC lesions (1 per subject) were excised by curettage, with no electrodessication. Approximately 1 week later, treatment with imiquimod 5% cream was initiated. Imiquimod was applied to the target BCC once daily, 5 times per week (5x/week) for up to 6 weeks. Rest periods were allowed as needed. Subjects reported to the study center at treatment weeks 1, 2, and 6, and posttreatment at weeks 12, 26, and 52. At treatment week 6 and all posttreatment visits, the investigator clinically assessed the target site for tumor clearance and cosmetic outcome. A template made at initiation and created from clear plastic overlay aided in locating the target tumor site. If the investigator identified a lesion that had occurred or recurred at the target site, the subject was discontinued from the study and counted as a recurrence/persistence (R/P).</detailed_description>
