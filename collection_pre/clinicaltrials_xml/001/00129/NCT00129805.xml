	<brief_summary>Sarpogrelate (MCI-9042) is an antiplatelet drug that decreases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in platelets via a blockade of 5-HT2 receptors; it has been used in atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. S-ACCESS was a randomized, double-blinded trial to compare the relative efficacy of sarpogrelate (100mg three times daily) and aspirin (81mg once daily) in 1510 patients with recent cerebral infarction. Patients were followed for 0.9 to 3.5 years. The primary endpoint was recurrence of cerebral infarction; relative safety was also assessed.</brief_summary>
