	<brief_summary>The primary rationale for this study is to develop an optimized schedule of administration of FOLFOX + bevacizumab that maximizes the efficacy and safety of this regimen when administered to patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The hypothesis is that the use of an intermittent oxaliplatin (IO) schedule of FOLFOX/bevacizumab will allow these patients to continue on treatment for a longer period of time by reducing the proportion of patients who discontinue therapy early because of treatment-related toxicities and thus increasing the possibility of a longer time to progression. The primary objective is: - To test the hypothesis that an intermittent oxaliplatin (IO) schedule of FOLFOX/bevacizumab will allow patients to remain on therapy for a longer period of time compared to a conventional "treat-to-failure" schedule, by reducing the proportion of patients who discontinue therapy for treatment-related toxicities. The secondary objectives are: - To evaluate the impact of calcium/magnesium infusions on the incidence and severity of neurotoxicity in subjects receiving either the IO or conventional FOLFOX/bevacizumab treatment schedules as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. - To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IO versus the conventional schedule + calcium and magnesium infusions, as part of oxaliplatin-based first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
