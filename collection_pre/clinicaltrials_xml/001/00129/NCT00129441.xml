	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to determine whether the short-term (4 week), double-blind administration of Merck L-830982 provides evidence of improvement in cognitive functioning in stable male subjects with schizophrenia. This initial, small sample size study (n=9 on L-830982 and n=6 on placebo) is restricted to males in order to reduce the variance that might be attributable to the well-documented sex differences in the clinical features of schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
