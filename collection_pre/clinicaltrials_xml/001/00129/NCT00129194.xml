	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of KP-1461 given every 12 hours for 14 days when administered to HIV+ patients who have failed multiple highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens. Patients currently on HAART will be required to discontinue all HAART medications for up to 6 weeks after screening eligibility has been determined.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>KP-1461 is a carbamate prodrug of the active nucleoside, KP-1212. KP-1212 is incorporated into the proviral DNA. After multiple rounds of replication, KP-1212 increases the high inherent mutation rate of HIV beyond the threshold of viability, a process called "viral decay acceleration". KP-1212 is unique from conventional nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in that it inserts mutations randomly across the entire 10,000 nucleotide HIV genome and does not exert selective pressure by targeting a specific viral or cellular process, thus potentially avoiding drug resistance.</detailed_description>
