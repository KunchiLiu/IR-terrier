	<brief_title>Low-Dose Naltrexone Combined With Bupropion to Stop Smoking With Less Weight Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label smoking cessation clinical trial of 25 mg naltrexone with 300 mg bupropion sustained-release (SR) in six male and fourteen female participants. This pilot study is being conducted to determine: - effect size estimates for smoking cessation and post-cessation weight gain, which will be used to compute the sample size needed for a large-scale clinical trial; and - compliance with a combination of 25 mg naltrexone and 300 mg bupropion SR. In addition to examining the sample in this study, the investigators plan to compare this sample to a sample of matched controls.</detailed_description>
