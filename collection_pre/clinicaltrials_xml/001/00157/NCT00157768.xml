	<brief_summary>Of the patients who survive hospitalization after an acute myocardial infarction, ca. 10% die of sudden cardiac death in the following 2 years. The prognosis appears not improved by medication with antiarrhythmics (class I/III). A positive effect of beta-blockers (Metoprolol CR/Zok) on total mortality after myocardial infarction in patients with heart failure is well established. On the other hand, an implantable defibrillator (ICD) proved to be superior to medication when used for secondary prevention in patients after cardiac arrest. The question arises whether ICD therapy is also effective in primary prevention in high risk patients after acute myocardial infarction. This study determines if patients, who were defined as high risk patients in the early post infarction phase by means of noninvasive methods, benefit from primary prevention by means of an ICD. Special emphasis is put on an individual optimization of the infarction therapy, including beta-blockers.</brief_summary>
