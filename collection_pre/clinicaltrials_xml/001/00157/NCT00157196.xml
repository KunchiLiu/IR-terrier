	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to document the safety of tecemotide (L-BLP25) phase III formulation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects with unresectable Stage III disease. This population includes Stage IIIA NSCLC subjects, a population not studied in former clinical studies with this vaccine. The secondary objective is to document the survival of subjects treated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically documented unresectable stage III NSCLC. Mediastinal (N2) involvement must be confirmed by biopsy Stable disease or clinical response after primary therapy of chemoradiation treatment for unresectable stage III disease Primary therapy should be a minimum of 2 cycles of Platinumbased firstline chemotherapy, given concurrent with thoracic radiation. The combined modality should consist of either: induction (2 cycles) chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy; or concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy; or concurrent chemoradiation therapy alone A minimum radiation dose of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 6,000 centigray (cGy) should be administered. Subjects must have completed the primary therapy at least 4 weeks and no later than 6 months prior to study entry Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply Undergone lung cancer specific therapy (including surgery) prior to primary chemoradiation therapy Received immunotherapy/systemic immunosuppressive drugs/investigational systemic drugs within 4 weeks prior to study entry Subjects with brain metastases, pleural effusion, unless cytologically confirmed to be nonmalignant Past or current history of neoplasm other than lung carcinoma, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years Autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency Clinically significant hepatic, renal dysfunction or cardiac diseases Clinically significant active infection Pregnant or lactating, women of childbearing potential, unless using effective contraception as determined by the investigator Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply</criteria>
