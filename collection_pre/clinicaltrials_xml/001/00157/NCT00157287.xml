	<brief_summary>Protocol directed weaning has been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of tertiary centres. However, this benefit has not previously been studied in a community hospital setting. We therefore sought to evaluate the impact of an evidence-based weaning guideline on the outcomes for patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICUs of community hospitals in a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 11 community hospitals.</brief_summary>
