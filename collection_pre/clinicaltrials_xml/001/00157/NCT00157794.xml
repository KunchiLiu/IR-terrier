	<brief_summary>Right ventricular apical pacing in patients treated with a pacemaker is unnecessary in cases where patients have stable atrioventricular (AV)-conduction. Recent findings demonstrate that pacing even might have unfavourable effects, especially if patients suffer from additional cardiac diseases such as heart failure. The Search AV+ algorithm was designed to avoid ventricular pacing and support intrinsic AV-conduction in order to avoid possible detrimental effects of right ventricular apical pacing. The goal of the EnTRINSIC study is to assess the amount of ventricular stimulation, the amount of hospitalizations, the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and the usage of drugs in patients treated with pacemakers with an activated Search AV+ algorithm versus patients treated with an individual optimization of the pacemaker settings to minimize the amount of right ventricular pacing.</brief_summary>
