	<criteria>Subject has completed Baxter protocol 069901 Subject is HIV1 seronegative or, if HIV1 seropositive, has a CD4+ lymphocyte count &gt;= 400/mm3 documented within three months of the screening visit Subject (and his legally acceptable representative, in the case of study participants &gt;= 10 and &lt; 18 years of age) has been informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provisions, and signed and dated the informed consent form approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC and Baxter The subject received factor VIII products other than rAHFPFM upon completion of Baxter protocol 069901 The subject developed an inhibitor to factor VIII, measured in the central laboratory, during Baxter protocol 069901. An inhibitor is defined as a Bethesda titer &gt; 1.0 or, if Bethesda titer &lt; 1.0, confirmation using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay with a titer &gt; 0.6 The subject is scheduled to receive an immunomodulating drug other than antiretroviral chemotherapy (e.g., ainterferon, steroids) during the course of the study The subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures</criteria>
