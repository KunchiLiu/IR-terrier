	<brief_summary>This study examines whether low intensity, dose adjusted warfarin prolongs the time to mechanical failure of hemodialysis catheters without resulting in an unacceptable rate of bleeding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Access II - Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Malfunction of Haemodialysis Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving or about to initiate hemodialysis are randomized to receive either adjusted dose warfarin to achieve an INR of 1.5-1.9 or adjusted dose placebo within 72 hours of hemodialysis catheter placement. The primary outcome is mechanical failure of the catheter, as outlined below.</detailed_description>
