	<mesh_term>Hemophilia A</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Factor VIII</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age &gt;= 5 years The subject has severe or moderately severe hemophilia A defined by a baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 2% of normal documented at screening or historically (e.g., at hemophilia diagnosis) Subjects may enroll regardless of their serologic status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) The subject requires a surgical, dental or other invasive procedureeither elective or emergency The subject has a history of at least 150 exposure days for all other factor VIII products (as estimated by the study site investigator) prior to study entry The subject has a life expectancy of at least 28 days from the day of surgery The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provisions, and signed and dated the informed consent form approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC and Baxter BioScience The subject has a detectable inhibitor to factor VIII in the local hemostasis laboratory at the investigative site at the time of enrollment The subject has a history of inhibitor to factor VIII &gt; 1.0 BU. Note: If the subject has a history of an inhibitor titer &gt; 1.0 BU at any time prior to enrollment but demonstrated expected clinical responses to conventional doses of factor VIII therapy, the subject may enroll The subject has known hypersensitivity to Recombinate The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug study, or has participated in any clinical trial involving an investigational drug within 30 days of study entry The subject has clinical and/or laboratory evidence of abnormal hemostasis from causes other than hemophilia A (e.g., latestage chronic liver disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation) The subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures.</criteria>
