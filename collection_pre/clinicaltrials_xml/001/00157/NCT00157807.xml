	<brief_summary>The clinical effects of intra-operative radiofrequency ablation in patients with persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation and an indication for an implantation of a heart valve prosthesis or coronary bypass surgery are the purposes of this study. The study will examine if and to what extent the quality of life and the use of medical care differs between patients with and without ablation. Furthermore, there will be thorough echocardiographic examinations of the heart to detect differences between the different treatment groups. The patients will be followed for one year after treatment.</brief_summary>
