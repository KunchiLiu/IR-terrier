	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) effectively relieves angina, results in longer survival, and a better quality of life in specific subgroups of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Due to the high incidence of coronary artery disease worldwide, as well as the effectiveness of the surgical procedure, CABG surgery makes up one of the top ten most frequently performed procedures in North America and Europe. In the United States it is estimated that over 700,000 CABG procedures are performed per year. Despite the benefits of CABG surgery, patients undergoing these procedures may also suffer serious adverse outcomes including operative mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ventricular failure, life-threatening arrhythmia, renal insufficiency, and stroke. Some of the proposed causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG include perioperative ischemia, inadequate myocardial protection and reperfusion injury. The impact of these serious complications is significant. Incidence rates of death and MI following CABG surgery range from 5% to 12% depending on risk status. Results from large clinical trials have recently demonstrated the importance of neurologic deficits as a problematic outcome of CABG. These deficits include memory impairment, psychomotor, visuospatial, attention and language abilities as measured by neuropsychological testing as well as sensori-motor abnormalities associated with stroke. MC-1 is a naturally occurring small molecule. Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies suggests that MC-1 protects the heart from ischemic damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury. This trial will assess the effects of MC-1 compared to placebo on cardiovascular and neurological events following CABG surgery.</detailed_description>
