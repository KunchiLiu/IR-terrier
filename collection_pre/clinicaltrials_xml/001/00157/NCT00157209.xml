	<brief_summary>This is a prospective open label, controlled, randomized study to test the safety and efficacy of active specific immunotherapy with tecemotide (L-BLP25) for the treatment of subjects with Stage IIIB or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To be eligible, subjects entering the trial will have to demonstrate either stable disease or a clinical response after first-line treatment (chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2. Following a 3 week washout period, subjects will be stratified by disease status (either Stage IIIB locoregional disease or Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion and Stage IV), and randomized to either best supportive care (BSC) plus tecemotide (L-BLP25) treatment or BSC alone.</brief_summary>
