	<brief_summary>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a means of artificially performing the function of the human lung and/or heart outside the body. Its use is escalating in a wide range of clinical settings in the adult population without evidence or guidelines to support this practice. This study involves a nationwide questionnaire which has two components. The initial pilot survey will attempt to identify all institutions currently practicing ECMO or those intending to do so in the future, and are willing to participate in prospective data collection. The second phase will involve a monthly survey of these centres regarding the extent of ECMO use, practice details implemented, and outcome data. It is hoped that the collection of this information will later assist in the development of guidelines for this expensive and presently unsubstantiated practice, together with the construction of appropriate training programs for staff.</brief_summary>
