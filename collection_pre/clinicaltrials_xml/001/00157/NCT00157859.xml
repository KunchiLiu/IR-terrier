	<brief_summary>Multidrug resistant strains of P.falciparum and P.vivax are becoming increasingly prevalent in the Asia Pacific rim. To determine the efficacy of locally recommended antimalarial protocols in Papua, Indonesia, consecutive patients presenting to a rural clinic were enrolled into a prospective efficacy study. Patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and those with vivax malaria with chloroquine monotherapy. Patients failing therapy received unsupervised oral quinine +/- doxycycline for 7 days. Follow-up was continued for 42 days for falciparum malaria and 28 days for vivax malaria. The study hypothesis was that current recommended antimalarial protocols were no longer effective.</brief_summary>
