	<brief_title>The Heat Study: 2 Year Lifestyle Intervention in Overweight Women to Encourage Weight Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although short term weight loss is often achievable in overweight individuals, long term maintenance is generally poor. The researchers urgently need new information regarding the most cost effective programme(s) for maintenance of weight loss. This study will recruit 200 women and compare two approaches for providing support: one with intensive health professional support, the other peer group support facilitated by a research nurse with frequent 'weigh- ins'. The researchers will also compare two different diets one a high carbohydrate, high fibre, low glycaemic index diet versus one relatively high in monounsaturated fat and protein and low in glycaemic load.</detailed_description>
