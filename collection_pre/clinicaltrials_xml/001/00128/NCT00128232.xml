	<brief_summary>Currently, the first line treatment for acromegaly is surgery, in order to remove the adenoma causing overproduction of growth hormone which leads to acromegaly. Octreotide LAR is approved for treatment of acromegaly after surgery if the disease is not controlled. This study was aimed to test the safety and efficacy of octreotide LAR in acromegalic patients who did not have any previous treatment for acromegaly.</brief_summary>
