	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of Suc-HSA after consecutive daily intravenous (i.v.) doses. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability and the antiretroviral and immunological effects of consecutive daily i.v. doses of Suc-HSA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Succinylated Human Serum Albumin (Suc-HSA) for HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single centre, single arm study. Subjects will receive 5 consecutive daily doses of Suc-HSA at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the Special Investigation Unit (SIU), with a safety follow up on the SIU for 4 hours on day 1 and 2 hours on the next days. There will be follow-up visits on week 1, 2, 4 and 12. Standard safety parameters (physical examination, clinical symptoms, laboratory hematology and biochemistry) will be followed until week 12. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+/CD8+ cell counts will be assessed at every visit. Plasma drug levels (trough and peak) will be measured from baseline until week 2. 6 patients will be included in this study as described in this protocol amendment. Eligible subjects are chronic HIV-1 infected patients who have never been treated with antiretroviral treatment and for whom there is no need to start antiretroviral treatment. Test Product: Suc-HSA, a candidate HIV-1 fusion inhibitor. Duration of treatment: 5 days Criteria for evaluation: - Safety: symptoms, signs at physical examination, standard hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters- Efficacy: changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T cell count - Pharmacokinetics: plasma levels of Suc-HSA: Cmin, Cmax and AUC</detailed_description>
