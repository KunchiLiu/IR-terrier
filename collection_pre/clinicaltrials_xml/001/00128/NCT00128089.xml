	<brief_title>Trial of New Dietary Treatment of Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes is complicated and often fails. This is a dietary treatment that uses fingerstick testing of blood sugars and a remarkably simple algorithm to promptly lower the blood glucose to treatment goals. A series of 10 overweight type 2 diabetic patients not well controlled, or needing medication for control, will be recruited to follow this plan; followup is to be until 6 months after the last patient is enrolled, or when all patients have normal A1Cs with no medication, whichever comes first. Primary endpoints to be measured are A1C, weight loss (in pounds and BMI reduction) and medication reduction. Secondary endpoints are occurrences of hypoglycemia, reduction of medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and patient satisfaction. As this is a Phase 1 trial, the only control group is historical controls (the patients themselves and the medical literature).</detailed_description>
