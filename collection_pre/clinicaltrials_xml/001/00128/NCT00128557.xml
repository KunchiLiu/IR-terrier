	<brief_title>Community Trial of Newborn Vitamin A Supplementation to Reduce Infant Mortality in Rural Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, community trial of newborn vitamin A supplementation on mortality in the first six months of life. The trial is being implemented in 596 sectors (i.e. villages and/or smaller groupings), in two thanas comprising a population of ~580,000 in rural northern Bangladesh (Gaibandha/Rangpur area) and is nested within the JiVitA-1 maternal supplementation study. Women residing in the study area are already under 5-weekly pregnancy surveillance conducted by village-based field staff as part of the maternal supplementation trial. During their third trimester of pregnancy, women are visited by a study supervisor who explains the purpose and procedures of the study. After obtaining informed consent, women are interviewed for possible risk factors in the third trimester of pregnancy, including a 30-day history of morbidity, a 7-day dietary and alcohol intake and tobacco use questionnaire, a 7-day household chores questionnaire, and maternal anthropometry (mid upper arm circumference measurement). Upon birth, household members contact the village-based field staff who immediately administers the vitamin A or placebo to the infant, according to sector assignment. After supplementation, newborns are measured for weight, length and mid-upper arm, head and chest circumference, and then followed weekly for vital status for three months, and again at six months of age. A child death initiates the process of death verification and cause of death determination.</detailed_description>
