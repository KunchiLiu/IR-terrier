	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Aztreonam for Inhalation Solution (AZLI) in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Patients With Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with CF often have lung infections that occur repeatedly or worsen over time. The lung infections are often caused by PA. Treatment with antibiotics is used to reduce the presence of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given orally, intravenously, or inhaled as a mist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether AZLI, an investigational formulation of the antibiotic aztreonam, is safe in repeated courses in patients with CF and PA. A course of AZLI treatment in this study comprised 28 days, followed by a 28-day period off treatment. Participants could receive up to 9 courses of AZLI, with a total time on study of up to 18 months. Safety and efficacy results for the 18-month, 9-course period are reported, with efficacy results presented on a by-treatment course basis.</detailed_description>
