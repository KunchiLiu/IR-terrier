	<brief_title>Psychodynamic Therapy for Treating Panic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial of a manualized form of brief psychodynamic psychotherapy in comparison with applied relaxation training, a less active form of treatment in other studies, for adults with primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) panic disorder. Forty nine patients who have signed written consent who have primary DSM-IV panic disorder have been entered into the study. Randomization has been stratified by presence of major depression and use of psychoactive, anti-panic medications. Medications, if present, have been held constant. All patients have received 24 sessions of either psychodynamic psychotherapy, or applied relaxation training for panic disorder. This study is currently closed for recruitment, although final follow-up assessments have yet to be completed.</detailed_description>
