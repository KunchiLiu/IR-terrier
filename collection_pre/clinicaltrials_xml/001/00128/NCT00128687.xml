	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Evidence from extensive population studies and clinical trials shows the effectiveness of risk factor management in reducing morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease (CAD). These studies have generated important national clinical practice guidelines. Current prevention practices, however, fall short of attaining the goals recommended in these national guidelines. These shortfalls lead to unnecessary CAD disease burden, as well as perpetuation of socioeconomic disparities. Case management proves to augment current CAD prevention activities and improve adherence with national guidelines. The Stanford Health Education and Risk Reduction Training (HEAR2T) program is an innovative, yet well-tested, case management tool which will be evaluated in this study. HEAR2T has been developed and evaluated in several studies at Stanford. It is based upon the social cognitive model of Bandura and uses case managers to work intensely with patients to educate them and change their overall behavior related to health. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The Stanford Health Education and Risk Reduction Training (HEAR2T) program will be evaluated in a high-risk population of low socioeconomic status (SES) served by the county health care system of San Mateo County (SMC), California. The study will: 1) enhance the HEAR2T program for use in low-SES populations; 2) implement this program as an integral part of clinical care; 3) implement a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of HEAR2T in lowering aggregate CAD risk; 4) determine if HEAR2T diminishes socioeconomic disparities; 5) estimate HEAR2T's cost effectiveness; and 6) transition the intervention from a research study to an ongoing County CAD case management program. The primary outcome measure will be change in aggregate CAD risk score, calculated from a Framingham model based on individual CAD risk factors. The primary hypothesis is that patients case-management via the HEAR2T model will produce favorable changes in aggregate CAD risk score compared to control patients in usual care. An estimated 200 intervention and 200 usual care patients will be enrolled from four health centers in the SMC system. Usual care patients will crossover to the intervention after 15 months, allowing for additional assessment of the intervention's impact. Continued follow-up of the participants will assess the durability of risk changes achieved during initial intensive case-management. This study will make a critical and innovative contribution to defining optimal disease management in a low-SES population.</detailed_description>
