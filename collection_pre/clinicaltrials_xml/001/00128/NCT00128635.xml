	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody TNT-1/B (^131I MOAB TNT-1/B), can find tumor cells and carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B in treating patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iodine I 131 Monoclonal Antibody TNT-1/B in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody TNT-1/B in patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Secondary - Determine the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of this drug in these patients. - Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. - Determine the overall survival, median time of survival, and 6-month survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of therapeutic doses of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody TNT-1/B (^131I MOAB TNT-1/B). The first 12 patients accrued to the study undergo stereotactic placement of 2 catheters within the contrast-enhancing tumor on day 0. These patients then receive an imaging dose of ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B interstitially over approximately 25 hours on day 1 followed by dosimetry, biodistribution evaluations, and whole body imaging over an 8-10 day period. Beginning at least 2 weeks, but no more than 4 weeks later, all patients undergo catheter placement as above. One day later, patients receive a therapeutic dose of ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B interstitially over approximately 25 hours. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating therapeutic doses of ^131I MOAB TNT-1/B until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 3 weeks, at 6 weeks, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks (for the first 12 patients accrued to the study), every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
