	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leuprolide Acetate 3.75 mg Depot to Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Other assessments include evaluation of main leuprolide PK parameters in 12 subjects after administration of 3 doses. Study Design: This will be a multi-center, open-label, fixed investigation of six monthly dosages of leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg administered to patients with histologically proven carcinoma of prostate, who might benefit from medical androgen deprivation therapy. A total of 120 male patients will receive a single, i.m. injection of leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg initially on study day 0 (after baseline assessment) and then monthly (i.e. every 28 days) for five months. 12 of the patients will also have plasma leuprolide levels measured for PK analysis during the first 3 injection periods (PK group). These patients will belong to pre-defined study sites.</detailed_description>

Blood donations/losses within 2 months of baseline, apart from previous prostatic surgery patients (see earlier exclusion [9]; please note that these patients should not be included in the pharmacokinetic [PK] group) Known hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH agonist, including any LHRH analogues, or any excipients of the study formulation History of the following prior to the study: immunization (within 4 weeks of baseline); flu shots (within 2 weeks of baseline); anaphylaxis; skin disease which would interfere with injection site evaluation; dermatographism will be documented at screening and followed up while on treatment.</criteria>
