	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II trial to assess the efficacy of the GAT neoadjuvant regimen in patients with stage III breast cancer, confirmed by true-cut or open biopsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine, Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel (GAT) as Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2 treatment cycles of chemotherapy (one cycle = 2 weeks) must be administered to each patient before breast surgery. The required number of patients has been calculated following Simonâ€™s method. 43 patients will be enrolled in two phases: first, 29 patients must be enrolled, and at least 2 pathological complete responses obtained. Patients recruitment will continue until 43 patients have been enrolled. Assumptions are that there is a 95% probability to obtain a rate of pathological complete responses of at least 10%.</detailed_description>
