	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer form forming, growing, or coming back. Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response against human papillomavirus and may be effective in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer. It is not yet known whether human papillomavirus vaccine is more effective than hepatitis A vaccine in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying human papillomavirus vaccine to see how well it works compared to hepatitis A vaccine in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer in younger healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine To Prevent Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia or Cervical Cancer in Younger Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary •Demonstrate the efficacy of the candidate vaccine, human papillomavirus 16/18 (HPV 16/18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP)/AS04 vaccine compared with control in preventing grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix, or invasive cervical cancer (CIN2+) associated with HPV 16 or HPV 18 cervical infection in younger healthy participants who are negative for HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the corresponding HPV type at months 0 and 6. Secondary - Determine the duration of protection against HPV 16 or HPV 18 cervical infection in participants treated with the HPV 16/18 L1 VLP/AS04 vaccine. - Determine the safety of this vaccine in these participants, regardless of their initial HPV 16/18 DNA status. - Evaluate the efficacy of the candidate vaccine, HPV 16/18 L1 VLP/AS04 vaccine compared with control in preventing CIN2+ associated with any oncogenic HPV type cervical infection in participants who are negative for HPV DNA by PCR for the corresponding HPV type at months 0 and 6. - Compare the efficacy of the candidate vaccine with control in preventing CIN2+ associated with HPV 16 or HPV 18 cervical infection, detected within the lesional component of the cervical tissue specimen by PCR, in participants who are negative for HPV DNA by PCR for the corresponding HPV type at months 0 and 6 and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at month 0. - Compare the efficacy of the candidate vaccine with control in preventing persistent HPV 16 or HPV 18 cervical infection in these participants. - Determine the immunogenicity of HPV 16/18 L1 VLP/AS04 vaccine by ELISA and V5/J4 monoclonal antibody inhibition enzyme immunoassay in the first 600 participants randomized to receive HPV 16/18 L1 VLP/AS04 vaccine. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Participants receive human papillomavirus 16/18 L1 virus-like particle/AS04 vaccine intramuscularly (IM) once in months 0, 1, and 6. - Arm II: Participants receive hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix®) IM once in months 0, 1, and 6. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed at 6 months and then at least annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 7,500 participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
