	<brief_title>Effect of Tactile and Kinesthetic Stimulation on Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infants birth weight equal or less than 1500 grams and gestational age equal or less than 32 weeks will be randomized in two groups: standard care that will receive the usual treatment applied to all infants admitted to our unit and a second groups that will receive standard care plus maternal tactile and kinesthetic stimuli that will be taught to the mothers. Randomization will be performed among those that accept to participate in the study.
