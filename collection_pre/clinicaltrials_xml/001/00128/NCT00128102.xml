	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor effectiveness of an oral investigational drug, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, in the treatment of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (Vorinostat, MK-0683) Versus Placebo in Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (0683-014 AM5, EXT1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Extension Phase: Participants in this study will be eligible to enroll in an open-label treatment extension phase if they: a) were originally randomized to the vorinostat arm and have not experienced disease progression; b) were randomized to the placebo arm and meet the "Extension Phase Inclusion Criteria for Participants in the Placebo Arm" below; or c) were originally randomized to the vorinostat arm and discontinued study therapy for reasons other than progression and the investigator believes that it is in the participant's best interest to resume vorinostat treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Participant must be 18 years or older with confirmed diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma In countries where pemetrexed an approved mesothelioma treatment, the participant's disease has progressed or relapsed following treatment with at least one prior chemotherapy regimen with pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin OR In countries where pemetrexed is not approved for mesothelioma, the participant's disease has progressed or relapsed following treatment with at least one prior chemotherapy regimen OR Pemetrexed is not the preferred therapy for the participant and the participant's disease has progressed or relapsed following treatment with at least one prior chemotherapy regimen Participants must have received no more than 2 prior systemic therapy regimens Participant has a Karnofsky performance scale status of ≥70 Participant must have adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function and adequate coagulation (per prespecified laboratory values) Extension Phase Participants who are receiving treatment with vorinostat and have not experienced progression of mesothelioma Participants who were randomized to the placebo arm and are: 1) have a Karnofsky performance scale status of ≥70; and 2) have adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function and adequate coagulation (per prespecified laboratory values) Participants assigned to vorinostat who have discontinued study therapy for reasons other than progression of mesothelioma, if the investigator is of the opinion that the potential benefit outweighs potential risks associated with using vorinostat Exclusion Criteria : Participant has been treated with a Histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitor Participant has an active infection for which they received treatment with intravenous antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal medications within 2 weeks of the start of study drug. Participants with a "currently active" second malignancy. A malignancy is not considered "currently active" if participants have completed therapy for the second malignancy and are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years Participant has uncontrolled brain metastases Participant has a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or HIVrelated malignancy Participant is pregnant or breast feeding Participant has a history of gastrointestinal surgery or other procedures that might interfere with the absorption or swallowing of the study drug Participants taking part in the predose spot and postfirst dose 24hour urine collections must exclude medications containing acetominophen or paracetamol for one week prior to the start of vorinostat therapy and during the entire period of urine collection Participants taking part in the predose spot and postfirst dose 24hour urine collections may not be using hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis</criteria>
