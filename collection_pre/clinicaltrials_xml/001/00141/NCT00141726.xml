	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of etanercept in the treatment of patients with sub-acute lung injury following a bone marrow transplant. This study will also examine the toxicity of treatment with etanercept as well as whether there is an improved quality of life in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Enbrel (Etanercept) for the Treatment Sub-Acute Pulmonary Dysfunction After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung or breathing problems can develop several months to years following a bone marrow transplant. In some cases, these breathing problems develop without any signs of germs or infection in the lungs. The name for this type of breathing problem is called "Sub-Acute Lung Injury". Sub-acute lung injury often develops many months, even years following a bone marrow transplant. It is often characterized by shortness of breath, cough, wheezing and fatigue. Sub-acute lung injury can either lead to the formation of scar tissue in the lungs (making it difficult to take deep breaths), or it can cause the lungs to get weak (making people feel out of breath easily). Approximately 25 - 50% of patients with sub-acute lung injury may eventually die from the damage in their lungs. Typically, such patients die from infections that develop inside the damaged lungs. In this study, treatment with an experimental drug called Etanercept will be used. (Enbrel). The physicians feel there is the possibility that Etanercept may help improve breathing. Breathing ability will be assessed prior to treatment as well as during and after treatment so that comparisons can be made.</detailed_description>
