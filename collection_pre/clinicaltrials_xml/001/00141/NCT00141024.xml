	<brief_title>Safety of and Immune Response to the Experimental Preventive HIV Vaccine, EP HIV-1090, in Healthy, HIV-1 Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through the development of a safe and effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct, readily produced in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. EP HIV-1090 is a DNA HIV CTL vaccine; the proteins for which its genes code are designed to interact with CD8 cells (CTL) and cause CD8 cell proliferation. The DNA plasmids in EP HIV-1090 code for proteins conserved among HIV subtypes A, B, C, D, F, and G, which encompass the HLA subtypes of 85% of the worldwide general population. Participants will be enrolled in this study for 1 year. Group 4 participants will receive EP HIV-1090 or placebo at study entry and Months 1, 3, and 6. There will be 11 study visits that will occur at screening; study entry; and Months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12. A physical exam and risk reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling will occur at each visit. Participants will be asked about their adverse experiences from vaccination at each visit. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected visits.</detailed_description>

More information about this criterion can be found in the protocol. Any jobrelated responsibility that would interfere with the study Serious adverse reaction to vaccines. A person who had an adverse reaction to pertussis vaccine as a child is not excluded.
