	<criteria>Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathic pain syndrome, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or posttraumatic neuropathic pain (including postsurgical), confirmed by a qualified pain specialist. Subjects must have completed at least 4 daily pain diaries during the 7 days prior to Visit 2 and have an average pain score of â‰¥4 over the 7 days prior to Visit 2 (randomization). Neurologic disorders unrelated to DPN, PHN, or posttraumatic neuropathic pain (including postsurgical), that may confuse or confound the assessment of neuropathic pain. Presence of any severe pain associated with conditions other than DPN, PHN, or posttraumatic neuropathic pain (including postsurgical) that may confound the assessment or self evaluation of the pain due to DPN, PHN, or posttraumatic neuropathic pain (including postsurgical). Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min (estimated from serum creatinine, body weight, age, and sex using the Cockcroft and Gault equation in Appendix E). Maximum dose for subjects with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min is 300 mg/day</criteria>
