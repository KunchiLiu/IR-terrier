	<brief_summary>The AFORRD trial is asking three important questions: What proportion of people with Type 2 Diabetes are likely to be treated satisfactorily with a fixed dose of a statin that lowers blood cholesterol levels to help reduce the risk of heart disease? To what extent do omega-3 fatty acids lower blood triglyceride levels when given with or without a statin? Are there simple techniques that can help people to take their tablets on a regular basis?</brief_summary>
