	<brief_summary>PD-0332991 may work in cancer by stopping cancer cells from multiplying. PD-0332991 is in a new class of drugs called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK inhibitors). This research study is the first time that PD-0332991 will be given to people. PD-0332991 is taken by mouth daily.</brief_summary>
