	<brief_summary>For women with a fetus in breech presentation, does early ECV (at 34 0/7 up to 35 weeks and 6/7 days) versus delayed ECV (not before 37 weeks and 0/7 days) increase or decrease the likelihood of cesarean section (CS)?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early External Cephalic Version (ECV) 2 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Outcomes: Rate of Caesarean section Secondary Outcomes: Rate of preterm birth Other Outcomes: admission to neonatal intensive care unit â‰¥ 24 hours, perinatal or neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity, serious fetal complications, maternal death or serious maternal morbidity, non-cephalic presentation at birth, women's views, and health care costs. The Data Coordination for this study is being carried out at the Maternal, Infant Reproductive Health Research Unit at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Women with any breech presentation 2. A live singleton fetus 3. Gestational age of 33 weeks 0 days to 35 weeks 6 days 1. Contraindications to ECV (e.g. fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placenta, major lifethreatening fetal anomalies, uterine anomalies, hyperextended fetal head, rupture of membranes, severe oligohydramnios, severe polyhydramnios) 2. Contraindications to early ECV (e.g. increased risk of preterm labour [such as past history of preterm labour in this or previous pregnancies], increased risk of abruptio placenta [such as maternal hypertension]) 3. Contraindications to labour or vaginal delivery (e.g. placenta previa, previous classical CS) 4. Women planning delivery by CS if the fetus turns to cephalic 5. Women planning a vaginal delivery if the fetus remains breech 6. Women at increased risk of unstable lie (eg. grand multiparity) 7. Previous participation in EECV2 Trial</criteria>
