	<brief_summary>The optimal treatment of drug resistant (defined as BP&gt; 140/85 despite three anti-hypertensive drugs including a diuretic) is not well defined. This study aims to test the hypothesis that resistant hypertension is caused by excessive expansion of extracellular fluid volume. A secondary objective is to study which of three different antihypertensive drugs would be most useful in drug resistant hypertension.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following recruitment subjects will have ECV measured by 51Cr-EDTA determination of GFR, with Brochner-Mortensen correction applied. Subjects then receive the following drugs, in a randomised fashion, for a period of four weeks each, with BP &amp; ECV measurement at end of each period: doxazosin GITS (Cardura XL) 4 mg b.d.; frusemide 40 mg b.d.; amiloride 5 mg b.d.; placebo.</detailed_description>
