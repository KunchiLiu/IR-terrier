	<brief_title>Implementation of a New Strategy to Identify HNPCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre developed a new method to identify patients with HNPCC. This method appeared cost-effective and feasible. Using this new method 70% of the HNPCC patients will be identified as compared to less than 30% when the current method is used. However, this new method does not implement itself; large gaps exists between best evidence and daily practice. This study will compare an intensive strategy, consisting of distribution of educational materials, education, feedback and reminders, with a minimal strategy, only consisting of distribution of a critical care pathway. The aim is to find the most cost-effective strategy to implement the new method to identify patients with HNPCC in the Netherlands.</detailed_description>
