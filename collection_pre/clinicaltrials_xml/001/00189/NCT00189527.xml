	<brief_summary>Noninvasive ventilation is a therapeutic option in some patients with chronic respiratory failure. Patients usually ventilate during nightime with a domiciliary ventilator either in assist control or in pressure support mode. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy and the tolerance of assist control and pressure support modes during domiciliary noninvasive ventilation in patients with chronic respiratory failure.</brief_summary>
