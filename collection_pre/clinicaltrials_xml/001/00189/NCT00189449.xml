	<brief_summary>Seasonal/perennial allergic rhinitis (SAR/PAR) is a common childhood illness. One of the leading therapies for the treatment of SAR/PAR is intranasally inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). One of the major long-term safety concerns is whether ICS interferes with normal growth in allergic rhinitis children. Recent evidence suggests that nasal ICS may cause decreased growth. However, the effect of nasal ICS on long-term growth and the attainment of final adult height is unknown. Another potential systemic adverse effect of ICS use is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. The primary hypothesis of this study is that triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray (TAA) will have no effect on measured adult height in relation to target adult height in children with allergic rhinitis.</brief_summary>
