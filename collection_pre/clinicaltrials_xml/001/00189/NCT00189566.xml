	<brief_title>Taxol® in Monotherapy or in Combination With Topotecan or Carboplatin in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer in Early Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this research study is to find out if treatment of early relapse of ovarian or fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer with paclitaxel (Taxol*) weekly administered, in lower doses in combination with topotecan (Hycamtin*) or carboplatin will improve efficacy compared to weekly administration of paclitaxel in monotherapy. Tolerance in the three groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
