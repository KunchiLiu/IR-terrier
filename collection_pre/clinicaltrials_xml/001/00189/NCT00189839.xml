	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and to compare the efficacy and safety of a triple modified release tacrolimus FK506E (MR4) / MMF / steroid regimen with a triple standard tacrolimus FK506 / MMF / steroid regimen in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. It shall be demonstrated that FK506E (MR4) is non-inferior to FK506 with regards to the primary endpoint.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients receiving a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor or a living non HLA identical donor between 5 and 65 years of age with compatible ABO blood type. Patients with end stage kidney disease who are suitable candidates for primary renal transplantation or retransplantation (unless the graft was lost because of immunological reasons within 12 months). Patients receiving or having previously received an organ transplant other than a kidney. Patients with a high immunological risk, defined as a panel reactive antibodies (PRA) grade &gt;50% in the previous 6 months and/or with a previous graft survival of less than 12 months due to immunological reasons. Cold ischaemia time of the donor kidney &gt;30 hours.</criteria>
