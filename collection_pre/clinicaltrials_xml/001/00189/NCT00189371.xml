	<brief_summary>Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Relapse more than 6 months following first line chemotherapy is regarded as platinum/taxane sensitive disease. Reinduction chemotherapy with platinum/taxane is known to be an effective treatment option. Therapy induced anemia is a common problem resulting in decrease of quality of life. The rationale of this trail is to evaluate the effects of epoetin alpha on reduction of therapy induced anemia, rate of transfusions and on quality of life.</brief_summary>
