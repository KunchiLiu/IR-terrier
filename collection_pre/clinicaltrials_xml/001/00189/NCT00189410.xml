	<brief_summary>Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin as well as Carboplatin have been showed efficacy in monotherapy as in combination therapy of gynaecologic tumours. As there is no common standard in the therapy of recurrent ovarian carcinoma, tumours of the uterus nor for non-epithelial ovarian tumours at time of designing of this study, this trial shall evaluate the new and well tolerated combination therapy consisting of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Carboplatin.</brief_summary>
