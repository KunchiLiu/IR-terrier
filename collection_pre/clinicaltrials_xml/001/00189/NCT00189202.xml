	<brief_summary>African Americans receiving a kidney transplant are considered at high risk for early rejection of their transplanted kidney and require more immunosuppression to maintain their kidney transplant function. This increase in immunosuppression puts this group at risk for drug-related toxicities and complications such as post-transplant diabetes. This study will evaluate: 1. Whether a sirolimus based steroid avoidance regimen in African Americans may decrease the risks of drug-related toxicities, 2. Decreased rates of metabolic complications such as post-transplant diabetes, 3. The effect of Sirolimus plus a reduced dose cyclosporine on renal allograft function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Sirolimus-Based, Steroid Avoidance Immunosuppression African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open labeled prospective trial with race matched historical controls. The treatment group (experimental arm) will be African American de novo solitary renal transplant recipients. The control arm will consist of race matched solitary renal transplant recipients who received a Cyclosporine (CsA) -based immunosuppressive regimen. The subjects will be matched for organ source (living donor vs. cadaveric). The experimental treatment arm will have an immunosuppression regimen consisting of Sirolimus, Reduced dose cyclosporine, Thymoglobulin, and only 3 doses of steroids.</detailed_description>
