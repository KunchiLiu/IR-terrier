	<brief_summary>Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Many patients respond to additional cytotoxic treatment with partial or complete responses, yet approximately 100% of these patients will ultimately progress. Novel consolidation strategies following treatment for recurrent disease are needed and an immunologic approach is an attractive option.EpCAM is expressed in a large number of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer tissues. Thus targeting these cancers with an anti-EpCAM antibody is a promising innovative therapeutic approach.</brief_summary>
