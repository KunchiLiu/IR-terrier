	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety of the administration of a copper chelating agent, tetrathiomolybdate, for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that have failed previous treatment. The primary endpoint for this study is safety with secondary endpoints including change in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and quality of life.</brief_summary>
