	<brief_title>Cerebral Effects of Pegylated Interferon in Hepatitis C Positive Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with non-cirrhotic hepatitis C will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and neuropsychological testing prior to starting interferon. Subjects will have repeat testing following 12 weeks of interferon therapy and again at 12 weeks post interferon therapy. MR spectroscopy (MRS) will measure the cerebral metabolites, NAA (N-acetyl aspartate), Cho (choline), MI (myoinositol) and Cr (creatine) at 3 distinct brain regions, i.e. basal ganglia and 2 locations within the frontal cortex. Neuropsychological testing will include tests of the following cognitive domains: executive functioning, memory, language, motor skills and will also include questionnaires pertaining to quality of life (SF-36), mood (Beck's depression inventory) and a self-rating cognitive questionnaire (Conners' Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scales [CAARS]). Control subjects will include non-cirrhotic HCV subjects who are not taking interferon therapy.</detailed_description>
