	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Therapy With Herceptin and Taxol for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive Herceptin intravenously once weekly for 12 weeks, and Taxol intravenously every 3 weeks (week 1, week 4, week 7 and week 10). After 12 weeks of treatment, breast surgery will be performed (either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy). Once patients have recovered from the surgery, they will receive adriamycin and cytoxan every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (12 weeks total). After Herceptin and Taxol therapy, tumor assessment will be performed along with an echocardiogram and mammogram. At the time of surgery, re-assessment of the tumor will be done. Blood work will be performed on day one of each chemotherapy cycle.</detailed_description>
