	<brief_title>Comparing Paroxetine and Duloxetine on Cardiovascular Measures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind placebo-controlled study will test the hypothesis that greater reduction in heart rate variability will be associated with duloxetine than paroxetine in outpatients with major depressive disorder. We will also examine the relationship between changes in heart rate variability to the magnitude of serotonin and norepinephrine transporter occupancy produced by each drug.</detailed_description>
