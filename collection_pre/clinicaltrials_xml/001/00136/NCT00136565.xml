	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and the safety profile and toxicity of a combination of Velcade™ (bortezomib) with a standard chemotherapy regimen (ACVBP [doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone]) in the treatment of previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Bortezomib Combined With ACVBP in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized, non-competitive clinical study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of V-ACVBP chemotherapy in previously untreated patients aged from 18 to 65 years with peripheral T-lymphoma. It is anticipated that 60 subjects will be enrolled over two years (from June 2005 to May 2007). The duration of the treatment period is approximately 28 weeks and patients are followed until death. The total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years (from June 2005 to May 2010).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Previously untreated noncutaneous peripheral Tcell lymphoma, including human Tcell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1) related Tcell lymphoma, and natural killer (NK)cell lymphoma. Ages 18 to 65 years. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Written informed consent. Bcell lymphoma or other subtype of Tcell lymphoma including anaplastic large cell lymphoma AKL(+), lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary cutaneous Tcell lymphoma. Any previous therapy for lymphoma except for shortterm corticosteroids before inclusion. Inability to tolerate the ACVBP regimen according to investigator's judgement. Positive serology for HIV. Poor renal function (creatinin &gt; 150 µmol/l within 14 days before enrollment), poor liver function (total bilirubin &gt; 30 µmol/l, transaminases &gt; 2.5 upper normal limit [UNL] within 14 days before enrollment), unless these abnormalities are related to the lymphoma. Poor bone marrow reserve as defined by neutrophils &lt; 1.5 G/l or platelets &lt; 100 G/l within 14 days before enrollment, unless these abnormalities are related to the lymphoma. Patient with &gt;= grade 2 peripheral neuropathy nonrelated to lymphoma. Any central nervous system (CNS) disease. CNS or meningeal involvement by the lymphoma. Any serious active disease or comorbidity according to the investigator's decision. Any history of cancer during the last 5 years with the exception of nonmelanoma skin tumours or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Known hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol. Contraindication to any cytotoxic drug contained in chemotherapy regimen. Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential not willing to use an adequate method of birth control (i.e. hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of study. Men not agreeing to take adequate contraceptive precautions during the study. Treatment with investigational drug within 30 days before planned first cycle of chemotherapy and during the study.
