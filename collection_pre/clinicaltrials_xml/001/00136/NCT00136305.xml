	<brief_title>Comparing Asthma Action Plans for Pediatric Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma medical regimens are complex for families, requiring changes in the types and amounts of medication based on the frequency and intensity of symptoms. Written asthma action plans (AAP's) are commonly used to provide a set of instructions to help parents and children implement these complicated regimens. However, written AAP's require substantial literacy levels, so for younger children, low-literacy families, or non-English speaking families, a pictorial version of the AAP may be more understandable and useful. The study aims to validate a newly developed, fully pictorial AAP in terms of its relative impact on parent- and child-reported knowledge of the action plan, medication use, and parent- and child-reported satisfaction, when compared to a standard-care written AAP.</detailed_description>
