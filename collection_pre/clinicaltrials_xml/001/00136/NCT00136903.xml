	<brief_summary>To establish the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of Ex-vivo Cultured Adult HumanMesenchymal Stem Cells (Prochymal) in subjects experiencing acute GVHD, Grades II-IV,post HSC transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Adult Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Treat Acute GVHD.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol 260 - Subjects will be randomized with equal probability to the treatment arms (2 million cells/kg of Prochymal or 8 million cells/kg of Prochymal) using a stratified block design. The stratification factor is acute GVHD grade. For the purpose of stratification, the GVHD grades are II and III-IV. Treatment with investigational agent was administered on study Days 1 and 4. Patients were followed for safety and efficacy until Day 28 after initiation of treatment with the investigational agent, or until withdrawal or death, whichever occurred first. Protocol 261 - Subjects were evaluated for safety until 2 years from Day 1 of the preceding Prochymal® Protocol No. 260 until withdrawal or death.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Protocol 260 Subjects must be 18 to 70 years of age inclusive If female and of childbearing age, subjects must be nonpregnant, not breast feeding, and use adequate contraception. Males must use adequate contraception. Subject must have newly diagnosed, Grade IIIV acute GVHD requiring therapy. Biopsy for confirmation of GVHD is not mandatory, but is recommended when feasible. Enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy results. Subject must have received either full or reduced intensity myeloablative regimens followed by an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood, including DLI Subjects must have minimal renal and hepatic function as defined by: * Calculated creatinine clearance (CLcr) of &gt; 30 mL/min using the CockroftGault equation Subject must be available for all specified assessments at the study site through study Day 28. Subjects must provide written informed consent and authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Protocol 260 Subject has received previous treatment for Grade IIIV acute GVHD (except as noted in criterion 2). Subject has been treated for GVHD with methylprednisolone, &gt; 2mg/kg/day, for more than 72 hours prior to receiving Prochymal™ Subject has uncontrolled alcohol or substance abuse within 6 months of randomization. Subject has received an investigational agent (not approved by FDA for marketed use in any indication) within 30 days of randomization. Subjects may not receive an investigational agent during the 28day study period Subject has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the subject (e.g., uncontrolled infection, right heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, etc.) Subject has unstable arrhythmia Subject is unwilling to sign consent form for the longterm followup study, protocol No. 261 Subject has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products. Subject had received transplant for a solid tumor disease. Protocol 261 Subject must have received any treatment with the Investigational Agent in the preceding Prochymal® study. Subject must have completed their participation in a preceding Prochymal® study. If female and of childbearing age, subjects must be nonpregnant, not breastfeeding, and use adequate contraception. Male subjects must use adequate contraception. Subject must provide written informed consent and written authorization for disclosure and use of PHI.</criteria>
