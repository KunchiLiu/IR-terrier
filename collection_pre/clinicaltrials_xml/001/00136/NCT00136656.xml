	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of the therapeutic efficacy of cefixime by mouth (PO) 10 days (d) and ceftriaxone intravenous route(IV) 4d followed by cefixime PO 6d on renal scars 6 months after a first acute pyelonephritis episode. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with cefixime PO will allow no more renal scars than intravenous route (IV) treatment of pyelonephritis in infants and children less than 3 years old, 6 months after the first episode. If it is true, treatment will no longer need hospitalisation and the advantages for children, families and the health system will be very important.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Guidelines for treatment of acute pyelonephritis in infants and children are different from one country to another. The main question is the incidence of renal scars. intravenous route (IV) treatment is supposed to give the best results, but no previous study has ever given the incidence of renal scars after PO treatment. This multicenter, randomised trial is an equivalence study of PO and intravenous route (IV) treatments.</detailed_description>
