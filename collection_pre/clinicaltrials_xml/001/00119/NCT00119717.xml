	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, controlled, randomized, single-blind, multi-center study of NeuroFlo treatment plus standard medical management versus standard medical management alone. Randomization will be 1:1 and stratified to ensure equivalent patient distribution between treatment and control for the following key parameters: 1. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline (stratify &lt;10, 11-18) 2. Time from symptom onset (TFSO) to time of baseline NIHSS evaluation (stratify &lt;5 hrs, or ≥5 hrs).</detailed_description>
