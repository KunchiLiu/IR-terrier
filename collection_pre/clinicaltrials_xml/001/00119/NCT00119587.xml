	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare once a week and once every other week darbepoetin alfa on the change in hemoglobin levels between the screening/baseline period and the evaluation period (weeks 25-30). This study will also assess the change in mean hemoglobin over 4 week intervals, instability of hemoglobin concentrations, darbepoetin alfa dosing requirements and red blood cell transfusions.</brief_summary>
