	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: There is now unequivocal evidence that early coronary reperfusion using either thrombolytics or primary angioplasty results in a long-term mortality reduction among individuals who have had a heart attack. The benefit of early reperfusion (less than 6 hours after the heart attack) was initially attributed to myocardial salvage and the resultant preservation of left ventricular function. However, it is now known that the survival benefit associated with thrombolytic therapy is not consistently associated with a major improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). These observations led to the formulation of the "late open artery hypothesis," which suggests that clinical outcomes can potentially be improved by late reperfusion after a heart attack. Observational clinical studies have suggested that late patency of the infarct-related artery (IRA) after thrombolysis is associated with a survival benefit that is independent of LVEF and therefore cannot be solely explained by salvage of myocardium. Definitive proof of the late open artery hypothesis is currently lacking, however, because previous studies that have evaluated late percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of occluded IRAs after a heart attack have produced conflicting results. These findings led to the organization of the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), an international, NHLBI-funded, randomized trial of 2,200 participants. OAT is testing the hypothesis that mechanical reperfusion of an occluded IRA with PTCA and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 3 to 28 days after a heart attack in high-risk individuals will reduce mortality, recurrent heart attacks, and hospitalization for class IV congestive heart failure. Enhancement of electrical stability is one of the major mechanisms that has been proposed to explain the association of an open IRA with an improved prognosis independent of myocardial salvage. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This study is an ancillary study of OAT. It will characterize the effects of late PCI of occluded IRAs on the most important and clinically relevant noninvasive markers of vulnerability to malignant ventricular arrhythmias: heart rate variability, T wave variability, and signal-averaged electrocardiography. These analyses will be performed in 300 participants at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year following a heart attack in order to determine the effects of late PCI on the autonomic nervous system, ventricular repolarization, and ventricular conduction abnormalities.</detailed_description>
