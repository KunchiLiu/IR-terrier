	<brief_title>A Safety and Tolerability Study of Paliperidone Palmitate Injected in the Shoulder or the Buttock Muscle in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date, all prior trials involving intramuscular injection of paliperidone palmitate were conducted with buttock administration. This is a randomized, multicenter, crossover design study in evaluating safety and tolerability of paliperidone palmitate in two different injection sites. The study hypothesis is that there will be no difference in safety and tolerability between buttock injection compared to shoulder injection at any of the three different doses of paliperidone palmitate. The patients will receive intramuscular injections of paliperidone palmitate in either their buttocks or in their shoulders</detailed_description>
