	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, docetaxel, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with docetaxel and capecitabine works in treating patients with cancer of unknown primary origin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine, Docetaxel, and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Cancer of Unknown Primary Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the feasibility of positron emission tomography (PET) and pathology assessment in identifying the primary tumor site in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary. - Determine the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and capecitabine in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary. Secondary - Determine the frequency with which PET scan and pathology assessment can define the organ of origin in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, multicenter study. - Part 1: Patients undergo a comprehensive standard evaluation, including pathologic assessment and positron emission tomography scan, to attempt to identify the primary tumor site. If the primary tumor site is identified, the patient proceeds to appropriate treatment for that tumor off study. If the primary tumor site remains unknown, the patient proceeds to chemotherapy in part 2 of the study. - Part 2: Patients receive gemcitabine IV and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and 11. Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks and then every 6 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44 patients (10-29 for part 2) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
