	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing disease with acute flares. The standard therapy is to treat acute flares using topical medications. The two most common classes of topical medications for atopic dermatitis (AD) are topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Pimecrolimus and topical corticosteroids exert their activity by different mechanisms, there may be a synergistic effect of the combination therapy. Therefore, a combination therapy may provide a faster resolution of severe skin lesions and consequently reduce the duration of the topical corticosteroid treatment. Another benefit of the combination therapy maybe the use of a lower potency corticosteroid to achieve the same degree of clearance. The hypothesis of this trial is that the combination of the two agents will lead to faster clearance than the single agent of topical corticosteroids.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial is a double-blind controlled trial of fluticasone cream daily and pimecrolimus cream BID versus fluticasone cream daily and placebo cream BID for the treatment of acute flares of atopic dermatitis. While pimecrolimus cream 1% has been proven to be effective in mild and moderate Atopic dermatitis (AD), there is a need for a fast control of severe skin lesions. On the other hand, reducing the duration of the topical corticosteroid treatment is a reasonable approach to minimize the occurrence of adverse effects. Because pimecrolimus and topical corticosteroids exert their activity by different mechanisms, there may be a synergistic effect of the combination therapy. Therefore, a combination therapy may provide a faster resolution of severe skin lesions and consequently reduce the duration of the topical corticosteroid treatment. Another benefit of the combination therapy maybe the use of a lower potency corticosteroid to achieve the same degree of clearance. In vitro data have demonstrated that a combination of steroids and tacrolimus has synergistic effects on in vitro human lymphocyte proliferation. In addition, it has previously been reported, in a pilot investigation in two subjects, that a combination regimen of pimecrolimus 1% twice a day and fluticasone propionate cream 0.05% once daily was superior to fluticasone propionate cream 0.05% once daily in the acute treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). This study is conducted to validate these findings in a larger number of patients.</detailed_description>
