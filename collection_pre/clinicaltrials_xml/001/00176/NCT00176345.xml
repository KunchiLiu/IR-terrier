	<brief_summary>Bradykinin has been identified to contribute to the release of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and EDHF through activation of specific bradykinin 2 (B2) receptors, which is finally promoting a vasodilatory respone. Regular physical exercise training results in an improvement of endothelial function in patients with CAD. These positive effects were partially attributed to an increased expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) as a result of the training intervention. Aim of this trial is therefore to determine, whether the training-induced correction of endothelial dysfunction is also bradykinin-dependent.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total of 20 patients with stable coronary artery disease are prospectively randomized to 4 weeks of exercise training or sedentary lifestyle. Endothelial function of the radial artery is determined by a high-resolution A-mode ultrasound.</detailed_description>
