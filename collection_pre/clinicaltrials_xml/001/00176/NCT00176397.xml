	<brief_summary>Recent technical advances in percutaneous coronary interventions have made it possible to approach patients with coronary lesions formerly considered to be classical candidates for bypass surgery, e.g. patients with left main coronary stenosis. However, it is still unclear whether the good long-term results achieved with the surgical therapy can be reproduced by an interventional strategy using drug-eluting stents (DES). The aim of the current trial is, therefore, to compare the clinical and angiographic results of PCI and CABG in patients with left main coronary stenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) With Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) for Patients With Significant Left Main Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent technical advances in percutaneous coronary interventions have made it possible to approach patients with coronary lesions formerly considered to be classical candidates for bypass surgery, e.g. patients with left main coronary stenosis. However, it is still unclear whether the good long-term results achieved with the surgical therapy can be reproduced by an interventional strategy using drug-eluting stents (DES). The aim of the current trial is, therefore, to compare the clinical and angiographic results of PCI and CABG in patients with left main coronary stenosis. The study was planned as a "non-inferiority" trial based on the hypothesis that PCI may be able to reach similar long-term results as compared to CABG.</detailed_description>
