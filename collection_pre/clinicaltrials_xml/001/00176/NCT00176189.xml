	<brief_summary>Fixed-partial dentures fabricated of zircon-oxide ceramics were introduced in dentistry some time ago. However, the survival rate of all-ceramic extended (up to 47mm) fixed-partial dentures is unknown. The hypothesis was that long FDPs fabricated of zirkon-oxide withstand masticatory forces in the posterior and anterior regio of the jaw.</brief_summary>
