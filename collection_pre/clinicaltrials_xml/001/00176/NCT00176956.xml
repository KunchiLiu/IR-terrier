	<brief_title>Atopic Dermatitis-Like Skin Disease in Pediatric Heart Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to determine whether pediatric heart transplant patients with an atopic dermatitis-like rash report a personal and/or family history of atopy (asthma, allergies and atopic dermatitis). In addition comparisons will be made between the presence of atopy between patients with and without the skin rash. Comparisons will be made of systemic immunosuppressive therapies between patients with and without the atopic dermatitis-like rash. Determination will be made as to whether histologic characterization of a skin biopsy specimen is consistent with AD. Thorough evaluations will be made of patients in the clinic with this rash and the presence of bacterial superinfection will be ruled out.</detailed_description>
