	<brief_title>Improvement of Physical Activity and Correction of Body Mass Index in School Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increasing incidence of overweight children in Germany is due to a lack of physical activity and intake of unhealthy food. The importance of physical activity for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in adults was shown in several trials. Therefore we provide additional sport lessons over the period of one year in two defined schools in Leipzig with the aim to improve physical fitness in school children. Two other classes with the -in germany- usual quantity of sport classes served as control classes. In all classes at the beginning and at the end of the school year blood samples were taken, and a clinical investigation, a coordination test for children and a spiroergometer were performed. Additionally each child had to fill out a questionnaire. Endurance training is emphasized in the sport lessons.</detailed_description>
