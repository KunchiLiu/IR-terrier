	<brief_title>The Effects of Curcuminoids on Aberrant Crypt Foci in the Human Colon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laboratory studies have indicated that this agent, which is derived from plants and found in foods we eat, has anti-inflammatory properties and prevents colon cancer in animal studies. ACFs are small abnormalities in the lining of the colon that with time may grow into colorectal adenomas (also called polyps, growths or small masses of tissue on the lining of the colon or rectum which have the potential to become cancerous) which can then grow into adenocarcinomas (cancer) in the colon or rectum.</detailed_description>
