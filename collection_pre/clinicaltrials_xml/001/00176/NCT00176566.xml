	<brief_summary>You have been asked to participate in this research study because you have or may have oral leukoplakia. Oral leukoplakia is described as a white patch or plaque on the oral mucosa (mouth) that will not rub off and cannot be removed by scraping, reversed by elimination of obvious irritants (things that cause redness and/or swelling) such as dentures (artificial replacment for missing teeth), or lesions as described that are diagnosed by your dentist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial to Assess the Effects of Green Tea in Oral Leukoplakia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since oral leukoplakia may precede the development of cancer, using agents that may prevent cancer, called chemoprevention, may be useful. The purpose of this study is to determine whether taking a green tea preparation may have effects on your leukoplakia. It is hoped that these effects may reduce the subsequent risk of cancer in or around the area of leukoplakia. To assess for these effects, samples of the lining of your mouth will be obtained, and they will be analyzed looking for certain features (biomarkers).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with oral leukoplakia without evidence of active infections in the mouth will be invited to participate in this study. Patients must currently consume no more than 3 cups of tea a day, not be taking large doses of vitamin A or its derivatives (more than 25,000 units), selenium, or betacarotene.
