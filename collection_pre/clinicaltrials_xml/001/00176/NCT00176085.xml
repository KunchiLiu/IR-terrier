	<brief_summary>A study on the fate and elimination of 11-Nor-Delta9-carboxy-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was up to now not conducted, except of one single experiment in which (lacking) psychopharmacological activity was tested after intravenous infusion of 20 mg in a human individual. In this study, however, the authors did not trace the above questions due to analytical and methodological deficits. Aim of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of THCCOOH and THCCOOH-Glu after intravenous ad-ministration of 5 mg THCCOOH in healthy individuals</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of THCCOOH and Its Acyl-glucuronide After Intravenous Administration of THCCOOH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the pharmacokinetics of THCCOOH after intravenous administration of THCCOOH (5 mg) and its formed glucuronide in healthy individuals in order to improve the possibilities for the assessment of unfitness to drive. For these purposes the following criteria will be studied: THCCOOH - Primary: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtotal) Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) Time of Cmax (tmax) Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) - Secondary: Systemic and renal clearance (Cls, CLr) Volume of distribution of (Vc) Formed THCCOOH-glu - Primary: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtotal) Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) Time of Cmax (tmax) Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) - Secondary: Systemic and renal clearance (Cls, CLr) Volume of distribution (Vc)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Good state of health (physically and mentally) Any regular drug treatment within the last two months Any intake of a substance known to induce or inhibit drug metabolising enzymes or transport systems within a period of less than 10 times the respective elimination halflife Any acute or chronic illness or clinically relevant findings in the prestudy examination Allergies (except for mild forms of hay fever) or history of hypersensitivity reactions Smoking (regular or irregular) Excessive alcohol drinking (more than approximately 30 g alcohol per day) Positive drug screening especially THC or known or admitted drug abuse</criteria>
