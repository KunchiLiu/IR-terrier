	<brief_summary>This trial is designed to gain insight into the mechanism of action of eflornithine hydrochloride in men and to aid in determining if this compound is deserving of further development for a pseudofolliculitis barbae indication. This study will also provide knowledge which will be useful in designing future PFB trials in this indication is pursued.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 15% Eflornithine Hydrochloride Cream on African-American Males With Pseudofolliculitis Barbae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed mechanism of action of eflornithine hydrochloride for treatment of hair growth is that it reduces the rate of cell growth within the hair follicle by inhibition of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). In preclinical studies eflornithine hydrochloride was shown to inhibit ODC and decrease hair mass. In sheep, systemic inhibition of ODC by eflornithine hydrochloride markedly altered not only the length and diameter of hair fibers, but also the portion of the hair fiber cross-section occupied by paracortical cells, which are primarily found in straight hairs. In a Phase II study evaluating the effect of the drug in the treatment of female hirsutism, it was anecdotally noted that those who also had PFB showed an improvement in this condition.</detailed_description>
