	<mesh_term>Angina, Stable</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Angiographically documented CAD, with at least one coronary artery stenosis of more than 50% in a native segment never subjected to intervention, which is recommended for treatment with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Stable coronary artery disease Eligible patients could be asymptomatic or have class I to III angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS]) with documented myocardial ischemia Angina pectoris threshold &gt; 50 Watt (cycle ergometry) Permanent residence should be within 25 km of training facility. &lt; 18 or &gt; 70 years of age Patient currently participating in an exercise training program Unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction during the last 2 weeks Symptoms of CCS class IV Exercise limitations due to clinical conditions not related to CAD Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 40% Ventricular arrhythmia (Lown Ivb) Hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease Previous cardiac surgery PTCA performed during the last 12 months Any major noncardiac condition that would adversely affect survival during the duration of the study Reduced compliance</criteria>
