	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate whether patients with anorexia nervosa have elevated plasma cholesterol levels and, if elevated plasma cholesterol levels influence drug transport by the ABC-transporter P-gp (P-glycoprotein, MDR 1/ABCB1). We will isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and total RNA from the blood of patients with anorexia nervosa and healthy subjects as control. PBMCs will be used for quantitative cholesterol determination and for measuring the activity of P-gp using a FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) method (rhodamine123 efflux). Total RNA will be used for quantitative expression analysis of P-gp by reverse transcriptase real time PCR.</brief_summary>
