	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if capnography can be utilized to assist in the process of endotracheal intubation; specifically, in locating the glottic opening. Ultimately this would result in a new use of capnography to aid in securing normal and difficult airways. Currently capnography is only utilized for the confirmation of endotracheal tube placement. If successful, this study will provide information, and allow for the development of instrumentation that will assist in difficult airway management; specifically, in locating the glottic opening when visualization may be impaired. Ultimately, this technique will be useful for routine and emergency airway management.</brief_summary>
