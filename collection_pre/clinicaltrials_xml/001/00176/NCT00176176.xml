	<brief_summary>In this study, changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) and the hemodynamic state during ventricular fibrillation or induced ventricular tachycardia are investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Cognitive Function Before and After Induced Ventricular Fibrillation in Electrophysiological (EP) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a high risk of malignant tachyarrhythmia are routinely investigated by programmed electrophysiological study (EPS). To investigate the hemodynamic effects of ventricular arrhythmia to cerebral circulation an EEG and transcranial ultrasound are conducted simultaneously during the EPS. Before and after the EPS a neuropsychological test and an investigation of a specific blood sample (Neuron Specific Enolase, NSE) is done.</detailed_description>
