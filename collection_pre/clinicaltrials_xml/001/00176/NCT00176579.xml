	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Measuring bone mineral density may help doctors predict whether prostate cancer will come back. It may also help the study of prostate cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying whether bone mineral density affects cancer recurrence in patients with early stage prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Mineral Density and Cancer Recurrence in Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with clinically significant early stage prostate cancer. - Determine whether patients who have a higher level of BMD and have had a radical prostatectomy for cure are less likely to have an early relapse (i.e., less than 3 years) than those patients with a low level of BMD. OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study followed by a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study. Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with a densitometer. Posteroanterior measurements of the total hip are also recorded. Patients also undergo blood collection to examine markers that provide evidence of systemic disease. Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
