	<brief_title>Atomoxetine for Treatment of Weight Gain in Olanzapine or Clozapine Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a 6 month double-blind trial of atomoxetine in combination with a Weight Watchers group to help patients lose the weight they have gained taking olanzapine or clozapine. All participants should have been on Olanzapine or clozapine for at least 6 months and gained 7% of baseline weight or have a BMI of 27 or greater. In addition to the group support, participants are provided supervised exercise sessions and medical supervision. Previous studies of the group process alone were successful in helping patients lose weight. It is hoped that the addition of atomoxetine, which is known to cause appetite suppression, will be more effective in helping subjects lose weight. All subjects will receive either atomoxetine or placebo during the 6 month study.</detailed_description>
