	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells using this conditioning regimen in patients undergoing a hematopoietic (blood forming) cell transplant for an inherited metabolic storage disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior to transplantation, subjects will receive Busulfan intravenously (IV) via the Hickman line four times daily for 4 days, Cyclophosphamide intravenously via the Hickman line once a day for 4 days, and Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) intravenously (IV) via the Hickman line twice daily for three days before the transplant. These three drugs are being given to subjects to help the new marrow "take" and grow. On the day of transplantation, the donor's hematopoietic cells will be transfused via central venous catheter. After hematopoietic cell transplant, subjects will then receive two drugs, cyclosporin and either methylprednisolone or Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). Cyclosporin and methylprednisolone or MMF are given to help prevent the complication of graft-versus-host disease and to decrease the chance that the new donor cells will be rejected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, Gaucher's disease, Fucosidosis, Wolman disease, NiemannPick disease and Batten disease (CLN3) who have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)identical or haplotype mismatched (at 13 antigens) related marrow, or umbilical cord blood donor. One or two umbilical cord blood (UCB) units may be used. Patients with GM1 gangliosidosis, Tay Sachs disease or Sandhoff disease who have a HLAidentical or 1 antigen mismatched related or unrelated donor, or suitably matched umbilical cord blood unit(s). One or two UCB units may be used. Patients with adrenoleukodystrophy must have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, neurological and neuropsychometric function consistent with the diagnosis, and for boys with parietaloccipital dysmyelination a performance intelligence quotient (IQ) ≥80. In cases, when the performance IQ is not ≥80, the protocol committee may recommend transplant if the patient's clinical condition and neuropsychometric status are deemed to be acceptable based upon consideration of such factors as age at onset of cerebral disease, magnitude of change in performance IQ and neurologic deficits. Patients with arylsulfatase A deficiency (Metachromatic Leukodystrophy) must have either the presymptomatic late infantile, juvenile or adult form of the disease and must have acceptable neurological and neuropsychometric function. Patients with galactocerebrosidase deficiency (Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy) must have acceptable neurological and neuropsychometric function. Patients with acid lipase deficiency (Wolman disease) must have a liver biopsy that documents no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis, and acceptable neurological and neuropsychometric function. Patients with fucosidase deficiency (Fucosidosis) must have acceptable neurological and neuropsychometric function. Patients with glucocerebrosidase deficiency (Gaucher's Disease) must have acceptable neurologic and neuropsychometric function. Patients with Batten's disease (CLN3) must have acceptable Neurological and neuropsychometric function. Absence of major organ dysfunction. Organ evaluation results as follows: Cardiac: ejection fraction &gt;30% Renal: serum creatinine &lt;2x normal or creatinine clearance 60 mL/min. Hepatic: total bilirubin &lt;2x normal and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2x normal Signed consent. Patients with symptomatic late infantile form of metachromatic leukodystrophy. Patients with symptomatic infantile globoid leukodystrophy. Note: Patients with Hurler syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VI, or Mannosidosis disease are no longer eligible for this protocol, but can be transplanted under protocol MT 9907 (NCT00176917 Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Hurler Syndrome, Maroteaux Lamy Syndrome (MPS VI), and Alpha Mannosidase Deficiency (Mannosidosis)). Pregnancy Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or known HIV positive serology Patients or parents are psychologically incapable of undergoing bone marrow transplant (BMT) with associated strict isolation or documented history of medical noncompliance. Patients ≥ 50 kg may be at risk for having cell doses below the goal of ≥ 10 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg and therefore will not be eligible to receive unrelated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs)</criteria>
