	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: When irradiated donor lymphocytes are infused into the patient they may help the patient's immune system kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving irradiated donor lymphocytes works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irradiated Donor Lymphocytes in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with HLA-partially matched related donor lymphocytes. - Determine the rate and kinetics of clinical/radiological response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the rates of graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive irradiated donor lymphocytes IV over 1 hour on day 0. Treatment repeats every 8-16 weeks for up to 6 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood is collected periodically for research studies, including immunophenotypic analysis of cells and assay for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer-cell activity against target cells. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
