	<brief_summary>Perioperative stress for cataract surgery in the elderly is considerable even in the absence of pain. For these patients with a high comorbidity level, the perioperative situation comprising factors such as uncomfortable positioning, dull ambience, face cover, poor sedation, and anxiety might not only reduce intraoperative compliance but induce cardiac ischemia and hypertensive crises. Hypnosis is supposed to increase patient comfort, to shield the patient from organic stress and to improve intraoperative compliance without side effects even in old and very ill patients. In a controlled study, we, the investigators at the University of Heidelberg, compared phakoemulsification under topical anesthesia as usual (and placebo hypnosis) with either additional hypnosis or hypnoanalgesia without topical anesthesia.</brief_summary>
