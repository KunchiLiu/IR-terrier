	<brief_title>Dextromethorphan in Treating Patients With Fatigue Caused by Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the effects of dextromethorphan hydrobromide in patients with cancer-related fatigue. Secondary - Correlate the changes in cancer-related fatigue with the levels of plasma homocysteine versus red blood cell folate. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, pilot study. Patients receive oral dextromethorphan hydrobromide 3 times a day on days 1-7. Treatment repeats weekly for up to 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
