	<brief_summary>In this randomised, cross-over, controlled study, a total of 84 subjects will be included: 12 healthy non-smoking volunteers; 12 current smokers; 30 patients with mild steroid-naïve asthma; and 30 patients with mild-moderate COPD. Each subject will have 1 screening visit (if necessary) and 2 study visits. At visits 2 and 3 the effects of adenosine 5`-triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine 5`-monophosphate (AMP) challenge, given in a random order, will be tested.</brief_summary>
