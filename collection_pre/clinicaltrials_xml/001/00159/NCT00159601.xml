	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measuring and monitoring Quality of Life in children and youths continues to increase in importance to both researchers and decision makers. Only a limited number of well validated instruments that measure Quality of Life in children exists, and in Norway only few has been translated into Norwegian. Up to date there are no studies investigating the quality of Life in Norwegian child and adolescent psychiatric patients in a longitudinal perspective, compared to the normal population. Two generic Quality of Life instruments (KINDL, Bullinger &amp; Ravens-Sieberer 2000 and the ILC, Matejatt &amp; Remschmidt 1998) are introduced in Norway by this study in addition to the use of other well established measures like the "Child behaviour Check List" (Achenbach et al. 2001), etc. Comparisons: 400 patients and their parents in a child psychiatric outpatient clinic 2000 pupils from the normal population in the middle of Norway Repeated measures after 6 months in both groups. In addition a follow up study for the clinical group 3 years after referral started in june 2006.</detailed_description>
