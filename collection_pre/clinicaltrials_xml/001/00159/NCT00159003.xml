	<brief_summary>There are naturally occuring variations in the genetic makeup of all of us. Some of these variations may contribute to a change in susceptibility toward different diseases or change the prognosis. We are studying these genetic variations in patients with leukemia. The genes we are studying are those which influence detoxification of drugs and toxins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Genetic Factors Related to Predisposition and Prognosis of Hematological Malignancies in Israel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have prepared DNA on patients with leukemia (AML, CML and CLL) and we are studying the influence of polymorphisms in drug metabolism and disposition genes on predisposition and prognosis of these types of leukemia. The genes we are studying include: MDR1, CYP3A4, NQO1, NAT1/2, GST, hOCT. We plan to study other genes that may be contributory. Study includes comparing the frequency of polymorphisms in these genes with the frequency in the general population and the study of DNA biding proteins which bind at the sites of these polymorphisms.</detailed_description>
