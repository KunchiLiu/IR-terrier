	<brief_summary>Alpha thalassemia causes mild anemia and is found in many ethnic groups. Usually it is found in regions where malaria is endemic. We have found that alpha thalassemia is common in Ashkenazim, whose countries of origin are in temperate climates. We are analyzing the alpha globin genes of individuals of many ethnic groups and will compare to try to define the origin of thalassemia in these individuals of European extraction.</brief_summary>

We have found that alpha thalassemia is common in Ashkenazim, whose countries of origin are in temperate climates. We are analyzing the alpha globin polymorphisms to determine the haplotypes of individuals of many ethnic groups and will compare to try to define the origin of thalassemia in these individuals of European extraction.</detailed_description>
