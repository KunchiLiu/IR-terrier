	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of a simplified PI-based treatment regimen (Kaletra,ä) compared to conventional HAART regimens in patients infected with HIV-1 who are on their first boosted-PI antiretroviral treatment regimen. The potency of the antiviral activity of Kaletra has been clearly demonstrated in a wide spectrum of patients in a number of different clinical trials.6-9 The durable viral suppression seen after 4 years of therapy10 proves that it can provide effective, long-term treatment for people with HIV-1. Data from one of these trials (M97-720),6 an ongoing Phase II study of lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with NRTIs suggests there may be a role for monoclass therapy with Kaletra in the treatment of HIV-1-infection.</brief_summary>
