	<brief_summary>Patients with HIV an have a variable course of their infection. We are trying to identify factors which worsen or ameliorate the course of the disease. Such factors may be related to metabolism (breakdown) of drugs or to iron handling by the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Genetic Factors Which May Influence the Course of HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with HIV can have a variable course and the disease may be influenced by polymorphisms in drug metabolism and disposition genes such as MDR1 and CYP3A4. In addition, reports have linked changes in the course of the disease with iron status, with high iron being detrimental. We will study polymorphisms in these genes and correlate with clinical course in HIV patients and also with phenotype of drug resistance and disease parameters (such as CD4 counts and opportunistic infections).</detailed_description>
