	<brief_summary>This pilot study will measure the baseline levels and the intra- and inter-subject variability of exhaled (alveolar and bronchial) and nasal NO in smoking subjects with mild and moderate COPD on or off steroid treatment, smoking healthy volunteers and non-smoking mild asthmatics off steroids, using multiple exhalation flow rates. In addition, exploratory markers of iNOS activity (eg. 3-nitrotyrosine, nitrite, nitrate and 3-nitro-4-hydoxyphenylacetic acid) in blood, sputum, urine and exhaled breath condensate will be evaluated. We will also evaluate exhaled and nasal NO in a population of mild asthmatics in order to obtain baseline and variability data for future clinical studies involving asthmatic subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy volunteers (smokers) 1. Healthy subjects, defined as individuals who are free from significant cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological, malignancy, endocrine, neurological and psychiatric disease as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations. 2. Aged 4075 years inclusive. 3. Male or female 4. Body mass index within the range 1932kg/m2 inclusive. 5. Subject has a screening FEV1 measurement of &gt; 80% of predicted 6. Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. 7. Smokers with a pack history &gt;10 pack years [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked]. A smoking COPD subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: 1. COPD patients, defined as either Stage I or Stage II COPD diagnosis according to GOLD criteria Individuals must be otherwise healthy, individuals who are free from significant cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological, malignancy, endocrine, neurological and psychiatric disease as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations. 2. Aged 4075 years inclusive. 3. Male or female 4. Body mass index within the range 1932kg/m2 inclusive. 5. FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% 6. FEV1 &lt;15% reversibility (not % predicted) or an increase of &lt;200ml (or both) after inhaled B2agonists (400mcg salbutamol) 7. Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. 9. An active smoker with a pack history of &gt;10 pack years [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked]. Asthma (nonsmokers) 1. Individuals must be otherwise healthy, individuals who are free from significant cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological, malignancy, endocrine, neurological and psychiatric disease as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations. 2. Male or female 3. Body mass index within the range 1932kg/m2 inclusive. 4. Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. 5. Subjects with a history of nonsevere allergic asthma and who are not receiving treatment in the form of inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Their history of asthma must be documented for a minimum of 6 months prior to entry to the study, with exclusion of other significant pulmonary diseases (i.e. chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). 6. Aged 18 45 years 7. Baseline FEV1 &gt; 70% of predicted 8. Non Smokers with no smoking history 9. PC20 methacholine &lt; 8 mg/ml at screening 10. Subjects must have had positive skin prick test for 2 or more of common antigens in the past 2 years or at screening Healthy volunteers (smokers) A healthy smoking subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations, the Physician Responsible considers the volunteer unfit for the study. 2. The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity during the previous 4 months or any other clinical trial during the previous 3 months. In case of a non invasive, clinical trial not involving new molecular entities a 1 month washout will be sufficient. 3. The subject has donated a unit of blood within the previous month or intends to donate in the month after completing the study 4. The subject regularly, or on average, drinks more than 21 units per week 5. The subjects is taking any medication (whether prescribed or overthecounter), any herbal medication (incl. St.John's Wort) or high doses of nutritional supplements which could interfere with the study tests, within 14 days of study entry and throughout the study. 6. The subject has received oral steroids within 3 months of study entry 7. The subject significant risk factors for Hepatitis B or C infection 8. The subject has significant risk factors for HIV infection. COPD (smokers) A smoking COPD subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations, the Physician Responsible considers the volunteer unfit for the study. 2. The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity during the previous 4 months or any other clinical drug trial during the previous 3 months. In case of a non invasive, clinical trial not involving new molecular entities a 1 month washout will be sufficient. 3. The subject has donated a unit of blood within the previous month or intends to donate in the month after completing the study 4.

The subject has received oral steroids within 3 months of study entry. 7. The subject has history of an upper respiratory infection (including sinusitis) within 4 weeks prior to study entry. 8.

The subject has a history of lifethreatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with either hypercapnoea, respiratory arrest or hypoxia seizures. 2. Subjects have a symptomatic pattern suggestive of poorly controlled asthma that in the opinion of the investigator precludes them from entry into the study 3.
