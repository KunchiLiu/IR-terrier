	<brief_summary>In type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control despite maximum "classic" oral treatment, bed time insulin therapy may lead to a parallel increase in abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat, whereas pioglitazone treatment should lead to a stability (or even a decrease ) in visceral and an increase in subcutaneous abdominal fat. As visceral fat mass is correlated with insulin-resistance and cardio-vascular risk, the evolution of visceral abdominal fat in type 2 diabetic patients is of great importance. Main objective: To compare visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat compartment after a six-month bed time insulin or pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control despite a maximal oral treatment with metformin and sulfonylureas. The study hypothesis is that quantity of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue should differently evolute comparing a 6 month treatment with pioglitazone® (30 or 45mg/j) or NPH " bed-time " insulin (0.2u/kg/</brief_summary>
