	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin chemotherapy will be effective in reducing or eliminating the tumor(s) in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer; oxaliplatin is a chemotherapy drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of colon cancer. Neither gemcitabine nor oxaliplatin are approved for the treatment of breast cancer. However, both drugs have been shown to decrease the size of breast cancer tumors.</brief_summary>
