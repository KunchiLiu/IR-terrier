	<brief_summary>To evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of amlodipine, atorvastatin and the combination in patients with symptomatic myocardial ischemia. Amlodipine's use in angina has been well documented in clinical trials such as the Circadian Anti-Ischemia Program in Europe (CAPE), but the impact on vascular inflammation in clinical practice has not been tested. Furthermore, the potentially synergistic benefit of atorvastatin and amlodipine on inflammation ischemic activity has not been studied.</brief_summary>
