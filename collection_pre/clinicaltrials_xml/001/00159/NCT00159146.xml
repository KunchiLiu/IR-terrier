	<detailed_description>Antidepressant therapy has a delayed onset of action of 4-6 weeks. Pindolol has in some studies shown an accelerating effect. In this study we investigate the effect of 20 mg of pindolol retarded formulation in combination with Venlafaxine compared to placebo Pindolol and Venlafaxine for a duration of 19 days. Effect is measured by the Hamilton Depression rating Scale and the Preskorn Scale (self-rating).</detailed_description>
