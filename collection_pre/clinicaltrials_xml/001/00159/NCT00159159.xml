	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - Evaluation of the benefit on renal function of one year of a low dose of ciclosporine versus the usual dose Secondary Objective: - To evaluate the immunosuppressive efficacy and tolerance of the treatment Study Duration: Twelve months for each patient Study Treatment: Ciclosporine Group A: low dose &gt;= 130 µg/l &lt; T0 ciclosporinemia &lt; 200 µg/l; Group B: standard dose &gt;= 200 µg/l &lt; T0 ciclosporinemia &lt; 300 µg/l. Study Visits: One visit every 15 days, for the first three months; then 1 visit every month, for 6 months; and 1 visit at 9 and 12 months. Associated Treatments: - Mycophenolate (Cellcept®), 3g a day - Corticoids, as used for transplanted patients Randomization: Randomization will occur when it is decided that ciclosporine will be introduced.</brief_summary>
