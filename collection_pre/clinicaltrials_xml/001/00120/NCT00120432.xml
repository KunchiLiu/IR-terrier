	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy on pupillary dilation between the single dose versus the three doses of 1% tropicamide with 10% phenylephrine for complete ocular examination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Dose of 1% Tropicamide and 10% Phenylephrine for Pupillary Dilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no clinical trials using an appropriate regimen for pupillary dilation up until now. Therefore, the authors were interested to find out the most appropriate regimen for complete ocular examination, based on the finding that a pupil diameter of 6 mm or greater is adequate for indirect ophthalmoscopy. The authors hypothesize that a single dose of 1% tropicamide and 10% phenylephrine is adequate to complete the job and are conducting this prospective randomized clinical controlled trial to prove the hypothesis.</detailed_description>
