	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how many chronic users of antisecretory medication can stop after a test for a bacteria associated with peptic ulcer disease. This is evaluated in a discontinuation trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Testing patients with a Helicobacter pylori (Hp) 13C-urea breath test and treatment with eradication of Hp if positive - test-and-eradicate - have proven as effective and safe as prompt endoscopy for management of dyspeptic patients in a primary health care setting. However, empirical treatment with an ulcer-healing drug is often used in dyspeptic patients, as reflected in a growing proportion of long-term users without known ulcer or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). This group of patients contributed to 59% of the total use of acid-suppressive medication in the County of Funen in Denmark in 1997. Aim/purpose: It is our aim to examine the need for continued medication with prescribed, acid-suppressive drugs in primary health care. Our secondary objective is to investigate the profile of symptoms, quality of life, Hp-status, consumption of drugs and use of health care services in the same context. Methods: To conduct a randomised, placebo-controlled, blinded, clinical discontinuation trial, 500 long-term users of acid-suppressive drugs are identified by general practitioners. Long-term use is defined as treatment for more than 2x28 days during a 6-month period. The patients are included with a 13C-urea Hp-breath test and randomised for treatment with PPI or placebo. Hp-positive patients are treated with an Hp-eradication treatment. The patients are followed for 1 year; the primary outcome is the need for open treatment with acid-suppressive medication due to failing symptom relief despite treatment with the randomised project medication. The patients are to fill in a symptom and medication diary every month for periods of 1 week. Questionnaires are to be given to the patients 3 times during the follow-up period. Medication diaries as well as questionnaires have proven useful in similar studies. The main outcome is analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates analysis.</detailed_description>
