	<brief_summary>With ongoing war in Iraq, the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans is increasing. Creation, implementation, and testing of new and innovative interventions are needed to provide additional options for enhancing the mental health of those with PTSD. Surveys indicate that veterans are interested in complementary approaches to health care. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) delivered as a brief, 6-week, complementary and portable intervention. It includes frequent, silent repetitions of a mantram (mantra), a word or phrase with spiritual associations, to manage PTSD symptoms and improve quality of life military veterans with trauma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) is an innovative, portable meditation-based group intervention. In this study, the MRP was delivered in addition to usual care (defined as case management and medication) in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting. The MRP was compared to usual care only. This 4-year study employed a mixed-methods, prospective, randomized controlled trial with qualitative phone interviews at 3 months post-intervention to explore ways that the intervention was used. Outpatient Veterans (N=146) with military-related PTSD were recruited from a single VA site and randomly assigned to the experimental arm (n=71) which consisted of usual care and the mantram program versus usual care only control group (n=76).</detailed_description>
