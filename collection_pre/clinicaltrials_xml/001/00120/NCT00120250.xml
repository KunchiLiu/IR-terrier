	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain data investigating the safety and efficacy of eszopiclone for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related sleep disturbance and the impact of improved sleep with eszopiclone treatment on neuroendocrine correlates of PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that eszopiclone will be significantly more effective than placebo and well tolerated for PTSD-related sleep disturbance, improvement in sleep will be associated with improvement in overall PTSD symptoms, and patients with PTSD-related sleep disturbances will have abnormal levels of stress hormones.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eszopiclone for Sleep Disturbance and Nightmares in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by three symptom groupings: re-experiencing symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive memories; physiological hyperarousal; and avoidance symptoms. Of the three major categories of symptoms in PTSD listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, sleep-related problems are listed in two of them: difficulty falling asleep is considered an aspect of hyperarousal symptoms, and nightmares are a type of re-experiencing symptom. Both are found commonly in PTSD. Little is known about the relationship of neuroendocrine dysregulation in PTSD and sleep disturbance. It is possible that successful treatment of sleep disturbance in PTSD may alter an abnormal stress hormone pattern. The novel cyclopyrrolone hypnotic eszopiclone thus presents an intriguing opportunity to examine the treatment of sleep disturbances and nightmares in PTSD. This study will determine the safety, efficacy and impact on neuroendocrine parameters of eszopiclone compared to placebo for sleep disturbance and overall PTSD symptoms in individuals with PTSD and reported sleep disturbance.</detailed_description>
