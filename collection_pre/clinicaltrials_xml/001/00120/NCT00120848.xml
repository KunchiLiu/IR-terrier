	<brief_summary>Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This is an observer blind follow up study of the study HPV-001, which evaluated the ability of the HPV vaccine to prevent HPV infection. The current study invites all of the 1113 subjects in the HPV-001 study that received all three doses of vaccine/placebo to be enrolled and followed-up for several additional years to see if the HPV vaccine prevents HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections and to evaluate the safety of the vaccine. Subjects will remain in the same study group as in the primary study. No vaccine or placebo will be administered in this study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
