	<brief_summary>The general objectives of this protocol are to develop a multi-center prospective data collection process to identify risk factors for progression of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). These data will be used as a basis for identifying management strategies appropriate for further evaluation (randomized controlled trials), to develop evidence-based standards of care, and as a tool to facilitate quality-assessment at individual centers through comparison of outcomes with the entire database.</brief_summary>
