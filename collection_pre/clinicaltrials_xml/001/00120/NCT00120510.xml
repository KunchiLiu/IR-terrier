	<brief_summary>Anti-HIV treatment consisting of lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV) and efavirenz (EFV) is the current standard of care for initial treatment of HIV in most areas of the world. The purpose of this study is to determine the best time to start this anti-HIV treatment in treatment-naive adults in Haiti.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Standard Start of Anti-HIV Therapy for Treatment-Naive Adults in Haiti</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many parts of the world, initial standard of care for HIV includes 3TC/ZDV and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor EFV. However, it is unclear if early (CD4 count less than 350 cells/mm3) or delayed (CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3) therapy initiation leads to improved survival. This study will determine the most appropriate time to initiate ART in HIV infected individuals in Haiti. The study will enroll patients from the Haitian Study Group on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO) Centers. Some participants in this study will have active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This study will last at least 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups at study entry. Group A participants will receive 3TC/ZDV twice daily and EFV once daily at study enrollment. Participants receiving TB therapy at the time of enrollment may be observed for 2 weeks prior to beginning early therapy. Dosage adjustment of EFV may be necessary for participants receiving rifampin as part of their TB therapy. Group B participants will receive 3TC/ZDV twice daily and EFV once daily when they develop clinical AIDS or their CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm3 (WHO Stage IV). Directly observed therapy will be used for the first two months of treatment for every participant. Group A participants will have 14 study visits after beginning treatment; the visits will occur at Months 1, 2, 3, and every 3 months thereafter. Medical and medication history, physical exams, and contraceptive counseling for women will occur at all visits. HIV counseling, blood collection, and HIV staging will occur at most visits. At some study visits, Group A participants will be asked to complete quality of life and adherence questionnaires. Group B participants will have 14 study visits after study entry and will begin treatment when they meet WHO criteria. Assessments will be the same as for Group A. Any participant who fails the first-line regimen during the study will switch to a second-line ART regimen.</detailed_description>
