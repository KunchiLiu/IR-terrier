	<brief_title>Black Cohosh as Alternative Therapy for Treating Menopause-Related Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During menopause, up to 90% of women will experience symptoms of anxiety, such as nervousness, irritability, fatigue, muscle aches, depression, and low libido. Concern over the safety and effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for relieving these symptoms has caused many women to seek alternative medical treatments. Data suggest that black cohosh has a direct effect on the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in anxiety. This study will determine whether black cohosh can effectively treat anxiety symptoms in menopausal women. This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either black cohosh or placebo daily for the duration of the study. Self-report scales will be used to assess participants' anxiety symptoms and quality of life at the beginning and end of the study.</detailed_description>
