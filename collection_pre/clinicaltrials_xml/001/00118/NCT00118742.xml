	<brief_summary>This two-arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of a long-term calcineurin inhibitor-free maintenance regimen with CellCept and sirolimus in recipients of an orthotropic liver transplant. Patients will be randomized to receive either CellCept 1-1.5 g twice daily (BID) + tacrolimus + cyclosporine, or CellCept 1-1.5 g BID + sirolimus. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1 to 2 years, and the target sample size is 100 to 500 individuals.</brief_summary>
