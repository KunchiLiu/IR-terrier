	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with or without impaired liver or kidney function. Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Sorafenib may have different effects in patients who have changes in their liver or kidney function</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors, Multiple Myeloma, or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma With or Without Impaired Liver or Kidney Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction (part 1 of the study). II. To determine a tolerable starting dose of BAY 43-9006 in patients with varying degrees of hepatic or renal dysfunction (part 2 of the study). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 9 treatment cohorts according to hepatic or renal function. Patients receive oral sorafenib once on day 1 and then once daily, twice daily, or every other day beginning on day 8 and continuing for 3 months. Patients are re-evaluated at 3 months. Patients with responding disease may continue study treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per treatment cohort) receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have cytologically or histologically confirmed tumors that are metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; Patients with solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or nonHodgkin's lymphoma are eligible Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter &lt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or &lt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly nonmeasurable lesions; Lesions that are considered nonmeasurable include the following: Bone lesions Ascites Pleural/pericardial effusion Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis Abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques Cystic lesions ≥ 4 weeks since major surgery ≥ 4 weeks since completion of radiation or chemotherapy except for ≥ 6 weeks for nitrosoureas, LPAM or mitomycinC ECOG Performance Status of 02 Nonpregnant and nonnursing because the effects of BAY 439006 on the fetus/infant are unknown; in addition, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use an appropriate method of birth control throughout their participation in this study; appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives (Norplant), or double barrier methods (diaphragm plus condom) No patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements No concomitant medications known to cause hepatic or renal toxicity, including antiseizure medications, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and steroids No gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease No HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 439006; however, patients who are HIV+ but without AIDS defining diagnosis and not on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible No patients with evidence of biliary or renal obstruction; patients should be observed for at least one week after treatment (i.e. stents or drains) for biliary or renal obstruction to ensure their organ dysfunction has stabilized before registration to this protocol No current treatment with other investigational agents No evidence of bleeding diathesis No patients on therapeutic anticoagulation; prophylactic anticoagulation (i.e., low dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided that the requirements for PT, INR or PTT is met No treatment with cytochrome P450 enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine or Phenobarbital), rifampin or St. John's wort Patients with brain metastases are eligible if they meet all of the following criteria: Asymptomatic Radiographically stable disease for at least 2 months Previously received treatment for the brain metastases Not currently receiving steroid therapy or enzymeinducing anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine) Granulocytes ≥ 1,500/μl Platelet count ≥ 75,000/μl Normal or abnormal organ function</criteria>
