	<brief_summary>Specific Aims: - To determine if curcuminoids modulate cellular proliferation as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps. Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease cellular proliferation in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps. - To determine if curcuminoids modulate apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL assay, in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps. Hypothesis: Curcuminoids increase apoptosis in colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps. - To determine if curcuminoids modulate COX-2 expression as measured by immunohistochemical assays in subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease colorectal mucosa COX-2 expression in subjects with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps. - To determine if curcuminoids modulate COX-2 activity as measured by urinary eicosanoids Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease concentrations of urinary eicosanoids.</brief_summary>
