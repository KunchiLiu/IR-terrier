	<brief_summary>Currently, the preferred anti-HIV regimens used in the United States consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV). However, with new anti-HIV drugs being approved, alternative regimens need to be tested to determine if new drug combinations have increased effectiveness in treating HIV. The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of four different regimens in HIV-infected adults who have never taken anti-HIV drugs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efavirenz or Atazanavir/Ritonavir Given With Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate or Abacavir/Lamivudine in HIV Infected Treatment-Naive Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment regimens consisting of EFV and two NRTIs are the most commonly prescribed regimens for the initial therapy of HIV-infected people in the United States. Such regimens are popular because the drugs are easy to administer, have overall excellent efficacy, and are well tolerated. However, because of concerns about long-term drug toxicity, the development of drug resistance, and potential complications in pregnant women, it is imperative that other drug combinations be investigated as possible alternative initial regimens. Drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HIV treatment include the protease inhibitor (PI) atazanavir (ATV) and the two NRTI coformulations emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) and abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC). Data are limited on the efficacy of these new drugs when part of anti-HIV drug regimens. This study will evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of four different treatment regimens in HIV-infected treatment-naive adults. The treatment portion of this study will last 96 weeks after the last participant is enrolled. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four arms: - Arm 1 participants will receive EFV, FTC/TDF, and placebo for ABC/3TC. - Arm 2 participants will receive EFV, ABC/3TC, and placebo for FTC/TDF. - Arm 3 participants will receive ritonavir (RTV)-boosted ATV, FTC/TDF, and placebo for ABC/3TC. - Arm 4 participants will receive RTV-boosted ATV, ABC/3TC and placebo for FTC/TDF. NOTE: Lopinavir/ritonavir may be used in substitution of other drugs for certain participants. Study visits will occur at study entry; Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24; and every 12 weeks thereafter. A physical exam, blood collection, and urine collection will occur at most visits. Two pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from participants between Weeks 4 and 24. Participants will undergo adherence training at study entry and will be asked to complete adherence questionnaires at selected study visits. Some participants will be asked to participate in ACTG A5224s, a metabolic substudy of ACTG A5202. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for A5202 met in January 2008 to review the study. After reviewing the study information, the DSMB noted that certain study regimens were significantly less effective than others. Specifically, ABC/3TC-containing regimens were not as effective in controlling the virus as TDF/FTC-containing regimens for participants entering the study with high viral loads. The DSMB also commented that participants assigned to ABC/3TC had a shorter time until they experienced side effects than participants assigned to TDF/FTC. The DSMB had no safety concerns for the other drug comparisons. Based on DSMB review, in Feb 2008 participants who started the study with high viral loads were told whether they were taking ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC and offered the option to continue or change their NRTI study drug component, after discussion with their doctor. For participants who started the study with lower screening viral loads, study treatment continued without change. For 74 participant the reason for first treatment modification was "unblinded and switched" as a consequence of the DSMB results (33 on EFV, ABC/3TC, and placebo FTC/TDF arm; 1 on RTV-boosted ATV, FTC/TDF, and placebo ABC/3TC arm; and 40 on RTV-boosted ATV, ABC/3TC, and placebo FTC/TDF arm).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIVinfected. A resistance assay must be obtained if the participant has evidence of recent infection. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Antiretroviral naive, defined as 7 days or less of ARV treatment at any time prior to study entry. Participants who have received ARVs as part of postexposure prophylaxis or who have received an investigational drug that was not an NRTI, NNRTI, or PI are eligible for this study. HIV viral load greater than 1,000 copies/ml within 90 days prior to study entry Certain laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol Willing to use acceptable forms of contraception Parent or guardian able and willing to provide written informed consent, if applicable Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative at study entry Immunomodulators (e.g., interleukins, interferons, cyclosporine), HIV vaccine, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 30 days prior to study entry. Individuals receiving either stable physiologic glucocorticoid doses, corticosteroids for acute therapy for pneumocystis pneumonia, or a short course (2 weeks or less) of pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy will not be excluded. Known allergy/sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations Active alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements Serious illness requiring systemic treatment or hospitalization. Patients who have completed therapy or are clinically stable on therapy for at least 7 days prior to study entry are not excluded. Known clinically relevant cardiac conduction system disease Requirement for any current medications that are prohibited with any study treatment. Evidence of any major drug resistanceassociated mutation on any genotype or evidence of significant resistance on any phenotype performed at any time prior to study entry. Current imprisonment or involuntary incarceration for psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness Breastfeeding. Women who become pregnant during the study will be unblinded and required to permanently discontinue their study regimens.</criteria>
