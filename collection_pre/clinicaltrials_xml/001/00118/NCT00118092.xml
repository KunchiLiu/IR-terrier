	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well 17-AAG works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that did not respond to previous hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-AAG, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>17-AAG in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond to Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treated with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall survival and disease-free survival rate in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the duration of PSA response and PSA control in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with measurable disease treated with this drug. V. Correlate changes in expression levels of interleukin-6, maspin, and NF-kappaB in serum and tissue with cancer and treatment-related outcomes in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 2-6 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of treatment beyond documentation of CR. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.</detailed_description>
