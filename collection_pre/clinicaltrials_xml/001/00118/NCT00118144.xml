	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV lung cancer. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage IIIB or IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) or adencarcinoma of the lung with BAC features treated with bortezomib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine predictors of response, based on molecular correlative studies of tumor and blood, in patients with treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy (yes vs no). Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.</detailed_description>
