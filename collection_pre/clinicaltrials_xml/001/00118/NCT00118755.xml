Patients were randomized to receive either: 1) Xeloda 850 mg/m^2 orally twice a day (po bid) on Days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, and Avastin 7.5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle; or 2) Xeloda 1500 mg/m^2 po bid on Days 1-7, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 and Avastin 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment was 1-2 years, and the target sample size was 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
