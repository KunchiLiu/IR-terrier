	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Treatment of Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), previously believed to be a disorder of childhood, affects as many as 5 percent of adults. Adults with ADHD are at high risk for academic and occupational underachievement, relationship difficulties, and reduced quality of life. This study will determine whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective than ADHD education and relaxation techniques in treating adults with ADHD. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 12 to 15 weekly sessions of either CBT or training in which they will learn relaxation techniques and receive detailed information about ADHD. Questionnaires will be used to assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study entry and at study completion. The study is being conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and requires 5 assessment visits and 12 weekly therapy visits. Participants must be able to travel to Boston on a weekly basis in order to participate in the study. Study hypothesis: CBT is a more efficacious treatment for adult ADHD than education and relaxation techniques.</detailed_description>
