	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cyclophosphamide may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with cyclophosphamide after surgery may cause a stronger immune response to kill any remaining tumor cells. It may also prevent or delay the recurrence of melanoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given with or without cyclophosphamide and to see how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of adjuvant vaccine therapy comprising multi-epitope melanoma peptides (MP) and multi-epitope melanoma helper peptides (MHP) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with resected stage IIB-IV melanoma. - Determine the safety of administering cyclophosphamide before vaccination in these patients. - Compare the magnitude of immune response against vaccination comprising MP in combination with either MHP or tetanus toxoid helper peptide (TET) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 with vs without cyclophosphamide in these patients. Secondary - Compare the response rate and persistence of immune responses in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the magnitude of immune response against vaccination comprising TET or MHP with vs without cyclophosphamide in these patients. - Compare the response rate and persistence of immune response against vaccination comprising TET or MHP with vs without cyclophosphamide in these patients. - Determine the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the peptide components of these vaccines in these patients. - Compare, preliminarily, disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to HLA-type (HLA-A1 positive vs HLA-A2 positive, HLA-A1 negative, or -A3 negative vs HLA-A3 positive, or -A1 negative) and participating center (University of Virginia [UVA] vs non-UVA). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive vaccine comprising multi-epitope melanoma peptides (MP) and tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 intradermally (ID) and subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 85, 183, 274, and 365. - Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day -4. Patients then receive vaccine as in arm I. - Arm III: Patients receive vaccine comprising MP and multi-epitope melanoma helper peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 ID and SC on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 85, 183, 274, and 365. - Arm IV: Patients receive cyclophosphamide as in arm II. Patients then receive vaccine as in arm III. Treatment in all arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 173 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
