	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of six cycles of concurrent fludarabine and rituximab in patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) or CD5-, CD10-, CD20+ low-grade B cell lymphomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine and Rituximab for the Treatment of Marginal Zone Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Primary - To estimate the objective response rate. Secondary - To assess the safety. - To describe the progression-free survival at one year. - To examine the association between clonal cytogenetic abnormalities identified by FISH, and the objective response rate as well as the progression-free survival at one year. Target enrollment was 30 eligible patients. An 80% objective response rate at 1 month restaging after 6 cycles was considered as evidence of activity in this patient population while 60% was not considered activity. If at least 22 patients achieved objective response the treatment would be considered promising. With 30 eligible patients, the probability of observing this was 0.87 assuming a true rate of 80% and 0.09 assuming a true rate of 60%.</detailed_description>
