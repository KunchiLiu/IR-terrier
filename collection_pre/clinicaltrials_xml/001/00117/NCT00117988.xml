	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well 17-AAG works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-AAG, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>17-AAG in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, or Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Determine the complete and partial response rates and time to treatment failure in patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or classical Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the biologic effect of this drug on selected molecular targets in primary lymphoma cells from these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (anaplastic large cell lymphoma vs mantle cell lymphoma vs Hodgkin's lymphoma). Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing disease regression after completion of 8 courses may receive 2 additional courses of treatment beyond their maximal response. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.</detailed_description>
