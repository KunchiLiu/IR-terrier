	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of subjects in Australian clinical practice continuing treatment with Anakinra (Kineret速) at the end of study week 48 in subjects with active RA. The continued use of Kineret速 will be based on pre-defined response assessment criteria for subjects with active RA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects diagnosed with RA as determined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria with a disease duration of at least 24 weeks prior to enrollment Active RA at screening as defined by EITHER: (1) At least 6 swollen joints (using a 66 joint count) and at least 6 tender joints (using a 68 joint count) OR (2) 4 nonhand joints and at least 1 of the following: *Morning stiffness of at least 45 minutes; *CRP greater than 1.5 mg/dL (15.0 mg/L); *ESR greater than 28 mm/h; *DAS28 greater than 3.2 Subjects must have failed an adequate trial of at least 3 diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) alone or in combination (one of which must be MTX) and have been on the same treatment and doses for 4 weeks prior to enrollment (i.e., an adequate trial is defined as 12 weeks unless limited by toxicity or intolerance) Subjects' doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral corticosteroids (less than or equal to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) must have been kept stable for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Doses of 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent should not be exceeded during the study ACR functional class IV or ARA anatomical stage IV Subjects that are scheduled for surgery or being evaluated for surgery for hands, wrist and feet Felty's syndrome Any poorly controlled, clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic renal failure, liver disease) Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (e.g., diabetics with HbA1C greater than 8%, peripheral neuropathy, renal/retinal involvement, or vascular disorders) Malignancy, other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix within the past 5 years Abnormal chest xray that is clinically significant or bronchiectasis Within 12 weeks before date of enrollment any of the following occurrences: presence of serious infection (e.g., requiring hospitalization and/or IV antibiotics), frequent, acute, or chronic infections History of chronic infection Recent history (within 24 weeks of enrollment) of drug or alcohol abuse Known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus Presence of any condition that may compromise the ability of the subject to give informed consent Planned events (e.g., planned hospitalizations, vacations, etc.) that would interfere with the collection of the required assessments and/or may prevent the subject from completing the study according to protocol White cell count less than or equal to 3.5 x 10^9/L, a neutrophil count of less than or equal to 2.5 x 10^9/L, or platelet count of less than or equal to 125 x 10^9/L at screening Hemoglobin less than or equal to 8.0 g/dL at screening Elevated AST or ALT greater than or equal to 1.5 x the upper limit of normal at screening Elevated serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 x the upper limit of normal at screening Received intraarticular or systemic corticosteroid injections within 4 weeks before enrollment Subjects who have received previous treatment with antiIL1ra or antiTNF therapies (e.g., anakinra, etanercept or infliximab) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant during the course of the study Subject (man or woman) is of child bearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive precautions Known allergy to E. coli derived products Receiving or has received any investigational drug within the previous 30 days or within 5 halflives of any investigational drug, whichever is greater (or is currently using an investigational device)</criteria>
