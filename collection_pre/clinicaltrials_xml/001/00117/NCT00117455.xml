	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of two different fixed doses of pegfilgrastim (6mg and 12mg) and a by-weight dose of filgrastim (5ug/kg/day) for the mobilisation and collection of PBPCs for autologous transplantation after chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with nonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who are considered to be suitable candidates for autologous PBPC transplantation per institution guidelines ECOG 02 inclusive ANC greater than 1.5 x 10^9/L; PLT greater than 100 x 10^9/L Exclusion Criteria: More than one line (regimen) of previous chemotherapy treatment and more than 2 cycles of any premobilisation salvage chemotherapy prior to enrolment. Patients were also to be excluded from the study if they had received any salvage chemotherapy containing the following agents: procarbazine, nitrogen mustard, nitrosoureas (including BCNU), melphalan and fludarabine. Previous bone marrow or PBPC transplant Greater than 20% bone marrow involvement of the disease at time of screening, as demonstrated by biopsy Prior total nodal irradiation or any radiotherapy in the past 4 weeks Serum creatinine greater than 1.5 x upper limit of institutional normal range Total serum bilirubin greater than 2 x upper limit of institutional normal range Current diagnosis of splenomegaly not related to lymphoma History of prior malignancy, except for lymphoma, curatively treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, insitu cervical carcinoma or a surgically cured malignancy Any premalignant myeloid condition or any malignancy with myeloid characteristics (e.g., myelodysplastic syndromes, acute or chronic myelogenous leukaemia) Significant nonmalignant disease, including documented HIV infection, uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mmHg), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (greater than NY Heart Association Class II), poorly controlled diabetes, coronary angioplasty within 6 months, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias, or active hepatitis C Haematopoietic growth factors administered within 1 week of study entry. If growth factor support was given during previous chemotherapy cycles, WBC less than 15.0 x 10^9/L was required at enrolment Treatment with Interferon® during the last 3 months Known hypersensitivity to E. coliderived pharmaceutical products (e.g., filgrastim, HUMULIN® insulin, Lasparaginase) Subject had previously been randomised into this study</criteria>
