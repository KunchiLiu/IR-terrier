	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare a one year treatment program of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) + suboxone for opiate addicted individuals meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) to a one year program of standard drug counseling (I/GDC) + suboxone. Drug counseling consists of manualized individual sessions + group therapy. This trial is being completed at two sites, at the University of Washington and at Duke University. One hundred and seventy-two individuals (86 per condition) with opiate dependence and meeting criteria for BPD will be enrolled in a one-year treatment and a one-year follow-up assessment. Each site (University of Washington, Duke) will enroll 86 clients with both treatment conditions being conducted at each site. Assessments measuring drug use, suicidal behaviors, retention and other treatment-related behaviors, general psychopathology and functioning, and increases in behavioral skills will be given at four month intervals for the entire two years.</detailed_description>
