	<brief_title>Orthostatic Hypotension in Rehabilitation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, quasi-experiment conducted in two consecutive phases. During the observation phase, eligible patients are identified and followed through their usual course of care in the nursing home/rehabilitation unit. During the intervention phase, patients enrolled who have OH will receive the intervention. Patients will be enrolled over two research phases and the investigators expect to evaluate 459 subjects. This research program will occur over a three-year period. Methods: During Phase I, baseline prevalence and natural history of OH will be determined by: enrolling consecutive appropriate subjects (able to stand, not end of life care) from a rehabilitation and nursing home unit and measuring OH 3 times weekly over their inpatient stay. In addition, chart review of diagnoses, medications, functional status, nutrition, and adverse events will be evaluated and correlated with clinical status. During Phase II, the investigators will implement a standardized, interdisciplinary (MD/RN/PT/Dietician) treatment plan for patients with OH. This will include chart review of diagnoses, medications, functional status, nutrition, adverse events, and correlation with clinical status. The goals of the interventions are to identify and treat the underlying causes of OH in rehabilitation patients. Based upon the comprehensive assessment, intervention participants will receive a standardized, interdisciplinary treatment regime.</detailed_description>
