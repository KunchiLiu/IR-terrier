	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel study was designed to evaluate whether a single fixed-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of pegfilgrastim or daily administration of Filgrastim for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) support would assist in allowing the planned dose-on-time (PDOT) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (CHOP) chemotherapy with Rituximab every 14 days in subjects with aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma by reducing the duration of neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia.</brief_summary>
