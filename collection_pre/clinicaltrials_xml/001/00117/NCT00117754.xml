	<brief_summary>Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp hair follicles, which occurs primarily in children. Hair loss, hair breakage, scaling, plus various degrees of erythema, pustules and pruritus are the primary clinical signs which can be associated with tinea capitis. The infection is caused by a relatively small group of dermatophytes in the genera Trichophyton and Microsporum. Terbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative antifungal agent. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of terbinafine in children with tinea capitis.</brief_summary>
