	<detailed_description>This is a 2-arm, single-center, open-label, randomized, active-controlled study to compare the safety and efficacy of luteal phase replacement with DR-2011 to progesterone vaginal gel over an 18-day treatment period. Patients will also be required to use an estrogen patch during the course of the study. The overall study duration for each patient will be approximately 1Â½ months. Luteal phase replacement will be monitored by endometrial biopsy on Cycle Day 25 or 26. In addition, serum hormonal levels will be measured at screening and at designated times from Cycle Day 14 to 31.</detailed_description>
