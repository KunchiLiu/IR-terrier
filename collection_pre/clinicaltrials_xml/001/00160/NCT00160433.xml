	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of Asoprisnil in the Treatment of Women With Endometriosis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, is a progressive, estrogen-dependent disease that occurs in menstruating women of reproductive age. Although all major endometriosis therapies are effective for the treatment of pain, no single treatment is superior to others in terms of efficacy. The major drawbacks of the current medical therapies are severe side effects such as hot flushes and osteoporosis. The objective of this study is to determine if a dose-response relationship exists between asoprisnil and endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea or to establish the lowest effective dose of asoprisnil in the treatment of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis. Women with surgically confirmed endometriosis will be administered asoprisnil 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mg tablets or a placebo once daily for 3 months and efficacy will be assessed by improvement in pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, bleeding, analgesic use, global efficacy, and quality of life questionnaires. Safety will be based on assessments of the endometrium, lipid profiles, adverse events, and changes from baseline laboratory values and vital signs.</detailed_description>
