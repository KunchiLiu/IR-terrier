	<criteria>Participation in either of the CDP870031 [NCT00152490] or CDP870032 [NCT00152425] clinical studies in which the subject completed the Week 2 assessment in CDP870031 [NCT00152490] or the Week 6 randomization in CDP870032 [NCT00152425] but whose Crohn's Disease was significantly worse as determined by the investigator and whose Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score at entry to this study is either (subjects may have received active or placebo treatment): 1. At least 70 points higher then Baseline (Week 0 CDP870031 [NCT00152490]; Week 6 CDP870 032 [NCT00152425] responders) OR 2. Higher than Baseline (Week 0 CDP870031 [NCT00152490]; Week 6 CDP870032 [NCT00152425] responders) with an absolute score of at least 350 points Subjects must be able to understand the information provided to them and give written informed consent Any exclusion criterion that would have prevented the subject's participation in the qualifying pivotal study (CDP870031 [NCT00152490] or CDP870032 [NCT00152425]), although the upper limit of 450 in the CDAI score is not applicable. In addition the criterion that excludes previous participation in a clinical trial of Certolizumab Pegol does not apply</criteria>
