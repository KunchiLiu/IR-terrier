	<brief_summary>This is a research study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and side effects of several dose levels of esterified estrogens (EE) and methyltestosterone (MT) given individually and in combination compared to a placebo (a tablet with no active drug in it) as a possible treatment for vasomotor symptoms (such as hot flushes and flushing) of menopause.
