	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to assess the feasibility (completion of full treatment) in both arms and to assess endoscopic complete response rate in both arms. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the toxicity profile of each arm using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) scale (V.3).</brief_summary>

Metastatic disease except for third upper or cervical esophagus tumor with regional nodes, or third lower esophagus tumor with celiac nodes (M1a) Multiple carcinomas of the esophagus Small cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the esophagus Complete dysphagia (grade 4 NCICTC); patient with exclusive parenteral nutrition.
