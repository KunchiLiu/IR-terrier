	<brief_title>NK-1 Antagonism of SLV317 in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral single dose cross-over study. 18 healthy male volunteers will receive 250 mg SLV 317 or placebo in randomised order with a minimum wash-out period of one week between the two administrations. Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed up to 4.25 hours post-dose using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique. After obtaining venoconstriction via infusions of phenylephrine, substance P will be co-infused intermittently to induce venodilation. Substance P infusions will be separated by intervals of 45 minutes in order to prevent the well-known occurrence of tolerance. Venous blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed up to 24 hours post-dose. Safety will be assessed by measuring ECG, pulse rate, blood pressure, haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and by monitoring of adverse events.</detailed_description>
