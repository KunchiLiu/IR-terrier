	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of adjunctive treatment with LEV (3,000 mg/day or a target dose of 60 mg/kg/day in children) compared to placebo in reducing PGTC seizures in subjects (4 - 65 years) suffering from idiopathic generalized epilepsy uncontrolled despite treatment with one or two concomitant AEDs.</brief_summary>
