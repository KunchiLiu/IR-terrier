	<criteria>Amenorrhoea for &gt;= 12 months. Serum estradiol and FSH level within the postmenopausal range Baseline endometrial biopsy assessed by light microscopic histological evaluation revealing: insufficient endometrial tissue for diagnosis because of insufficient available (atrophic) endometrial tissue (not because of an inaccessible cervix) and endometrial thickness &lt; 5 mm (double layer) by transvaginal ultrasound, atrophic endometrium, secretory endometrium, menstrual type endometrium, proliferative endometrium Previous systemic unopposed estrogen replacement therapy over 6 months or more. Any estrogen, progestogen, and/or androgen therapy in the last four weeks before Screening Visit (Visit 1). The baseline endometrial biopsy should in all cases be taken after cessation of the withdrawal bleeding due to previous hormone replacement therapy. History or presence of an estrogen dependent neoplasia (including breast cancer). History or presence of malignant neoplasms other than basal or spinal cell carcinoma of the skin.</criteria>
