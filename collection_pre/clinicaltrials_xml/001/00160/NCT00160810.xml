	<brief_title>Outcome Study of Complex Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complex distal radius fractures are a common problem treated by orthopaedic surgeons. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome between complex distal radius fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation using a volar fixed angled plate versus and external fixator versus DRV. The hypothesis is that the volar fixed angled plate will have a superior outcome both radiographically and clinically.</detailed_description>
