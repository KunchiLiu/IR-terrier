	<brief_summary>This research is designed to investigate the perceptions and opinions of individuals who either have schizophrenia or who have a family member with schizophrenia, in relation to genetic counseling. Data will be collected via a 15 minute online questionnaire. There is also an option for respondents to participate in a 45 minute interview if they wish. It is expected that the study will show that adequate information about genetic counseling is not provided to these individuals. It is also hoped that this research will help to make genetic counseling sessions more specific to people with schizophrenia in their family.</brief_summary>
