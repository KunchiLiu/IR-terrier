	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate desmoteplase (which is a manufactured protein derived from the saliva of the vampire bat) in dissolving clots that are blocking the flow of blood through one (or more) of the blood vessels supplying the brain, thereby reopening the blocked blood vessel and allowing blood to flow again in individuals suffering from ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
