	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the Leish-111f + MPL-SE vaccine given as three injections every 28 days at each of three dose levels of Leish-111f protein, in combination with standard pentavalent antimony therapy in adult patients with mucosal leishmaniasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Leish-111F + MPL-SE Vaccine in the Treatment of Mucosal Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucosal leishmaniasis is a disfiguring and possibly fatal infection. All available medical therapies require weeks of treatment and cause significant toxicity. In Peru, the standard therapy is daily intravenous (IV) pentavalent antimony (20 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. It appears that Leishmania infections can be eliminated by T helper 1 immune responses. These findings argue that a vaccine that augments mucosal leishmaniasis patients’ T helper 1 responses will eliminate the infection and disease. This study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, sequential dose-escalating trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three injections of 5, 10, or 20 μg of Leish-111f protein + 25 μg of MPL-SE adjuvant given at 4 week intervals as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy with pentavalent antimony (20 mg/kg/day for 28 days) in patients with mucosal leishmaniasis.</detailed_description>
