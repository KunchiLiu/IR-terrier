	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine the effects of an intensive lifestyle modification program in patients with HIV and Metabolic Syndrome. The primary endpoints will be improvement in body composition, specifically waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). The secondary endpoints will include improvement of cardiovascular indices, such as total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride cholesterol levels, blood pressure, cardiac enzymes, c-reactive protein (CRP), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), and insulin and glucose metabolism. We expect that quality of life indices and life skills should also improve with the lifestyle modification program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Lifestyle Modification in HIV Lipodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a randomized, case-control study of 80 subjects (N=80). Forty subjects will be randomized to the observation group and 40 to the intervention (REACH) group. After two initial screening visits with medical and nutrition staff for informed consent, determination of eligibility, and evaluation of a 7-day food record, qualifying patients will be seen for a baseline visit. A nutrition questionnaire and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) testing will be done at the first screening visit, and sub-maximal stress testing and other tests with physical therapy will be done at the second screening visit. At baseline, patients will have an interval history and physical exam, lipodystrophy evaluation by the investigator (objective) and patient (subjective) report, blood tests and body composition. Nearly identical visits to that at baseline, with the addition of the sub-maximal stress test, and other physical therapy testing, will be repeated at 6 and 12 months. Carotid ultrasound will be repeated at the 6 and 12 month visits. There will also be a short visit at 3 and 9 months to obtain an interval history and physical exam, safety labs, and a 7-day food record for an Intake Report. At baseline, patients will be randomized to either the observation group or the lifestyle intervention, known as "Reach for Energy, Activity, and Cardiovascular Health" (REACH). Randomization will be stratified for gender and fasting glucose &lt; or &gt;= 110 mg/dL. Those randomized to observation will receive a one time counseling session with nutrition staff at the baseline visit and monthly, unscripted phone calls from the investigator/co-investigator, and come in for regular study visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, as described above. Those randomized to REACH will attend one-on-one counseling sessions with a trained dietitian covering the "core-curriculum" that is modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study 16 week core curriculum intervention.</detailed_description>
