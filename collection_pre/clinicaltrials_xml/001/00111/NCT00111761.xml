	<brief_title>Evaluating Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indication Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Primary Objective To assess the safety of ABX-EGF in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. (The primary objective in the original protocol was to assess progression free survival after treatment with ABX-EGF in combination with the Saltz regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer). Secondary Objective(s) To assess the clinical efficacy of ABX-EGF in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. (Secondary objectives in the original protocol were to assess safety and additional measures of the clinical efficacy of ABX-EGF in combination with the Saltz regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer). To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABX-EGF in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. (Secondary objectives in the original protocol were to assess the PK of ABX-EGF in combination with the Saltz regimen, and the PK of irinotecan (IR) and its active metabolite SN-38 when IR is given in combination with ABX-EGF, leucovorin (LV), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer)</detailed_description>
