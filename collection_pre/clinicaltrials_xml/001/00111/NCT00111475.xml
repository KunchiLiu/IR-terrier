	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are: to determine a weekly dose that demonstrates a satisfactory safety profile and sustains elevated platelet counts within a targeted therapeutic level (a doubling of baseline platelet counts and within the range of greater than or equal to 50 x 10^9/L and less than or equal to 450 x 10^9/L in thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP; to assess Amgen megakaryopoiesis protein 2 [AMP2 (AMG 531)] pharmacokinetics (PK) in thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP.</brief_summary>

If prior history of cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ, no treatment or active disease within 5 years before randomization Unstable or uncontrolled disease or condition related to or impacting cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) greater than class II], uncontrolled hypertension [diastolic greater than 100 mmHg] or cardiac arrhythmia) Have 3 or more of the following predisposing factors for thromboembolic events: *diabetes; *smoker using oral contraceptives; *hypercholesteremia (greater than 240 mg/dL); *treatment for hypertension Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or hepatitis C virus Received any treatment for ITP (except for a constant dose schedule of corticosteroids) within 4 weeks before the screening visit Received IVIg or WinRho within 2 weeks before the screening visit Received hematopoietic growth factors, including IL11 (NeumegaÂ®) within 4 weeks before the screening visit Past or present participation in any study evaluating PEGrHuMGDF, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO) or related platelet product Received any alkylating agents within 8 weeks before the screening visit or anticipated use during the time of the proposed study Received any monoclonal antibody (eg, rituximab) within 16 weeks before the screening visit or anticipated use during the time of the proposed study Less than 4 weeks since receipt of any therapeutic drug or device that is not FDA approved for any indication before the screening period Less than 2 months since major surgery (including laparoscopic splenectomy) Pregnant or breast feeding Subjects of reproductive potential who are not using adequate contraceptive precautions, in the judgment of the investigator</criteria>
