	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well paclitaxel works in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic epithelial carcinoma of the pancreas treated with paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol^®-PM). - Determine the best overall response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the clinical benefit and safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol^®-PM) IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
