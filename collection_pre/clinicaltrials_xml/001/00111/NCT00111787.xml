	<brief_summary>This Study was designed to determine how effective and safe a new investigational drug, lapatinib, is in combination with paclitaxel in treating patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer. Tumor tissue collected pre-treatment, following 14 days of treatment and at the time of surgical resection will be examined for pathologic response and biologic activity by IHC (immunohistochemistry) within the tumor. Treatment will consist of 14 days of lapatinib monotherapy followed by 12 weeks of combination therapy with lapatinib and paclitaxel. Blood samples for hematology and chemistry panels, MUGA/ECHO exams and physical exams will be performed throughout the study to monitor safety.</brief_summary>
