	<brief_summary>Interrupting HAART during limited periods of time ("structured treatment interruption : STI") could entail benefits (better long term tolerance, lower drug-induced viral resistance, lower cost) but also concomitant risks (lower efficacy, higher drug-induced viral resistance). At present, the benefit/risk ratio of STI is unclear. Several STI trials are in progress in industrialised countries. This trial aim at assessing the benefits and risks of two different STI strategies in West Africa.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Trial of Structured Treatment Interruption of HAART in HIV-Infected Adults in Abidjan (ANRS 1269 TRIVACAN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of two strategies of structured treatment interruption (STI) of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) compared with a continuous HAART. It's a multicentric open labeled randomised non-inferiority trial, which takes place in 5 health care centres in Abidjan, the economic capital city of Cote d'Ivoire The trial was designed in two phases : 1. Pre-randomisation phase : 840 HAART-naive HIV-infected adults start the following continuous HAART regimen: zidovudine-lamivudine in combination with - preferably efavirenz, for HIV-1 infected men, and HIV-1 infected women with an effective contraception and no history of nevirapine-containing p-MTCT (prevention of mother to child transmission); - ritonavir-indinavir, for HIV-2 infected patients, women not desiring contraception, and women with a past history of p-MTCT with nevirapine. 2. Trial phase : After at least six months on continuous HAART in the pre-randomisation phase, patients who meet success criteria (CD4 count over 350/mm3, undetectable viral load, absence of current opportunistic infection) are randomised into three arms : - Arm 1: Continuous HAART (1 of 6 patients) - Arm 2: Fixed STI strategy (3 of 6 patients): immutable periods of 2 months on HAART / 4 months off HAART - Arm 3: CD4-guided STI strategy (2 of 6 patients): unlimited interruption of HAART, and then re-introduction/re-interruption guided by the evolution of the CD4 count. Following the DSMB recommendation, the arm 3 has been discontinued in october 2005. The trial is continuing for patients in the arms 1 and 2.</detailed_description>
