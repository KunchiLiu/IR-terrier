	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that affects the central nervous system. Chronic methamphetamine use often leads to psychotic behavior. Rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is currently approved to treat Alzheimer's-related dementia. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of rivastigmine in treating methamphetamine dependent individuals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of two dose levels of rivastigmine or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants will be assessed for cardiovascular, subjective, and reinforcing effects that are produced by methamphetamine. All participants will partake in contingency management sessions through Week 4.</detailed_description>
