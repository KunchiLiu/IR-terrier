	<brief_title>Effect of Propranolol on Preventing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can occur following exposure to a traumatic event in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. PTSD is marked by clear biological changes as well as psychological symptoms. Many people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts. This study will assess the effect of post-trauma propranolol on reducing the incidence and severity of PTSD. The study will also evaluate propranolol's effectiveness as a preventive measure against subsequent PTSD symptoms. Participants in this double-blind study will be recruited upon admission to the Massachusetts General Hospital Emergency Department after exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. Baseline psychometric and psychobiologic measurements will be collected. Within 6 hours following the traumatic event, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 40 mg of short-acting propranolol or placebo and 60 mg of either long-acting propranolol or placebo. For the next 10 days, participants will receive 120 mg of either long-acting propranolol or placebo twice daily. A 9-day medication tapering will follow. Participants will undergo psychophysiologic, psychodiagnostic, and psychometric testing for PTSD 1 and 3 months following the traumatic event.</detailed_description>
