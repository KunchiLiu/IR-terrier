	<brief_summary>The specific aim of the "Coronary Patients Evaluation Study" (COPES) Project 2 is, within a Phase-I RCT, to examine patient satisfaction, treatment safety, and symptom reduction associated with treatment for symptoms of distress and/or depressed mood among post acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, as compared to usual cardiology care. For the purposes of this study, "symptoms of distress and/or depressed mood" is defined by a score on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) &gt;10. The specific treatment approach utilized follows the, "Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment" (IMPACT) Clinical Trial, and involves up to 6-months of a patient preference, stepped-care protocol. Within this protocol, patients choose between brief, problem focused psychotherapy and anti-depressant medication. Treatment progress is reviewed at 2-month intervals, providing opportunities to 'step-up' treatment if patients are not demonstrating sufficient symptom reduction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: To examine patient satisfaction, treatment safety, and symptom reduction associated with treatment for symptoms of distress and/or depressed mood among post acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, as compared to usual cardiology care. Research Design: The Study utilizes a Phase-I RCT design to achieve this Aim. Methodology: Patients with confirmed ACS are screened for symptoms of distress and/or depressed mood within 7 days of the index ACS event, using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Those meeting inclusion criterion on the BDI (score&gt;10) and consenting to study are followed for 3-months, at which time they are re-assessed. Those continuing to show BDI score &gt;10 and consenting, are randomized to the intervention condition (INT) or to usual cardiologic care (UCC). INT is defined by up to 6-months of a patient preference, stepped care treatment whereby patients chose between brief, problem-focused psychotherapy (PST) and antidepressant medication (MED). Patients are re-evaluated at 2- and 4-months after randomization. Those not showing sufficient improvement in symptoms receive augmented therapy. Those who initially choose PST can receive more frequent sessions and/or the addition of MED; those who initially choose MED can receive a change of agent, an increase in dosage, an additional medication, and/or PST. Hypotheses to be tested are: 1. Patient satisfaction within intervention treatment (INT) will be higher than in the usual cardiologic care (UCC) condition, as evidenced by self-report and levels of participation 2. The INT group will experience a greater reduction in symptoms of distress and/or depression over the treatment period than the UCC group (secondary hypothesis). 3. Improvement in symptoms of distress and/or depression will be associated with reduction in levels of inflammatory markers and improvement in adherence with physician prescribed aspirin therapy (secondary hypothesis). This is a multi-site study involving Mt. Sinai, and Yale and Columbia University Schools of Medicine. A total of 500 people will be screened into the initial 'observational period', which occurs at the time of new ACS diagnosis. From among these, it is anticipated that 200 people will evidence persistent BDI &gt; 10 at 3-month follow-up and agree to be enrolled in the Phase 1 RCT. The clinical relevance of the Study concerns demonstration of the acceptability and satisfaction with the treatment approach by post-ACS patients, as preliminary to a Phase-III RCT that would test the effect of such an intervention on event-free survival after ACS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Hospitalization with a verified diagnosis of unstable angina (UA) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). UA is defined as newonset angina within 2 months, exacerbation of previous angina with pain at rest or with minimal exercise, prolonged chest pain (lasting &gt; 20 minutes), or angina within 2 weeks following discharge for myocardial infarction in patients with documented coronary artery disease (defined as ischemic ECG STT segment changes, previously documented MI, positive nuclear treadmill test result, or coronary angiographic evidence of blockage of 50% stenosis in &gt;1 major coronary artery). AMI is defined as at least 2 of the following: ischemic chest pain lasting &gt;20 minutes, acute rise in serum troponinI &gt;1.0 ng/L, and new pathologic ST segments in &gt;2 contiguous ECG leads. 2. Score on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) &gt; 10 within 7 days of index ACS event and 3months later. 1. active suicidal or homicidal ideation, as these patients require immediate referral for assessment and treatment (see below for procedures for these patients); 2. current alcohol or other substance abuse disorders (as depressive symptoms may be a result of these disorders), 3. any current psychotic disorder, 4. history of psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or serious personality disorders, 5. diagnosis of a terminal noncardiac illness, 6. ACS diagnosis secondary to diagnosis of a severe medical disease, 7. inability to communicate in English, 8. levels of cognitive impairment indicative of dementia, 9. unavailability for the period of the study, 10. overt hypothyroid, and 11. currently taking triptans.</criteria>
