	<brief_title>Combined Interventions for Treating Depression and Chronic Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship between depression and back pain is complex. Depression is the most common mental condition associated with chronic back pain. Despite this relationship, many patients with depression and back pain seek treatment only for one of the two conditions, which can worsen the untreated condition. An intervention that reduces the symptoms of both depression and back pain is needed. This study will determine the effectiveness of an integrated intervention in reducing both back pain and depression symptoms. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an integrated intervention or standard of care for 6 months. Participants in the integrated intervention group will receive cognitive behavioral therapy for back pain and antidepressants and/or problem solving therapy for depression. Study visits will initially occur once a week and then taper to once every 2 weeks for the 6-month duration; the time of tapering will depend on participant response to treatment and will be at the investigator's discretion. Depression and back pain symptoms will be assessed in all participants at study entry, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after the end of treatment. The study entry and study completion assessments will occur during study visits. The last assessment will be a telephone interview.</detailed_description>
