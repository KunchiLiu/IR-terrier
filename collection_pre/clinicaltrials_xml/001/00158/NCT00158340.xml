	<brief_title>Guided Self-Help Treatment for Binge Eating Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious condition characterized by compulsive overeating and feelings of powerlessness. The condition often has a negative impact on both physical and emotional health. This study will examine ways to help people determine whether they have BED and will test whether guided self-help (GSH) treatment is effective in treating BED. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either GSH treatment or usual clinical care (which may include general support and talk therapy) for 3 months. The GSH treatment is a cognitive behavioral therapy-based program that will be administered over 8 sessions. Participants receiving GSH will be given a book that focuses on dealing with BED; they will also meet with a therapist regularly to have their progress monitored. The Eating Disorders Examination (EDE), self-reports, questionnaires, and surveys will be used to assess participants. Assessments will be conducted at study entry, at Weeks 2 and 4 of the treatment, at the end of the treatment, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
