	<brief_summary>Genital herpes (GH) is a commonly occurring sexually transmitted disease caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2); both can cause GH, although the latter is much more likely to produce frequent recurrences of GH lesions. Evidence suggests that there are advantages to using suppressive vs. episodic treatment, which include increased intervals between the pain and discomfort of genital herpes recurrences. Therefore, this study will collect safety and efficacy data on suppressive therapy with valaciclovir in subjects newly diagnosed with HSV-2 genital herpes.</brief_summary>
