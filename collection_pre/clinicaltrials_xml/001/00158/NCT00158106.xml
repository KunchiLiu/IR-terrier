	<brief_title>Assessing the Effectiveness of Communication Therapy in the North West (The ACT NoW Pilot Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question: This is the pilot phase of a two-phase study. Phase 1 - What is the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of therapy for adults with post-stroke communication impairment? to be followed in 2006 by Phase 2 - What are the effectiveness, costs and service user preferences, for the provision of speech and language therapy for communication difficulties experienced by people in hospital with a stroke? Methodology: Phase 1 - Qualitative (focus groups &amp; individual interviews) and quantitative (pilot RCT). Phase 2 - Qualitative (focus groups &amp; individual interviews) and quantitative (a pragmatic, multicentred, randomised controlled trial, stratified by diagnosis and therapist/centre, using an 'intention to treat' approach). Discrete choice experiments will be used to determine cost effectiveness. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be functional communicative ability. The economic analysis will estimate the incremental cost effectiveness and net benefit of the intervention group compared to the control group from a societal perspective. The qualitative study will examine service users' and carers' perspectives on the process and effects of Speech and Language Therapy or the control treatment. Sample Group: Adults with dysarthria or aphasia, seen early after admission to hospital with a stroke. Exclusions: subarachnoid haemorrhage, progressive dementia, expected recovery without therapy.</detailed_description>
