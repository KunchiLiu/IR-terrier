	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression Relapse Prevention in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a chronic and episodic condition that may have devastating effects on social and emotional functioning, particularly in the pediatric population. While approximately 90% of children eventually recover from an episode of depression, up to 40% of those children relapse within 1 to 2 years. Data indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered after depressive symptoms subside can significantly reduce depression relapses in adults. However, there are no comparable studies in children or adolescents. This study will determine whether CBT is effective in reducing a relapse of depressive episodes in children and adolescents with major depression. This study comprises two phases. In Phase 1, all participants will receive drug treatment for 12 weeks. Participants who respond to the treatment will complete the study after 12 weeks. Participants whose depression symptoms return after 12 weeks will be enrolled in Phase 2. In Phase 2, participants will be randomly assigned to either continue drug therapy alone or to receive drug therapy plus CBT for 6 months. The CBT will focus on teaching participants skills to manage depressed moods and to identify situations which might put them at risk for a relapse in depressive symptoms. Self-report scales will be used to assess the depressive symptoms of participants who complete Phases 1 and 2 at study entry and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
