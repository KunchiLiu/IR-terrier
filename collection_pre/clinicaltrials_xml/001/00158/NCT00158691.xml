	<detailed_description>Prospective randomized study in order to compare intravenous (IV) versus subcutaneous (SC) administration of amifostine in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. IV administration of amifostine is 200 mg/m2/day in a short 3-min infusion 15 to 30 min before each fraction of radiotherapy. SC administration is 500mg/day in two slow 1.25 ml injections at two different sites 20 to 60 min before each radiotherapy fraction.
