	<brief_title>A Comparison of Weighted Vest Exercise and Strength Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle power, a separate physical attribute from strength, is an important determinate of physical functioning in the elderly, for example in avoiding impending falls, rising from a chair, and climbing stairs. Muscle power, which declines with aging at a different rate than strength, has been shown in previous studies to improve through power training utilizing specially designed exercise equipment. However, weighted vest exercise could provide an acceptable, low cost, readily accessible alternative. The hypotheses being tested in this study are: 1) weighted vest exercise will improve lower extremity power when compared to age matched controls in a standardized progressive resistance training program; 2) improvements in lower extremity power enhance functional performance as shown by improved gait velocity, stair climbing, and chair rise time; and 3) weighted vest exercise in impaired older adults will improve self-reported function and disability. One hundred sixty-four men and women ages 65 and older, with some physical limitation but able to climb stairs independently, will be randomized to one of two 16-week exercise programs. The intervention group will participate in a weighted vest exercise protocol, consisting of chair-based and stair-climbing exercise, while the control group will participate in a standardized progressive resistance training program. Participants in both programs will meet three times per week for 30-60 minutes per session, for a total of 16 weeks, at a research exercise gym, and will be under the direct supervision of research staff.</detailed_description>
