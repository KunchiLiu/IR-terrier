	<brief_summary>Nebivolol is one of a class of drugs known as beta-blockers. These drugs are useful in the treatment of high blood pressure, angina, abnormal heart rhythms and following a heart attack. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of nebivolol to cause a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm, known as QTc prolongation. The potential of nebivolol to cause this adverse event will be compared to three other drugs: atenolol, a beta-blocker approved by the FDA; Avelox (moxifloxacin), an anti-biotic approved for use by the FDA which is known to cause QTc prolongation; and placebo, a drug look-alike that contains no drug. The working hypothesis was that 20 or 40 mg of nebivolol would not prolong corrected QT intervals measured during peak nebivolol concentrations (i.e., 2 hours after dosing) on Day 7.</brief_summary>
