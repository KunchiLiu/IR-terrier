	<brief_title>Long Term Open Label Continuation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study DE020 was a multicenter, open-label continuation study for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had participated in a prior Phase 1, 2, or 3 adalimumab study in the United States or Canada, had a favorable safety and efficacy profile when treated with adalimumab, and met the eligibility criteria for the continuation study. Participants received subcutaneous injections of adalimumab every other week (eow) or monthly based on the adalimumab regimen received in the prior study (i.e., participants who received monthly dosing in the prior study began the continuation study on monthly dosing; all other participants began adalimumab dosing at eow intervals). Participants who maintained an American College of Rheumatology 50% (ACR50) response for 2 consecutive visits could have their dosing interval lengthened to a monthly dosing schedule. Safety and efficacy data were collected over 520 weeks (10 years). Both safety and efficacy data were analyzed using all participants who received at least 1 dose of open-label adalimumab in the 10-year continuation study DE020 (the Full Analysis Set, n=846). Three patients who entered the continuation study but were never dosed were excluded from all analyses.</detailed_description>
