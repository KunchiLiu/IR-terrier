	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to learn whether the study vaccine and the adjuvants(drugs that are used to help immune response) have an acceptable safety profile in treating individuals with HIV. A second purpose for this study is to understand how your immune system responds to the study vaccine with the adjuvants. Understanding these differences could be useful in several ways. First, it might help identify people whose disease is likely to respond to the study vaccine with the study adjuvants. Second, the information might be useful in developing other treatments for people whose disease does not respond to the study vaccine with the adjuvants.</brief_summary>
