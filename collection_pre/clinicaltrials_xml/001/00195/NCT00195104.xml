	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide in Combination With Cytarabine in Patients With High-risk MDS and Poor-prognosis AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single institution, dose-escalation study of low-dose cytosine arabinoside and arsenic trioxide. Patients will receive a fixed dose of arsenic trioxide administered 0.25mg/kg/day on days 1-5 and 8-12 and ara-C administered at 5, 7.5, or 10 mg/m2 SC BID days 1-14 in repeated cycles of 2 weeks on therapy and 2 weeks off therapy in a standard dose escalation design (1 cycle = 2 weeks on therapy + 2 weeks off therapy).</detailed_description>
