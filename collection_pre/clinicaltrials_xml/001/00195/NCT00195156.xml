	<brief_title>Treatment With ATRA-IV and Depakote in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Depakote in combination with liposome encapsulated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-IV) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. This will be a 2-step dose escalation study. Once the patient starts therapy at a designated dose level, it will not be escalated for that patient. Three patients at each dose level must complete 4 weeks of therapy before escalating to the next higher level. If none of the patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 3 new patients will be treated with the next higher dose level.</detailed_description>
