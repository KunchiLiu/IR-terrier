	<brief_summary>This is a phase 3b/4 randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of tigecycline to ceftriaxone sodium plus metronidazole in hospitalized subjects with cIAI (Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection). Subjects with clinical signs and symptoms of cIAI will be included for enrollment. Subjects will be stratified at randomization for Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation scale (APACHE II) score &lt; 10 and &gt; 10. Subjects will be followed for efficacy through the test-of-cure assessment. Safety evaluations will occur through the treatment and post-treatment periods and continue through resolution or stability of the adverse event(s).</brief_summary>
