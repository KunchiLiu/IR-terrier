	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in combination with methotrexate in patients with recent onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to assess the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after treatment with adalimumab for up to 10 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab and Methotrexate (MTX) Versus MTX Monotherapy in Subjects With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study had an initial 2-year double-blind treatment period followed by an 8-year open-label extension period, for a total of up to 10 years study duration. The study was designed to assess the potential of adalimumab + methotrexate to improve signs and symptoms of disease and to inhibit radiographic progression in patients with recent onset (disease duration less than 3 years) rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated with methotrexate. Adalimumab is a human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody.</detailed_description>
