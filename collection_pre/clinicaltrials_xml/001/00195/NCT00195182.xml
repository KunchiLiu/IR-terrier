	<brief_title>Psychosocial Determinants of Medication Adherence in Hypertensive African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieving and maintaining recommended blood pressure goals in hypertensive African Americans is paramount to addressing racial disparities in hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. Because antihypertensive therapy is the cornerstone of hypertension management, good medication adherence is the key to adequate blood pressure control. Successful approaches to racial disparities must address how to increase adherence to anti-hypertensive medications. Adherence to anti-hypertensive medications is likely multifactorial, and not solely related to SES or access to medical care. Psychosocial factors such as stress and depression have been implicated as important determinants of medication adherence. However, little is known about how other psychosocial factors such as perceived racism impact anti-hypertensive medication adherence. Understanding these relationships may assist in the development of targeted strategies to achieve good medication adherence in hypertensive patients. The objective is to understand the relationships between perceived racism and medication adherence, while examining the role of depression, psychological stress, and self-efficacy in a population of hypertensive African-American patients. 262 African American adult hypertensive patients will be recruited from an urban academic general medicine practice. Baseline data collection will include assessments of demographics and socioeconomic status, clinical history and hypertension characteristics, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and medication adherence. Patients will be followed for 1 year, when final evaluations will take place, including assessment of hypertension, stress, depression, medication adherence and level of perceived racism (measured by a validated instrument). The primary outcome is the change in medication adherence scores from baseline to 12 months. Statistical models will be developed to determine if level of perceived racism is associated with medication adherence, and whether stress and depression play a role in this relationship.</detailed_description>
