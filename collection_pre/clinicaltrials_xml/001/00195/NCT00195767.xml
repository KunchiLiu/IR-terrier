	<criteria>Subject and subject's legal representative have voluntarily signed and dated an IRBapproved informed assent form and an IRBapproved informed consent form, respectively, before any studyspecific procedures or tests are performed. The subject was randomized into Study M01342 and either completed the study or prematurely discontinued due to ineffectiveness. The subject is male or a nonpregnant, nonlactating female. Subject is judged to be in general good health based upon the results of a physical examination, vital signs, 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory profile (as described in Section 5.3.1) Exclusion Criteria Subject is female, of childbearing potential, and not using an effective method of birth control (e.g., total sexual abstinence or contraceptives). Subject experienced a serious adverse event in Study M01342, which the investigator considered "possibly" or "probably related" to study drug. Subject is violent, homicidal, or suicidal such that, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is at significant imminent risk of hurting self or others. Subject has any of the following abnormal laboratory results at the last assessment prior to Day 1: Platelet count &lt;/= 100,000/ÂµL; ALT or AST &gt;/= 2 times Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) The subject is taking a protocol allowed medication for ADHD that has not been stable for at least 3 months prior to Day 1, is expected to require a dosage adjustment during the study, or that, in the investigators opinion, may be exacerbating mood symptoms. Subject requires treatment with or has taken a protocolprohibited medication (see Appendix D) within 5 elimination half lives of Day 1. Subject has received an investigational drug, other than Depakote ER in Study M01342, within 30 days prior to Day 1 of this study. In the investigator's opinion, longterm treatment with Depakote ER for the subject's mania associated with bipolar disorder is contraindicated. For any reason, subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable candidate for this study.</criteria>
