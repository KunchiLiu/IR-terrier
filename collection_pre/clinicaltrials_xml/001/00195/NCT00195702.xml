	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of adalimumab compared with placebo (during double-blind phase) and to to evaluate the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy following repeated administration of adalimumab (during open-label extension phase) in patients with persistently active rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving concurrent methotrexate therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Treated Concomitantly With Methotrexate.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a 10-year study which had an initial 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by an open-label extension phase up to 9 years in duration. Data were analyzed for the double-blind phase using all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug through Week 52 and for all patients who received at least one dose of adalimumab during the 10-year study (the Intent-to-Treat [ITT] population).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 or older and in good health (Investigator discretion) with a recent stable medical history Met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and had at both screening and baseline visits &gt;=6 swollen joints and &gt;=9 tender joints, despite a minimum of 3months treatment with methotrexate (MTX). (Distal interphalangeal joints [DIPs] were not to be included in joint count for inclusion. The screening and baseline visits could be 3 to 28 days apart for patients not previously receiving diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs] other than MTX or 4 to 6 weeks for patients requiring a DMARD washout period.) Insufficient efficacy with MTX 12.5 to 25 mg per week (10 mg per week if MTX intolerant). If patient on a secondline treatment (DMARD) other than MTX, he/she had to discontinue it for at least 28 days before the baseline visit (the washout period). Treatment with oral folic acid 13 mg/day or, if appropriate, up to 10 mg leucovorin per week. Both rheumatoid factor positivity and a Creactive protein value &gt;=1 mg/dL, or at least one joint erosion on Xray. Subject considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for the study. Female subject who was pregnant or breastfeeding or considering becoming pregnant. Preceding treatment with any tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist, including adalimumab. Prior exposure to alkylating agents, such as chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide. Intraarticular, intramuscular, or intravenous administration of corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. Subject was wheelchair bound or bedridden.</criteria>
