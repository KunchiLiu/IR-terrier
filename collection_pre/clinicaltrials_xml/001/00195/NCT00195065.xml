	<brief_title>Cornell Translational Behavioral Science Research Consortium: Asthma Qualitative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Through a series of open-ended questions we will explore and build a better understanding of how different patient populations view asthma and the difficulties they face in changing behavior. In addition the responses to such questions should help us to better understand and anticipate some of the barriers and issues that participants may face in successfully changing their behaviors. 2. The second objective is to use the responses obtained to inform how an intervention of positive affect induction and self-affirmation should be operationalized and tailored.</detailed_description>
