	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to identify infants who are at risk for developing problems related to being breast-fed. A previous study identified items that place an infant at a high risk for developing complications related to being breast-fed. The present study will use the same survey and collect data from more participants. These additional participants are necessary to provide statistical analysis for the survey. The survey being developed will assist health care professionals to identify those infants at risk for developing health problems related to being breast-fed and provide care that will minimize the chances of developing complications.</detailed_description>
