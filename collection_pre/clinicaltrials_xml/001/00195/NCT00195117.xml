	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Changing Exercise and Physical Activity Behavior in Asthma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate a novel intervention of induced positive affect and induced self-affirmation to increase physical activity in patients with asthma. At the start of the trial all patients in conjunction with their physicians will select a program of mild to moderate physical activity or exercise to be adopted and maintained on a routine basis. All patients will record perceived exertion and pedometer measurements in a log diary. All patients will be contacted by telephone at set time intervals to encourage them to continue their selected physical activity or exercise. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will also receive induced positive affect and self-affirmation throughout the study period. Patients in the control arm will not receive the positive affect and self-affirmation components.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients will be eligible for this study if their physicians consider them medically able to participate, if they are 18 years of age or older if they have a diagnosis of mild to moderate asthma based on the NHLBI Asthma Expert Panel's classification system which rates symptoms, frequency of exacerbations, nocturnal attacks, activity restriction, use of medications, and pulmonary function. Patients will be excluded from this study for the following reasons: If they are unable to walk several blocks for whatever reason; If they have musculoskeletal or neurological deficits that preclude increased physical activity; If they have other pulmonary diseases; If they have cardiac disease or other severe comorbidity; If they are unable to provide informed consent because of cognitive deficits; If they refuse to participate.</criteria>
