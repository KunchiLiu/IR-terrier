	<brief_summary>The Alfred Hospital receives approximately 40% of the major trauma patients in Victoria, all of whom are at risk for spinal injuries. The potential for spinal injuries necessitates the undertaking of appropriate spinal investigations, and a delay in the completion of these investigations exposes the patient to the risk of a missed diagnosis of spinal instability and of complications of immobility; the potential spinal patient is required to wear a neck collar and be nursed lying flat whilst awaiting the completion and the appropriate documentation of spinal X-ray investigations. The purpose of this study is to identify the issues causing a delay in the process of the completion of the appropriate spinal investigations and the documentation of the results. The outcome of the proposed research will be the development of a clinical management protocol to expedite the process, with the aim of optimising patient care and reducing complications.</brief_summary>
