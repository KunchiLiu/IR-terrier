	<brief_summary>Tumor cell proliferation and repopulation contribute to resistance to radiotherapy in head and neck cancer. Up to now, this characteristic is mostly assessed using biopsies acquired during inspection under general anaesthesia before treatment. 18F-FLT-PET (positron emission tomography) is a non-invasive imaging method showing areas of active proliferation. The aim of this study is to assess the value of the functional information gained by 18F-FLT-PET for radiotherapy planning and early tumor response assessment. Prior to radiotherapy, a planning CT-scan and a 18F-FLT-PET scan are acquired. After approximately two weeks of radiotherapy a further PET scan is obtained.</brief_summary>
