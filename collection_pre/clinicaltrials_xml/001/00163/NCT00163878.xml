	<brief_summary>A randomised control trial of patients who have a severe brain injury to determine if patients who receive a standardised sensory stimulation program emerge earlier from a vegetative state. The experimental group would receive, in addition to their normal occuaptional therapy, sensory stimulation which would involve the daily application of stimulation to all five senses using the Sensory Modalities Assessment and Rehabilitation Technique (SMART).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomised control trial of patients who have a severe brain injury to determine if patients who receive a standardised sensory stimulation program emerge earlier from a vegetative state. The experimental group would receive, in addition to their normal occupational therapy, sensory stimulation which would involve the daily application of stimulation to all five senses using the Sensory Modalities Assessment and Rehabilitation Technique (SMART). The SMART is both an assessment and treatment too. Patients in both groups will have baseline assessments conducted using the SMART, with further assessments conducted every ten days for thrity days. The SMART is designed to provide quantitative data in the assessment of the patients cognitive function and potential awareness. It is a five point hierarchical scale from level 1 ( no response) to level 5 (discriminating).</detailed_description>
