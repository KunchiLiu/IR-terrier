	<brief_summary>In this study we will compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet, high in fruit and vegetables with the more conventional diet recommended for diabetes therapy (a high carbohydrate, low fat diet) on glycaemic and lipid control and on markers of inflammation, in people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that, over a six-month intervention period, a HVM diet will be more effective than a conventional HCLF diet in improving glycaemic and lipid control, and in reducing markers of vascular inflammation in people with Type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Mediterranean Style Diet on Vascular Health in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammation affecting both small and large blood vessels is an important factor increasing the risk of heart disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. Good markers present in the blood are now available to detect this inflammatory state. Recent evidence suggests that a Mediterranean-type diet, high in plant foods and with monounsaturated fat from olive oil has beneficial effects on blood vessels as well as on blood glucose and blood lipid control. In this study we will compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet, high in fruit and vegetables with the more conventional diet recommended for diabetes therapy (a high carbohydrate, low fat diet). Twenty-four people with Type 2 diabetes will be randomised to one of these diets and followed for six months. At the end of this time, the effect of the diets on markers for inflammation will be compared.</detailed_description>
