	<brief_title>Mirror Trial - Follow-Up Management of Peripheral Arterial Intervention With Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel is approved for secondary prevention of atherosclerosis in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Currently there are no data about the amount of platelet activation during peripheral arterial intervention, the effect of clopidogrel on platelet adhesion and its clinical impact. Patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease receive placebo or clopidogrel before the intervention and for 6 months in follow-up. Platelet activation, the effect on macro-and microcirculation will be assessed as well as clinical endpoints.</detailed_description>
