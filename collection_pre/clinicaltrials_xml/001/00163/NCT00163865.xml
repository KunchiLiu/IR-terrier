	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Boredom in a Community Sample of Adolescents and a Clinical Sample of Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Boredom has been recognized as a significant problem in a wide variety of areas. However, limited research has been focused on this construct (Vodanovich &amp; Watt, 1999). Research into boredom in adolescents is especially lacking in the psychological literature. This is surprising given that adolescence is a time marked by change, stress, and identity issues. The aim of the following pilot study is to examine boredom in a community sample of adolescents and a clinical sample of adolescents. This is important in order to examine differences among healthy adolescents and adolescents with mental illness, such as depression, anxiety, and ADHD. This has implications for both prevention and intervention strategies and programs, such as the assessment and treatment of adolescents with mental illness. Hence, the results of this study will be important in providing an evidence-based practice in the treatment of mental illness in adolescents. Participants will be asked to complete one survey, the Boredom Proneness Scale (Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986), and a demographic background form to measure gender, date of birth, country of birth, etc. The community sample of adolescents will be recruited from secondary schools in Victoria. The clinical sample of adolescents will be recruited from the Alfred Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. It is envisaged that about 100 adolescents from each sample will be recruited to participate.</detailed_description>
