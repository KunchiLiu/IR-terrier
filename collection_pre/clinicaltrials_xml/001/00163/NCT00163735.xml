	<brief_summary>This study is designed to identify whether wines which are produced using the common potential food allergens such as proteins derived from fish, milk or egg are likely to contain sufficient food allergens to cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Potential Allergens in Wine: Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent international legislation requires labelling of wines made using potentially allergenic food proteins "casein", egg white, isinglass ( fish derived), milk or evaporated milk where "there is detectable residual processing aid". However it is not clear whether the final wine contains concentrations of residual added food proteins that can provoke allergic reactions. Comparison:This study is a double blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether adults known to be allergic to eggs, fish, milk and/or nuts exhibit allergic reactions following consumption of Australian commercial wines fined with food allergens.</detailed_description>
