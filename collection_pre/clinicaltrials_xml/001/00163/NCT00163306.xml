	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a medical condition affecting the stomach and esophagus. GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter does not close properly and stomach contents leaks back (refluxes) into the esophagus. GERD is one of the most common medical disorders, with estimates of up to 50% of adults reporting symptoms related to gastric reflux. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) such as pantoprazole can relieve symptoms of GERD in a large proportion of patients. When refluxed stomach acidic content touches the lining of the esophagus, it causes a burning sensation in the chest or throat. This sensation is often referred to as heartburn. Some patients have symptoms of GERD without visible destruction of the tissue surface (no visible changes by endoscopic examination). The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of pantoprazole on the complete remission of GERD. Complete remission is defined as endoscopically confirmed healing and symptom relief after a maximum of 12-week treatment period. Pantoprazole will be administered once daily in the morning. Endoscopy will be performed at the start of the study, and then as required after 4, 8, or 12 weeks. The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of pantoprazole.</brief_summary>
