	<brief_title>Antenatal Micronutrient Supplementation and Birth Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maternal micronutrient deficiencies are common in the developing world and may influence intrauterine growth and fetal and neonatal health and survival. Currently, policies for antenatal supplementation beyond iron-folic acid are not in place in these settings. And yet, the efficacy of such supplementation strategies has not been well established. Specifically, it is not clear if multiple micronutrient combinations will enhance fetal growth and newborn health and survival compared to single or smaller combinations of micronutrients. Also, while birth weight may serve as a proxy measure of newborn health, infant morbidity and mortality needs direct examination. Comparisons: Pregnant women received daily folic acid, folic acid plus iron, folic acid plus iron plus zinc, or a multiple micronutrient supplement containing 11 other nutrients all with vitamin A compared to a control group that received only vitamin A.</detailed_description>
