	<brief_summary>This project examines experimental pain and chronic pain in the mouth, specifically the condition called atypical odontalgia (AO:atypical toothpain). In 16 patients with AO and 16 healthy persons, capsaicin (chili-pepper) is applied to the gingiva to cause pain. This pain is evaluated by the participants. In three sessions, 3 different medications are tested for effect on the pain. The medications are fentanyl, S-ketamine and placebo-treatment (saline). The aim is to know more about pain mechanisms in AO in order to develop an effective treatment.</brief_summary>
