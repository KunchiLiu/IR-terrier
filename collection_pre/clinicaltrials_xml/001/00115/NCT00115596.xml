	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate a formal curriculum for teaching basic procedures to pediatric interns at Children's Hospital, Boston. The incoming class of interns for the academic year '05-06 will be randomly assigned to participate in the curriculum or not. Four procedures including intravenous catheter insertion, venipuncture (blood drawing), bag-and-mask ventilation, and lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will be taught. Interns will then be tested on their ability to perform these skills on anatomic models and on live patients. Our hypothesis is that interns receiving the formal curriculum will be more confident and more successful in performing these procedures than those who do not.</brief_summary>
