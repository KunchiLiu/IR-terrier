	<brief_title>Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increased risk of infection despite intensive antimicrobial prophylaxis is a well-recognized complication of lung transplantation. Recent evidence suggests that immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation may lead to humoral immunodeficiency due to hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG). In lung transplant recipients with HGG, IVIG therapy offers the potential to significantly decrease the incidence and severity of infections, thereby reducing morbidity and potentially mortality. Comparison: The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of IVIG versus placebo for lung transplant patients with severe HGG to see if IVIG decreases the number of bacterial infections in these patients.</detailed_description>
