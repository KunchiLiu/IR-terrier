	<brief_title>Use of Rosiglitazone in the Treatment of Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no current pain control in women with minimal-mild endometriosis that concomitantly allows them the chance to conceive. Women between the ages of 18 and 45 years with minimal to mild endometriosis and pelvic pain of greater than three months duration, will be enrolled into a 6-month prospective phase 2 clinical trial. Comparison: Following enrollment, one week after the last menstrual period, eligible participants will be randomized to a 6-month treatment of rosiglitazone 4 mg/day. Efficacy comparisons will be made utilizing visual analog scale diaries, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaires and physical component summary scores of the SF-36. Secondary measures will include cytokine quantification, proteomics, gene array analyses and serious adverse effects.</detailed_description>
