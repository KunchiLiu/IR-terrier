	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) compared to the right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-to-PA) shunt; compare the effect of the MBTS to that of the RV-to-PA shunt on the incidence of death or cardiac transplantation at 12 months post randomization; and compare the effect of the two shunts on intensive care unit (ICU) morbidity, unintended cardiovascular interventional procedures, right ventricular function, tricuspid valve regurgitation, pulmonary artery growth, and neurodevelopmental outcome.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and related single right ventricle anomalies are the highest risk congenital cardiovascular malformations. Surgical repair begins with the Norwood procedure during the newborn period, a stage II procedure at 4 to 6 months of age, and Fontan procedure at 18 to 36 months. The Norwood procedure remains one of the highest risk procedures in congenital heart surgery. A few small nonrandomized studies of a novel approach to the Norwood procedure have reported improved outcomes. This new approach uses a RV-to-PA shunt to provide pulmonary blood flow rather than the standard MBTS. This multi-center, randomized clinical trial will evaluate early and intermediate-term outcomes for patients undergoing a Norwood procedure with either the RV-to-PA shunt or the MBTS.
