	<brief_title>Pegfilgrastim Administered on the Same Day as Chemotherapy in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase 2 study of pegfilgrastim given either the same day as or the day after a chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (R-CHOP). Chemotherapy was administered every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in subjects with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; mantle cell or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Subjects were administered R-CHOP on day 1 of each cycle. All subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: arm A subjects were administered pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 1 of each cycle (within 4 hours of chemotherapy completion); arm B subjects were administered pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 2 of each cycle (at least 24 hours after chemotherapy completion). All subjects were administered placebo on the day they did not receive pegfilgrastim. A total of 77 subjects were enrolled at 24 centers across the US. Protocol treatment duration for subjects was up to 18 weeks (6 three-week cycles).</detailed_description>
