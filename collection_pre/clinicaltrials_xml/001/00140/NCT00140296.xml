	<brief_summary>Consistent and correct use of an effective contraceptive method is a primary determinant in preventing pregnancy. Unfortunately, only a minority of healthcare providers adequately address women’s contraceptive needs. We have developed a standardized behavioral-based contraceptive counseling model that can be used by providers and other clinic staff to address this limitation. The model, ESP, is an adaptation of motivational interviewing and involves: Exploring discrepancies between pregnancy intention and contraceptive use and between risk of STDs and condom use; Sharing information; and Promoting behaviors to reduce risk. Study question: Does ESP counseling lead to an increase in consistency and effectiveness of contraceptive use among women at risk of unintended pregnancy? Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 747 women, ages 16-44, at self-identified risk of unintended pregnancy enrolled from March 2003 to September 2004 at healthcare settings in North Carolina. Intervention participants received individualized ESP counseling from a health educator to address barriers to effective and consistent contraceptive use. Risk reduction steps were negotiated. Pregnancy, Chlamydia infection and contraceptive use were assessed at baseline and follow-up. “Highly effective” contraceptive use was defined as a combination of effectiveness and consistency. Women in the control arm received general preventive health counseling (e.g., smoking and exercise). Differences between the study arms at 12-months may illustrate the longer term influence of the intervention.</brief_summary>
