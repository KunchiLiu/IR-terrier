	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Handwashing Promotion Program in Chinese Elementary Schools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diarrheal and respiratory diseases cause 3.8 million deaths annually among children in the developing world. Reduced rates of these diseases have been measured during intensive, home-based handwashing interventions. We evaluated a school-based handwashing program for 1st grade students to determine whether a more scalable intervention could also reduce illness rates, and impact hygiene knowledge and attitudes. Thirty schools from each of 3 counties in Fujian Province, China, were randomized to one of the following groups: a) control; b) standard intervention, which included a handwashing program (1 hour of hygiene instruction and 1 soap sample kit per pupil); or c) expanded intervention, which included the handwashing program, soap for school sinks and 1 peer hygiene monitor per class. Teachers collected illness symptom information from students weekly and recorded student absences daily between January and April, 2005. Mean illness and absence rates were calculated for each school. Students were given a knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire before the intervention and again 5 months later.</detailed_description>
