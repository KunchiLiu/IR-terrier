	<brief_summary>This study is a multicentric randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of the combination ACVBP+rituximab compared to the combination of CHOP+rituximab in patients aged from 18 to 59 years with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one factor of the age-adjusted international prognostic index (IPI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACVBP Plus Rituximab Versus CHOP Plus Rituximab in Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma and Age-adjusted IPI of 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III multicentric open label randomized study is based on the results of previous LNH 93-5 and LNH98-5 studies. The LNH93-5 study has shown that the ACVBP regimen gave a longer EFS (39% vs 29% at 5 years, p=0.005) and a longer overall survival (46% vs 38% at 5 years, p=0.036) than CHOP in patients aged between 61 and 69 with an IPI score ≥1. However ACVBP had a more important toxicity and a higher treatment related mortality (13% vs 7%, p&lt;0.01), specially after 65 years. In younger patients ACVBP is better tolerated. The addition of Rituximab to standard CHOP (R-CHOP) has been shown in LNH98-5 study to improve complete remission rate (CR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in elderly patients with B-DLCL. Considering only patients with an aa-IPI score of 1, the 2 year EFS was 75% in the R-CHOP group as compared with 42% in the CHOP group. This study is designed to test whether addition of rituximab to ACVBP is better than R-CHOP in patients younger than 60. Primary endpoint is event-free survival, we expect a gain in 2 years-EFS of 10% in R-ACVBP group as compared with R-CHOP group. This study is a multicentric, phase III open-label, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of ACVBP+rituximab compared to CHOP+rituximab in patients aged from 18 to 59 years with non previously treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one factor of the age-adjusted international prognostic index</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient with histologically proven CD20+ diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (WHO classification) Aged from 18 to 59 years. Ageadjusted International Prognostic Index equal to 1 (elevated LDH level OR stage IIIIV OR ECOG status 234). Patient not previously treated. With a minimum life expectancy of 3 months. Negative HIV, HBV and HCV serologies test 4 weeks (except after vaccination). Having previously signed a written informed consent. Any other histological type of lymphoma. Any history of treated or nontreated indolent lymphoma. However, patients not previously diagnosed and having a diffuse large Bcell lymphoma with some small cell infiltration in bone marrow or lymph node may be included. Central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma. Contraindication to any drug contained in the chemotherapy regimens. Any serious active disease (according to the investigator's decision). Poor renal function (creatinin level&gt;150µmol/l), poor hepatic function (total bilirubin level&gt;30mmol/l, transaminases&gt;2.5 maximum normal level) unless these abnormalities are related to the lymphoma. Poor bone marrow reserve as defined by neutrophils &lt;1.5 G/l or platelets &lt;100 G/l, unless related to bone marrow infiltration. Any history of cancer during the last 5 years with the exception of nonmelanoma skin tumors or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before planned first cycle of chemotherapy and during the study. Pregnant or lactating women. Adult patient under tutelage.</criteria>
