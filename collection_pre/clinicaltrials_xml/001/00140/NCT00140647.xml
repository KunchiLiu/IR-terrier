	<brief_title>The Study of Atherosclerosis With Ramipril and Rosiglitazone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STARR is a multi-centre, international, randomized controlled clinical trial with a 2x2 factorial design, that will evaluate the effects of ramipril and of rosiglitazone on atherosclerosis progression, as determined by B-mode carotid ultrasound (US). It is designed as a substudy of DREAM (Diabetes Reduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medications) Trial. The study is designed to enroll 1,200 study participants and follow is proposed for an average of 3.75 years. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH: With regards to ramipril this study will provide important mechanistic data regarding potential benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy on atherosclerosis and by inference in reducing CV risk in a lower risk younger population than studied in previous trials. In this population a clinical outcome trial focusing primarily on CV events would be difficult to conduct due to the expected fairly low event rate. If the study on atherosclerosis is positive, this may provide a rational for therapy in this subset of patients without overt CVD or diabetes, but with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.</detailed_description>
