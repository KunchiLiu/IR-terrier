	<criteria>In or outpatients of 65 years of age or above fulfilling the International Classification of DiseasesTenth Edition (ICD10) diagnosis of depressive single episode (F32.0032.11. 32.8 or 32.9), depressive recurrent episode (F33.0033.11, 33.8 or 33.9) or organic depressive episode (F06.32). The depressive state should be mild to moderate and reach a score on HAMD6 of ≥ 7 and ≤ 11 Patients with dementia can be included provided they have a mini mental state exam (MMSE) score of ≥ 17 Patients with a current depressive episode of a severity reaching a score of ≥ 12 on the HAMD6item depression factor. This is to exclude patients with severe or psychotic depression Patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviour Patients with conditions where treatment with escitalopram is contraindicated: e.g. hypersensitivity to escitalopram or other contents of escitalopram tablets, concomitant treatment with nonselective, irreversible monoamineoxidase inhibitors, such as Marplan Patients who in the current depressive episode have had a failed trial of treatment with escitalopram Comorbid dementia with a severity corresponding to a score on the MMSE of less than 17 as these patients will often be without the ability to give informed consent Patients with sensory defects rendering psychometric assessment impossible, e.g. deafness, blindness, severe aphasia Patients who cannot speak Danish well enough to make psychometric assessment possible and meaningful Patients with congenital or early acquired intellectual deficits</criteria>
