	<brief_summary>This is the clinical registry of cell based therapies that is available to researchers around the world. The registry is web based. All researches must provide IRB approval to the coordinating site- University of Utah in order to obtain access to the registry. The are predetermined case report forms for cardiovascular diseases that are currently in clinical trials- including demographics, safety, and possible efficacy end-points. All investigators have access to their own data. The servers are U.S. HIPPA compliant and protected with secure back-up.</brief_summary>
