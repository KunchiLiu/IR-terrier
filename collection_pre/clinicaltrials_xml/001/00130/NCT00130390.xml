	<brief_title>Study of Nitazoxanide Tablets in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Active Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a significant need for a safe and effective treatment of Crohn's disease. It is recognized that bacteria in the gut lumen may have a role in the etiology and/or symptoms of this disease. Antimicrobials have often been used in treating Crohn's disease although their effectiveness has not been well established. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are also believed to play an important role in this disease. Nitazoxanide, a thiazolide anti-infective, is active in vitro against a broad spectrum of anaerobic bacteria, and it inhibits secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, -4, -5, -6, -8, -10 and TNF alpha. The drug is also highly concentrated in the gastrointestinal tract. With these characteristics, nitazoxanide offers a unique approach to treatment of Crohn's disease.</detailed_description>
