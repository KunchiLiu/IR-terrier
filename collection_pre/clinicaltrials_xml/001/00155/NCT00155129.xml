	<brief_summary>The release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is thought to play a causative role in migraine. Nociceptin immunoreactivity and ORL-1 mRNA have been detected in human trigeminal ganglia where it was co-localized with CGRP. It may play a role in migraine pathogenesis. We are collecting the blood samples of migraineurs for analysis of these neuropeptides.</brief_summary>
