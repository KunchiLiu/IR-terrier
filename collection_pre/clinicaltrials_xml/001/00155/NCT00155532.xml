	<brief_title>Skin Denervation in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To address the issues of skin denervation and its clinical and pathological correlations in lupus, we will study a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort by evaluating the extent of cutaneous innervation. Patients are recruited from the rheumatologic clinic, and various neuropsychiatric syndromes are diagnosed based on clinical judgement following detailed history taking and neurological examinations. Skin biopsy with PGP 9.5 immunohistochemistry will be performed following established procedures after informed consent is obtained, and punches of 3 mm in diameter will be taken from the lateral side of the distal leg, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus. Intraepidermal nerve fibre densities will be compared with results of immunological, pathological, psychophysical, and electrophysical studies to understand the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in SLE.</detailed_description>
