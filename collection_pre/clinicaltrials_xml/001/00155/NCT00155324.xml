	<brief_title>Change and Clinical Significance of Plantar Fascia Thickness After ESWT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) on the thickness of plantar fascia measured by ultrasonographic examination among patients with chronic plantar fascitis. Two different dosage of ESWT will be applied, and the outcome will be followed 3 and 6 months after the treatment. The change of plantar fascia thickness will be correlated with clinical improvement, including the pain improvement, foot function, and quality of life at follow up.</detailed_description>
