	<brief_title>Effects of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy on Sleep Disturbance in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance is prevalent in chronic dialysis patients and there is a negative correlation between the quality of life and overall survival and sleep disturbance in them. So many factors interfering the sleep of these patients, however, there is no effective therapy for them except some drugs, such as hypnotics or anxiolytics. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an effective behavioral therapy for insomnia clinically and it contains three therapeutic domains including stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, and relaxation training. It has been proven to be beneficial in improving sleep pattern in chronic insomnia and cancer patients and alcoholism. In previous studies, cognitive-behavioral therapy can redress anxiety in chronic hemodialysis patients, however, there is no clinical evidence revealing its effectiveness upon sleep disorders in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Our study tries to elucidate the therapeutic effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on the sleep disturbance in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. We will perform cognitive-behavioral therapy to eligible peritoneal dialysis patients and evaluate the sleep condition before and after the therapy. Moreover, clinical conditions, biochemical and hematological parameters, inflammatory mediators in blood will be measured at baseline, before and after therapy.</detailed_description>
