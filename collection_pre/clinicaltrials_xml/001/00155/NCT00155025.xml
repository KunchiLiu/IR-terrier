	<detailed_description>We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of prostate cancer patients at NTUH from 1978 to 2002. The initial presentations, systemic diseases, smoking habits, clinical stages, Gleason scores, pathological stages, treatments, and outcome were recorded. Post-hoc questionnaires were completed with OPD visits, admission visits, telephone interviews and mails. The questionnaires included the family histories of prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma and so on. If patients is passed away, the first degree relatives will fill the vacant position. The prevalence of family histories of prostate cancers in these patients was determined. The associations of family histories and clinical presentations were analyzed. Besides, the characteristics of patients with and without responses were discussed.</detailed_description>
