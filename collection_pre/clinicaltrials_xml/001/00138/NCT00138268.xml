	<criteria>For the portion of the pilot study conducted at the UCLA CVR, an umbilical cord blood sample will be obtained from approximately 8 to 12 healthy pregnant women who are delivering neonates at the Obstetrical delivery ward of Harbor UCLA Medical Center. Informed consent will not be obtained because the blood will be obtained after delivery from a clamped umbilical cord attached to the placenta (afterbirth) that otherwise would be discarded. A cord blood sample will not be collected from women who have requested special arrangements for a cord blood registry service.</criteria>
