	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine, in patients presenting hepatic iron overload (genetic haemochtomatisis or dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome), the effects of venesection therapy on cytochrome P450 2E1 activity by comparing the rates of metabolization of chlorzoxazone before and after venesection.</brief_summary>
