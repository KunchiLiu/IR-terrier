	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid when given together with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in treating patients with progressive metastatic or unresectable colorectal cancer or solid tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid when administered with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin in patients with progressive metastatic or unresectable colorectal cancer or other solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Patients receive oral SAHA once or twice daily on days 1-3. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 4 followed by fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 4-5. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
