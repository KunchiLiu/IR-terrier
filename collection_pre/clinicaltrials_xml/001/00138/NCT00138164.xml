	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as denileukin diftitox, may be able to carry cancer-killing substances directly to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well denileukin diftitox works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukin Diftitox in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of denileukin diftitox, in terms of objective response and time to progression, in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. - Determine the 1-year overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 20-80 minutes on days 1-3, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, and 99 (weeks 1-16) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a partial response at week 16 may continue treatment once monthly for up to 8 additional doses or until a complete response (CR) is achieved. Patients achieving a CR (at any time) receive 2 additional monthly doses of denileukin diftitox beyond CR. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
