	<brief_title>A One Year Clinical Trial Assessing the Usefulness and Safety of Inhaled Insulin in Diabetics With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pfizer announced in October 2007 that it would stop marketing Exubera. At that time recruitment for study A2171030 was placed on hold. Nektar, the company from which Pfizer licensed Exubera, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search for a new marketing partner. Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability of Exubera. As a result, study A2171030 was terminated on June 17, 2008. Neither safety nor efficacy reasons were the cause of the study termination.</detailed_description>
