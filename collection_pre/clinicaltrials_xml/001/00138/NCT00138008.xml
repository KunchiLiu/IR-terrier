	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate Radiotherapy Followed by Endocrine Therapy Vs Endocrine Therapy Alone for PSA Failure After Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial is conducted in Japan to evaluate radiotherapy followed by endocrine therapy for PSA failure after radical prostatectomy. Patients who have PSA failure after radical prostatectomy under a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer (T1-2 N0M0) are randomized into treatment group of either radiotherapy followed by endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone. Urologic Oncology Study Group (UOSG) in the JCOG composed of 36 specialized institutions will recruit 200 patients. The primary endpoint is time to treatment failure (TTF) of bicalutamide and secondary endpoints are TTF of protocol treatment, progression free survival, overall survival, adverse events and quality of life (QOL). The Clinical Trial Review Committee of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) approved the protocol on April 13, 2004, and the study was activated on May 17, 2004.</detailed_description>
