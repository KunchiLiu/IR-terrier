	<brief_summary>This study intends to optimize a fluorouracil/irinotecan chemotherapy regimen by the identification of individual thymidylate synthase (TS) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) polymorphisms before the first administration. The results of this identification determine the chemotherapy type: high-dose irinotecan or not.</brief_summary>
