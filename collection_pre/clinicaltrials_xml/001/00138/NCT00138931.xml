	<brief_summary>We are studying the genetics of human cardiovascular and neuromuscular disease. There are many different genetic regions that have been associated with the development of cardiomyopathy. An equal number of genetic regions have been associated with muscular dystrophy and there is overlap because some of the identical genes, when mutated, produce both cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy. We are working to identify genes and gene mutations associated with cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias and muscular dystrophy. We propose to screen these samples for mutations in genes known to be involved in these disorders.</brief_summary>
