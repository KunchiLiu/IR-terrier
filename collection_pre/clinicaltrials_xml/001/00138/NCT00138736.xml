	<brief_title>Study on Mannan Binding Lectin (MBL) Substitution in MBL-Deficient Children With Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mannan Binding Lectin (MBL) is a member of the lectin pathway of the complement system and plays an important role in the innate immune system. MBL replacement in MBL-deficient children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia represents a new approach to lower the risk of febrile episodes, of hospital admission, of prolonged use of intravenous antibiotics and of severe infections. The aim of the Phase II study is to find evidence for the correct prediction of plasma levels of MBL necessary for clinical effects and biological efficacy, to confirm the dosage regimen needed to reach the required MBL plasma levels, and reconfirm the safety and lack of side-effects.</detailed_description>
