	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that a subpopulation of patients with candiduria are at significant risk for disseminated disease and would benefit from treatment, while others are at low risk from complications and therefore require no antifungal therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Funguria in Hospitalized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol will attempt to generate a detailed clinical profile of patients with funguria and identify subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for candiduria and determine the relative risks for obtaining candiduria. In addition, it will look at identifying subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for candidemia and identifying subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for death. Finally, it will attempt to determine if funguria independently predicts fungemia or death. Data will be complemented by surveillance of a comparable population without funguria.</detailed_description>
