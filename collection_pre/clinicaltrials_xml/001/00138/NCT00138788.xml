	<brief_title>Brain Metastases Study: Radiotherapy Fractionation Schemes in the Treatment of Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Untreated brain metastases are usually fatal within a few weeks. The standard treatment for brain metastases is whole brain irradiation. This results on average in an increase in survival by 2 to 4 times compared to withholding irradiation. The majority of patients experience improvement in the level of functioning as a result of irradiation. None-the-less approximately half of patients die because of progression of the brain metastases and their quality of life is often dominated by the effects of brain metastases. Various different dosages of radiation have been assessed and we wish to further investigate this by comparing a less intense schema with a more intense schema. Both of these fall within the range of published experience but have not been directly compared. The more intense schema may have more effect on the tumour but previous variations of dose intensity have not shown significant differences in survival. Differences in control of the metastases in the brain have been suggested but there have been no good comparisons of quality of life. Obviously when survival is measured on average in only 3 to 6 months, this is an important parameter for comparison. Comparisons: Stratification is by diagnosis either excision or biopsy/clinical. Patients will be randomised to receive either 40Gy 20#bd or 20Gy 4#daily.</detailed_description>
