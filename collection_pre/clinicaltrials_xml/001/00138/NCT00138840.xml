	<brief_summary>STA-5326 is an experimental drug that has been shown to block the release of interleukin-12 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Given this activity on the immune system, STA-5326 mesylate is a potential treatment for various autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease, that are mediated by the inappropriate expression of Th1 cytokines. This study is evaluating the use of STA-5326 mesylate in patients with moderate to severe, active Crohn's disease. Study visits include a screening visit, 9 treatment period visits over 6 months and a follow-up visit that will occur 30 days following the end of treatment. Study drug treatment will continue for up to 6 months.</brief_summary>
