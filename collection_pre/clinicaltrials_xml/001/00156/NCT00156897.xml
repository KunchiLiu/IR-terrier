	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of ATL-962 in Obese Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is a significant and increasing clinical problem. There is a need for effective therapeutic agents to help people reduce weight. ATL-962 is a lipase inhibitor which could reduce the amount of fat absorbed from a person's diet, leading to weight reduction. In this study patients with Type II diabetes who are clinically obese will receive ATL-962 at one of three dose levels, or placebo, or orlistat (another lipase inhibitor). The study will investigate the amount of weight lost after 12 weeks' treatment and will compare the safety and tolerability profile of ATL-962 and orlistat.</detailed_description>
