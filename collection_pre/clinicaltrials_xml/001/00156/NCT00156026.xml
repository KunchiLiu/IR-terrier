	<brief_title>Immediate Treatment vs Colposcopic Follow-up for Biopsy-Proven CIN 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In women who present with biopsy-proven CIN 1, to compare the management approach of regular colposcopic follow-up and only treating progressive disease using the LEEP, with an approach of immediate treatment using LEEP.
