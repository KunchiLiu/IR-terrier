	<brief_title>Phase 1 Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of AI-700 in Patients With Diminished DLCO and COPD and/or CHF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In ongoing clinical trials, AI-700 is currently being evaluated for its value to provide enhanced echocardiography to detect CAD. The patient population is comprised of those patients who have chest pain and are being evaluated for inducible ischemia. This population may include patients with compromised pulmonary function due to COPD or CHF. This study was to evaluate the safety of AI-700 in these patients.</detailed_description>
