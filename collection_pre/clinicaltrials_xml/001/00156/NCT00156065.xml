	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a brain disease. The primary features of schizophrenia are characterized by Positive symptoms (symptoms that should not be there, inability to think clearly, to distinguish reality from fantasy i.e., hearing voices) and Negative symptoms (a reduction or absence of normal behaviors or emotions, i.e., unable to manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others). Other symptoms include reduced ability to recall and learn new information, difficulty with problem solving, or maintaining productive employment. The symptoms of schizophrenia may be due to an imbalance in chemicals in the brain, primarily dopamine and serotonin, which enables brain cells to communicate with each other. The clinical development of asenapine, as described in the 2007 IDB appears to have antipsychotic activity with superior symptomatic control compared to placebo and an improved safety profile compared to currently available neuroleptics. Its fast dissolving formulation may further add to treatment compliance. While various titration schedules have been used in previous studies, dose increases at 5 mg BID (twice daily) up to 10 mg BID have been well tolerated. Therefore, further exploration in a larger group of subjects with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia using an asenapine flexible dosing design ( 5 or 10 mg BID) will mimic actual clinical practice in a long-term 52-week extension trial.</brief_summary>
