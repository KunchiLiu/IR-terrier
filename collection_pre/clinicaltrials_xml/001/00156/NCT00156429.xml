	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective review of the data available on patients and their family members with HCM and prospective follow-up of this cohort for clinical outcome and diagnostic studies. Genetic samples are being examined in this cohort to determine whether certain to determine whether certain beta-AR polymorphisms as well as other common genetic polymorphisms are associated with different morphological features, such as LVH in patients with HCM and whether these polymorphisms influence the clinical course and outcome in patients with HCM. For that purpose, we will build a database with clinical information including serial echocardiographic measurements for patients with HCM that have regular follow up and test them for beta-AR polymorphisms as well as other common genetic polymorphisms and other known cardiac-related polymorphisms that can potentially contribute to the morphologic differences seen in patients with HCM.</brief_summary>
