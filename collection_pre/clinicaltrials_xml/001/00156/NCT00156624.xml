	<brief_title>Thunder Trial - Local Taxan With Short Time Contact for Reduction of Restenosis in Distal Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug eluting stents have been proven to reduce the restenosis rate in the coronary arteries. Unfortunately drug eluting stents failed to demonstrate superiority over bare stents in the superficial femoral artery. We could show that a non-stent based delivery of Taxan was equal or superior to drug eluting stents in an animal model. This was both true for the coronary arteries and peripheral vessels. In a prospective blinded trail &gt;135 patients are randomized either to receive Taxan locally administered with a balloon catheter during balloon angioplasty, or together with contrast media. One group serves as control. There were no limitations due to lesion length. Follow-up angiography will be after 6 months, 12 months and 2 years.</detailed_description>
