	<brief_title>ALK21-006EXT: Long-term Safety of Medisorb速 Naltrexone (VIVITROL速) in Alcohol- or Opioid-dependent Adults (Extension of Study ALK21-006 [NCT01218997])</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From the date of successful completion of Study ALK21-006 (base study [NCT01218997])), all subjects, including those who received oral naltrexone during the base study, were given the option to enroll in this extension study. Study investigators ensured that subjects were opioid-free and did not demonstrate evidence of withdrawal prior to administration of VIVITROL therapy. If the investigator suspected recent clinically significant opioid use, a naloxone challenge test was performed. The naloxone challenge was not performed in a subject presenting clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal or in a subject whose urine contained opioids.</detailed_description>
