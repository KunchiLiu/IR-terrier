	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine Versus Follow-up After Resection of Colorectal Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, multi-centre, open phase III study with two parallel groups of patients according to the eligibility criteria. The times in both hierarchical classified endpoints will be measured as times from randomization. Patients with macroscopic complete resection of colorectal liver metastases will be randomized in: Arm A: post-operative adjuvant therapy with Capecitabine/ Oxaliplatin over 6 months and follow-up or Arm B: follow-up Randomization: stratification after Scores of Fong et al: - number of metastases (1 vs. &gt;=1) - maximal diameter of the metastasis (&lt;= 5cm vs. &gt; 5cm) - disease free interval (&gt;= 12 months vs. &gt; 12 months) - CEA (&lt;= 200ng/l vs. &gt;200 ng/l) in the strata 0-1, 2 and &gt;= 3,</detailed_description>
