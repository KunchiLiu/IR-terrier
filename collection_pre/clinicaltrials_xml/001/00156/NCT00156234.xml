	<brief_summary>Patients suffering from congestive heart failure report reduced exercise capacity. This skeletal muscle dysfunction is also detectable when using small muscle groups which should not put any demand on the heart. We hypothesize that congestive heart failure has systemic effects that causes the skeletal muscle dysfunction.</brief_summary>
