	<brief_title>The Effect of Two Versus Ten Days Application of Flammacerium in Partial Thickness Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerium is suggested to halt the cytokine cascade ensuing burn injury by binding the 'burn toxin' and, when used in combination with silver-sulfadiazine, may enhance its antibacterial effect. Since 1984, the combination of cerium and silver sulfadiazine, flammacerium, has been used in our centre. Current practice is to treat acute, non-facial, burns with daily cleaning and (re-)application of flammacerium for a total of ten days. However, prolonged application of cerium is thought to be unnecessary - it is effective in the early stages after injury- and prolonged application of silver sulfadiazine has a negative effect on wound healing. The objective of the proposed study is therefore, to assess whether the application of flammacerium for 2 days is as good as, or even better than, the application of flammacerium for 10 days regarding woundhealing in partial thickness burns.</detailed_description>
