	<brief_title>Study of Asoprisnil in the Treatment of Uterine Fibroids.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in women and many women must resort to surgery for relief. The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of two asoprisnil doses (10 and 25 mg tablets) administered daily to women who received asoprisnil in one of the asoprisnil long-term studies (study C03-062 or study M01-391). The safety endpoints for this study will include the affects of asoprisnil on the endometrium, ovaries, bone (a subset of study M01-391 subjects), lipid profiles, adverse events, and changes from baseline lab values and vital signs. Some subjects receiving asoprisnil developed endometrial changes. As a result, dosing was prematurely discontinued for all subjects. To ensure safety, subjects will remain on study and will undergo scheduled study procedures. In most subjects, endometrial changes reversed after asoprisnil discontinuation.</detailed_description>
