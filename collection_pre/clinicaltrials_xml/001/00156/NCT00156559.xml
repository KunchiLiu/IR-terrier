	<brief_summary>This research is designed to address the question, "Does the relative deficit in vaccine immunogenicity in extremely premature infants persist beyond the first 6 months of life?" We propose to measure the immunogenicity of varicella and mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at &lt;29 weeks gestation, when compared to full-term infants, as measured by the relevant viral serologies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title: MMR and Varicella Vaccine Responses in Extremely Premature Infants Phase: IV Population: 16 generally healthy premature infants born at &lt; 29 weeks' gestation, &lt; 16 months old from the Rochester area 16 generally healthy full-term infants born at &gt;/= 37 weeks' gestation, &lt; 16 months old from the Rochester area Number of Sites: University of Rochester Study Duration: 1.5 - 8.5 months Description of Agent or Intervention: Subjects will make 2 study visits. The first, at 15 months of age, will coincide with a routine well child visit. Subjects will have 2 mL of blood drawn at the time of their routine, 15-month MMR, varicella, and pneumococcal conjugate immunizations. At a second study visit 4-6 weeks later, another 2 mL of blood will be drawn. Objectives: Primary: We propose to measure the immunogenicity of routinely administered varicella and mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at &lt;29 weeks gestation (premature), when compared to that in full-term infants. Measles titers will be measured by neutralization assay. Mumps and rubella titers will be measured by enzyme-linked florescent immunoassay. Varicella titers will be measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Safety will be assessed by parental recall of vaccine-related adverse events and by active, prospective collection of blood-draw-associated adverse events. Schematic of Study Design: Subjects will be approached at 9-12 months of age for inclusion, and will consent at this time or at Visit 1 Visit 1 (15 mos): Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw Routine MMR, varicella vaccines administered by primary pediatrician per standard of care (at Visit 1) Visit 2 (16 mos): Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw Varicella, mumps, measles and rubella vaccine titers measured by ELISA</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study. 1. Premature infant &lt; 29 weeks' gestation at birth or term infant &gt;/= 37 weeks' gestation at birth. 2. Postnatal age &lt; 16 months, 0 days. 3. Has not yet received MMR or varicella vaccines. (There are no restrictions on the administration of other vaccines at the time of MMR/varicella vaccination.) 4. Parental permission. 5. Agreement of primary care pediatrician/ health care provider. 6. Receives primary pediatric care within an approximate 25mile radius of the University of Rochester. 7. Healthy status at enrollment. 1. Known immunodeficiency. 2. Systemic corticosteroid therapy at the time of MMR/varicella vaccination. 3. Requiring oxygen therapy. 4. Clinically significant findings on review of medical history and physical exam determined by the investigator or subinvestigator to be sufficient for exclusion. 5. Any condition determined by the investigator that would interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine or be a potential health risk to the subject.</criteria>
