	<detailed_description>Electrical stimulation in the apex of the right ventricle ( ventricular pacing) usually improves the heart function of patients with a pacemaker and can even be life-saving. However, evidence is accumulating that ventricular pacing may also have undesired long-term cardiac effects. Therefore, it makes sense to limit ventricular pacing to the absolute required minimum. The functionality RVP (Refined Ventricular Pacing) in the C-series 2nd generation pacemakers of Vitatron B.V. Arnhem, the Netherlands is designed to reduce ventricular pacing. After implantation of the Vitatron C50 D model C50A2 (pacemaker) or Vitatron C60 DR model C60A2 (pacemaker) and a 4-6 weeks stabilization period, proper functioning of pacemaker and leads (stimulation- and sensing parameters) is checked. The pacemakers will be programmed according to predefined settings. In the following 4-weeks Baseline period diagnostic data (atrial fibrillation burden and percentage of ventricular pacing (% VP)) are collected in the pacemaker memory. Based on these data, patients will be excluded from further participation (patients with more than 15% atrial fibrillation) or subdivided into three groups: (a) &lt; 30% VP (30- VP group), (b) &gt;30% VP, Sick Sinus Syndrome and normal conductivity (SSS group), (c) &gt;30% VP, 1st or 2nd degree AV block. Patients in these three groups will be treated for 4 weeks alternatively with the RVP functionality switched ON or OFF. The order will be determined by randomization. At the end of these two cross-over periods the % VP and the judgment of the patients of the last period will be assessed. Adverse events will be recorded from the moment of study enrolment.</detailed_description>
