	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver or Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in each group of patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression free survival at 6 months. II. To evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment in each group of patients. III. To evaluate median overall survival, 6 and 12 months survival rates. IV. To assess target-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/EGFR-P protein expression and the genes that regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis, which are either downstream of or cross-talk with the EGFR signaling pathway, to explore their association with clinical outcome. V. To measure expression profile and mutations of genes critical for EGFR and (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2 signaling pathways with particular relevance to GW572016, and to explore new gene-drug relationships as relating to hepatocellular and biliary carcinomas. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
