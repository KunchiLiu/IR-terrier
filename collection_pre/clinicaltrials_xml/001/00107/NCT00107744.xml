	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Protein and Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Epidemiologic studies suggest that vegetable protein intake is inversely related to blood pressure. Objectives: To examine the effect of soybean protein supplementation on blood pressure in persons with prehypertension or stage-1 hypertension Design: Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial Study Participants: 300 participants, aged 35-64 years, with an initial untreated systolic blood pressure of 130-159 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 80-99 mmHg Intervention: Study participants will be randomly assigned to take 40-grams of isolated soybean protein supplements per day or complex carbohydrate control for 12 weeks. Outcomes: Blood pressure measurements will be obtained using random-zero sphygmomanometers at baseline and during the trial at weeks 6 and 12. Net changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure before and after the intervention is the primary outcome.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Trial participants were men and women 35 to 65 years of age who had an average systolic blood pressure of 130159 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 8099 mmHg based on an average of 9 readings (3 observations at each of 3 screening visits). Selfreported use of antihypertensive medications during the preceding two months History of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, psychiatric disease, or any other serious lifethreatening illness that required regular medical treatment Serum creatinine ≥150.3 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) at the screening examination Alcohol intake ≥21 drinks/week or ≥40 grams/day Women who were currently pregnant or intended to become pregnant during the study were also excluded</criteria>
