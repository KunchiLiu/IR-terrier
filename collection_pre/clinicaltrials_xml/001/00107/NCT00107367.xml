	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers radiation directly to the area where a tumor was surgically removed may kill any remaining tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works in treating patients who are undergoing surgery to remove a metastatic brain tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery to Remove a Metastatic Brain Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 1-year local control rate in patients undergoing resection of a solitary brain metastasis comprising intraoperative radiotherapy using the INTRABEAM® system. Secondary - Determine the survival of patients treated with this therapy. - Determine distant recurrence of disease in patients treated with this therapy. - Determine the toxicity of this therapy in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this therapy. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients undergo surgical resection of a brain metastasis. Patients then undergo intraoperative radiotherapy using the INTRABEAM® system. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months for 2 years. Patients are followed within 48 hours after surgery, at 1 and 3 months, and then every 3 months for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-62 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
