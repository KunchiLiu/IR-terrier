	<brief_summary>This protocol is a study of HIV+ young people who were identified as having certain HIV-1 specific T-cell responses and genetic markers while previously enrolled in the 5-year longitudinal adolescent study, "REACH." Blood samples will be collected, a medical and medication history and physical examination will be performed every 6 months for a total of 2 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Genetic Markers as Explanations for the Observed Differences in Disease Progression in HIV+ Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between HLA class I genotypes with differing progression to AIDS in individuals who are followed after being off antiretroviral therapy. These studies do not always associate the same HLA class I alleles with the risks of HIV-1 disease progression; however they consistently demonstrated that HLA-B*35 and B*53 portend a bad outcome compared to the better outcome observed in HLA-B*27 and B*57 carriers. Despite this information, very little data exists to explain the mechanism of this association. This longitudinal study will look at the HIV-1 specific CD8+ T-cell responses and the dominant HIV-1 genotype among individuals identified as HLA-B*27, B*35, B*53 and B*57 positive through studies done in collaboration with the REACH project.</detailed_description>
