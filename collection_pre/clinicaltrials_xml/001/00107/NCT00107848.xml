	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with PROVIGIL in children and adolescents with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with narcolepsy or OSAHS (obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea), when administered for up to 12 months. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study by means of adverse event information, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, and body weight and height measurements; quarterly physical examination findings; and 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG) evaluations at the end of the study. In addition, the cognitive and behavioral effects of PROVIGIL will be assessed quarterly as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 (CBCL/6-18), a brief psychiatric interview, and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT 2).</brief_summary>

Acceptable methods of birth control include: barrier method with spermicide; steroidal contraceptives (oral, topical [patch], implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method; intrauterine device (IUD); or abstinence No positive urine drug screen (UDS) for any illicit drug or alcohol (ethanol) at baseline visit, unless a false positive is suspected, in which case the UDS will be repeated. If the patient has a positive drug screen for methylphenidate or amphetamine at screening, the patient must have a negative UDS after a washout period and prior to baseline. Have a parent or legal guardian who is willing to participate in the study Continue to meet inclusion criteria from the previous study, as appropriate Have self induced sleep deprivation/poor sleep hygiene Have a past or present seizure disorder (except history of a single febrile seizure), a history of psychosis, or of clinically significant head trauma (eg, brain damage) or past neurosurgery Have a history of suicide attempt, or are at suicidal risk A clinically significant drug sensitivity to stimulants such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, or pemoline; and modafinil or any of its components Any disorder that could interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion (including previous gastrointestinal surgery) Active, clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematologic, neoplastic, endocrine, neurologic, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other major clinically significant disorder/disease Any clinically significant deviation from the normal range(s) in the ECG or physical examination findings, or clinical laboratory (ie, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis) test results at the screening/baseline visit Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below the lower limit of normal at the baseline visit (NOTE: If the ANC is below the lower limit of normal at the baseline visit, the medical monitor will be consulted for continued eligibility in the study.) A seated pulse outside the range of 60 through 115 bpm after resting for 5 minutes A total daily intake of more than 500 mg of caffeine per day (eg, approximately ten 12 ounce caffeinated sodas, 5 cups of coffee or tea, or about 25 ounces of chocolate per day) within 1 week of the baseline visit Pregnant or lactating/nursing; any child who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn.</criteria>
