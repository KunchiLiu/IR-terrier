	<brief_summary>This protocol is designed to obtain detailed information on the impact of body composition on the pharmacokinetic behavior of doxorubicin after a single intravenous dose in children 21 years of age or younger. There is no efficacy component. Approximately 9 children will be enrolled at Children's Hospital Boston. The information gained from this study could be very important in developing dosing strategies for doxorubicin in the obese patient population.</brief_summary>
