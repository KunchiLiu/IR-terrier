	<brief_title>The Effects of Modafinil on Waking Function and on Sleep in Individuals With Primary Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary goal is to undertake a 2nd study evaluating whether Modafinil, alone or in combination with behavioral treatment for insomnia, will improve subjects' sleep continuity and/or self report daytime function. METHODS AND PROCEDURES Schedule for Procedures. Screening interview Sleep over night in our lab for one night 8 weeks of either behavioral or psychological therapy for insomnia 3 month post therapy follow up (two weeks of sleep diaries and one lab visit) 40 patients aged 25-80 with insomnia. All subjects will have a stable sleep/wake schedule with a preferred sleep phase between 10:00 PM and 8:00 AM. The age range is restricted to 1) minimize circadian rhythm influences on the diagnoses of Psychophysiological insomnia, 2) to increase our ability to recruit medically healthy sample, and 3) increase sample homogeneity. All subjects will meet diagnostic criteria for Psychophysiological Insomnia according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD). Criteria are: the complaint of insomnia and impaired daytime function; an indication of learned sleep-preventing associations and somatized tension; active help seeking. The complaint of disturbed sleep will have one or more of the following characteristics: &gt;30 minutes to fall asleep and/or &gt;2 awakenings per night of &gt;15 minutes duration and/or wake after sleep onset time of &gt; 30 minutes, problem frequency &gt;4 nights/ week, and problem duration &gt;6 months. In addition, all subjects will complain of fatigue and/or sleepiness at intake. Treatment. Regardless of group assignment, all subjects will 1) wear an actiwatch, 2) be seen on an individual basis for 8 weeks. Session length will be held constant and all patients will be seen by the same therapist (Wilfred Pigeon, PhD). Backup support will be provided by the Principal Investigator (Michael Perlis, PhD) or by the Clinic's Nurse Practitioner (Carla Jungquist, MSN) and 3) complete daily sleep diaries for duration of the study (from study intake until study end [8 weeks]).</detailed_description>
