	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the time course of muscle relaxation after administration of three different single intravenous bolus doses of rocuronium bromide for intubation (insertion of a tube through the nose or mouth into the trachea to provide artificial ventilation) in term neonates (birth to &lt;28 days old), infants (28 days to &lt;=3 months) and toddlers (&gt;3 months to &lt;=2 years), children (2 years to less than or equal to 11 years of age), and adolescents (&gt;11 years to less than or equal to 17 years of age). Subjects in each of the age groups will be randomized to one of 3 ZemuronÂ® doses: 0.45 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg.</brief_summary>
