	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of triptorelin when used for the protection of the ovaries (pair of female reproductive organs) during cyclophosphamide therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; lupus) and to see what effects (good or bad) it has on patients. The study will be done with female patients who have been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, are younger than 21 years of age, and require intravenous cyclophosphamide to control the disease. Each patient will be in the study for approximately 23 months, until 4 months after the intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment has been completed. This study is currently being conducted at 3 sites across the United States and Brazil (Los Angeles, Cincinnati and San Paulo Brazil). A total of 50 patients will participate in this study. Each patient will be randomized (assigned) to one of 5 groups. Randomization means that patients are put into a group completely by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither the patient nor the study staff knows what group the patient is in. The patient has a 20% chance of being placed in any group.

	<brief_title>Triptorelin for Ovary Protection in Childhood Onset Lupus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lupus is an autoimmune disease that may harm all organs in the body and especially affects the kidney, brain, skin and lungs. Cyclophosphamide is a very effective medication to treat lupus, but it can damage the ovaries (pair of reproductive organs). Only female lupus patients may participate in this study.</detailed_description>
