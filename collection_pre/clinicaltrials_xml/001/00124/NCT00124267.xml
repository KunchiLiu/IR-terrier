	<brief_summary>Cerebral malaria is the most lethal complication of P.falciparum infection with a mortality rate between 5 and 40%. Intravenous quinine remains the recommended treatment for cerebral malaria. However its administration is often not feasible due to lack of simple equipment or trained staff. When referral is not possible, a viable alternative is needed. The intrarectal route is of interest in children since it is painless and simple. Studies of the efficacy of intrarectal quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria are limited.

	<brief_title>Efficacy of Intrarectal Versus Intravenous Quinine for the Treatment of Childhood Cerebral Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral malaria is the most lethal complication of P.falciparum infection with a mortality rate between 5 and 40%. Intravenous quinine remains the recommended treatment for cerebral malaria. However its administration is often not feasible due to lack of simple equipment or trained staff. When referral is not possible, a viable alternative is needed. The intrarectal route is of interest in children since it is painless and simple. A few studies in Francophone Africa have reported clinical efficacy and tolerance of intrarectal quinine. Although the studies were randomized trials, they were not blinded and did not use the WHO definition of cerebral malaria as selection criteria. The current study aims to establish whether intrarectal quinine is as effective and as safe as intravenous quinine in the treatment of childhood cerebral malaria. To address the shortcomings of the Francophone African studies, the investigators have designed a randomized, double blind placebo controlled clinical trial to include patients who meet the WHO definition of cerebral malaria. Hypothesis: Intrarectal quinine (15mg/kg every 8 hours) given to children with cerebral malaria, will lead to a shorter parasite clearance time (39.9 hours) than intravenous quinine (55.0 hours). The investigators calculated a sample size of 54 patients in each group for 90% power and 95% confidence. In the calculation, the researchers assumed that the children receiving intrarectal quinine would have a mean parasite clearance time of 39.9 (SD 24.3) hours and those receiving intravenous quinine would have a mean parasite clearance time of 55.0(SD 24.3) hours (27.5% effect size), according to a study by Aceng, Byarugaba and Tumwine in the same hospital.</detailed_description>
