	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving cetuximab together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary * Determine the 11 month survival rate in older and/or poor performance status patients with stage IIIA or stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy. Secondary - Determine the tumor response rate, overall survival, and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine whether fear of death is less severe in the oldest of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine whether fear of death predicts survival of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Beginning on day 8, patients receive concurrent radiotherapy once daily on days 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 1 week, at 1 and 4 months, and then every 3 months for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months</detailed_description>
