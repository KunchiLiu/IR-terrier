	<detailed_description>The efficacy of EPA-DHA supplementation will be assessed in a randomized placebo-controlled trial with cognitive decline and early signs of depression as primary outcome measures. In this study 300 elderly people will be randomly allocated to one of three treatments. Two groups will receive fish oil capsules with different doses EPA/DHA (a normal dose or a high dose) and the third group will receive placebo capsules. At the start and at the end of the intervention period cognitive function, the occurrence of depression, quality of life, anthropometric values and biochemical indicators will be measured. After completion of the trial a workshop will be organized in which the outcomes of the proposed study will be presented to representatives of several key areas concerning mental health of elderly people.</detailed_description>
