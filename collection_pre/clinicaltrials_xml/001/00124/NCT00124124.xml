	<brief_summary>In this study, a melanoma vaccine (5 melanoma peptides) is given with either Montanide or dendritic cells as adjuvants. This randomized trial will establish the safety of both vaccines and compare the 2 vaccine adjuvants in their efficacy to induce immune responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Dendritic Cells Versus Montanide as Adjuvants in a Melanoma Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we will examine whether DCs pulsed with candidate melanoma-specific peptides and KLH can boost CTL responses to melanoma antigens in melanoma patients who are clinically free of disease but at high risk for recurrence. This vaccine will be compared to direct injection of the same peptides with KLH and Montanide as adjuvant.</detailed_description>
