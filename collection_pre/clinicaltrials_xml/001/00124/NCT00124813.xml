	<brief_summary>Background: In some studies, thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis. Induction therapy: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, oral idarubicin and dexamethasone (T-CID) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Maintenance therapy: Randomized trial to compare efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide and thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy in patients with at least stable disease after T-CID.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: In some studies, thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis. After 3-8 cycles of T-CID patients with at least stable disease will be randomized to receive thalidomide or thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy for at least one year or until progression.</detailed_description>
