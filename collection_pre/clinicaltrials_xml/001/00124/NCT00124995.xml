	<brief_summary>Although widely used for the treatment of pediatric status asthmaticus, intravenous terbutaline has potentially significant side effects; may not improve outcomes; and may increase Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay. This study is designed to test the efficacy of intravenous terbutaline for the treatment of status asthmaticus by adding intravenous terbutaline or placebo to standard asthma treatment. The dose of terbutaline or placebo will be titrated according to severity of illness as quantified by a validated clinical asthma score. Differences in outcomes between the study groups, such as length of stay, hospital costs, and lung function will be compared.</brief_summary>
