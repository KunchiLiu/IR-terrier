	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this 3-year project is to determine whether the provision of realignment therapy in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) relieves knee pain and improves function. The researchers will test the hypothesis that compared to control treatment, the use of realignment therapy (valgus knee brace + motion control shoes + orthosis) is effective in medial knee OA. The specific aims are: - To undertake a 30 week randomized crossover clinical trial in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis to determine whether provision of realignment therapy leads to lower pain scores and improved function during the time of this treatment than during the use of a placebo treatment; - To perform an open label follow-up study to track use and effectiveness of treatment. This project will be co-funded by DonJoy Orthopedic, a knee bracing company.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Trial participants must meet American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for osteoarthritis with knee pain, aching or stiffness on most of the past 30 days and evidence on radiograph of a definite osteophyte. In addition, because the researchers are interested in recruiting persons with medial knee osteoarthritis, participants will need to have evidence of disease in this compartment on their radiographs, and not have lateral compartment or patellofemoral compartment disease. Medial disease is based on definitions used in the researcher's previous publications as definite radiographic OA + at least grade 1 medial narrowing (03 scale) using an atlas from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Individuals with clinical evidence of patellofemoral disease or knee pathology (other than medial compartment OA) likely to be causing their knee pain. Individuals who usually use an ambulation aid to walk such as a cane, crutch, walker or wheel chair. Amputation of foot or previous major trauma to foot that would raise concerns about whether an insert might worsen foot pain. Persons with foot lesions such as sores or ulcers in which redistributing load in the foot might be dangerous, will be excluded. Known neuropathy from diabetes or for other reasons. Past history of deep venous thrombosis. Pain emanating more from back or hip than from knee as determined by screening questionnaire Low pain score on WOMAC, a widely used and well validated questionnaire to assess knee symptoms. To evaluate response, the researchers will require that patients have a minimal score of at least 4 out of 10 on at least 2 of 5 questions, or a total of greater than 15 out of 50 for the WOMAC pain scale in the eligible knee at prerandomization phone call and visit, and at randomization visit. This will allow us to detect response to treatment if response occurs. Planning to move from area within 9 months of study screening Symptomatic comorbid disease limits walking more than knee pain (per screening questionnaire) Receiving corticosteroid injections in the month prior to starting the trial. No other treatments will trigger exclusion, although for patients who have been on glucosamine +/or chondroitin +/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) the researchers will require that they must have taken these treatments for at least 2 months prior to onset of trial and to commit to not start a new treatment throughout the trial. Bilateral total knee replacements (TKR) or plan for TKR in next 6 months for affected knee. Known other causes of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), gout, psoriatic arthritis, pseudogout. Failure to pass 4 week runin test. Volunteers in a precontemplative state (persons who would not consider realignment therapy as a therapeutic option for their knee OA).</criteria>
