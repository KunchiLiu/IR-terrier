	<brief_summary>Modafinil is a medication that may enhance mood and increase energy in cocaine addicts, which may be useful in preventing cocaine relapse. Naltrexone is a medication that is currently used to treat drug and alcohol addiction. A combination of these two medications may be beneficial in reducing drug and alcohol use in individuals undergoing substance abuse treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of modafinil and naltrexone, alone and in combination, at reducing drug and alcohol use in individuals addicted to cocaine and alcohol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modafinil and Naltrexone to Reduce Cocaine and Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine and alcohol addiction are serious health problems with no available medical treatment for preventing relapse. Past research has shown that individuals who are addicted to both cocaine and alcohol typically respond poorly to conventional substance abuse treatment. Little attention has been directed towards how best to treat these individuals. Naltrexone is a medication that is currently used to treat drug and alcohol addiction. It acts by blocking the "high" feeling produced by drugs and alcohol. Modafinil, another medication, enhances mood, increases energy, and improves concentration in people with narcolepsy. Preliminary research has shown that it may produce similar effects to cocaine, thereby potentially countering the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal. Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBT), a form of therapy that aims to alter an individual's patterns of behavior and drug use, is also an important component of substance abuse treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of CBT plus placebo, CBT plus modafinil, CBT plus naltrexone, and CBT plus a combination of modafinil and naltrexone at reducing cocaine and alcohol use in individuals addicted to both substances. This 14-week study will enroll individuals addicted to both cocaine and alcohol. During a 1-week screening period, potential participants will be required to complete a detoxification program, including stopping all cocaine and alcohol use. Participants will also undergo a physical exam and an electrocardiogram. Blood will be drawn for laboratory tests, and urine tests will be used to screen for the presence of drugs and alcohol. Individuals who complete the screening and meet all study requirements will be permitted to participate in the treatment phase of the study. During the 13-week treatment phase, participants will be randomly assigned to receive modafinil, naltrexone, a combination of modafinil and naltrexone, or placebo. All participants will attend a CBT session once a week. Study visits will take place twice a week. At each visit, a urine test and breathalyzer will be used to screen for the presence of alcohol and drugs. Participants will also complete standardized psychological questionnaires to measure drug and alcohol craving, treatment services received, severity of illness, and withdrawal symptoms. In addition, participants will meet weekly with a nurse practitioner, who will dispense study medications, monitor adverse events, and evaluate the participant's clinical status. A follow-up evaluation will occur 6 months following the end of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>4.1 Inclusion Criteria 1. Male and females, 18 years of age or older. 2. Meets DSMIV criteria for current diagnoses of cocaine and alcohol dependence, determined by the SCIDIV. 3. In the past 30 days, used no less than $200worth of cocaine and meets the following drinking criteria as measured by the Timeline Followback (TLFB) (Sobell, 1995): 1. drank within 30 days of intake day, 2. reports a minimum of 48 standard alcoholic (avg. 12 drinks/wk) in a consecutive 30day period over the 90day period prior to starting intake (i.e., a minimum of 40% days drinking), and 3. has 2 or more days of heavy drinking (defined as 5 or more drinks per day in males and 4 or more drinks per day in females) in this same pretreatment period. 4. 72 consecutive hours of abstinence from alcohol, determined by selfreports and confirmed by a negative breathalyzer tests, and a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Scale for Alcohol (CIWAAR) (Sullivan, 1989) score below eight. Subjects will be encouraged to achieve 72 consecutive hours of abstinence, however, subjects who have achieved between 48 and 72 consecutive hours of abstinence will be included with the approval of the principal investigator. We anticipate that these subjects will comprise less than 5% of total enrolled subjects. Subjects will be given 2 additional weeks beyond the screening week to attain the appropriate period of alcohol abstinence prior to randomization. 5. Lives a commutable distance from the TRC and agrees to attend all research visits including followup visits. 6. Speaks, understands, and prints in English 7. Ability to give informed consent Exclusion Criteria 1. Abstinent from cocaine or alcohol for 30 consecutive days prior to signing consent form. 2. Meets DSM IV criteria for dependence on any substance other than cocaine and alcohol (except nicotine), determined by the SCID. 3.

Meets current or lifetime DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia or any psychotic disorder or organic mental disorder.

Severe physical or medical illnesses such as AIDS, active hepatitis, significant hepatocellular injury as evidenced by elevated total bilirubin levels (&gt;1.3 mg/dl),or elevated levels (over 4.5x normal) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (SGPT) after the required 3 days of abstinence. 7. Use of an investigational medication in the 30 days prior to randomization. 8. History of hypersensitivity to modafinil or naltrexone 9. Receiving chronic therapy with any drug known to interact adversely with either modafinil or naltrexone including propranolol, phenytoin, warfarin, diazepam 10. Took a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 30 days of randomization. 11. Is female and tests positive on a pregnancy test, is contemplating pregnancy in the next 6 months, is nursing, or is not using an effective contraceptive method (if relevant). Acceptable methods of contraception include barrier methods (diaphragm or condom with spermicide, female condom), intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system, levonorgrestrel implant, and medroxyprogeterone acetate contraceptive injection, copper IUD, vaginal contraceptive film, cervical cap, contraceptive foam. 12.
