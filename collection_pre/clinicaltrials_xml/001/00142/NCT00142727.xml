	<brief_title>Opioid Agonist and Antagonist Effects on Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacological effects of opioids in opioid dependent individuals can vary as a function of the characteristics of the opioid being studied (e.g., whether it is an agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist; the dose administered; and the route of administration). Another important set of factors influencing the effects produced by opioids is the characteristics of the organism to which the opioid is being administered. One such characteristic is the level of physical dependence in individuals. Participants in this study will be maintained on different dose levels of an opioid agonist (methadone). The participant will be challenged with a prototypic opioid agonist, antagonist, and a mixed agonist-antagonist with partial agonist features in order to determine the effects that each has on the human body.</detailed_description>
