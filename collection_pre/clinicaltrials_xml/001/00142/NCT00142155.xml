	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the type of Fc gamma RIIIa receptor that a particular patient's immune cells possess influences how they respond to rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation of FC Gamma RIIIA Receptor Response in Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A medical data collection survey sheet will be filled out by the patient or doctor with medical information pertaining to how the patient responded to rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies for use in this study. - Blood work will be performed to analyze the blood by molecular technology to find the kind of Fc gamna RIIIa receptor the patient possess and correlate these findings with the outcome of treatment with rituximab or other monoclonal antibodies.</detailed_description>
