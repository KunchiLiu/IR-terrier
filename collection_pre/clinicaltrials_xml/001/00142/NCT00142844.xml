	<brief_title>Combination of Disulfiram Plus Naltrexone to Treat Both Cocaine- and Alcohol-dependent Individuals - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many cocaine dependent individuals are also dependent on alcohol. Such individuals respond poorly to existing treatments and have received little research attention in the past. Naltrexone and disulfiram are medications currently approved for treating alcohol dependence. These two medications have different mechanisms of action in the body. In combination they might be effective in treating individuals dually diagnosed with cocaine and alcohol dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of naltrexone and disulfiram is useful in decreasing alcohol cravings in individuals who are dependent on both cocaine and alcohol. Participants in this 5-year, double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive disulfiram, naltrexone, both, or placebo. Treatment will occur for a 3-month period, after which alcohol, cocaine use, and other biopsychosocial measures will be assessed at Months 6 and 9.</detailed_description>
