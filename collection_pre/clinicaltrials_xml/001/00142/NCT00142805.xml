	<brief_title>Ketasyn in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substantial scientific evidence has shown that defects in glucose metabolism occur in Alzheimer's disease. Attempts to compensate for the reduced cerebral metabolic rates in AD have met with some success. Treatment of AD patients with high doses of glucose and insulin will raise cognitive scores. However, this effect is slight, and high doses of insulin can have adverse consequences. Administration of ketone bodies or their metabolic precursors such as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) presents an attractive alternative to glucose and insulin. In a preliminary study, Ketasyn™, an MCT, demonstrated pharmacological activity and statistically significant efficacy in improving short-term memory and attention performance after a single dose. Participants will be randomized to receive either Ketasyn™ or a matching placebo, administered once a day by mixing powder in a glass of liquid. The treatment period will last 90 days, followed by a 2-week washout period. Each patient will be seen 5 times: at screening, baseline, and post-baseline days 45, 90, and 104. The visits will include physical and/or neuropsychological examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory tests.</detailed_description>
