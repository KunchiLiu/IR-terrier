	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized evaluation of pneumococcal vaccine immunization of pregnant mothers, followed by pneumococcal conjugate immunization of their children is designed to assess the effects of these strategies on the immunogenicity and safety of both vaccines. We hypothesize that maternal followed by infant immunization will be safe and will provide higher levels of antibody from birth through 12 months of age.</brief_summary>
