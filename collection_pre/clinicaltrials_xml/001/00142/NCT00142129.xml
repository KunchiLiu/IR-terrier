	<brief_title>Bortezomib (Velcade) in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients will receive bortezomib intravenously twice weekly for 2 weeks on days 1,4,8 and 11 of each cycle. A 10-day rest period (days 12-21) will follow the 2 weeks of treatment. The treatment cycle is repeated up to eight times depending upon the disease response and if the patient is tolerating the drugs. - The following procedures will be conducted as part of the treatment monitoring: DAY 1 VISIT (of each treatment cycle): evaluation of disease-related symptoms, vital signs and weight and blood tests. DAY 4 VISIT (of each treatment cycle): vital signs and blood work. DAY 8 VISIT (of each treatment cycle): vital signs and blood work. DAY 11 VISIT(of each treatment cycle): vital signs, blood work, and possible CT Scan. - Treatment will be discontinued if any of the following occur: Disease gets worse, severe side-effects or the patient requires other anti-cancer therapy. - At the end of the treatment (30 days after the last dose of study drug) the patient will have a physical exam, vital signs, evaluation of disease-related symptoms, blood work and CT scan for tumor measurements. - Long term follow-up consists of every 3 month clinical visits until disease progression or up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
