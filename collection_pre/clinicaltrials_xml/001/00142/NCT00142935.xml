	<brief_summary>Much of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is driven by transmission from or to persons addicted to opiates. Many of these individuals pass through a correctional setting each year, creating an opportunity for linkage to substance abuse treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of initiating opiate replacement therapy prior to release from incarceration on reducing HIV risk behaviors and drug relapse. In addition, this study evaluated the effectiveness of short-term payment versus non-payment of community opiate replacement therapy immediately following release from incarceration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Opiate Replacement Therapy Administered Prior to Release From a Correctional Facility - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial proportion of individuals addicted to heroin are incarcerated while addicted and a majority of individuals released from a correctional setting have a history of heroin addiction. The period immediately after release from incarceration is a particularly high-risk time for HIV transmission and other problems, including drug relapse and overdose. Methadone treatment is the most widely used opiate replacement therapy in the United States and has been shown to decrease HIV risk, as well as drug use, addiction relapse, and criminal activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of initiating opiate replacement therapy prior to release from incarceration on reducing HIV risk behaviors and drug relapse. In addition, this study evaluated the effectiveness of short-term payment versus non-payment of community opiate replacement therapy immediately following release from incarceration. Participants in this were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Participants enrolled in Group 1 initiated methadone opiate replacement therapy about 1 month prior to release from incarceration. They proceeded with a methadone program of their choice upon release and received short-term payment to cover treatment costs. Participants enrolled in Group 2 were referred to a methadone program of their choice and received short-term payment to cover treatment costs. Participants enrolled in Group 3 were referred to a program of choice upon release from incarceration without receiving financial assistance. All participants had the opportunity to partake in existing support programs available at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections while incarcerated and in the community upon release. Follow-up assessments occurred at Months 1.5, 6, and 12. These included interviews and urine specimens for toxicology analysis to verify self-reports.</detailed_description>
