	<brief_summary>Existing and new pharmacotherapies along with prevention efforts are key to improving smoking cessation rates and reducing the premature morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. A number of individuals suffer from both nicotine dependence and depression. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of bupropion used in combination with the nicotine replacement patch and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in treating nicotine dependent individuals also diagnosed with depression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Smoking cessation treatment is highly cost effective and pharmacotherapy is universally recommended for treatment of nicotine dependence. However, the majority of smokers are unable to quit even with treatment. Existing and new pharmacotherapies along with prevention efforts are key to improving smoking cessation rates and reducing the premature morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of bupropion as an addition to a standard smoking cessation treatment of CBT and nicotine replacement. In addition, this study will determine if bupropion improves an individual's odds of quitting smoking, and whether this is achieved through its impact on negative mood states associated with depression. Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either bupropion or placebo. CBT sessions and individual meetings with a study physician will last for 13 weeks. Treatment with either bupropion or placebo will begin at the first CBT meeting and will continue for 13 weeks. Treatment with the nicotine replacement patch will begin at the second CBT meeting and will continue for 10 weeks. Participants will have monthly follow-up visits throughout the year following Week 13. During the follow-up period, participants will continue to take either bupropion or placebo but will no longer undergo CBT or nicotine replacement. If participants are unable to quit smoking, or become more depressed during the follow-up phase, they will be offered treatment with Zoloft, and will continue to be monitored for the duration of the follow-up year. If participants have been unsuccessful in using Zoloft, they will be offered another antidepressant at the judgement of the clinician.</detailed_description>
