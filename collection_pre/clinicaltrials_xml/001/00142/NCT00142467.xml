	<brief_title>Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin in Combination With Bevacizumab in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Treatment is given in cycles, each cycle (except for cycle 1) is 4 weeks long. Cycle 1 is only 2 weeks long. - During cycle one only, bevacizumab will be given intravenously on day one. Two weeks after receiving bevacizumab, the patient will return to the clinic for treatment with all 3 study drugs. - During cycle 2 and every cycle thereafter patients will receive; bevacizumab intravenously on day one and day 15; gemcitabine intravenously on day 2 and day 16; oxaliplatin intravenously on day 2 and day 16. - The following evaluations will be conducted on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle (once every 2 weeks): physical examination, vital signs, medical history, blood tests and urine tests. - Tumor measurements done by CT and/or MRI will be repeated at the end of cycle 3 and every 2 cycles thereafter. - Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) of the liver and Perfusions CT scans will also be done on days 10-12 following bevacizumab treatment during cycle 1, and the Perfusion CT will be repeated at the end of cycle 3. - Once study treatment is stopped the following evaluations will be performed: physical exam, vital signs, blood work, urine tests, CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, and tumor measurements by CT or MRI scans. - Follow-up will consist of physical examinations and blood tests every 6 months. - Patients will continue to receive study treatment as long as there is no disease progression or unacceptable side affects.</detailed_description>
