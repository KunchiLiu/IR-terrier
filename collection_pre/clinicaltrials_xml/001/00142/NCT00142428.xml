	<brief_title>Cetuximab in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first step in this study is to examine the tumor biopsy (previously collected) and determine whether or not it is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive or EGFR negative. Both EGFR positive and EGFR negative patients can participate in this study because at this time it is not known whether having a negative or positive receptor makes a difference in how the study drug works on the tumor. By knowing if the tumor is EGFR positive or negative, we will be able to see if there is a difference in the way the tumor responds to cetuximab. Patients will receive cetuximab intravenously once weekly for 6 weeks. Each 6-week period is one cycle of treatment. The first dose of cetuximab is larger than the following doses. For the first clinic visit the patient's blood pressure, temperature, breathing and heart rate will be taken before, during, at the end, and one-hour after the cetuximab has been administered. For each visit after that, blood pressure, temperature, breathing and heart rate will be taken before and after cetuximab has been administered. Before each administration of cetuximab, diphenhydramine will also be administered to decrease the chances of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The following tests and procedures will be performed at weeks 1, 3 and 5 during each 6-week cycle of treatments as well as at the end of study treatment: physical exam, vital signs, medical history and blood work. At the end of each 6-week cycle a CT and/or MRI will be performed to measure the tumor size. Long-term follow-up will include physical exams and bloodwork every 6 months. Patients will remain on cetuximab as long as there is no disease progression or intolerable side effects.</detailed_description>
