	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to see if an experimental drug, called MM-093, is safe and effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. MM-093 is a genetically engineered version of a naturally occurring protein called alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Adults normally have very small amounts of AFP in their bloodstream. However, during pregnancy, AFP levels in both the mother and the fetus are much higher than normal. It has been observed that women with RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) have fewer symptoms during pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester. At this time, the levels of AFP in the blood of the mother and fetus are the highest. This observation led researchers to begin examining AFP as a possible treatment for RA.</brief_summary>

Any condition for which participation in this study is judged by the physician to be detrimental to the patient, such as history of significant or unstable cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disease, or a DMARD (DiseaseModifying AntiRheumatic Drug)related severe, potentially lifethreatening AE (Adverse Event). Significant ongoing infection requiring systemic antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, or any antimycobacterial therapy.

History of severe hypersensitivity to goat, sheep or cow milk or products derived from goat, sheep or cow milk (patients who are lactose intolerant are not excluded). Any other condition that the investigator feels would jeopardize the integrity of the study (e.g. a CTCAE [Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events] grade 2 or above clinical finding or laboratory result).</criteria>
