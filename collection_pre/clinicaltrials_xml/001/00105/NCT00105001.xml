	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with or without sirolimus works in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body-irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving MMF and tacrolimus with or without sirolimus after transplant may stop this from happening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil With or Without Sirolimus in Preventing Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Who Are Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine which of 3 GVHD prophylaxis regimens results in reduction of acute grades II-IV GVHD to =&lt; 40%. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Reduce the incidence of non-relapse mortality from infections and GVHD before day 200 to =&lt; 15%. II. Reduce the utilization of high-dose corticosteroids compared to protocols 1463, 1641, and 1668. III. Compare survival and progression-free survival to that achieved under protocols 1463, 1641, and 1668. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING: All patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 and undergo total-body irradiation on day 0. TRANSPLANTATION: All patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) every 12 hours on days -3 to 180 with taper beginning on day 100 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive MMF PO every 8 hours on days 0-29 and then every 12 hours on days 30-96 with taper beginning on day 40 in the absence of GVHD. ARM II: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or PO every 12 hours on days -3 to 150 with taper beginning on day 100 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive MMF PO every 8 hours on days 0-29 and then every 12 hours on days 30-180 with taper beginning on day 150 in the absence of GVHD. ARM III: Patients receive tacrolimus and MMF as in arm II. Patients also receive sirolimus PO once daily on days -3 to 80. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then every year thereafter.</detailed_description>

this determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive antidonor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft rejection vector are considered a twoallele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed DONOR: Only filgrastim (GCSF) mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) only will be permitted as a HSC source on this protocol Patients with rapidly progressive intermediate or high grade NHL Patients with a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with disease refractory to intrathecal chemotherapy Presence of circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by standard pathology for patients with AML, MDS, ALL or CML Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12 months following treatment Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding Patients with active nonhematological malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) or those with nonhematological malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) who have been rendered with no evidence of disease, but have a greater than 20% chance of having disease recurrence within 5 years Fungal infections with radiological progression after receipt of amphotericin B or active triazole for greater than 1 month Cardiac ejection fraction &lt;
