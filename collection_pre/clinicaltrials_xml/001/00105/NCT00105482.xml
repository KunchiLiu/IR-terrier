	<brief_summary>Weight gain after quitting smoking is an important barrier to treatment for many smokers. This study will test a drug called naltrexone with weight-concerned smokers to investigate whether or not this drug both improves smoking cessation quit rates and minimizes post quit weight gain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Interventions for Weight-Concerned Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 25 mg naltrexone for smoking cessation in a sample of 270 male and female weight-concerned smokers. Participants also receive transdermal nicotine replacement therapy during the first 8 weeks of the study, which they begin on their quit date. Naltrexone study medication will be started a week before their quit date and continued through the six-month period. Brief behavioral counseling and research assessments are provided for two sessions prior to the quit date and then weekly for two weeks, bi-weekly for a month and every four weeks thereafter. A follow-up appointment is completed at 12 months after participants' quit date. The primary outcomes are six-month point prevalence abstinence and post-cessation weight gain for those who are continuously abstinent (not even a puff). Secondary outcomes include an examination of alcohol consumption, evaluation of urges, other measures of smoking cessation success, point prevalence abstinence at 12 months, and food preferences. A number of tertiary measures will be obtained for examining predictors of smoking cessation, weight gain, and naltrexone response.</detailed_description>
