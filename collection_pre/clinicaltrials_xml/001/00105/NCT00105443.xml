	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is: Find out if patients receiving sorafenib will live longer. Find out if sorafenib has any effect on patient reported outcomes. Find out if sorafenib prevents the growth of or shrinks liver tumors and/or their metastases. Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with liver cancer.</brief_summary>
