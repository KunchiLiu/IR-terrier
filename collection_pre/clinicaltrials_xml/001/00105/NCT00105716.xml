	<brief_summary>This four and a half year trial is evaluating both a patient and a provider intervention in a primary care setting among diagnosed hypertensive veterans. The two primary hypotheses are: 1) the proportion of veterans with BP control who receive either the provider-directed decision support or the patient health education and behavioral intervention will be increased by 10% as compared to usual care; and 2) the proportion of veterans with BP control who receive both the provider-directed decision support and the patient health education and behavioral intervention will be increased by 25% as compared to usual care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Lower Veterans BP: Patient/Physician Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: There are 65 million Americans and over 8.5 million veterans who have been diagnosed with hypertension, yet only 31% have their blood pressure (BP) under effective control. Uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of stroke, CAD, renal failure, CHF, and mortality. Objectives: This four year study evaluated simultaneously both a patient and a provider intervention in a primary care setting among diagnosed hypertensive veterans. The two primary hypotheses were: 1) the proportion of veterans with BP control who receive either the provider-directed decision support or the patient behavioral/education intervention will be increased by 10% as compared to usual care; and 2) the proportion of veterans with BP control who receive both the provider-directed decision support and the patient health education and behavioral intervention will be increased by 25% as compared to usual care. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial with a split-plot design. Thirty primary care providers in the Durham VAMC Primary Care Clinic were randomly assigned to receive either the provider intervention or basic patient information; 588 of their hypertensive patients were randomized to the patient intervention or usual care. The provider intervention (ATHENA study (IIR 99-275) included an electronically generated hypertension decision support system (DSS) delivered to the provider at each hypertensive patient's visit. The provider intervention was designed to improve guideline concordant therapy. The patient intervention was a tailored behavioral/education intervention administered at periodic telephone contacts. The intervention included support and reminders, information on hypertension and on health behaviors. Patients received feedback about their recent BP values, continuous patient education, and were monitored and supported to enhance adherence. The control group was usual care. Status: Complete. Major activities completed in the past 12 months include submission of a manuscript describing the study, the interventions, and baseline and follow-up analyses. Secondary analyses are being completed which will be included in additional manuscripts.</detailed_description>
