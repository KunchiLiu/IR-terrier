	<brief_summary>For primary objectives, we will determine the MTD and examine clinical responses and immune cell populations to determine an OBD, and describe the safety and tolerability of MEDI-507. For the secondary objectives we will look at the antitumor activity of MEDI 507, PK, serum concentrations, and immunogenicity of MEDI-507, as well as time courses of depletion and recovery of CD2 positive and total T-Cell populations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Individuals may be eligible for this study if they are 18 years of age or older and: Have one of the following types of TCell Lymphoproliferative disorders such as Cutaneous Tcell Lymphoma (CTCL), Peripheral Tcell Lymphoma (PCTL), Large Cell Lymphoma (LGL), or Adult Tcell Lymphoma (ATL). Patients should have disease that is resistant or refractory to the frontline therapy, except ATL patients for whom there is no standard therapy. At least 30% of tumor cells must be CD2 positive. Karnofsky Performance status of greater than or equal to 70% (able to care for themselves; but unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work). At least 3 weeks must have passed since prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, prolonged or cytolytic steroid therapy or major surgery, and all treatmentrelated toxicities must have resolved prior to the first MEDI507 administration (except thrombocytopenia). Have no prior treatment with MEDI507.</criteria>
