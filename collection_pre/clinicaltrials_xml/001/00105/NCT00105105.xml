	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of C-1073 (Mifepristone) on cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are also taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Aricept, Exelon or Reminyl).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone as Adjunctive Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a double blind, placebo controlled study of C-1073 to evaluate the effects on cognition in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and have been on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to either daily dosing with 300 mg C-1073 or a placebo for 16 weeks. Patients will continue the stable daily dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor throughout the study. Visits will be weekly at the beginning of the study, then every two weeks, and every 4 weeks after week 12. Assessments during these visits may include cognition and behavior, depression, safety, as well as physical exams, clinical laboratory tests, EKG and adverse event reporting.</detailed_description>
