	<brief_title>Interventions for Depressed Low Income Mothers and Their Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poorly educated, low income mothers are at high risk for becoming depressed. The effects of living in poverty and being reared by a depressed parent can be detrimental to an infant's development. Effective interventions to reduce maternal depression and strengthen the mother-infant relationships are needed. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 mothers will receive 16 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy (IP) designed to directly treat maternal depression. Group 1 participants will have monthly follow-up visits for 1 year. Participants in Group 2 will receive 16 weekly sessions of IP followed by 1 year of in-home, infant-parent psychotherapy, an intervention addressing relationship difficulties between depressed mothers and their infants. Group 3 mothers will be invited to attend informational meetings as well as be referred to local services available to people with depression. All mother-child pairs will be evaluated when the child is 12, 16, 24, and 36 months of age. Evaluations will involve questionnaires, diagnostic interviews, developmental assessments, and video- and audio-taped measures.</detailed_description>
