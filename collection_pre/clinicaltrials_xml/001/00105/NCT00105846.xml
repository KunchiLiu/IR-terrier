	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Home-Based Telemedicine Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Tele-home health care, which providers for video interactions between home-based veterans and home care nurses, is a potentially useful adjunct to home care services. However, few randomized trials have been conducted of this technology. Objectives: The primary objectives were to determine if tele-home health care patients, compared with patients receiving usual home care, have:1) higher levels of health related quality of life and home care satisfaction; 2) fewer inpatient admissions, hospital stays, and outpatient and emergency room visits; and 3) higher levels of home care access, in terms of the total number of contacts between HBPC nurses and patients. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control group. Video tele-health units were installed in patient homes for the intervention group, and control group patients received usual home care services. Baseline and six month follow up surveys included questions on perceived health related quality of life and home care satisfaction. T-tests were used to compare intervention and control group members in terms of six month changes in health related quality of life and satisfaction with home care. Multivariate analyses were used to assess group differences in six month health care service use, with prior service use and survival included as covariates. Status: The study is completed, with a final enrollment of 37 patients. Three study manuscrip[ts have been completed (two published and one under review).</detailed_description>
