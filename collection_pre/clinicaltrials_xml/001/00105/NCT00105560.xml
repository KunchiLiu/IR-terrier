	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers radiation directly to the area where a tumor was surgically removed may kill any remaining tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well proton beam radiation therapy works in treating young patients who have undergone biopsy or surgery for medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the 3-year incidence and severity of ototoxicity in young patients with medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma treated with adjuvant proton beam craniospinal and posterior fossa radiotherapy. - Determine the incidence of primary hypothyroidism and other endocrine dysfunction (neuroendocrine and end organ) in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the incidence and severity of neurocognitive abnormalities in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the acute side effects of this regimen, including esophagitis, upper and lower gastrointestinal tract disease, and weight loss, in these patients. - Determine the 3-year progression-free survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk (standard vs high). Patients receive proton beam craniospinal and posterior fossa radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6-8 weeks*. NOTE: *Unless otherwise specified by a co-existing protocol. Patients undergo neurocognitive evaluation at baseline or within 3 months after completion of radiotherapy and then at 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients also undergo endocrine evaluation at baseline and then annually for 5 years; and audiology evaluation at baseline, before each course of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (if receiving this), and then annually for 5 years. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for 2-5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
