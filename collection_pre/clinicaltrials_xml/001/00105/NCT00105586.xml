	<brief_title>Drug Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder Among the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GAD is a serious public health issue; particularly among the elderly, prevalence of the condition is high, and functional burden on those with the illness is significant. GAD is associated with irregular levels of neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry messages across nerve endings. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and emotions; increased levels of serotonin have been shown to reduce anxiety. Standard treatment for GAD typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), drugs that reduce serotonin re-entry into nerve cells. Escitalopram is an SSRI that is well tolerated and highly specific for the serotonin transporter (SERT). The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of escitalopram in reducing anxiety symptoms among elderly GAD patients. Additional aims include examining the efficacy of escitalopram for improving function, quality of life, and neuropsychological functioning, and examining whether genetic variation in the SERT gene influences these participants' response to treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram or placebo for 12 weeks (there is also a 12 week open label extension in which all participants will receive escitalopram). Participants will have weekly/biweekly study visits; during these visits, participants will complete self-report questionnaires on functional ability and anxiety symptoms. Blood collection and cognitive testing through various tasks will also occur.</detailed_description>
