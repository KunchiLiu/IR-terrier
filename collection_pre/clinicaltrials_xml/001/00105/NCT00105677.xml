	<detailed_description>The study focuses on identifying potentially modifiable determinants of patientsï¿½ willingness to consider joint replacement as a treatment option for osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. This line of research is informed by not only our prior work but also recent studies on health disparities and patient decision-making. Our long-term goal is the development and evaluation of interventions to target these determinants of willingness in order to eliminate ethnic disparities in joint replacement. The study findings will assist in laying the groundwork for the design of such interventions for patients with osteoarthritis.</detailed_description>
