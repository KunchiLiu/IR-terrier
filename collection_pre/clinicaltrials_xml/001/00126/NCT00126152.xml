	<brief_title>Senior Falls Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will measure differences in the incidence of falls and fall risk factors among subjects assigned to an intervention group and a control group. Subjects in the intervention group will receive a multi-faceted intervention based on best practices. Subjects in the control group will receive written fall prevention education materials. Fall monitoring will be conducted for subjects in both groups. Specific components of the intervention will include: - an individual fall risk assessment; - exercise with balance and strength training; - education on how to reduce falls and fall risk factors; and - recommendations for medical care management of identified fall risk factors.</detailed_description>
