	<brief_summary>To assist busy primary care clinicians in VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in managing complex patients by providing a single, interactive, and personalized source of information regarding applicable guidelines for post-MI patients. Specifically, 1) the investigators will identify barriers to provider adherence to guidelines within VHA clinics; 2) Apply guideline-based performance measures to electronic medical records (CPRS) and associated administrative data; 3) Implement the interactive Internet intervention developed by the NHLBI study, after inclusion of VA-specific components, including performance feedback for CBOC clinicians; and 4) Test hypotheses on the intervention's effectiveness, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness in both the VA and Medicare populations. This will include a randomized controlled trial with the CBOC as a unit of randomization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Web-Enhanced Guideline Implementation for Post MI CBOC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some 7.1 million Americans and an estimated 250,000 Veterans actively using VHA are Myocardial Infarction (MI) survivors. To date, most guideline interventions focus on a single patient condition, but ambulatory post-MI patients are frequently more complex, multiple comorbidities, and conflicting guidelines applicable to them. For example, whereas JNC-6 guidelines for the treatment of hypertension suggest pharmacological treatment at blood pressures above 140/80 mm Hg, to be initiated with diuretics or beta-blockers as first line agents, other guidance suggests that for post-MI patients with diabetes, treatment cut-offs should be lower and ACE-inhibitors may be considered as optimal first-line agents. On October 1, 2002, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) began a study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute (NHLBI) as an RO1 (Kiefe, PI (25%), Weissman, co-PI (20%)) to conduct a randomized trial, MI-plus to increase provider adherence to guidelines for post-MI patients. That NHLBI-funded study targets Medicare beneficiaries and their primary care providers in Alabama. Its primary goal is to develop and test with a randomized controlled trial, an Internet-based multimodal guideline implementation strategy. The investigators propose, herewith, to extend and adapt this study to a nationwide sample of VA post-MI patients and their primary care providers in the VA.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Potential subjects are defined as any VAemployed physician, PA, or CRNP who is a CBOC provider. All such providers will be offered the opportunity to participate and will have the option to agree to participate or not. Performance measure data from records of postMI patients of the above providers will be extracted to test the experimental intervention. (Note: No individually identifying patient information will be extracted.) All VAemployed CBOC providers (physicians, PAs, CRNPs) will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study. Any subject may refuse to participate or to discontinue participation at will at any point in the study without consequence. Potential subjects must be VAemployed physician, PA, or CRNP who is a CBOC provider. No such healthcare providers will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
