	<brief_summary>Most treatment procedures in AIDS-related lymphomas disclose a relatively poor outcome for patients with low response rates, high number of relapses and AIDS events. The addition of rituximab to the standard regimen - CHOP could improve the outcome of these patients. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab when added to the CHOP regimen in patients with newly diagnosed AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone (CHOP) in Patients With HIV Associated Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infection is associated with a high incidence of AIDS-related lymphomas (ARL). Since the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses has decreased, leading to a significant improvement in survival of HIV-infected patients. The incidence of ARL has decreased in a lower degree and lymphoma remains the major cause of death of HIV patients. Most treatment procedures disclose a relatively poor outcome of patients with low response rates, high number of relapses and AIDS events. Since the majority of HIV-associated NHL are CD20-positive the addition of rituximab to the standard regimen - CHOP could improve the outcome of these patients</detailed_description>
