	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of one dose of four different formulations of the MenACWY conjugate vaccine when given to healthy children aged 12 14 months and 3 5 years. The selection of the best formulation will be based on data obtained up to one month after the vaccine dose. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, September 2007.</brief_summary>

Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study Previously completed routine childhood vaccinations to the best of his/her parents'/guardians' knowledge. For pertussis vaccination, the children aged 1214 months should have been vaccinated with an acellular pertussis vaccine. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within one month of the first dose of vaccine and up to one month after administration of each study vaccine dose with the exception of oral polio vaccine. Previous vaccination against meningococcal serogroup A, C, W135 or Y disease. Administration of a H. influenzae type b, diphtheria or tetanus vaccine within 3 months before the first dose of vaccine. For subjects aged 1214 months at enrolment, a DTPa/Hib containing booster vaccination, in the second year of life: these booster vaccines will be given at Visit 2. History of meningococcal serogroup A, C, W135 or Y disease. Known exposure to meningococcal serogroup A, C, W135 or Y disease within the previous year. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.</criteria>
