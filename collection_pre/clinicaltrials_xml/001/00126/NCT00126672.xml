	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as sirolimus, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sirolimus works in treating patients with angiomyolipoma of the kidney.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus in Treating Patients With Angiomyolipoma of the Kidney</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of sirolimus, in terms of objective response rate, in patients with angiomyolipoma of the kidney secondary to tuberous sclerosis (TSC) or lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine changes in other TSC lesions (e.g., tubers, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, facial angiofibromas, or kidney cysts) in patients with TSC treated with this drug. - Determine changes in pulmonary disease in patients with LAM treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sirolimus once daily for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months and 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-30 months.</detailed_description>
