	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying quality of life in cancer survivors may help determine the long-term effects of hematologic cancer and may help improve the quality of life for future cancer survivors. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the quality of life of adult cancer survivors who have undergone a previous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplant for a childhood hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life of Adult Cancer Survivors Who Have Undergone a Previous Bone Marrow or Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant for a Childhood Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the extent to which adult cancer survivors who have undergone prior bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for a pediatric hematologic malignancy require ongoing health care and whether these needs change with increasing time after transplantation. - Correlate physical capabilities, body image, physical limitations, including sexuality issues which alter or influence lifestyle, with time after transplantation in these patients. - Determine whether cognitive abilities relative to memory and neurobehavioral ratings change with increasing time after transplantation in these patients. - Correlate social and relationship abilities with length of time after transplantation in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients and siblings complete a self-report quality of life questionnaire, including outcome assessments of neuroendocrine function, cognitive abilities, physical capability, and psychosocial behavior. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 750 patients (375 adult cancer survivors [case group] and 375 siblings [control group]) will be accrued for this study within 7 years.</detailed_description>
