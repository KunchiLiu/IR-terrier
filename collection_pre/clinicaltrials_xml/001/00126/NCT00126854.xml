	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the correct scanning parameters for obtaining good quality 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy images (MRSI) of the prostate gland before and after brachytherapy implantation for prostate cancer. Three Tesla MRSI may be a valuable additional diagnostic and follow-up investigation for prostate cancer patients.</brief_summary>
