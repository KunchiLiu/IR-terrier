	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: BL22 immunotoxin can find tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BL22 immunotoxin in treating patients with refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BL22 Immunotoxin in Treating Patients With Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Prolymphocytic Leukemia, or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant BL22 immunotoxin in patients with CD22-positive refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, or indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. - Determine the safety and efficacy of this drug in these patients. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the effect of this drug on various components of the circulating cellular immune system in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Patients receive recombinant BL22 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats ≥ every 27 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of neutralizing antibodies to BL22 or PE38, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients who relapse from a CR lasting ≥ 6 months may receive additional courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of recombinant BL22 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.</detailed_description>
