	<brief_summary>The study is designed to study the utility of 123I-mIBG as a diagnostic imaging agent to predict cardiac outcome in subjects with heart failure and in comparison to subjects without cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG) Scintigraphy Imaging in Patients With Heart Failure and Control Subjects Without Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 3, open-label, multicenter trial to investigate the prognostic usefulness of 123I-mIBG imaging to identify those subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II and III HF who will experience an adverse cardiac event. The study will consist of a maximum of 587 subjects (525 HF subjects and 62 control subjects) administered 123I-mIBG at approximately 40 centres in the United States. Subject status will be monitored at 6-week intervals post-administration of 123I-mIBG to assess the occurrence of adverse cardiac events. The median follow-up is expected to be 9 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study subjects must be adults with an established diagnosis of heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or III) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; 35%) or be healthy volunteers without heart disease. Healthy volunteers are not eligible if they have a history diabetes mellitus, signs/symptoms of neurological disease (eg, Parkinson's Disease, multiple system atrophy, Parkinsonian syndromes), or other diseases known to affect the sympathetic nervous system. Subjects with New York Heart Association Class I or IV heart failure are not eligible.</criteria>
