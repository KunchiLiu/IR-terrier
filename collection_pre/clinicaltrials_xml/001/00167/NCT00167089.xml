	<brief_title>Effects of Early Treadmill Training on Ambulatory Ability in Stroke Patients: Electromyographic and Kinematic Analyses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restoration of independent ambulatory ability is one of the most common functional goals of patients with hemiplegia after stroke. Ambulation training, therefore, is an important part of physical therapy intervention for these patients. Conventional neurologic physical therapy for ambulation training, based sorely on neurophysiology, prohibits early ambulation experience after stroke in attempt to avoid the development of abnormal gait patterns. Such an approach has been shown to be limited in helping these patients regain independent ambulatory ability.</detailed_description>
