	<brief_title>Genotoxicity Assessment for Patients Undergoing Radiation Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Correlative studies: analysis of RT effect on genotoxicity by assessing cytogenetic changes (dicentrics), micronucleated lymphocytes (MN-lymph), and micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) using peripheral blood of patients receiving radiation. i) document the kinetics by which radiation-induced MN-RET enter the peripheral blood stream. ii) benchmark the MN-RET endpoint against current gold-standard biodosimetry endpoints—dicentrics and MN-lymphocytes. iii) measure inter-individual variation in baseline and radiation-induced MN-RET frequencies. iv) in collaboration with several FCM-equipped laboratories, evaluate the transferability of the human MN-RET scoring assay.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients that are scheduled to begin radiotherapy to the largefield chest region are eligible if: Daily radiation dose is between 1.8 and 5 Gy/day Any single dimension of field size is ≥ 15 cm Provision of written informed consent or Or patients receiving IMRT or Tomotherapy, when lowdose radiation is spread out to the normal tissues, irrespective of daily radiation doses. Or patients receiving radionucleotides as part of the medical treatment (cancer or nonmalignant conditions) Or patients who will receive diagnostic CT scans, PET/CT scans, mammograms, or diagnostic imaging requiring radionucleotides</criteria>
