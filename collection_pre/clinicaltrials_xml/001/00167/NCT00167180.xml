	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a pre-infusion preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will improve the effectiveness of DLI in patients with blood cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Transplant Donor Lymphocyte Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When cancer relapses after donor bone marrow transplantation, regular dose chemotherapy offers little hope of prolonged survival. However, there is evidence that lymphocytes can attack cancer cells. There is considerable evidence that this immune attack on cancer cells is associated with graft-versus-host disease. Although graft-versus-host disease can cause problems, this immune reaction may, in part, be the way that bone marrow transplantation cures cancer. In this study we hope that infusion of immune cells from the subject's bone marrow donor plus a chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will activate the subject's immune system to attack their cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients (age &gt; or = 1 years) with a diagnosis of relapse after related or unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation for a hematological malignancy. For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia chromosome or persistence of BCR/ABL rearrangements by molecular testing on at least two measurements over a 6 month interval. If cytogenetics are normal and there is PCR evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have evidence of a quantitative increase in CML measured either by quantitative PCR or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). For nonCML, relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic criteria from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific cytogenetics. For disease specific definition of relapse, see appendix 3. Relapse can be determined morphologically with less than 5 percent blasts if definitive relapse can be determined. Equivocal results for relapse should result in a repeated test after an appropriate time interval (suggested 1 month) to determine eligibility. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases (often referred to as EBVassociated lymphomas) are NOT eligible for this protocol. For Chronic Phase CML patients only must have failed (no response in 3 months or incomplete response at 6 months) or refused treatment with Gleevec if no prior DLI, CML patients will first have DLI if relapse occurs after DLI, DLI with chemotherapy per this protocol will be offered Patients must be within one year of identification of relapse or if beyond that time period, must have at least 10% donor DNA by RFLP or cytogenetics. Same allogeneic donor (sibling or URD) used for transplantation is available for lymphocyte donation. No severe organ damage (by laboratory or clinical assessment) as measured by: blood creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL liver function tests &lt; 5 x normal left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40% (testing required only if symptomatic or prior known impairment). pulmonary functions &gt; 50% (testing required only if symptomatic or prior known impairment). Oxygen saturation (&gt;92%) can be used in child where PFT's cannot be obtained. chest xray without evidence of active infection Off prednisone and other immunosuppressive agents (given for any reason) for at least 3 days prior to DLI infusions. Performance status ≥ 60% Women must not be pregnant or lactating. The agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into breast milk All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception Patient must given written informed consent indicating understanding of the nature of the treatment and its potential risks Concurrent signs of acute or chronic graftversushost disease requiring ongoing treatment at the time of relapse will be ineligible. Patients being treated for GVHD with prednisone, cyclosporine, Imuran or other immunosuppressive medications are not eligible until these medications are discontinued for at least 2 weeks without a flare of GVHD. Active CNS leukemia Active fungal infection or pulmonary infiltrates (stable prior treated disease is allowable) HIV positive</criteria>
