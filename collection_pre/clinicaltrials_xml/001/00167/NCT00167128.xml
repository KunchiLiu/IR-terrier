	<brief_summary>In the management and remediation of students with specific performance deficits in speech-in-noise intelligibility, most often, a "triad" approach for treatment is used, which includes direct therapy, compensatory strategies, and environmental modifications. The purpose of the study is to determine whether a new hearing aid, the Phonak EduLink-FM System, can improve specific performance deficits in speech-in-noise intelligibility. Participants will complete a test battery related to auditory processing, as well as some psychological tests and questionnaires. One group of participants with specific performance deficits in speech-in-noise intelligibility will receive the hearing aid for use in school; a second group will not. The effect of this treatment on auditory performance, school performance and satisfaction, attention and verbal learning and memory, self concept, behavior and listening effort following 26 weeks of hearing aid use will be compared across the groups.</brief_summary>
