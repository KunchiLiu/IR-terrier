	<brief_summary>Hypertension is an increasingly important medical and public health issue. Literature suggests that there may be a role for dairy foods in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Recently, it has been suggested that several peptides in milk proteins could have blood pressure lowering properties. LACTOPRES is a randomised, double-blind parallel trial to assess the blood pressure effect of an increased intake of dairy peptides in humans.</brief_summary>
