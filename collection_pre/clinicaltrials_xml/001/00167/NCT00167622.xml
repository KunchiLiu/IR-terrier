	<brief_title>Early Mechanical Ventilation for Guillain Barré Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospital acquired pneumonia is a common and severe complication of Guillain Barré Syndrome. Several factors have been recognized as predictors of respiratory failure in adults with Guillain Barré Syndrome. They include a time from disease onset and patient admission of less seven days, inability to lift head, impaired swallowing and a forced vital capacity of less than 60% of predictive value. We reasonned that early mechanical ventilation may prevent aspiration which is likely the main cause of pneumonia in these patients.</detailed_description>
