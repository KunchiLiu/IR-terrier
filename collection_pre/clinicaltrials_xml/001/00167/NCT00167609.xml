	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of DHEA for Myotonic Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myotonic dystrophy is an inherited disorder that affects 1 per 8000 adults. The disease is characterize by muscular dystrophy, myotonia, cardiac disorders, cognitive function impairment, hypersomnia, hair loss, endocrine disorders. Recent small studies suggested that DHEA treatment may improve muscle strength in adults with myotonic dystrophy. Thus, the current study aims at investigating the safety and efficacy of a prolonged treatment with DHEA in adults with myotonic dystrophy.</detailed_description>
