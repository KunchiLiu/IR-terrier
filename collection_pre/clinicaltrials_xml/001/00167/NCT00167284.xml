	<brief_summary>With the advent of managed care, increasing responsibility for the care of patients with diabetes is being placed on primary care physicians. Evidence exists that physicians are not meeting established practice guidelines, and outcomes in patients with diabetes are less than optimal. It is thus the objective of this study to institute a community-based diabetes education intervention for both physicians and patients to enhance adherence to guidelines and improve patient outcomes. We will conduct a chart review (submitted under a separate IRB: #000733) in primary care practices to determine health status and guideline adherence. Following the chart review, physician practices will be assigned to one of three groups: physician + patient education, physician education alone, and usual care. Following the intervention, a repeat chart review will be conducted. Pre and posttest comparisons will be conducted to examine changes primarily in glycemic control, quality of life, patient knowledge, and physician adherence to practice guidelines. Secondarily, we will examine changes in therapeutic intervention, body mass index, and barriers to diabetes care. We will also examine individual barriers to diabetes care and their influence on outcomes in this population. The last phase of the study will encompass a second follow-up visit in which we will examine behavioral factors related to clinical change and sustainability of the intervention.</brief_summary>
