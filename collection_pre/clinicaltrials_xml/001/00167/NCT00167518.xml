	<brief_title>Intravitreal Triamcinolone for Clinically Significant Diabetic Macular Oedema That Persists After Laser Treatment (TDMO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of visual and the most common cause of legal blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries. Swelling of the central retina, or “macular oedema” is the commonest cause of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic macular oedema is treated with laser coagulation to the macular area according to established guidelines which take into account the extent of the leak and its proximity to the centre of the macula, the “fovea”. This treatment does not, however, always work and is inherently destructive. Intravitreal injection of crystalline steroids has been proposed as a new modality to treat clinically significant diabetic macular oedema. To determine by means of a prospective, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone three months or more after focal or grid laser photocoagulation for clinically significant diabetic macular oedema will improve the visual acuity of eligible eyes. OCT will be used in addition to visual acuity testing as an objective measurement of macular oedema.</detailed_description>
