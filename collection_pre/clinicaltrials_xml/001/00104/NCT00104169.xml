	<brief_title>Idiopathic Anemia of Aging (IAA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As individuals become older, the frequency of anemia increases. While the cause of anemia in many cases can be determined and corrected, in a number of individuals there is no correctable cause found and the patient must live with their anemia. This is known as idiopathic anemia, and can have serious consequences for the individual. Numerous studies have demonstrated that anemia is associated with loss of energy and stamina, causing individuals to decrease their activities, which adversely affects both their sense of well-being as well as their physical strength. Losses in these areas are associated with the clinical manifestations of frailty. The current pilot study will examine whether or not administration of Epoetin Alfa, a hormone stimulating production of red blood cells, can reverse this type of anemia. We will examine the consequences of reversing the anemia in terms of physical strength and function, cardiovascular function and sense of well-being and mental function. In this study, individuals with anemia will be treated for six months with Epoetin Alfa following the correction of their anemia and measurements done to evaluate physical strength, performance, cardiac, mental and kidney function. At the end of treatment, individuals will be followed for an additional six months to determine whether the anemia recurs and physical function decreases. Participation in this study is voluntary. All testing and medication received are free to the participant.</detailed_description>
