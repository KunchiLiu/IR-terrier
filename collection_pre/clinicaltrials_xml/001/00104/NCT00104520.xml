	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Aztreonam for Inhalation Solution (AZLI) in Cystic Fibrosis Patients With P. Aeruginosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with CF often have lung infections that occur repeatedly or worsen over time. The lung infections are often caused by a bacteria called PA. Treatment with antibiotics can stop or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by mouth, intravenously (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI), an investigational formulation of the antibiotic administered using the eFlowÂ® Electronic Nebulizer by PARI GmbH, in CF patients with PA. In this study, participants were screened for eligibility at Visit 1 (Day -42) and returned to the center for Visit 2 after a 14-day evaluation period. At Visit 2 (Day -28), participants began a 28-day course of open-label Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (TIS). At Visit 3 (Day 0), following completion of the 28-day course of TIS, participants began randomized, blinded treatment with either AZLI twice a day (BID) or three times a day (TID) or placebo BID or TID, and continued treatment for a total of 28 days, with a clinic visit at Day 14 (Visit 4) and at the end of treatment (Visit 5 [Day 28]). Participants returned for visits every 2 weeks for 8 weeks after the end of the blinded treatment (Visits 6 to 9 [Days 42 to 84]). Two hundred and forty-seven participants were treated in the TIS phase of this study. Two hundred and eleven subjects completed the TIS phase and were treated in the placebo-controlled phase with study drug (AZLI or placebo).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>CF as diagnosed by: 1. Documented sweat chloride greater than or equal to 60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test; or 2. Two wellcharacterized genetic mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; or 3. Abnormal nasal potential difference with accompanying symptoms characteristic of CF. PA present in expectorated sputum or throat swab culture at Screening. Participants must have received three or more courses of TIS within the previous 12 months. Participants on chronic azithromycin must have had no change in regimen in the previous 3 months and must have had a need for TIS and/or additional antipseudomonal therapy since initiation of azithromycin. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between (and including) 25% and 75% predicted at Screening. Ability to perform reproducible pulmonary function tests. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) greater than or equal to 90% on room air at Screening. Current use of oral corticosteroids in doses exceeding the equivalent of 10 mg prednisone a day or 20 mg prednisone every other day. History of sputum or throat culture swab yielding Burkholderia cepacia in the past 2 years. History of daily continuous oxygen supplementation or requirement for more than 2 liters/minute at night. Administration of any investigational drug or device within 28 days of Screening (Visit 1) or within 6 halflives of the investigational drug (whichever was longer). Known local or systemic hypersensitivity to monobactam antibiotics. Inability to tolerate inhalation of a short acting Beta2 agonist. Changes in antimicrobial, bronchodilator, antiinflammatory, or corticosteroid medications within 7 days before Screening or between Screening and the next visit. Changes in physiotherapy technique or schedule within 7 days before Screening or between Screening and the next visit. History of lung transplantation. A chest Xray indicating abnormal findings at Screening or within the previous 90 days. Abnormal renal or hepatic function or serum chemistry at Screening (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT] greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal range; Creatinine greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal range). Positive pregnancy test at Screening. Female of childbearing potential who was lactating or in the opinion of the investigator was not practicing acceptable birth control. Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness, which in the opinion of the investigator would have interfered with participant treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol.</criteria>
