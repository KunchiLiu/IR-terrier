	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease is a medical illness that damages the brain and causes problems with memory, mood and behavior. A substance called acetylcholine (ACh), which is naturally produced in the body, plays an important role in the normal functioning of the brain. In subjects with Alzheimer's disease, the level of ACh is greatly reduced. Currently, there are three commonly prescribed drugs used for treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by helping to maintain the level of ACh in the brain. This study will evaluate how much each of these drugs changes the levels of certain brain chemicals that are known to, or may play an important role in, Alzheimer's disease and its symptoms.</brief_summary>
