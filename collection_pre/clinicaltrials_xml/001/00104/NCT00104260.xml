	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the degree and frequency of response to Phenoptin™ (sapropterin dihydrochloride), as demonstrated by a reduction in blood phenylalanine (Phe) level among subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have elevated Phe levels. A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Phenoptin™ treatment in this subject population, and identify individuals in this subject population who respond to Phenoptin™ treatment with a reduction in blood Phe level.</brief_summary>
