	<brief_title>Osteoarthritis: Weakness From Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through this study, we hope to learn about the natural history of knee osteoarthritis and the disability that arises from it. We hope to better understand why people with knee osteoarthritis develop difficulty with mobility (e.g. walking, standing) in hopes of finding a cure. This study requires 1 four-hour visit to Harbor Hospital. The visit involves a physical exam, a DEXA bone density scan, blood and urine testing, knee x-rays, strength testing and a surface electromyography (EMG). Samples of muscle, joint fluid and joint tissue will be collected during your planned surgery. Participation in this study is entirely voluntary.</detailed_description>
