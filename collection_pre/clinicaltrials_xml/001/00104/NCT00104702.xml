	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating older women who are undergoing surgery for stage I or stage II breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Older Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine reproducibility of localized and concentrated adjuvant radiotherapy, in terms of isodose curve and dose heterogeneity, in older women with stage I or II breast cancer. Secondary - Determine the impact of this regimen on Katz's Activity of Daily Living score and Lawton's Instrumental Activity of Daily Living score in these patients. - Determine relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine overall and specific survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the cosmetic result, as assessed by the patient, surgeon, and radiologist, of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the direct and indirect costs of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study. Patients undergo surgery. After surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily for 5 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
