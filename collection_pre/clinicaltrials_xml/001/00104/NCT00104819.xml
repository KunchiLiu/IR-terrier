	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF works in treating patients with progressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Progressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Provide treatment with autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine (FavId)™ and sargramostim (GM-CSF) to patients with progressive grade 1, 2, or 3 follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who did not receive FavId™ while enrolled on protocol FAV-ID-06. Secondary - Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the response rate and response rate improvement after best response to prior salvage therapy in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to timing of disease progression while enrolled on protocol FAV-ID-06 (disease progression after prior rituximab AND never randomized vs disease progression after randomization to placebo arm). Patients receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4. Treatment repeats monthly for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional treatment as above every 2 months for 1 year (6 treatments) and every 3 months until disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days or until the start of subsequent treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 238 patients (67 in group I and 171 in group II) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
