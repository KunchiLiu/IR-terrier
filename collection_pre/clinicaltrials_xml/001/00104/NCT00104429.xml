Be treatmentnaive, defined as less than or equal to 2 weeks of treatment with a protease inhibitor (PI) or a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI/ NtRTI), or less than or equal to 7 days of therapy with a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Prior treatment with any entry inhibitor, attachment inhibitor, or fusion inhibitor (experimental or approved) is not allowed. Be able to understand and follow with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to study entry. Exclusion criteria: Detection of any CXC Receptor4tropic (X4tropic) virus, based on viral tropism test at screening.
