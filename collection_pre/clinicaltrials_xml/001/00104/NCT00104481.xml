	<detailed_description>The comparison condition is the same length as the cognitive behavior therapy condition but omits the cognitive restructuring component. In both conditions, smokers prepare for a quit date by using scheduled reduced smoking, which involves smoking on a set schedule that gradually reduces the number of cigarettes smoked. Post-treatment assessments occur one week after the end of treatment, and at 3-month followup. Pre- and post-treatment assessments include measures of coping skills and emotional acceptance, as well as smoking rate.</detailed_description>
