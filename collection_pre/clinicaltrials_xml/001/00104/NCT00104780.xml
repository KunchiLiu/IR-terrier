	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the overall survival of patients with HLA-A2-positive, stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with vaccine therapy comprising EP-2101 emulsified in montanide ISA-51 with that of historical controls and patients with HLA-A2-negative, stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC who undergo observation only. - Determine the safety of this vaccine in these patients. Secondary - Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this vaccine. - Determine the frequency, magnitude, and breadth of cytotoxic and helper T-cell response to vaccine epitopes in patients treated with this vaccine. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to HLA-A2 status. - Group I (HLA-A2 positive): Patients receive vaccine therapy comprising EP-2101 emulsified in montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously once in weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. - Group II (HLA-A2 negative): Patients undergo observation in weeks 9 and 18. After completion of study treatment, patients in group I are followed at 3 weeks. All patients are then followed at months 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.</detailed_description>
