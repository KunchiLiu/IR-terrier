	<brief_summary>Heart failure induces modification in several neurohormonal systems. The aim of this study is to determine if the growth hormone/IGF1 axis is modified in heart failure patients compared to healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Growth Hormone and Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred and sixty three heart failure patients were evaluated by clinical examination, echocardiography, exercise test and measurement of blood BNP. Growth hormone and IGF-1 plasma levels were determined in each patient. The same biological measurements were performed in a group of 148 healthy controls. Comparisons were performed between groups for Growth hormone plasma level, IGF-1 plasma level and Growth hormone/IGF-1 index. A correlation between the severity of heart failure and the different biological parameters was searched.</detailed_description>
