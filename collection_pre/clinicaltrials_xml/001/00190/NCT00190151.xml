	<brief_summary>Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been a growing therapeutic problem since the late 1980s. Resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria can arise through initial selection of resistant strains in the commensal flora. The emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in the commensal flora will be assessed in 48 healthy volunteers receiving variable doses of ciprofloxacin during 14 days. Emergence of resistance will be correlated to pharmacokinetic characteristics of ciprofloxacin.</brief_summary>
