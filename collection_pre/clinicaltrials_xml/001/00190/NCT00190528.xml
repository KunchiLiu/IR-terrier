	<brief_title>A Trial of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy + Surgery vs. Surgery for Bulky Stage I/II Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We designed this randomized study to investigate the clinical benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bulky stage I/II cervical cancer. Patients with FIGO stage I/II with bulky disease are randomized to either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (BOMP: Cisplatin 14mg/m2 day 1-5, Bleomycin 7mg day 1-5, Mitomycin 7mg/m2 day 5, and Vincristine 0.7mg/m2 day every 21 days for 2-4 cycles followed by radical hysterectomy or radical hysterectomy alone. The primary endpoint is overall survival and the secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, complication of surgery, completeness of radical hysterectomy, omission of postsurgical irradiation, completeness of postsurgical irradiation, response rate, and adverse events. A total 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) planned to accrue for this study within 5.5 years.</detailed_description>
