	<brief_title>The Influences of Malnutrition and Inflammation Complex Syndrome in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease is the major of cause of mortality of hemodialysis patients. In addition to diabetes and hypertension, malnutrition and chronic inflammation are well-known to be major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in normal population. For detecting the malnutrition and chronic inflammation and understanding the exact influences to hemodialysis patients, we conduct this study. We will collect the biochemical parameters, inflammatory markers, lipid parameters, hematologic parameters, and genomic DNA of patients. Then we will prospectively record the hospitalization, cardiovascular events, complications of arteriovenous fistula/graft, and mortality. According to the above results, we try to explore the exact role of malnutrition and inflammation in hemodialysis patients.</detailed_description>
