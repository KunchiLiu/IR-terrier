	<brief_title>Acetylcysteine Against Acute Renal Insult During Cardiopulmonary Bypass.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Reactive oxygen species have been shown to cause contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN). According to previous studies, the N-acetylcysteine has been proved to be advantageous in the avoidance of CIN. We seek to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine in limiting the nephrotoxicity after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS We will prospectively study 60 patients who will receive a cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either N-acetylcysteine (600 mg orally twice daily for 4 doses) with 0.45% saline intravenously, before and after cardiopulmonary bypass, or placebo with 0.45% saline. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen will be measured before, 48 h and 5 days after the operation procedure. Expected results Prophylactic oral administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, along with hydration, will significantly reduce the acute renal damage induced by CPB in patients with chronic renal insufficiency that need cardiovascular procedures.</detailed_description>
