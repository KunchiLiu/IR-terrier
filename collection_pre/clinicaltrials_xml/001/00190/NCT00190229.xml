	<brief_summary>Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a leucocytoclastic systemic vasculitis involving small vessels with the deposition of immune complexes containing IgA. It is characterized by the association of skin, joint and gastrointestinal manifestations. Even though the evolution is usually simple, some patients, especially adults, may have severe visceral involvement including heart, lung, brain and renal disease. The best treatment is currently unknown. This study will test the safety and efficacy of steroids associated or not with cyclosphosphamide to treat the acute lesions and to prevent the development of chronic lesions.</brief_summary>
