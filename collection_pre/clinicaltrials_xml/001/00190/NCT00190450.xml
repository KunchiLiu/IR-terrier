	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to show the existence of a clinical benefit rising from a substitution of the striatal neurons degenerated among patients reached of disease of Huntington by homologous neurons coming from human foetuses, by comparison of a treated group and a reference group not-treaty. The principal criterion is the progression of the motor score of the UHDRS by comparing the values obtained in the group treated by bilateral graft intrastriatal of foetal neurons with the values obtained in the group controls. At the end of this protocol, the patients controls will be grafted (with thus 18 months of time compared to the treated group). A secondary evaluation is envisaged 18 months after the graft of the group controls for the whole of the patients (either in 52 months). We will be able to thus compare the pre performances and 18 months post-graft for all 60 patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to show the existence of a clinical benefit rising from a substitution of the striatal neurons degenerated among a large cohort of Huntington's patient at early stage by homologous neurons coming from human foetuses, This effect will be estimated, compared with a group of patients not treated at first, on the results of the motor scale of the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS, Huntington study group, on 1996). Transplants will be realized in two surgical times to avoid the risk of hurts per-operating, BI-CAUDES, if transplants were realized at single time. The minimal interval between both transplants will be of 2 weeks, so as to let the patient recover of the first general anaesthesia It's a multicentric study of phase II randomised and controlled, with direct individual benefit.</detailed_description>

Mental Affection likely to disturb adhesion with the protocol, and in particular antecedents of hallucinations spontaneous and/or induced by the drugs; antecedents of serious depression having required repeated hospitalizations; antecedents of repeated suicide attempts. Cerebral morphological anomalies, others that those characteristic of the disease, noted with the IRM or the tomodensitometry.
