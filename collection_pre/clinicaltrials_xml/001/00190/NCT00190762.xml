	<brief_summary>Based on results from earlier clinical trials, Pemetrexed may have antitumor activity as a first-line agent in the treatment of mesothelioma. Given this, it is hypothesized that Pemetrexed may be active in second-line mesothelioma in which the standard treatment is best supportive care. This study will compare survival of previously treated patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who receive Pemetrexed plus best supportive care to the survival of similar patients who receive best supportive care alone.</brief_summary>
