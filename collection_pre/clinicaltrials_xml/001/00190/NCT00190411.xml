	<brief_summary>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular type (EDS-IV) is caused by a genetic defect of collagen type III. Patient die (median 40 yrs) of vascular complications. There is no treatment. We showed that arteries are thin and overloaded in this patients. We test the protective effect of celiprolol on cardiovascular events in a 5 years, randomized, PROBE design</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celiprolol in Patients With Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Vascular Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 patients with verified EDS-IV syndrome are included. Patients are randomized to either celiprolol (50 to 400 mg BID)or no treatment. Patients who are not randomized enter a longitudinal survey of events. The hypothesis is a 50% reduction in the occurrence of cardiovascular events under treatment, assessed by a blinded, independent events committee.</detailed_description>
