	<criteria>Subjects who meet all the criteria listed below will be considered for study inclusion: Male or female older than 18 years of age Meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure [PAP] &gt; 25 mmHg at rest and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &lt; 15 mmHg during right heart catheterization): primary pulmonary hypertension (sporadic or familial), or pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases, or pulmonary hypertension associated with HIV infection, or pulmonary hypertension associated with use of appetite suppressants or other toxic compounds, or pulmonary hypertension associated with shunting through a congenital heart defect surgically treated Class II or III in the NYHA classification scheme With a 6minute walking test distance between 40% and 80% of theoretical values (approximately 50 and 480 m) On conventional treatment, with no change in this treatment during the last month preceding the study. Conventional treatment includes calcium antagonists or beraprost. Subject who consents to participate in the study. Subjects with any of the following clinical features will not be included in the study: Pulmonary hypertension related to aortic or mitral valve disease, or extrinsic pulmonary vein compression Pulmonary hypertension related to hypoxia from respiratory disease with a total lung capacity &lt; 70% or Tiffeneau index &lt; 60% upon testing within the last 6 months (chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial disease, sleep apnea syndrome, alveolar hypoventilation, chronic exposure to high altitudes, neonatal lung disease, or alveolar capillary dysplasia) Pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension Pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic thrombosis and/or embolism (occlusion of the proximal or distal pulmonary arteries by thrombosis) In the 6minute walking test, inability to walk for 6 minutes, for any reason, or walking distance of less than 50 m Pregnancy, lactation, women of childbearing potential (if needed, effective contraception will be prescribed) History of hypersensitivity to citalopram or to medications structurally related to citalopram Treatment with another investigational drug within the 3 months preceding study inclusion Cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological or endocrine disease that is clinically significant, or any other significant disease that may interfere with the study protocol or with the interpretation of study findings History of drug or alcohol abuse Liver failure (except abnormalities related to the right ventricular failure) Kidney failure Mental status preventing the patient from understanding the nature, objectives, and possible consequences of the study Non stabilized psychiatric disorders Subject unable to comply with protocolrelated constraints (e.g., uncooperative, unable to attend followup visits, and probably unable to complete the study).</criteria>
