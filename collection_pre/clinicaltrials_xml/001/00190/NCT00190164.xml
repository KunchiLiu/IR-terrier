	<brief_summary>Rational of the study: There are arguments to think that the closure of macular holes can be obtained without a strict positioning under certain conditions, i.e. hole size ≤ 400 µm, if the patient avoids the position laid down on the back. In order to be able to confirm these observations, it is necessary to make a randomized study with an adequate number of patients. Aim of the study: To show that the percentage of success (anatomical closure confirmed by OCT) is not lower in the group without positioning. Tested Hypothesis: The absence of strict positioning is "at least as effective" on the success of the surgery of small macular holes as the imposition of a strict positioning. Expected results: To show that the success rate of the surgery of the idiopathic macular holes of 400 µm or less is not decreased by the replacement of a strict positioning (face-down 22h/24) by a simple instruction of avoiding the position laid down on the back, thus avoiding the patients this painful part of the treatment and allowing a reduction in the duration of hospitalization and consequently a reduction in the cost of the treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rational of the study: There are arguments to think that the closure of macular holes can be obtained without a strict positioning under certain conditions, i.e. hole size ≤ 400 µm, if the patient avoids the position laid down on the back. In order to be able to confirm these observations, it is necessary to make a randomized study with an adequate number of patients. Main Aim of the study: To show that the percentage of success (anatomical closure confirmed by OCT) is not lower in the group without positioning. Tested Hypothesis: The absence of strict positioning is "at least as effective" on the success of the surgery of small macular holes as the imposition of a strict positioning. Primary outcome: Frequency of the successes defined by anatomical closing. Secondary objectives: To show the non inferiority of the technique without positioning by the following variables: - ETDRS visual acuity in the third postoperative month. - Progression of cataract - Frequency of the complications. Design of the study: Randomized multicentric study, in parallel groups, open, with individual benefit for the patient. Number of subjects and duration of the study: 68 patients, divided into two parallel groups, of more than 18 years, presenting a hole ≤ 400 µm, will be included and followed over a period of 3 months. The estimated total duration of the study is 27 months. Data analysis: In the case of this equivalence clinical trial the margin of non inferiority was fixed at 15%. The secondary criteria will consequently be analyzed. Expected results: To show that the success rate of the surgery of the idiopathic macular holes of 400 µm or less is not decreased by the replacement of a strict positioning (face-down 22h/24) by a simple instruction of avoiding the position laid down on the back, thus avoiding the patients this painful part of the treatment and allowing a reduction in the duration of hospitalization and consequently a reduction in the cost of the treatment.</detailed_description>
