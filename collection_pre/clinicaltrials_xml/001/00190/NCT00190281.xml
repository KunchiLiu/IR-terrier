	<brief_summary>To evaluate the changes in the microcirculation of the liver, kidney and spleen during acute infection in patients with malaria (cohorts 1 and 3) and other infectious diseases such as acute pyelonephritis at day 0 (within 8 hours of the treatment start), day 2 to 4 and day 28-32, using functional US with continuous infusion of a contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Italy). Study hypothesis: malaria patients should exhibit a different pattern of enhancement, particularly when quantitative measurements of the SU signals is performed with destruction reperfusion kinetics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the changes in the microcirculation of the liver, kidney and spleen during acute infection in patients with malaria (cohorts 1 and 3) and other infectious diseases such as acute pyelonephritis at day 0 (within 8 hours of the treatment start), day 2 to 4 and day 28-32, using functional US with continuous infusion of a contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Italy). Three cohortes will be studied: cohorte 1 infection at Plasmodium falciparum (24 patients), cohorte 3 infection at Plasmodium vivax, ovale or malariae (5 patients) and cohorte 2 other infectious diseases such as acute pyelonephritis (24 patients). Study hypothesis: malaria patients should exhibit a different pattern of enhancement, particularly when quantitative measurements of the SU signals is performed with destruction reperfusion kinetics.</detailed_description>
