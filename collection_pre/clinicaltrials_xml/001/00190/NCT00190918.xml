All patients taking NSAIDs with longer halflives, should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration. Folic Acid (3501000 micrograms) must be given daily beginning approximately 57 days prior to first dose of pemetrexed and continuing daily until 3 weeks after the last dose of study therapy. Vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) will be administered as an intramuscular injection approximately 1 to 2 weeks prior to first dose of pemetrexed and repeated approximately every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of study therapy.
