	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will compare the mean first year height velocity of somatropin-treated prepubertal patients with SHOX deficiency with the height velocity of a control group of untreated prepubertal patients with SHOX deficiency. Both groups will be compared to a somatropin-treated group of girls with Turner syndrome. After the second year patients in the control group have the option to receive treatment as well. All patients will optionally be treated until they achieved adult height.</brief_summary>
