	<brief_title>Efficacy of 3,4-DAP in Fatigue Associated With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We proposed a randomized controlled trial between 3,4-diaminopyridine and placebo . The main objective : improvement of fatigue by diminution of EMIF-SEP score between the arm treatment and placebo arm.
