	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Adjuvant Oral UFT/LV to 5-FU/l-LV in Stage III Colorectal Cancer (JCOG-0205-MF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral fluoropyrimidines are widely used in practice for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected colorectal cancer in Japan. In order to evaluate a clinical benefit of oral anticancer drugs in adjuvant chemotherapy, we conducted randomized controlled trial comparing the oral combination chemotherapy, UFT+LV, to the standard intravenous combination chemotherapy, 5-FU+l-LV, in stage III colorectal cancer. UFT+LV: UFT 300mg/m2/day and LV 75mg/day, orally for 28days with 7days rest, repeated five times every 5 weeks. 5-FU+l-LV: 5-FU 500mg/m2, l-LV 250mg/m2, weekly administration for 6 times, repeated three times every 8 weeks. Primary endpoints are disease-free survival and secondary endpoints are overall survival and adverse event rate.</detailed_description>
