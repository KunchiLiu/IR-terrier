	<brief_title>A Trial of Chemotherapy Before and After Surgery for Stage II,III Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The previous study JCOG9204 showed that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil has a detectable preventive effect on relapse in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with surgery alone.(J Clin Oncol 2003;21:4592-4596) Therefore the standard treatment for stage II and III esophageal cancer is adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.</detailed_description>
