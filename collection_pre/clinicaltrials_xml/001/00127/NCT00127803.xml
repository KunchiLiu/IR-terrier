	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity Study of a Clostridium Difficile Toxoid Vaccine in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile is the leading infectious cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries. Hospital outbreaks of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are associated with substantial patient morbidity and mortality. Conventional therapy with antibiotics often results in secondary infection with resistant organisms or clinical relapse after discontinuation of the antimicrobial course. New strategies are needed to limit the impact of this opportunistic pathogen. Considerable evidence exists that immunity against C. difficile toxins may be effective in controlling CDAD. 48 subjects will be enrolled to receive one of three dose levels of modified C difficile vaccine or placebo administered on a 3-dose schedule. The study consists of a 30-day screening period, a 70-day treatment period, one follow-up phone interview 2 months after the last vaccination, and one follow-up clinic visit 6 months after the last vaccination.</detailed_description>
