	<brief_summary>This was a randomized, multi-center, partially placebo-controlled Phase IV study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a 48-week combined therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2a, ribavirin and amantadine sulphate versus placebo in untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C virus-genotype-1-infection. The hypothesis was that there will be an increase in sustained response rate for triple therapy compared to current standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alfa-2a, Ribavirin, Amantadine/Placebo in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-Genotype-1-Infection (PRAMA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: - Proof that a triple-therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a, ribavirin and amantadine sulphate) dispensed over a period of 50 weeks, improves the permanent virological efficacy by more than 10% as compared to a combination therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin, defined as negative HCV-RNA result obtained by a molecular verification method (e.g. Roche AmplicorTM HCV, v.2.0, sensitivity &lt;50 IE/ml) 24 weeks after the end of the therapy. Secondary Objectives: - Verification of the initial virological efficacy up to week 12, defined as negative HCV-RNA test results by means of quantitative proof methods, e.g. Roche AmplicorTM HCV Monitor v.2.0 (sensitivity &lt;600 IE/ml). - Biochemical efficacy, defined by the serum GPT values 24 weeks after the end of the therapy. - Virological efficacy, measured on the basis of the HCV-RNA values at the end of the therapy. - Biochemical efficacy defined by the serum GPT values at the end of the therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female and male subjects over 18 years of age and below 70 years of age Serological indication of chronic hepatitis C infection with positive antiHCV test and serum HCVRNA quantification &gt;600 IE/ml by means of quantitative proof methods, e.g. Roche AmplicorTM HCV Monitor test, v.2.0. Untreated patients with HCVinduced chronic infection. Indication of a genotype HCV1 on the basis of the reverse hybridizing assay Inno LiPA from Bayer Versant (Innogenetics).
