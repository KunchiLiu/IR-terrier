	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown that behavioral therapy for chronic pain can be beneficial for chronic pain and that behavioral therapy for insomnia can be beneficial for insomnia. However, seldom do chronic pain patients with insomnia receive a behavioral treatment for insomnia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment for insomnia is helpful for pain and whether treatment for pain is helpful for insomnia. It will also assess whether a combined treatment is any more or less effective for pain or for sleep. Finally, the study will assess whether any of these treatments leads to improvements in immune function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Insomnia Secondary to Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators' primary goal is to assess the extent to which three forms of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT for insomnia, CBT for pain, and combined insomnia &amp; pain) diminishes insomnia symptoms in patients with chronic pain compared to a group not receiving CBT. This will be evaluated in a randomized trial with before and after evaluations using standard sleep diary measures of sleep continuity. The investigators' secondary goal is to assess whether treatment responses to any of the interventions are associated with alterations in immune function. The investigators' tertiary goals are to evaluate whether improved sleep has effects on patient reports of pain severity, frequency, and tolerability as well as on mood and quality of life.</detailed_description>
