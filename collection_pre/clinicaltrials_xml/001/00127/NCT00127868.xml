	<brief_summary>Antifungal shampoos have been used as supplements to oral griseofulvin to help eradicate tinea capitis (also known as ringworm of the scalp) more quickly. While selenium sulfide shampoo has been the gold standard, its strong odor and its drying effect on the scalp discourage many patients from using it. Meanwhile, no other antifungal shampoo has been rigorously evaluated for efficacy. Therefore, while physicians are prescribing griseofulvin accompanied by any of a number of antifungal shampoos for tinea capitis, it is not known which antifungal shampoos (excluding selenium sulfide) actually significantly reduce time to cure, nor which do so the fastest. Scalp ringworm can also re-occur in the same child. To date, no studies have been done to find out whether or not the use of antifungal shampoos can prevent the recurrence of scalp ringworm. In this study, children ages 1-12 years old, who have clinically diagnosed tinea capitis, will all be prescribed oral griseofulvin for 8 weeks. In addition, they will be randomly assigned to use either selenium sulfide shampoo, ketoconazole shampoo, ciclopirox shampoo, or baby shampoo twice a week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, griseofulvin will be stopped. All patients will continue using the same assigned shampoo twice weekly for 24 weeks, while continuing to return to clinic every 4 weeks for scalp evaluation.</brief_summary>
