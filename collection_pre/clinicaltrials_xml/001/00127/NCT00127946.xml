	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Gastroschisis is a localised disruption of the abdominal layer. It occurs early in gestation, and the bowel is therefore bathing in the amniotic fluid and can be constricted at the level of the abdominal hole. The bowel is therefore submitted to different injuries partly attributable to the contact with amniotic fluid contaminated by digestive compounds and inducing an inflammatory reaction. Experimental studies on animal models and preliminary data in humans indicate that changing regularly the amniotic fluid (i.e. AMNIOECHANGE) would improve the outcome of theses fetuses and then neonates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of AMNIOECHANGE in Gastroschisis Affected Foetuses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To compare prospectively the effect of AMNIOECHANGE against classical care on the delay of full enteral feeding in gastroschisis affected foetuses Study: - Multicenter, Randomized. - Inclusion at 20 GA (gestational age) weeks. - AMNIOECHANGE every 2 weeks from 30 GA weeks Subject: 140 inclusion during 3 years Analysis: Triangular Sequential Evaluation</detailed_description>
