	<brief_summary>This is a randomized multicentre trial of emtricitabine (FTC) versus tenofovir (TDF)/FTC in antiretroviral naive subjects with HIV/HBV co-infection over 48 weeks (Clinical Trial A). Plus, a 12 week viral kinetic substudy comparing a subgroup of patients on Clinical Trial A is being conducted. (Substudy A1)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized multicentre trial of FTC vs TDF/FTC in antiretroviral naive subjects with HIV/HBV co-infection over 48 weeks (Clinical Trial A). Plus, a 12 week viral kinetic substudy comparing a subgroup of patients on Clinical Trial A is being conducted. (Substudy A1) Primary Objectives: - To compare the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA levels below the limit of detection (&lt;400 copies/ml) by week 48 in each treatment group Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the emergence of HBV resistance at 48 weeks - To compare the proportion of patients with undetectable HBV DNA at weeks 12 and 24 in each treatment group - To compare the proportion of patients who achieve HBeAg and HBsAg seroconversion at weeks 12, 24 and 48 during the study - To compare changes in ALT from baseline and the rate of hepatic cytolysis (ALT&gt;5x ULN) - To compare suppression of HIV-1 RNA and changes in CD4/CD8 counts over 48 weeks - To compare the effect of therapy on histological changes in the liver and the presence of ccc-DNA Enrollment: - 24 patients in Clinical trial A (of whom 16 enter substudy A1). Clinical Trial A: - Patients with HIV/HBV co-infection who are naive to HIV/HBV therapy, have detectable HBV viraemia and are willing to start antiretroviral therapy. Inclusion Criteria: - Written informed consent - Documented HIV infection - Age 18 – 70 years - HBV DNA &gt; 106 copies/ml Randomization: - Arm 1: Zidovudine (AZT), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz (EFV) - Arm 2: Tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz (EFV)</detailed_description>
