	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle modification (dietary education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) when compared to usual patient care. The secondary purpose of the study is to determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6 month period results in improvements in snoring and other symptoms and in the frequency of apnea on overnight monitoring.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle modification (dietary education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) when compared to usual patient care. The secondary purpose of the study is to determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6 month period results in improvements in snoring and other symptoms and in the frequency of apnea on overnight monitoring. Primary Objective - To determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle modification (dietary education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with mild-moderate OSA when compared to usual care. - To determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6 month period result in improvements in objective measures of sleep disordered breathing (AHI). Secondary Objective - To determine if the weight loss achieved in 6 months result in improvements in OSA symptoms (e.g., snoring, sleepiness) and quality of life. - To determine if metabolic parameters (e.g., lipids, glucose) improve. - To determine if there is improvement in sleep structure and oxygenation during sleep.</detailed_description>
