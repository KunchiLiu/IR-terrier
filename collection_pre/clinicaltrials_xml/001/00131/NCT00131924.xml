	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: High doses of esterified estrogens may stop the growth of breast cancer cells that no longer respond to hormone therapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose esterified estrogens work in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that has failed previous hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Esterified Estrogens in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Failed Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical response rate in postmenopausal women with estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer that has failed prior sequential endocrine therapy treated with high-dose esterified estrogens (Menest^®). Secondary - Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral high-dose esterified estrogens (Menest^®) 3 times daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.</detailed_description>
