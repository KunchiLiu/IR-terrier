	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of Different Doses of Chrysalin in Adults Who Have a Broken Wrist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a medical need for a product that is safe and can accelerate the rate of bone healing, leading to a reduction in immobilization time. Chrysalin, also known as TP508, is a synthetic peptide (protein) that is an exact copy of part of the human protein thrombin, which is a protein that occurs naturally in the body. Chrysalin can be used to mimic part of the thrombin response after injury without stimulating any of the events associated with blood clotting, and can therefore accelerate the normal process of healing.</detailed_description>
