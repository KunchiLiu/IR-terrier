	<brief_summary>This study will compare growth hormone levels and cardiovascular risk markers in normal weight and overweight women and men. In women and men with increased abdominal weight, growth hormone (GH) versus placebo will be administered and effects on cardiovascular risk, insulin resistance and body composition will be measured.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to measure growth hormone levels in women and men who are normal weight, overweight, and obese. Growth hormone levels will be correlated with body weight, body composition, and markers of cardiovascular risk. In overweight or obese women and men with increased visceral adiposity and below average IGF-1 levels, growth hormone versus placebo will be given for 6 months. Effects of growth hormone treatment on weight, body composition, insulin resistance, lipids, and cardiovascular risk markers will then be assessed. Study subjects will be followed for an additional six months for these endpoints.</detailed_description>
