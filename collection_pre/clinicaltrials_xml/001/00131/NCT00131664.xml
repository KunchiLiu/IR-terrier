	<brief_summary>The incidence of type 2 diabetes is on the increase. According to recent Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines glucose control, based on the A1C measurement, needs to be achieved within a 6-12 month period of time after the initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The guidelines on the use of antihyperglycemic agents identify the potential benefits of sub-maximal oral combination therapy in order to achieve more rapid and improved glycemic control compared with higher dose monotherapy. Furthermore, many patients on prolonged oral antihyperglycemic monotherapy who then start on combination therapy may not achieve the required target glycemic control. Indeed early initiation of combination therapies may be necessary to achieve and maintain glycemic targets because of the progressive deterioration of pancreatic β cell function and glycemic control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avandia™ + Amaryl™ or Avandamet™ Compared With Metformin (AVALANCHE™ Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AvandametTM combines two oral antihyperglycemic agents, rosiglitazone maleate and metformin hydrochloride, with different but complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control while reducing circulating insulin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. AvandiaTM and AmarylTM combine two antidiabetic agents, rosiglitazone maleate and glimepiride. Glimepiride is an effective antihyperglycemic agent which has a low incidence of hypoglycemia, symptomatic hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, and confirmed hypoglycemia. Subjects in this study who are inadequately controlled on diet, exercise and a submaximal dose of metformin or sulfonylurea (SU) will be randomized to either a combination of metformin plus rosiglitazone (AvandametTM) or a combination of AvandiaTM + AmarylTM or a Metformin monotherapy arm. As per the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guidelines, their fasting plasma glucose and A1C to be 7 (mmol/L / percent) or less throughout the study. If the subject does not achieve the target then either AvandametTM or AvandiaTM and AmarylTM or Metformin will be up-titrated in an effort to reach this CDA recommended target. This study will attempt to demonstrate that the either combination arm of rosiglitazone plus metformin (AvandametTM) or the other combination arm of AvandiaTM + AmarylTM will provide greater glycemic control while avoiding the side-effects associated with the use of maximal dose metformin.</detailed_description>
