	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether treatment of pregnant Malawian women with repeated doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and azithromycin antibiotics will prevent preterm deliveries and result in other health benefits both for the mother and the foetus/newborn.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gestational Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and Azithromycin Treatment to Prevent Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maternal anaemia, preterm deliveries and low birth weight are common in Sub-Saharan Africa and contribute significantly to the ill-health of pregnant women and infants. The present study is based on the assumption that these adverse outcomes can be prevented by improved antimicrobial management of malaria and sexually transmitted infections (STI) among pregnant women. To test the hypothesis, a randomised clinical trial following Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is being carried out in Malawi, South-Eastern Africa. A total of 1320 consenting women who present at a rural antenatal clinic after 14 but before 26 completed gestation weeks will be enrolled. One third of the women will receive antenatal care according to national recommendations, including regular visits to health centre, screening for pregnancy complications, haematinic and vitamin A supplementation and two doses of presumptive malaria treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Another third will receive otherwise the same care, but sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment is given at monthly intervals. The final third receives standard antenatal care, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment at monthly intervals and two doses of presumptive STI treatment with azithromycin. Women are monitored throughout pregnancy and delivery and newborn growth will be followed up for five years. The primary outcome measure is proportion of preterm births in the three study groups. Secondary maternal outcomes include anaemia and malaria parasitaemia during pregnancy, at delivery and at 1, 3, and 6 months after delivery, gestational weight gain and morbidity and STI prevalence after delivery. Secondary child outcomes consist of proportion of babies with low birth weight, mean birth weight, growth in infancy and childhood, incidence of malnutrition in infancy and childhood, and mortality. Additionally, information is collected on the development of malaria-specific humoral immunity in pregnancy and participant experiences from the study. Participant safety is systematically monitored throughout the intervention.</detailed_description>
