	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palifermin (recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor, rHuKGF) in reducing the incidence of severe oral mucositis in subjects with locally advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for their disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Palifermin for the Reduction of Oral Mucositis in Subjects With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of palifermin administered intravenously (IV) in weekly doses (minimum of 7 weekly doses, until RT was complete) in reducing the incidence of severe (World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3 or 4) oral mucositis in subjects with locally advanced HNC receiving RT concurrent with CT (RT/CT) as adjuvant treatment for their disease (postoperative setting). This study will assess the safety and tolerability of palifermin at the dose of 120 Î¼g/kg IV administered weekly (minimum 7 weekly doses, until RT was complete) in this subject population. This study will also evaluate the effect of palifermin on the clinical sequelae of severe OM (eg, average subject-reported mouth and throat soreness [MTS] score), and on RT-induced xerostomia in this population, as well as the long-term effects of palifermin on disease outcome and survival in this population.</detailed_description>
