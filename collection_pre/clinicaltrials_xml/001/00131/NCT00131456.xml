	<detailed_description>Given that depression and marijuana addiction often occur together, medications to treat individuals diagnosed with both conditions may be effective. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Ven-XR in treating individuals diagnosed with depression and marijuana addiction. During this twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, study visits will occur twice each week. During study visits, participants will receive either placebo or medication and provide a urine sample for drug screening. Blood tests will be collected each month and women must take pregnancy tests each month. Throughout the study, all participants will receive individualized psychotherapy sessions. At each study visit, participants will be given $5 to cover transportation costs.</detailed_description>
