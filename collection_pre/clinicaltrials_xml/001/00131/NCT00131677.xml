	<criteria>Healthy biologic male (male at birth) 1860 years of age HIV1 negative by licensed, commercially available, FDAapproved whole blood rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) at screening and enrollment Reports any anal sex with a man in the last 12 months Able to understand and pass comprehension assessment questionnaire Able to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Able to understand English Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance of at least 70 mL/min Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) less than or equal to 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3; Platelets at least 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin at least 9.5 g/dL Serum amylase less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN Biochemical profile: within normal limits for serum phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and calcium. Hepatitis B surface antigen negative Normal urine dipstick or urinalysis (UA) Active untreated syphilis Current uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mmHg) Mutually monogamous for &gt; one year with a known HIV antibody negative partner History of chronic renal disease, known osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or osteopenia Current or expected participation in other longitudinal HIV behavioral or biomedical research study Current HIV antiretroviral use Receiving or planning to receive ongoing therapy with any nephrotoxic agents or experimental/investigational agents Previous or expected requirements for the administration of immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. chronic systemic steroids, interferon, interleukins, chemotherapy, radiation). Evidence of a gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome or chronic nausea or vomiting which may confer an inability to receive an orally administered medication. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with participant compliance. Imminently lifethreatening medical conditions (malignancy, immunosuppressive disease [e.g. lymphoma]), or other serious disease or conditions (e.g. cardiovascular, renal, diabetes) within the last 5 years or that are unstable and/or require chronic medication that would impede compliance with study requirements and complicate the interpretation of adverse events Expected to be noncompliant with study visits or planning to move within 24 months to an area where the study will not be conducted Any other clinical or social condition, prior therapy, occupation, or other responsibility, that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to study participation or compliance with the dosing requirements.</criteria>
