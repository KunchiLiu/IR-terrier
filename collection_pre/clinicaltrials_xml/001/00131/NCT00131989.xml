	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia. Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity(s) (DLTs) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY 43-9006 given orally. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain preliminary evidence of tumor response to BAY 43-9006 in patients. II. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of BAY 43-9006. III. To characterize the preliminary profile of adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters in patients treated with BAY 43-9006. IV. To assess effects of BAY 43-9006 on various cellular properties of leukemic blasts exposed to drug in vivo and in vitro. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-14 or 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) may be considered for retreatment with sorafenib for up to an additional 6 courses upon disease recurrence provided the duration of CR is longer than 1 month. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have pathological confirmation (histologically or cytologically) of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (other than acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis The morphologic diagnosis of AML (nonAPL), ALL, and CML in blast crisis will be made independently by members of the hematologic pathology division; routine staining and standard criteria as outlined by the Report of the NCISponsored Workshop will be followed All patients must have been refractory to or relapsed from their most recent therapy AND are considered ineligible for potential curative approaches including allogeneic stem cell transplant; in addition, patients must be at least: 3 weeks from last cytotoxic chemotherapy (excluding hydroxyurea) Hydroxyurea may be used for blast count control but must be discontinued within 48 hours of the initiation of BAY 439006 2 weeks from last radiation therapy 3 week from last biologic therapy (including myeloid growth factors) ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Life expectancy of greater than 2 months Multilineage bone marrow failure due to the subject's underlying leukemia Total blast count in the peripheral blood &lt; 30,000 Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 mg/dl AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 5 X institutional upper limit of normal Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal All women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; the effects of BAY 439006 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; however, kinase inhibitors are known to be teratogenic; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients with APL are not eligible for this clinical trial Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier Patients with rapidly increasing peripheral blood blast counts (increase in the absolute peripheral blast count &gt; 50% within one week) or uncontrolled (absolute blast count &gt; 30,000) while on hydroxyurea will be excluded Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., persistent grade 3 while undergoing treatment) Patients may not be actively receiving any other investigational agents Patients active and / or untreated CNS leukemia will not be eligible History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to BAY 439006 Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 439006 Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy; therefore, HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 439006; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Patients must not have any evidence of bleeding diathesis Patients must not be on therapeutic anticoagulation; prophylactic anticoagulation (i.e. low dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided that the requirements for PT, INR or PTT are met Patients must not be taking the cytochrome P450 enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital), rifampin or St. John's wort</criteria>
