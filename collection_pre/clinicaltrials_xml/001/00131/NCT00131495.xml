	<brief_title>Study of Transdermal Testosterone Patches in Menopausal Women With Low Libido</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a condition suffered by as many as 32% of the menopausal population. It is generally defined as a low libido which causes distress. Testosterone therapy (transdermal patch) is currently under investigation for this disorder and results of three phase 3 trials have shown evidence of efficacy in menopausal patients on hormone replacement therapy. Low libido does not discriminate between those women utilizing hormone replacement therapy and those who do not. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of the transdermal testosterone patch in naturally or surgically menopausal women with low libido who are not receiving systemic estrogen or estrogen progestin therapy. Persons could elect to go into a single blind study for one year after completing the first yeat double blind</detailed_description>
