	<brief_title>Electronic Recording of Compliance With Occlusion Therapy for Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-compliance is a limiting factor for success of occlusion therapy for amblyopia (lazy eye) in childhood. It is responsible for approximately 1% of the adult population being unable to read with the amblyopic eye. The researchers used electronic monitoring of compliance to investigate predictors and a remedy for non-compliance. Methods: In a prospective randomised controlled trial, compliance was measured for one week every three months during 30 months in newly diagnosed amblyopic children in The Hague, Frankfurt and Leicester. The familyâ€™s social-economic and ethnic background was assessed through a questionnaire. Children were randomised to receive either an educational cartoon story explaining, without text, the rationale for treatment to the child with reward stickers and an information sheet, or a picture to colour. All received standard orthoptic care by a treating orthoptist, who was unaware of the randomisation. The electronic device and educational programme were distributed via home-visits by researchers. The primary outcome measure was percentage of compliance (realised/prescribed occlusion time). The secondary outcome measure was influence of social-economic, ethnic and clinical factors on compliance.</detailed_description>
