	<brief_title>The CHAT (Community Health Advice by Telephone) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred and twenty five healthy, sedentary men and women ages 55 and older will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 12 months of physical activity counseling delivered by a human counselor, 12 months of physical activity counseling delivered by a telephone-linked computer system, or a 12-month attention-control condition (a health education class). Data on physical activity participation and related quality of life indicators (e.g., improved physical functioning, fitness, sleep) will be collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 month post-test and 18 month follow-up. The primary hypotheses are: - participants in either physical activity counseling condition will show greater improvements in physical activity participation at 12 months compared to the attention-control condition; - participants in the human counselor condition will show greater improvements in physical activity at 12 months relative to the computer condition; and - participants in the computer condition will show better maintenance of physical activity between 12 and 18 months compared to participants in the human counselor condition.</detailed_description>
