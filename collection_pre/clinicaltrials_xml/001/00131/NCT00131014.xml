	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate possible genetic factors that contribute to the development of lymphomas. The databank will be used to determine whether familial lymphomas have unique genetic characteristics different from sporadic lymphomas and to attempt to identify a gene that confers an increased risk of lymphoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patients who participate will be asked to complete detailed family and medical history questionnaires initially, with a follow-up questionnaire every year. - Patients will be asked to supply a blood sample and possibly a mouthwash sample, both of which can be done by mail. - Patients will be asked to consent to the release of their lymphoma tissue block for the purposes of the study. - Patients will be given letters of invitation for their affected relatives to invite them to participate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any individual diagnosed with nonHodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who has a 1st degree relative (parent, sibling or child) with a lymphoproliferative disorder; or families in which the individual has a lymphoproliferative disorder, and an unusual clustering of frequent or premature solid tumors is also observed. Family members of the individual, either affected or unaffected with lymphoma, who are contacted by the individual and agree to participate in the study. Deceased family members may be included in the study. Public records such as death certificates may be used to confirm the history. Consent for medical records or tissue blocks will be obtained from the deceased family member's next of kin. The hierarchy of relatives defined as next of kin is spouse, offspring, parents and siblings. Archived tissue samples may be used for genetic research.
