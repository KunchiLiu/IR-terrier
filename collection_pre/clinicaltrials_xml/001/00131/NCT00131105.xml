	<brief_title>The TLC2 (Teaching Healthy Lifestyles to Caregivers 2)/CALM (Counseling Advice for Lifestyle Management) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study combines elements of two previous studies--Teaching Healthy Lifestyles for Caregivers (TLC2) and Counseling Advice for Lifestyle Management (CALM)--to compare exercise and diet interventions in caregivers and non-caregivers. Two hundred and forty healthy men and women ages 50 and older, half caregivers and half non-caregivers, will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: - a 12-month physical activity intervention and a 12-month dietary counseling intervention delivered simultaneously; - a 12-month counseling intervention first focusing on physical activity followed by the addition of dietary counseling; - a 12-month counseling intervention first focusing on dietary counseling followed by the addition of physical activity counseling; or - a 12-month attention-control condition focusing on stress-management skills training. Data on physical activity participation, saturated fat consumption, and related quality of life indicators (e.g., improved physical functioning, fitness, sleep, and psychological well-being) will be collected at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months post-test. The primary hypotheses are: - participants assigned to the physical activity and dietary counseling conditions will show greater improvements in physical activity participation and saturated fat consumption at 12 months compared to the attention-control condition; and - participants in the sequentially-delivered counseling interventions will show greater improvements in physical activity and saturated fat consumption compared to participants in the simultaneously-delivered interventions.</detailed_description>
