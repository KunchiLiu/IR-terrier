	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with recurrent diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the response rate of treatment with sorafenib (BAY43-9006) in patients with recurrent aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the duration of response and progression free survival of treatment with BAY43-9006 in patients with recurrent aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas. II. To characterize the toxicity of treatment with BAY43-9006 in patients with recurrent aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas. III. To further characterize the pharmacokinetics properties of BAY43-9006 and assess influence of monooxygenases polymorphisms and multi-drug resistance transporter (MDR) on pharmacokinetics. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year. PLANNED ACCRUAL: 41 ACTUAL ACCRUAL: 14</detailed_description>
