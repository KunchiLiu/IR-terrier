	<brief_summary>In an attempt to simplify the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, the researchers will investigate the presence of specific molecular markers of ectopic pregnancy. The quantification of these (and other proteins) will be performed using the Ciphergen Protein Chip system where serum is sampled with a high-throughput system. The patterns of these peaks will be compared for those with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and normal pregnancy. Later goals of the research will be to identify the actual proteins that correspond to the peaks which discriminate between the two clinical entitles. The goal is to identify a unique protein pattern or protein peak to distinguish a normal intrauterine pregnancy from that of an ectopic implanted gestation.</brief_summary>
