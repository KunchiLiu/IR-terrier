	<brief_title>A Study of HSV Testing Among Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study hypothesis is that women with antepartum testing who are identified as susceptible to HSV-1 or HSV-2 will have reduced unprotected coital activity and reduced unprotected oral-genital activity compared to those who did not receive antepartum testing. The objective of the study is to evaluate the acceptance, and effect of type-specific HSV serologic testing of pregnant women on sexual behavior at the end of pregnancy. Upon enrollment, study participants will be randomized into either of two type-specific HSV serologic testing and counseling regimens: - Group 1: Antepartum and postpartum testing. Subjects will be made aware of their antepartum testing results. - Group 2: Antepartum blood draw and postpartum testing. Subjects' specimens will be tested at the same time. Women in group 2 will receive information about herpes infection and how to decrease their chance of acquiring infection during pregnancy. Subjects will be asked to keep a diary of sexual activity and return to the clinic every 4 weeks until delivery.</detailed_description>
