	<brief_title>Weekly Topotecan Therapy in Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Stage IIIC and IV optimally-debulked ovarian cancer will be treated with 6 cycles (every 3 weeks) of carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). Patients who demonstrate a complete clinical response to this regimen will then be treated with topotecan consolidation (4 mg/m2 weekly x 8 weeks for one cycle followed by a break in the 9th week) for a maximum of 3 cycles. Primary endpoints will be toxicity and the determination of the appropriate dose, schedule, and duration of topotecan for further consolidation trials.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histopathologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer. Patients must have completed frontline chemotherapy and be clinically NED (CA 125 &lt;35, negative CT scan, negative physical exam). Patients may have a second look laparoscopy, however, there must be no gross disease present (microscopic disease or pathologically negative). Patients must not have had other myelosuppressive therapy within four weeks of initiating topotecan therapy. Topotecan treatment must begin within 10 weeks following last cycle of initial chemotherapy. Patients may have had only one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients with a concomitant malignancy other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
