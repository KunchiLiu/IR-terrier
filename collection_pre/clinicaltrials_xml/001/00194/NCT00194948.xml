	<brief_title>Treatment Choices for Improving Adherence and Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigates whether offering primary care patients treatment that is congruent with their preferred first choice improves adherence and outcomes, in comparison to offering treatment that is not congruent with their preferred first choice. All subjects are offered a treatment with demonstrated efficacy, namely either the antidepressant medication escitalopram or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for 5 months. We hypothesize that patients who receive congruent treatment will be more likely to initiate treatment, adhere to treatment, and achieve depression remission.</detailed_description>
