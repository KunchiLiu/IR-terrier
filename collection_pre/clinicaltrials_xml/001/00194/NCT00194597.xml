	<brief_summary>Viagra is a potent 5-PDE inhibitor that causes vasodilation in the penis and, therefore, erection in men with erectile dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that Viagra may improve the symptoms of men with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome based on the following assumptions: Chronic Pelvic Pelvic Syndrome and Interstitial Cystitis involve poorly understood central and peripheral pain sensitization such as are seen in Chronic Sympathetic Dystrophy, also called Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome. This pain may be caused by constricted blood vessels resulting from past stress, injury or trauma Viagra will dilate sympathetically constricted vessels and improve pelvic blood flow in the same manner it does in men with erectile dysfunction. Since men with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome often complain of sexual dysfunction; improving sexual function and, therefore, quality of life may improve overall well being and perception of pain.</brief_summary>
