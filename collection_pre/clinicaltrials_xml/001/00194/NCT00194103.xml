	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of extended telephone monitoring for alcohol-dependent patients receiving intensive outpatient treatment. It is hypothesized that telephone monitoring will produce better alcohol use outcomes relative to treatment as usual. It is also hypothesized that adaptive telephone monitoring plus brief counseling will produce better alcohol use outcomes over time relative to telephone monitoring plus feedback only.</brief_summary>
