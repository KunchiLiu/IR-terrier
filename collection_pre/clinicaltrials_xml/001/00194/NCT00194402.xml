	<brief_summary>Slo-Niacin and atorvastatin (Lipitor) are both drugs that lower cholesterol. In this research, we will compare the effectiveness of Slo-Niacin and atorvastatin taken alone and together. This study will help show how the individual benefits of the two drugs taken separately can be combined when taken together.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SLIM: Combined Effects of Slo-Niacin and Atorvastatin on Lipoproteins and Inflammatory Markers in Hyperlipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combined niacin and a statin treatment has greater potential value than either agent alone for the dyslipidemia of insulin resistance, obesity and the metabolic syndrome. The efficacy of Slo-Niacin and atorvastatin has not been formally examined in this setting. Methods: Forty-four dyslipidemic men and women (LDL-C &gt;130mg/dL and below average HDL-C (&lt;55 in women and &lt;45 in men) were randomized to a 3 month course of atorvastatin 10 mg or Slo-Niacin increased monthly at doses of 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/day. The alternate drug was added in the second 3-month segment. Lipid profiles and transaminase measurements were obtained monthly and full lipoprotein quantifications, apoproteins, remnant like lipoproteins (RLP), LDL buoyancy, glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein were measured at the end of each 3-month sequence. Results: Mean entry lipids were (mg/dL) TG 187, LDL-C 171, HDL-C 39. Mean BMI was 32.6 Kg/M2. When Slo-Niacin and atorvastatin were given alone, respective decreases in triglyceride (TG) were 18% and 10%, LDL-C 12% and 36% and non-HDL-C 15% and 36%. HDL-C increased 8% and 6%, respectively. Combined therapy decreased median TG 33% and mean LDL-C 43% and increased mean HDL-C 10%. Mean hs CRP decreased 23% and RLP 44.5% in the combined groups. Conclusions: Slo-Niacin with atorvastatin improves all lipoprotein fractions, RLP and hsCRP in combined hyperlipidemia. The reduction of LDL with the drug combination is equivalent to that obtained with 20-80 mg of atorvastatin alone.</detailed_description>
