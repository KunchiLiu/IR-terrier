	<brief_title>Suppression of Oral HHV8 Shedding With Valganciclovir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to use valganciclovir to define the role of antiviral therapy in suppression of HHV-8 shedding in HHV-8 seropositive men. Our hypothesis is that valganciclovir will substantially reduce the frequency of detection and amount of HHV-8 in the mouth. Such reduction will serve to confirm that the mouth is the site of active HHV-8 replication. If valganciclovir is found to be effective, the findings from this proposal would serve as the basis for a clinical trial with valganciclovir for prevention of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) in high-risk HHV-8 seropositive persons. After informed consent, all subjects will undergo medical history, physical examination and screening laboratory examination. Eligible patients will return to clinic for randomization to receiver either valganciclovir 900 mg qd or placebo. Participants will receive a diary for noting adverse events and concurrent medications. The clinician will instruct the participants on collection of mouth swabs and provide Dacron swabs, vials with PCR media and pre-printed labels. Subjects will be asked to obtain a swab of oral mucosa every morning. Clinic visits every other week will serve to review interim medical history and diaries for adverse events, collect PCR swabs, dispense additional medication and draw safety labs. The study uses a double-blind, randomized placebo design. Therefore, participants will not know whether they will be taking a placebo or active medication at any time during the study. Due to the crossover study design, however, all participants will receive the same amount of placebo and study drug over the duration.</detailed_description>
