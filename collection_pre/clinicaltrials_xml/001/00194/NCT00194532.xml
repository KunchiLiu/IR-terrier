	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common problem in young healthy women, afflicting approximately one-half of women by their late 20s. One of the most common antibiotics used to treat UTIs is ciprofloxacin, usually for a total of three days. However, increasing resistance to this antibiotic has raised concerns about its overuse for cystitis and generated interest in alternative agents. An alternative antibiotic which is approved for use in UTIs is cefpodoxime. However, there are few studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of this compound when given in a 3-day regimen as is commonly used for treatment of UTI. The major purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a 3-day regimen of cefpodoxime versus ciprofloxacin for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis.</brief_summary>
