	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the drug combination of Doxil (doxorubicin) and estramustine when used to treat prostate cancer that is resistant to hormones and to a chemotherapy type called taxanes. The primary hypothesis is to reduce the measurable disease or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by at least 50% from baseline.</brief_summary>
