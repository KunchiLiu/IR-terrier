	<brief_title>Study of Preoperative Docetaxel or Cisplatin (CDDP) + Docetaxel for C-stage IB-II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative chemotherapy has substantial theoretical advantage. Several controlled trials are under way in early stage (clinical stage IB-II) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In each trial, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is employed. Although platinum-based doublet is the treatment of choice for advanced NSCLC, risk/benefit balance might well be different in earlier stages. There have been no prospective randomized trials to choose an optimal preoperative chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC. Comparison: Preoperative cisplatin-docetaxel combination versus docetaxel monotherapy in clinical stage IB/II NSCLC.</detailed_description>
