	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Therapy for Acute Hepatitis C Infection in HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background:HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of developing a chronic course of hepatitis C after infection. Moreover, chronic hepatitis C is less well treatable in HIV-Coinfected than in hepatitis C monoinfected patients. There is basic research and clinical data on hepatitis C mono-infection supporting high sustained response rates of hepatitis C when treatment is started in the acute phase of infection. Aim of the study: To determine whether pegylated interferon therapy is effective to treat acute hepatitis C infection in HIV-coinfected individuals. Methods: Prospective, open-label, historical controlled trial. Eligible subjects are treated over 24 weeks with a pegylated interferon at standard dose. Weight-adjusted ribavirin comedication is recommended for HCV-genotypes 1 and 4. Treatment will be withheld for 12 weeks in order to allow spontaneous resolution in subjects with clinical symptomatic hepatitis C infection.</detailed_description>
