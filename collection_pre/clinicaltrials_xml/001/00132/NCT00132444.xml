	<brief_summary>This study will help determine whether the agent UC-781, formulated as a gel, is safe when applied to the vagina twice daily for 14 days. It will also assess whether women find the gel acceptable to use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of UC-781 Vaginal Microbicide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To assess the safety and acceptability of vaginal use of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel in sexually active HIV-uninfected women, and their male partners, and sexually abstinent HIV-infected women Design: Single-center, phase I randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with 14 days of twice-daily product or control gel exposure Study population: Sexually active, HIV-uninfected women at low-risk for HIV and their male partners; sexually-abstinent HIV-infected women; all age 18-45 Size: 36 sexually active HIV-uninfected women and up to 36 of their male partners; 18 sexually abstinent HIV-infected women Treatment regimen: Stage 1: HIV-uninfected, sexually active women and 1 male partner per woman: 12 women assigned to 0.1% UC-781 twice daily x 14 days; 12 women assigned to 0.25% UC-781 twice daily x 14 days; 12 women assigned to control gel twice daily X 14 days. Stage 2: HIV-infected, abstinent women: 12 assigned to 0.25% UC-781 twice daily x 14 days; 6 assigned to control gel twice daily x 14 days Study duration: Participant accrual will take 6 months. Each participant will be followed for 14 days in Stage 1 and 21 days in Stage 2. Total study duration will be 9 months. Study Site: The Hope Clinic of Emory University, Decatur, GA Primary Objectives: - To assess the safety and toxicity of 0.1% UC-781 gel and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally twice-daily for 14 days on the vulvar and cervicovaginal mucosa of sexually active HIV-uninfected women - To assess the safety and toxicity of 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally twice-daily for 14 days on the vulvar and cervicovaginal mucosa of sexually abstinent HIV-infected women Secondary Objectives: - To assess the acceptability of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally twice-daily for 14 days among HIV-uninfected, and the acceptability of 0.25% gel similarly administered to HIV-infected women - To assess the effect of study product on vaginal microflora of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women - To assess the systemic absorption of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel when administered intravaginally - To assess HIV viral load in genital secretions in HIV-infected women during 0.25% UC-781 gel use - To assess the genotypic resistance patterns of HIV in genital secretions and peripheral blood in HIV-infected women during 0.25% UC-781 gel use - To assess the acceptability of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel in male sexual partners of HIV-uninfected women Primary Endpoints: The safety and toxicity of 0.1% UC-781 gel and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered intravaginally twice-daily for 14 days in sexually-active HIV-uninfected women and 0.25% UC-781 gel administered in sexually-abstinent HIV-infected women will be assessed by: - Macroscopic and/or microscopic evidence of vulvar and/or vaginal epithelium damage, including ulceration, abrasion, severe erythema, and/or severe edema - Macroscopic and/or microscopic evidence of cervical mucosal damage including ulceration, abrasion, severe erythema, and/or severe edema - Symptoms of genital irritation, including burning, itching or soreness - Laboratory evidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity for hematology, liver or renal function which cannot be attributed to another cause Secondary Endpoints: Acceptability of 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel use by HIV-uninfected and 0.25% UC-781 gel use by HIV-infected women will be assessed by: - Proportion of participants who at Day 14 visit indicate they would be 'somewhat unlikely' or 'very unlikely' to use 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel during sexual intercourse in the future compared to control gel users - Reported positive aspects of using 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel compared to control gel users - Reported negative aspects of using 0.1% and 0.25% UC-781 gel compared to control gel users</detailed_description>
