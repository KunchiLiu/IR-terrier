	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of specialized treatment (including cognitive therapy, social counselling and a recommendation letter to the patients' primary care physician) on the functional level, emotional problems, and use of health care in patients with chronic medically unexplained symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Patients With Longstanding Unexplained Health Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medically unexplained or functional somatic symptoms are complaints, which are not attributable to any verifiable, conventionally defined disease, or which cannot adequately be supported by clinical or para-clinical findings. Functional somatic symptoms are common in the population and in all clinical settings, both in primary and secondary care. The disorders range from mild, transitory cases, which are difficult to delimit in relation to normality, to severe chronic cases with multiple symptoms from different organ systems. Chronic multiple functional somatic symptoms often cause frustration for both GPs and patients due to lack of availability of specialized treatment offers. Patients may have a high use of health care, and their social and functional level is low. In Denmark, patients with chronic multiple functional somatic symptoms account for at least 10% of the early retirement pensions each year. Diverse interventions have been effective in the management and treatment of patients with functional disorders. Care recommendation letters for the GPs have both helped reduce the patients' use of health care and improved their level of physical functioning. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have shown that cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) has effect on specific patient groups with functional disorders. Through a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, social counselling and recommendation letters, it is possible to offer patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms a presumably effective and cost-effective treatment.</detailed_description>
