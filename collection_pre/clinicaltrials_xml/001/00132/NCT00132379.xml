	<brief_summary>The drug ABR-217620 is a combination of two proteins, one that recognizes tumor cells and one that triggers an attack on the tumor cells by activating some white blood cells belonging to the body's normal immune system. In animals, this results in an accumulation of white blood cells in the cancer that can fight the cancer. This study will test how much of the drug, in combination with docetaxel (an approved drug for treating non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), can be given to patients with NSCLC without causing unacceptable side effects.</brief_summary>

Any concurrent malignancy, except for the following malignancies that may be included: nonmelanoma skin cancer; cervical cancer in situ; ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of breast; or past history of prostate cancer without clinical evidence of disease (includes patients receiving hormonal therapy). History of brain metastases, unless stable for more than 4 weeks, and not requiring steroid therapy and without clinical symptoms of brain metastases. Significant symptomatic cardiac disease including history (within past 6 months) or current unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction; or patients with uncontrolled hypertension, or hypertension requiring treatment with more than 2 drugs. History of or current arrhythmias requiring treatment, except for nonspecific, asymptomatic STT wave changes or extrasystoles. Seizure disorder requiring therapy. Treatment with betablockers, including topical therapy for glaucoma, during the 6day treatment period (5day treatment + 1 day inpatient followup), and within 5 days before start of ABR217620 treatment. Simultaneous participation in any other investigational drug study or participation in a study less than 4 weeks before start of study treatment. Treatment with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids within 2 weeks before start of treatment. Treatment with anticoagulants, except when used to maintain the patency of a central venous line. Active autoimmune disease requiring therapy or any history of systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Concurrent biological response modifiers (within 3 weeks of study entry) except for any type of erythropoetin. Chemo/radio/immunotherapy less than 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) before start of treatment. Known allergy or hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides (e.g., kanamycin). Known allergy or hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.
