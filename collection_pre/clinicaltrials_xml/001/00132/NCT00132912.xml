	<brief_summary>The object of the study is to determine whether different doses of SCH 530348, when added to standard medical care in persons undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, will increase the risk of bleeding. A secondary objective is to determine whether patients treated with SCH 530348 have fewer cardiac events such as heart attack, bypass surgery, or death compared with those persons treated with the standard of care.</brief_summary>
