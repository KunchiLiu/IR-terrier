	<detailed_description>The brain imaging is conducted at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders in New Haven, Connecticut. The imaging procedure occurs over a two day period. After a screening visit, including review of the potential subject's neurological history and a thorough neurologic exam, subjects are injected with [123I]ß CIT, an investigational radioactive material that localizes in the brain. Twenty-four hours later study participants return to the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders where an investigational scanning procedure is used to obtain SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) images of the brain.</detailed_description>
