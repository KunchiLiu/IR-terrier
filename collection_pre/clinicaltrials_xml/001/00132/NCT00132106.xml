	<brief_summary>The activity of the sympathetic nervous system seems to influence the uptake (and handling) of glucose by the skeletal muscle of the forearm. Conditions in which sympathetic activity is increased seem to inhibit/reduce forearm glucose uptake. Inversely a decrease in sympathetic activity seems to increase glucose uptake. This study analyzes the effect of alfa-adrenergic receptor blockade (counteracting sympathetic influence) on insulin-stimulated forearm glucose uptake in patients with increased sympathetic activity (patients with chronic heart failure).</brief_summary>
