	<brief_summary>Angiographies of the supra-aortic vessels by magnetic imaging have become common recently. So it was the purpose of this study to evaluate the imaging potential of different contrast agents. Three contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging are compared in angiographies of the supra-aortic arteries in a intraindividual study of 10 patients. All applications of these contrast agents are performed with a flow of 2 ml/s. One contrast medium is applicated a second time with a reduced flow of 1 ml/s. The angiographies of the supra-aortic vessels are evaluated by two experienced readers in a consensus reading. The signal/noise- and contrast/noise-ratio of anatomic vessel segments of the carotic and vertebral arteries are measured and compared to each other.</brief_summary>
