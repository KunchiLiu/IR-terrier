	<brief_summary>This study is looking at the safety and tolerability of the experimental biological drug EMD 273066 when given with low dose cyclophosphamide to patients with recurring EpCAM positive ovarian, prostate, colorectal or non-small cell lung cancers. EMD 273066 is an experimental biological drug that may increase the immune response to certain cancers. Patients will be enrolled in groups of 3, with each successive group receiving a higher dose if the prior group adequately tolerates the study medication.</brief_summary>
