	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of lonafarnib (versus placebo) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Benefit will be measured by achievement of platelet transfusion independence for at least 8-consecutive weeks, and without simultaneous worsening of hemoglobin and/or need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Additional endpoints will be hematologic response (which includes complete remission, partial remission, hematologic improvement), number of RBC transfusions, bleeding events, infections and safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed MDS (RA, RARS, RAEB, RAEBT) or CMML according to FAB classification. Platelet transfusion dependence (requiring 1 to 8 platelet transfusion events every 4 week period (Day 84 to Day 57, Day 56 to Day 29, and Day 28 to Day 1) over an 8week retrospective and 4week prospective screening period). The individual number of platelet transfusion events during the three 4weekly periods (Day 84 to Day 57; Day 56 to Day 29; Day 28 to Day 1) must not differ by greater more than 2 from the average number of platelet transfusion events during the 12 week screening period. If the subject is RBC transfusion dependent, the number of RBC transfusion events during the three 4weekly periods (Days 84 to 57; Day 56 to Day 29 and Day 28 to Day 1) must not differ by more than 2 from the average number of RBC transfusion events during this 12 week screening period. ECOG PS 02. Subjects with chemotherapy/radiotherapyassociated secondary MDS. &lt;12 Weeks (prior to Day1 Randomization) from any investigational drug use, any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and any other treatment or MDS/CMML other than best supportive care. Hx of bonemarrow or peripheral stemcell transplantation or treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion. Hx of AML. Known hx of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Marked baseline prolongation of QTc interval, CTCAE Grade &gt;=1. Use of ketokonazole within 72 hours prior to study drug administration.</criteria>
