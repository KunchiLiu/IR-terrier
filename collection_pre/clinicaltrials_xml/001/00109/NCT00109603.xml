	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the anti-HIV drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) on lipid levels in HIV infected adults on stable anti-HIV drug therapy. Study hypothesis: The addition of TDF to stable background antiretroviral therapy in HIV infected individuals with dyslipidemia will result in a reduction of non-HDL after 12 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate on Lipid Levels in HIV Infected Adults on Stable Anti-HIV Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in significant reductions in morbidity and mortality among HIV infected people. However, significant adverse effects, including dyslipidemia, have been associated with HAART. Dyslipidemia may cause elevations in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations, as well as a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations. Dyslipidemia is of particular concern for patients receiving HAART because the condition is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. TDF is an antiretroviral that has exhibited favorable lipid effects in several studies in HIV infected people, but the mechanism for the observed lipid-lowering effect of TDF is unknown. This study will evaluate the efficacy of TDF on lowering non-HDL in HIV infected adults currently on stable HAART. HAART itself will not be provided by this study. This study will last 32 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms. Arm A participants will receive 12 weeks of TDF daily, 4 weeks of no TDF, 12 weeks of placebo daily, then 4 weeks of no TDF. Arm B participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo daily, 4 weeks of no TDF, 12 weeks of TDF daily, then 4 weeks of no TDF. Participants will continue to take their currently prescribed stable HAART regimen for the duration of the study. There will be 13 study visits over the 32 weeks of the study. Clinical assessments will occur at all visits; blood and urine collection will occur at most visits.</detailed_description>
