	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and pharmacokinetics of AMN107 in six groups of patients with one of the following conditions: Relapsed/refractory Ph+ Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (arm 1) Group A - Imatinib failure only (arms 2, 3 and 4) - imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML - Chronic Phase (CP) - imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML - Accelerated Phase (AP) - imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML - Blast Crisis (BC) Group B - Imatinib and other TKI failure (arms 2, 3 and 4) - imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML - Chronic Phase (CP) - imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML - Accelerated Phase (AP) - imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML - Blast Crisis (BC) Hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL) (arm 5) Systemic mastocytosis (Sm) (arm 6)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main inclusion criteria include: Patients with CML in blast crisis, CML in accelerated phase defined as never in blast crisis phase, or CML in chronic phase defined as never been in blast crisis phase or accelerated phase who have: *developed progressive disease during therapy with at least 600 mg of imatinib per day, OR *patients with CML on imatinib therapy, at any dose, developing progressive disease and the presence of a genetic mutation likely to result in imatinib resistance OR *have developed an intolerance to imatinib Relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL Hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Systemic mastocytosis who have a clinical indication for treatment. Prior imatinib therapy for patients with Ph+ ALL, HES/CEL and SM is permitted but is not required CML patients who have been treated with an investigational tyrosine kinase inhibitor who otherwise meet the definition of imatinibresistance or intolerance are eligible Written informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed Impaired cardiac function Patients with severe/chronic or uncontrolled medical conditions (including but not limited to diabetes, infections, GI impairment, CNS infiltration, liver and kidney disease) Prior and concomitant use of certain medications (including but not limited to warfarin, chemotherapy, hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factors, medications that can affect electrocardiogram test results, other investigational drugs ) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Patients with a history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically significant or currently requires active intervention. Patients unwilling to comply with the protocol. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
