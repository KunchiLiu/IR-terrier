	<brief_summary>This Phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhuMAb VEGF (Avastin) when administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in combination with 5 FU (fluorouracil)/leucovorin versus 5 FU/leucovorin alone in subjects with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer who are not optimal candidates to receive first-line CPT-11 (irinotecan). A total of 48 doses of rhuMAb VEGF may be administered during this study (maximum of 96 weeks of therapy).</brief_summary>
