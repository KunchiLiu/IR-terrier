	<brief_summary>The project's aim is to provide a targeted, computer-administered intervention to facilitate tobacco cessation for clients in alcohol treatment. The main focus of "On the Air: A tobacco cessation program for adults in alcohol recovery" is to reduce tobacco use of clients in alcohol treatment. The program will be offered through inpatient, residential, and outpatient treatment programs to help those struggling with alcohol addiction to understand, reduce, and stop tobacco use. Clients will develop a personalized tobacco cessation plan relevant to their readiness to quit tobacco use. Based on the metaphor of a television network, this tobacco cessation program contains information on personal risks, peer stories, cravings and withdrawal, a variety of interactive activities and tools, and also motivational feedback and tips to assist in the quitting process. Phase I was a proof of concept phase, in which we delivered a prototype CD-ROM on tobacco cessation. Phase II will involve completing the development of a functional CD-ROM tool which will be subjected to a clinical field trial with a group of adults (n=196) in treatment facilities for alcohol recovery. The clinical field study will involve finalizing the content, interface, and interactive features of the CD-ROM. We will also gather satisfaction data from both clients and counselors in the various treatment facilities.</brief_summary>
