	<brief_title>Evaluation of Diabetes Self-Management Consultant Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of a diabetes Self-Management Consultant (SMC) intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes with unsatisfactory glucose control (i.e., HbA1c â‰¥ 8%--the value chosen as "high risk" by the Diabetes Quality Improvement Project which is an initiative of the Health Care Financing Administration, the American Diabetes Association, and the Foundation for Accountability) to a control group selected using the same criteria. The SMC intervention will be implemented and evaluated in two different health care systems serving two distinct populations of patients with diabetes. After signing the Informed Consent document, subjects will be randomized to the SMC intervention or a control group. All subjects in the study will complete a baseline assessment of their diabetes care and health status. Subjects randomized to the SMC intervention will have an individual meeting with the SMC to review and refine a self-management plan based on the subject's priorities and goals. These subjects will receive individual follow-up and support during the year, through monthly phone calls and an annual meeting with the SMC and their primary care physician. Subjects randomized to the control group will receive usual care following their baseline and their 12-, 24-, and 36-month assessments. Unlike most nurse-manager studies, the SMC's interactions with patient care will use a theory-based behavioral approach with which we have extensive experience. The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMC intervention compared to usual care. All records will be handled confidentially. Lab results and personal data will be linked by a research specific identifier code.</detailed_description>
