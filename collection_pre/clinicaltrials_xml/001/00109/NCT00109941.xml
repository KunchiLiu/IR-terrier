	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Opioid growth factor may stop the growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well opioid growth factor works in treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioid Growth Factor in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the growth inhibitory effects of opioid growth factor ([Met^5]-enkephalin) in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Secondary - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. - Determine the pain control, depression, and nutritional status of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive opioid growth factor ([Met^5]-enkephalin) IV over 45 minutes once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks during study treatment, and at the completion of study treatment. Patients are followed weekly for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
