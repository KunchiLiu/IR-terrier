	<brief_title>Safety of Single Doses of Peginesatide in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential dose escalation study conducted at a single clinical center. The study was designed to evaluate up to 6 treatment cohorts of 9 participants with CKD not on dialysis in the first cohort and 5 participants in each subsequent cohort. In each treatment cohort, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of peginesatide (n=7 in the first cohort, n=4 in subsequent cohorts) or placebo (n=2 in the first cohort, n=1 in subsequent cohorts). Participants were followed for a minimum of 28 days.</detailed_description>
