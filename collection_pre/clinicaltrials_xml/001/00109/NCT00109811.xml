	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the T-lymphocyte immune response in patients with recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) peptide vaccine (PSA-3A; PSA: 154-163 [155L]) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of this vaccine in these patients. II. Determine the effect of this vaccine on serum PSA level in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) peptide vaccine (PSA-3A; PSA: 154-163 [155L]) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously once in weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 18 in the absence of disease progression* or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *A rise in PSA alone is not considered disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
