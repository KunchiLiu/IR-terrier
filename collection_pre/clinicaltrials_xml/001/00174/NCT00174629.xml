	<criteria>Patients must be/have: histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, large cells or adenocarcinoma; it is recommended to provide the full paraffinembedded block or at least 5 5 sections obtained from the primary tumor, recurrence or metastasis, not stained, fixed in formalin/embedded in paraffin, mounted on slides (10 micron sections), as well as two serum samples in two 10ml tubes and two blood samples (see appendix X); unresectable metastatic (stage IV or IIIB malignant pleural effusion) NSCLC; WHO performance status &lt; 2; Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal functions, assessed during the previous 14 days, that should be shown by the following characteristics: hemoglobin &gt; or = 10g/dl and no blood cell transfusion within the previous 2 weeks; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 2.0 10^9 cells/l; platelet count &gt; or = 100.10^9 cells/l; no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or abnormal bone marrow reserve; creatinine &lt; or = 1.5 x UNL or creatinine clearance &gt; or = 60 ml/min (real or calculated); total bilirubin &lt; or = UNL; ASAT (SGOT) and/or ALAT (SGPT) &lt; or = 1.5 x UNL; alkaline phosphatases &lt; or = 5 x UNL; serum calcium &lt; or = 1.1 x UNL; at least one measurable lesion; previous surgery intervention (more than 30 days before inclusion in the study) is allowed but metastatic disease must be demonstrated; previous radiotherapy is allowed if: less or equal to 10% of bone marrow has been irradiated end of radiotherapy 21 days or more prior to inclusion in the study; patient has fully recovered from all toxic effects; at least one of the measurable target lesions for evaluation of tumor response has not been irradiated; the patient must be accessible for treatment and followup. The patient entered into this trial must be treated and followed up at the participating center; life expectancy &gt; or = 12 weeks; The initial diagnostic procedures should be performed during the 4 weeks prior to the randomization. pregnant or lactating women (women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception); prior systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy for NSCLC, even as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy; prior malignancies, except cured nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with nonevidence of disease for at least 5 years; history or clinical symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases; current peripheral neuropathy and neurohearing &gt; or = NCICCTG grade 2 except if due to trauma; other serious illness or medical condition, including: congestive heart disease; prior myocardial infarction within 6 months; history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders that would inhibit their understanding and giving of informed consent; infection requiring I.V. antibiotics and tuberculosis under treatment ongoing at study entry; untreated superior vena cava syndrome; active peptic ulcer; unstable diabetes mellitus or other contraindication to high dose corticotherapy such as herpes, herpes zoster, cirrhosis; hypercalcemia requiring therapy; preexisting ascitis and/or clinical significant pericardial effusion; patients whose lesion(s) are assessable only by radionuclide scan; history of allergy to drugs containing the excipient TWEEN 80Â®; concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs; participation in a clinical trial of one or more investigational agents (i.e. antibiotic) or devices within 30 days of study entry.
