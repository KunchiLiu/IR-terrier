	<brief_summary>Recent studies revealed that the ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay for gamma interferon is a specific method for contact tracing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, its use in endemic area and bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated hosts has not been proved. We hypothesize that the TB-ELISPOT assay can be a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool for active tuberculosis in clinical suspects in Taiwan.</brief_summary>
