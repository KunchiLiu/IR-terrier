	<brief_summary>This research study will assess whether AAB-001 is safe, well tolerated and effective for use in patients with Alzheimer's Disease. AAB-001 is a new drug that is not available outside this study. AAB-001 is an antibody (a type of protein usually produced by white blood cells to destroy other substances in the body). In Alzheimer's disease a protein called amyloid gathers in the brain and is thought to cause symptoms like memory loss and confusion. It is hoped that AAB-001 will attach to the amyloid protein in your brain and help your body to remove it.</brief_summary>
