	<brief_title>Long-Term Safety of Febuxostat in Subjects With Gout.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uric acid is the end product of purine degradation in humans. Hyperuricemia, a urate concentration in serum exceeding the limit of urate solubility (approximately 7.0 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]), is a common biochemical abnormality. Aberrations in any of the multiple mechanisms involved in the production and/or excretion of uric acid may increase serum urate concentrations, with persistent hyperuricemia as a marker for extracellular fluid monosodium urate supersaturation. As such, hyperuricemia is a necessary (but often not sufficient) risk factor for monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues and is the fundamental pathophysiological process underlying the clinical manifestations of gout, which is a chronic disease characterized by urate crystal formation and deposition in joints and bones. Gout may progress from episodic attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis to a disabling chronic disorder characterized by deforming arthropathy; destructive deposits of urate crystals (tophi) in bones, joints, and other organs; structural and functional renal impairment due to interstitial urate crystal deposition; and urinary tract stones composed entirely or in part of uric acid crystals. Management of gout requires chronic treatment aimed at lowering serum urate into a subsaturating range (usually &lt;6.0 mg/dL) in which crystal formation and deposition are prevented or reversed. Febuxostat (TMX-67) is a non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor being developed as an orally administered agent for management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Subjects who want to participate in this study will have successfully completed study TMX-00-004 (NCT00174967). All participants will initially receive an 80 mg dose. Dose titrations will occur in order to obtain and maintain clinically acceptable serum urate levels.</detailed_description>
