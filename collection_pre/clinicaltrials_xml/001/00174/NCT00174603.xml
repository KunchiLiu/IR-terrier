	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the mood stabilizing and antipsychotic properties of quetiapine in the treatment of depression by comparing subjects who were randomly assigned to either quetiapine monotherapy, quetiapine and citalopram; or haloperidol and citalopram. We hypothesize that quetiapine monotherapy would have similar effects to the combination of a first generation antipsychotic plus an antidepressant for the treatment of a major depressive episode with psychosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thus, current practice for treating psychotic depression is to combine an antidepressant with an antipsychotic. However, there are limitations to this approach. The rate of response is still lower than in other forms of major depression (Janicak et al., 2001). The rate of noncompliance is higher in this group; and the incidence of adverse effects related to the antipsychotic is increased (Janicak et al., 2001). As a result, studies have examined alternative treatments. The present study proposes to examine quetiapine's antipsychotic and mood stabilizing properties for the treatment of a major depressive disorder with psychotic features Subjects will be randomized to either quetipine monotherapy, quetiapine and citalopram; or haloperidol and citalopram.</detailed_description>
