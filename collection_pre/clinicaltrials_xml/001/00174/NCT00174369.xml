	<brief_summary>MEK is a critical member of the MAPK pathway involved in growth and survival of cancer cells. PD-325901 is a new drug designed to block this pathway and kill cancer cells. The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of PD-325901 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. PD-325901 will be given by mouth as a pill twice a day, CT scans will be done and biopsies of a tumor and a blood sample will be taken before treatment to examine the how genes affect tumor response to the study medication. Blood samples will be taken to measure the amount of drug in the blood.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEK Inhibitor PD-325901 To Treat Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was terminated prematurely on 23 March 2007 due to safety issues (ocular and neurological toxicity observed in another PD-0325901 study, A4581001) as well as lack of objective responses</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastases (Stage IV or recurrent disease) or locally advanced (Stage IIIB) with malignant pleural effusion with no expectation of further effects of prior anticancer therapy, and resolution of all acute toxic effects Adequate renal, liver, and bone marrow function, determined within 2 weeks prior to the first treatment and an ECOG status of &lt;=1.
