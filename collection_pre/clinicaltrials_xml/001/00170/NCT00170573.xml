	<brief_summary>Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) formulation has been approved for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Toxic skin reactions were reported as being the dose-limiting toxicity and have an impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). The primary aim of this study was to optimise the toxicity profile by choosing a biweekly schedule of PLD Furthermore, QoL was investigated. Secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the response rates of this new regimen.</brief_summary>
