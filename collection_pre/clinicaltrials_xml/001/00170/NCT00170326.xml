	<detailed_description>The interventricular synchrony is one of the components of a proper cardiac function. When there is no synchrony -as in left bundle block (LBBB)- the clinic consequences should have little importance in patients with a healthy heart or a great importance in patients suffering heart failure (HF), specially in those with severe grade of HF, the benefit of cardiac resynchronization by pacing both ventricles or left ventricle (LV)should means healthy improvement in patients. All previous studies done in HF, are in patients with symptomatic HF. The importance of stop progression of latent HF in patients with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction (VD)in permanent pacing indication patients. Pacing may accelerate HF progression by dissincronyzing ventricles. ACE inhibitors studies in asymptomatic VD gave positive results. The PreVent-HF is an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded pilot trial specifically designed to evaluate as main objective the progression of VD in permanent pacing population.</detailed_description>
