	<brief_title>Intervention for Male STDs in India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>India has the second highest number of HIV infections of any country in the world, and the epidemic continues unabated. This trial is focused on high risk men attending public STI clinics. A proposed 2 and a half year study, this trial will utilize the continuation of a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention compared to HIV C&amp;T and STI treatment alone targeting HIV uninfected male STI patients. The specific aims are to complete the current behavioral intervention trial and to expand the current investigations to include: the evaluation of men who have sex with men as well as women and evaluate the use of alcohol to the entire sample of recruited men. STI patients will be recruited from three sites and if randomized will agree to a 12 month participation commitment. Strategies employed in both arms of the trial are simple and the fundamental components of an HIV prevention strategy. By demonstrating their effectiveness in India the hope is to encourage the public health leadership to adopt them and continue to change drug treatment availability.</detailed_description>
