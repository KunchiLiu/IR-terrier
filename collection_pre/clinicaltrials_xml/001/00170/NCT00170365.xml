	<brief_title>Restorative Yoga for Stress Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a perceived benefit from adding a restorative yoga class as a method of stress reduction for the HFA Addiction Medicine Clinic staff. Working in a busy clinic can be very stressful. While it is not always possible to completely eliminate stress from our lives, it is known that stress reduction techniques help to diminish the negative consequences of stress. This study was designed to answer the following question "How much change in perceived stress is obtained through weekly Restorative Yoga sessions?" Study population were members of the HFA Addiction Medicine Clinic. All staff completed the Spielberger Job Stress Survey and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at baseline and at six months following intervention onset. Volunteers from the Addiction Medicine Clinic attended weekly restorative yoga sessions 45 minutes in length held over the noon hour. Serial State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and weekly questionnaire regarding the perceived effects of the restorative yoga on aspects fo patient care were completed by study volunteers.</detailed_description>
