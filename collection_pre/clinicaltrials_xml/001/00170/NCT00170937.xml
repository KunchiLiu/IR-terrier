	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is a classification for patients with a constellation of risk factors which may include abdominal obesity, hypertension, elevated blood lipids and sugar. Three or more of these factors together constitute the metabolic syndrome and place these patients at a greater risk for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study is to determine whether two common drugs to lower blood pressure, whether used separately or in combination, have different effects on blood sugar levels in patients diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
