	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients with acute musculoskeletal pain following an uncomplicated soft tissue injury (within the last 72 hours) which is expected to be selflimiting, requiring shortterm treatment with a NSAID. Patients’ acute musculoskeletal pain at baseline must be ≥ 50 mm on a 0 – 100 mm on a Visual Analogue Scale. Patients may have taken analgesic therapy following injury. However, the baseline pain intensity assessment should be taken: (i) 4 hours after the last dose of ≤ 400 mg ibuprofen, ≤ 1000 mg paracetamol, ≤ 600 mg aspirin or ≤ 2 tablets of other overthecounter analgesic aspirinbased or paracetamolbased combination medications (ii) or 8 hours after the last dose of &gt; 400 mg ibuprofen or ≤ 50 mg diclofenac Exclusion Criteria Patients whose pain is due to an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition e.g. osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.
