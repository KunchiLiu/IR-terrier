	<brief_summary>The Medtronic InSync III Marquis Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D)-System (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with biventricular stimulation for cardiac resynchronization) is equipped with the "Conducted-Atrial Fibrillation (AF)-Response-Algorithm (CAFR)". This algorithm is designed to maximize biventricular stimulation and thus the amount of cardiac resynchronization when atrial fibrillation occurs. The goal of the study is the evaluation of the effect of the CAFR in CRT-patients suffering from atrial fibrillation by quantification of the increase of biventricular pacing during atrial fibrillation caused by CAFR as well as the influence of the CAFR on the ventricular heart rate.</brief_summary>
