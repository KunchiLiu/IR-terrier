	<brief_title>The Use of Low Molecular Weight Heparin in Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolic (VTE) prophylaxis in trauma patients is a critical clinical problem. Patients with traumatic brain injury usually have effective VTE prophylaxis withheld secondary to concerns of exacerbating intracranial hemorrhage. This study examines the safety and efficacy of early administration (within 24 hrs of admission) of low molecular weight heparin to this patient population with very high VTE risk.</detailed_description>
