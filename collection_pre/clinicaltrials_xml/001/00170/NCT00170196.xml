	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of addition of corticosteroid therapy to antibiotics in patient admitted with Community-acquired pneumonia. The hypothesis is: Prednisolone in combination with antibiotic treatments is effective in improving clinical outcome in patients hospitalized with CAP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Studies of Corticosteroid Therapy in Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a acute illness with a considerable morbidity and mortality, especially patients with severe CAP. In the past decennia, in spite of many investigations, little reduction is seen in morbidity an mortality. Corticosteroids have a immune-modulation effect, which is not completely elucidated. Most likely the immune modulation effect is due to down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The use of corticosteroids next to antibiotics in CAP could lead to shorter time to clinical stability, length of stay and costs. Comparison: Hospitalized patients with CAP treated with antibiotics and prednisolone versus hospitalized patients with cap treated with antibiotics and placebo</detailed_description>
