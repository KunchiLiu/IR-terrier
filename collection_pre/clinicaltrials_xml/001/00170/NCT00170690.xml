	<brief_title>Preference Study With Elderly Patients Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 60% of all cancer diseases appear to people aged 65 years and older. Ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of death among gynaecological malignant tumours. Since the highest carcinoma incidence is between the 60th and 70th year more women will come down with ovarian cancer because of increased life expectancy. At least 65% of patients with FIGO stage III/IV will exhibit a relapse or progress after first-line therapy. In most studies the age of the patients is limited to 65 years. It could be shown that especially elder patients often receive an inadequate operative and cytostatic therapy resulting in a worse prognosis. Patients aged 70 years or elder who will be treated with treosulfan, given oral or intravenous, shall be compared regarding the patient compliance, toxicity especially hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity grade 3-4 (CTC NCI), overall survival, progression free survival, quality of life.</detailed_description>
