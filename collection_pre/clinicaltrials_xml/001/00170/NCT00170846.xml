	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate whether the initiation of everolimus together with the reduction or discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) will improve graft function in the maintenance of renal transplant recipients with renal impairment by reducing the progression of chronic allograft nephropathy. The development of atherosclerosis in the native arteries of the patients will also be explored.</brief_summary>
