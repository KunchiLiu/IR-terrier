	<criteria>At least 55 years of age. Previously untreated or treated hypertension. For patients &gt;= 60 years, evidence of at least one CV disease or target organ damage, or for patients 5559 years evidence of at least two CV diseases or target organ damage from two different organ systems as defined in the protocol. Allergy to any of the drugs administered in this trial. Current angina pectoris (ie, no anginal event requiring NTG within 1 month prior to Visit 1). Secondary hypertension. Refractory hypertension defined as SBP &gt;= 180 mmHg and/or DBP &gt;= 110 mmHg unresponsive to tripledrug regimens of sympatholytics, diuretics and vasodilators. History of symptomatic heart failure (NYHA classes IIIV) or ejection fraction &lt; 40%. Myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization (CABG or PCI), unstable angina within one month of Visit 1. Stroke or transient ischemic event (TIA) within 3 months of Visit 1. Significant obstructive valvular cardiovascular disease or any valvular disease expected to lead to surgery during the course of the study. Evidence of hepatic disease (AST or ALT values &gt;= 2 X upper limit of normal). Impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;= 2.5 mg/dL (221 µmol/L)). Baseline serum potassium of &gt; 5.2 meq/L not on potassium supplements. History of malignancy including leukemia and lymphoma (but not basal cell skin cancer) within the last 5 years. History of clinically significant auto immune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Significant noncardiovascular illness or condition likely to result in death prior to trial completion, e.g., major organ transplant (life expectancy &lt;5 years). Significant cardiovascular disease such as an aortic aneurysm ≥ 6 cm, likely requiring surgical intervention during the course of the study. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria applied to the study.</criteria>
