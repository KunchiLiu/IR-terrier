	<brief_summary>Synchronism of gas flow delivered by the ventilator and muscular effort of the patient will be studied during two kinds of ventilation. The first one is the proportional assisted ventilation during which the gas flow is theoretically adapted to the patient's muscular effort within the breath. The second is the pressure support ventilation during which the gas flow is delivered to maintain the inspiratory pressure stable. The hypothesis is that the first mode allows a better synchronism.</brief_summary>
