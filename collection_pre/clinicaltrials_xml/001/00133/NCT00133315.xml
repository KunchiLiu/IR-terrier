	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to establish a Danish cohort of spondylarthropathy (SpA) patients who are being treated with TNFalfa blockers. By following the TNFalfa blocking treated patients the researchers want to identify better biomarkers for disease activity and disease progression. In addition, the researchers want to identify predictors for disease progression.</brief_summary>
