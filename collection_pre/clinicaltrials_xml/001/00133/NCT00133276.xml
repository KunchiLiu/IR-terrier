	<brief_summary>The treatment of chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon and ribavirin is highly effective but is hampered by peginterferon-induced psychopathology. Prevention of peginterferon-induced psychopathology with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) (paroxetine) has been shown to be effective in patients treated with interferon for malignant disease. The aim is to study the effects of prophylactic treatment with escitalopram (another SSRI) on peginterferon-associated psychopathology in patients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment of chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon and ribavirin is highly effective but is hampered by peginterferon-induced psychopathology. Prevention of peginterferon-induced psychopathology with SSRI's (paroxetine) has been shown to be effective in patients treated with interferon for malignant disease. The aim is to study the effects of prophylactic treatment with escitalopram on peginterferon-associated psychopathology in patients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. Design: double blind, randomized controlled trial with two arms, maximum 40 patients per arm. Patients, starting with peginterferon and ribavirin, will be randomized to receive escitalopram therapy 10 mg per day (however, 5 mg in the first two weeks) or placebo. Study population and selection: eighty patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys 180 microgram) and ribavirin (Copegus 400 mg twice daily) will be included in the study. Aims of the study: 1. to asses whether prophylactic treatment with escitalopram avoids significantly the occurrence of peginterferon-induced psychiatric disturbance; defined as an increase of two points on observer-based rating scales reflecting anxiety (BAS:BriefAnxietyScale), loss of concentration, depression and loss of impulse control (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale: MADRS), and 2. to assess the frequency of major depression according to DSM IV criteria, in the escitalopram and placebo-treated patients.</detailed_description>
