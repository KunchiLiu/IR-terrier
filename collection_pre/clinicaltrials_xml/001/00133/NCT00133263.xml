	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Standardized Bereavement Intervention in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nowadays there is little evidence about what is the best bereavement intervention in primary care and each family physician (FP) assists bereaved people in a different way. The death of a loved one is the most stressful life event that can face a person; in fact, bereavement is associated with an increased risk of depression, generalized anxiety and panic disorder, alcohol abuse and use of medications, sudden cardiac events, suicide, and an increased demand for health resources. The FP is the only specialist who -through his position in the health system and in the community- can give emotional support to the bereaved and simultaneously deal with the health problems associated with the process. In response to this, our work group has designed a guide specifically for FP: Primary Bereavement Care (PBC), and is currently testing its efficacy in a randomized controlled study. Comparison (s): Recently widows attended by FP trained in PBC through seven PBC sessions, compared to recently widows attended by FP not trained in PBC through seven "ordinary" sessions.</detailed_description>
