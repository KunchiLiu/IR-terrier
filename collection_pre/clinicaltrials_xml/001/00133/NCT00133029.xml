	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration for cesarean section (immediate preoperative versus intraoperative administration) impacts the rate of postoperative febrile morbidity. The specific aim of the project is to test the hypothesis that preoperative antibiotic administration will decrease the rate of composite postoperative febrile morbidity.</brief_summary>
