	<brief_title>Study to Improve the Treatment of Epilepsy (SITE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background. The aim of the treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is to achieve seizure freedom without causing side effects. Assessment of side effects is difficult. They may start insidiously, the patient may not associate certain complaints with the use of AEDs, or the treating physician does not take enough time to discuss this topic during the limited time of a visit in the outpatient department. We know from clinical trials that side effects occur in a substantial group of patients. We do not know whether we deal with this possible complication in an adequate way in clinical practice. Study objective. To study whether adjustment of medication will reduce the occurrence of side effects and improve quality of life. Study design. A randomised clinical trial comparing adjustment of treatment in case of relevant side effects to continuing treatment unchanged. Relevant side effects are defined as at least one moderate or serious problem scored on a questionnaire to assess complaints in people with epilepsy. Patients who do not report relevant side effects will be followed for 13 months (arm A) in which two visits are scheduled, after 7 and 13 months respectively. The patients who do report relevant side effects will be randomised to either discussion of the questionnaire results and adjustment of treatment if appropriate (arm B) or to ignore the results of the questionnaire and continue treatment unchanged (arm C). Investigations will be repeated in both groups after 7 and 13 months after the initial visit.</detailed_description>
