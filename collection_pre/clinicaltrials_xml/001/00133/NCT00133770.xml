	<brief_title>Intravenous (IV) Pantoprazole in Erosive Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disease that affects 20-50% of adults in Western Countries. The disease can be divided into three clinical categories: nonerosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD), and Barrett's esophagus. Intravenous (IV) infusion produces a faster and steadier acid suppression than an oral regimen. Furthermore, some patients with severe erosive esophagitis cannot take pills by mouth and will benefit from an IV formulation. Recently, we observed healing of severe erosive esophagitis with continuous IV pantoprazole in several patients in 3 days. The safety of IV pantoprazole has been demonstrated in patients with GERD, with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or bleeding ulcer. This study is to define the safety and efficacy of continuous IV pantoprazole in the treatment of severe erosive esophagitis. Comparison: The continuous IV pantoprazole compared to the once a day IV pantoprazole for 72 hours in the treatment of severe erosive esophagitis.</detailed_description>
