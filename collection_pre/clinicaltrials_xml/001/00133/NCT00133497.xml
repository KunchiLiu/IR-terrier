	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of and the body's response to an experimental cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (called gB/MF59 vaccine). Participants will include approximately 400 healthy females, ages 12-17, recruited from adolescent clinics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Participants will receive 3 doses of vaccine or placebo (saltwater) on a 0, 1, and 6 month schedule. Study procedures will include blood and urine samples. Participants will complete a diary recording temperatures and any side effects experienced. Subjects will be involved in study related procedures for up to 31 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>gB/MF59 Vaccine in Preventing Cytomegalovirus Infection in Healthy Adolescent Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of the cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (gB)/MF59 vaccine in preventing systemic cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) in healthy adolescent females. The study interventions include: intramuscular (IM) injection of the investigational vaccine, CMV gB)/microfluidized adjuvant 59 (MF59), delivered as 20 micrograms in 0.5 mL of vaccine or IM injection of 0.5 mL of saline placebo. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive vaccine or saline placebo. The primary efficacy objective is to assess whether injection with 3 doses of the CMV gB/MF59 vaccine will reduce the acquisition of a systemic CMV infection in healthy CMV-seronegative adolescent females. This will be accomplished by comparing the rates of acquisition of systemic CMV infection, defined as detection of CMV in the urine or blood, between the placebo and CMV vaccine recipients beginning 1 month after the third dose of vaccine. The primary safety objective is to assess the local and systemic effects of immunization and adverse events (AE) with the CMV gB/MF59 vaccine when administered to female adolescents on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. This will be assessed by comparing the rates of specific local and systemic reactogenicity events and AEs between the vaccine and placebo groups. The endpoint for this trial will be a systemic infection, which will be defined as identification of CMV from the urine (chosen because it is the most common site for isolation of CMV) or blood (chosen because it is the most likely route by which CMV reaches the fetus). Approximately 2400 healthy females, age 12 to 17 years (at time of initial enrollment) will be recruited in order to obtain approximately 400 CMV-seronegative subjects for the vaccine trial. Collection of sera will occur at Screening, Study Day 0, Month 6, Month 7 and every 3 months after Month 7. Collection of urine will occur at Study Day 0, Month 1, Month 2, Month 6, Month 7 and every 3 months after Month 7. Safety/reactogenicity monitoring will consist of solicited signs and symptoms self-reported by memory aid on the day of vaccination and for 6 follow-up days. Unsolicited symptoms will be collected for the 30-day period (± 2 days) after each vaccination and followed to adequate resolution or stabilization. The study duration for each subject will be 31 months: 7 months on the study with 24 months of follow-up beginning 1 month after the last injection. There will be 14 scheduled visits. This study is linked to DMID protocol 06-0043.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject Inclusion Criteria (Screening): Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed assent prior to study enrollment; parent(s) or legal guardian must provide written informed consent prior to study enrollment. Subjects must be female and be 12 to 17 years at time of screening. Subjects must be willing to consider participation in the experimental cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine portion of the study which is 31months in duration and must not be planning to relocate from the study area. Subjects must be using or willing to consider using effective methods of birth control. This includes abstinence or if sexually active using an effective method of birth control (e.g., oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive jelly; cream or foam; intrauterine contraceptive device; DepoProvera®; skin patch; vaginal ring or cervical cap) for 30 days prior to vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for 3 months after completion of the vaccination series. Subjects who are of childbearing potential must be willing to have a urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours before vaccination. The results will need to be negative to enroll in the vaccine study. Subject's inclusion criteria (vaccine): Subject is willing and able to provide written informed assent prior to study enrollment; parent(s) or legal guardian provides written informed consent prior to study enrollment. Subject is female and 12 to 17 years at time of screening. Subject is available for the 31month duration of the study (7 months on the study and 24 months of followup beginning 1 month after the last injection) and is not planning to relocate from the study area. Subject must agree to practice abstinence, or if sexually active must be using an effective method of birth control (e.g., oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive jelly; cream or foam; intrauterine contraceptive device; DepoProvera®; skin patch; vaginal ring or cervical cap) for 30 days prior to vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for 3 months after completion of the vaccination series. Subject of child bearing potential has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours of vaccination. Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the memory aid, return for followup visits, accessible by phone and not planning on moving from the study area). Subject Inclusion Criteria (Shedding): Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed assent prior to study enrollment; parent(s) or legal guardian must provide written informed consent prior to study enrollment. Subject is positive for antibodies to CMV detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial CMV antibody assay screen.
