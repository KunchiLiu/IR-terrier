	<brief_title>Vasoconstrictors as Alternatives to Albumin After Large-Volume Paracentesis (LVP) in Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial compares the effect of a combination of vasoconstrictors (octreotide plus midodrine) to albumin on the time to recurrence of ascites in patients with refractory ascites treated with large volume paracentesis. The treatment allocation ratio for the two treatment arms is 1:1 using a stratified random permuted block design. Subjects are patients 18-80 years old with cirrhosis and ascites who are stratified according to the presence or absence of renal dysfunction at the time of randomization. Measurements include blood pressure, weight, girth, abdominal ultrasound, forearm blood flow, plasma renin activity, angiotensin, and aldosterone, repeated during a 6 month period.</detailed_description>
