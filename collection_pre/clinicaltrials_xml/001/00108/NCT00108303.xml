	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia has long been known to be an illness with significant evidence for a genetic predisposition. The purpose of this study is to determine the genetic abnormalities that cause childhood and adult onset schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Research in Schizophrenia Using DNA Markers and Clinical Phenotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is known from genetic linkage and gene expression studies that the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor gene is abnormally expressed in people with schizophrenia. The immediate objectives of this proposal support the long-term objectives of a comprehensive description of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and new drug treatments by carefully defining the physiological genotype-phenotype relationship for a single candidate gene. Subjects and family members with a mental illness or who appear to have a mental illness will be asked to undergo an interview, perform some mental tests and have a blood, urine, and saliva sample taken one time.</detailed_description>
