	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Treatments for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Sleep Disturbance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive, stereotypical nightmares and insomnia commonly characterize post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms of disrupted sleep in PTSD has therefore assumed considerable clinical importance. We previously reported an increase in rapid eye movement activity (REM activity) during REM sleep (REMS) in Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD, and this finding can be seen as consistent with the view that most, although not all, dreaming occurs during REMS and the repeated observation that REM activity correlates with the intensity of dream mentation. There is a growing body of evidence that post-traumatic nightmares can respond to psychological treatment interventions. Namely, a cognitive-behavioral technique entitled imagery rehearsal (IR) has been reported to be effective in the treatment of such nightmares in victims of crime and in women who have been sexually assaulted. In a small pilot study, it has also been reported to be effective in the treatment of Vietnam veterans with combat-related PTSD. The two objectives of this proposal are: 1. To compare, in a study with random assignment and a parallel group design, the effectiveness in controlling the subjective sleep disturbance in veterans with PTSD of IR and Sleep and Nightmare Management (SN), a psychological treatment that targets life stressors and problems with sleep hygiene that may exacerbate insomnia and nightmares. 2. In a subset of these subjects, to compare the effectiveness in reducing REM activity of IR and SN.</detailed_description>
