	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies paclitaxel to see how well it works compared to polyglutamate paclitaxel or observation only in treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial, peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and polyglutamate paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Paclitaxel and polyglutamate paclitaxel may also stop the growth of ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Sometimes, after treatment, the tumor may not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective than polyglutamate paclitaxel or observation only in treating ovarian epithelial, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Polyglutamate Paclitaxel, or Observation in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial, Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether CT-2103 (polyglutamate paclitaxel) or paclitaxel, administered to women with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who have attained a clinically-defined complete response to primary platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy ("consolidation/maintenance therapy") will reduce the death rate, compared to re-treatment at the time of documented disease progression. II. To determine if, in this clinical setting, CT-2103 produces a more favorable toxicity profile (with a particular focus on peripheral neuropathy as measured by the Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG] NTX4) and superior quality-of-life (as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian [FACT-O]), compared to paclitaxel. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the relationship between expression of several of the angiogenic markers and overall survival or progression-free survival in patients randomized to CT-2103, paclitaxel, or no treatment. II. To assess the association among the various tissue and serum markers of angiogenesis, and compare the ability of different combinations of these markers to predict patient outcome including overall survival and progression-free survival in patients randomized to CT-2103, paclitaxel, or no treatment. III. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research and evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. ARM III: Patients receive no further anticancer treatment until evidence of disease progression. In arms I and II, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 10 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a histologic diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma, or stage III or IV epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma, with either optimal (=&lt; 1 cm residual disease) or suboptimal residual disease following initial surgery; all patients must have had appropriate surgery for ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation to confirm diagnosis and stage Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: Serous adenocarcinoma Endometrioid adenocarcinoma Mucinous adenocarcinoma Undifferentiated carcinoma Clear cell adenocarcinoma Mixed epithelial carcinoma Transitional cell carcinoma Malignant Brenner tumor Adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) Patients must have completed treatment within the past 12 weeks with at least 5 cycles and not more than 8 cycles of a platinum (IV or intraperitoneal [IP]) and paclitaxel or docetaxelbased combination chemotherapy and have no symptoms suggestive of persistent cancer, normal (no evidence of cancer) computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and normal cancer antigen 125 (CA125) following this therapy Patients treated with neoadjuvant platinumtaxane chemotherapy for a presumptive diagnosis of stage III or IV epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or, fallopian tube (by paracentesis, percutaneous biopsy or open biopsy) are eligible provided that they have undergone interval abdominal surgery after at least one but no more than six cycles of standard chemotherapy; such surgery must meet the same criteria as for those undergoing up front surgery, including tissue diagnosis for confirmation of primary tumor site and stage III or IV disease; also, patients must have received at least two cycles after interval abdominal surgery Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ul, equivalent to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE version [v]3.0) grade 1 Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/ul Creatinine =&lt;
