	<brief_title>Linezolid in the Treatment of Hemodialysis Patients With Catheter-Related Gram-Positive Bloodstream Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pfizer suspended enrollment on 21 August 2006 as a precautionary measure in light of the mortality imbalance seen in a similar study, and terminated the study on April 6, 2007 due to factors affecting the timeline to completion, such as slow enrollment and inclusion of sufficient evaluable subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To be eligible for this study, a patient must provide informed consent and must meet all of the following criteria. No study procedures, including any baseline tests, should be performed until the patient (or parent/legally acceptable representative, if appropriate) legally signs the informed consent form. Male or female, 18 years of age or older and &gt;= 40 kg body weight Endstage renal disease patients on hemodialysis with: A) Signs and symptoms of a localized catheterrelated infection (eg tenderness and/or pain, erythema, swelling, purulent exudates within 2 cm of entry site); OR B) A body temperature of &gt;= 38.0 C or &lt; 36.0 C (oral equivalent); OR C) A Grampositive blood culture. If the Grampositive isolate is S. aureus, it must be cultured from at least 1 culture bottle from either the peripheral set or the catheter set of culture bottles. For all other Grampositive pathogens (eg, coagulasenegative staphylococci), isolates need to be cultured from at least 2 culture bottles of which one must be from the peripheral set. There must be no other obvious source of the bacteremia Presence of at least one of the following systemic signs of infection (may be obtained up to 24 hours prior to baseline): *Hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or its reduction by &gt;= 40 mmHg from the patient's baseline, in the absence of other causes for hypotension; *Tachycardia defined as a pulse rate &gt; 90 beats per minute; *Tachypnea defined as a respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths per minute or PACO2 &lt;32 torr; *White blood count &gt;10,000 cells/mm3 or &lt; 4,000 cells/mm3, or with a differential count showing &gt;10% band neutrophil forms. Patients on hemodialysis with tunneled or nontunneled catheters including antibiotic coated hemodialysis catheters. Patients may have more than one concurrent catheter. Patients who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures Patients presenting with any of the following will not be included in this study: Catheterrelated bloodstream infections caused by Gramnegative bacteria, fungi, mixed cultures of Gram negative bacteria and Gram positive bacteria or mixed cultures of Gram positive/negative bacteria and fungi Patients with evidence of other infections resulting in bacteremia, such as clinical or radiographic signs of osteomyelitis, endocarditis, skin/skin structure infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, joint infection, intraabdominal infection, septic thrombophlebitis or other infection Patients in whom the infected catheter cannot be removed Patients with permanent intravascular devices such as artificial vascular grafts, implantable pacemakers or defibrillators; intraaortic balloon pumps, and left ventricular assist device; intravascular transplants such as prosthetic cardiac valves; or nonintravascular devices such as peritoneal dialysis catheters; or neurosurgical devices such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, intracranial pressure monitors, or epidural catheters, prosthetic cardiac valves, prosthetic vascular grafts, or other internal prosthesis Females of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to take adequate contraceptive precautions, have a positive pregnancy result within 24 hours prior to study entry, are known to be pregnant, or are currently breastfeeding an infant Identification of a pathogen resistant to linezolid or vancomycin Patients who are unlikely to survive through the treatment period and evaluation Administration of a glycopeptide antibiotic within 5 days prior to enrollment. Administration of other potentially effective systemic Grampositive antibiotics for more than 48 hours within 72 hours prior to enrollment unless the pathogen showed drug resistance Previous enrollment in this protocol Hypersensitivity to linezolid, vancomycin, gentamicin or one of their excipients (or aztreonam if nonbacteremic Gramnegative coverage is required) Concurrent use of another investigational medication or use within 30 days of study entry Patients with pressor and fluidresistant hemodynamic compromise or pulmonary embolism</criteria>
