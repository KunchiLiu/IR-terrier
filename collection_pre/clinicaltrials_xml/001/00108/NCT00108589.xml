	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of S-adenosylmethionine therapy in those patients with non-alcoholic liver disease in the form of steatohepatitis (NASH). This will be accomplished by development of a database of these patients, all of whom will have biopsy documented NASH. A placebo controlled trial will then examine the effect of S-adenosylmethionine over time on clinical outcome in these patients. It is expected that this agent will slow or halt the progression of this disease.</brief_summary>
