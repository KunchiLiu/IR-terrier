	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of interferon and ribavirin combination therapy in people with Hepatitis C. The specific aims are: - To assess how often depressive symptoms occur in patients taking combination alpha interferon plus ribavirin or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy for Hepatitis C, when depressive symptoms occur, and how severe the depressive symptoms are when they do occur; - To identify potential predictors for the development of depressive symptoms; - To identify if citalopram, an antidepressant medication, can prevent or lessen the severity of depressive symptoms brought about by interferon therapy.</brief_summary>
