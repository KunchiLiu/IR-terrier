	<brief_summary>This proposal evaluates cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition as a means to decrease T regulatory cell activities and thus augment immune responses against lung cancer. The broad goal focuses on understanding how COX-2 expression regulates the malignant phenotype in non small cell lung cancer in an effort to foster an informed approach for the use of COX-2 inhibitors in prevention and therapy for lung cancer.</brief_summary>
