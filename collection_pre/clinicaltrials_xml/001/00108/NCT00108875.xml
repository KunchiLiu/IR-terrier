	<brief_title>Survivin Peptide Vaccination for Patients With Advanced Melanoma, Pancreatic, Colon and Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As prognosis of advanced melanoma, pancreatic, colon and cervical cancer remains gloomy, new therapeutic modalities have to be developed to improve the patientÂ´s clinical outcome. Immunotherapy, which targets tumor associated antigens of tumor cells or tumor stroma, is currently an intensively investigated, novel therapeutic option. As survivin is expressed both by neoplastic cells as well as by endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature, this antigen is an intriguing target molecule. Spontaneous cytotoxic T-cell responses against different survivin epitopes in cancer patients underline the relevance of survivin-directed immunological trials. This study is comprised of a peptide vaccine with HLA-A1, -A2 and -B35 restricted survivin epitopes in Montanide ISA-51 for patients with stage IV melanoma, advanced pancreatic, colon and cervical carcinoma. The vaccine is applicated as a deep subcutaneous injection. Vaccination is administered for the first 2 months weekly, afterwards every 4 weeks. Standard staging examinations are performed every three months. Clinical, laboratory and immunological monitoring is done every month.Diagnostic leucapheresis is performed before first vaccination and afterwards every 2 months.</detailed_description>
