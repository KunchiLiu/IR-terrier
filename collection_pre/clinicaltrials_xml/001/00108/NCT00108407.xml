	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Types of Psychotherapy for Treating Depression and Substance Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is the most frequent co-occuring mental health disorder among adults with substance use disorders, and such comorbidity is often associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Although there is an urgent need for effective treatments specific for dual-diagnosis adults, few studies have been conducted to address this need. Comparison: This study will compare substance use and depression symptoms of individuals in two different psychotherapy groups: Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Twelve Step Facilitation Therapy. Symptoms and substance use will be compared during the active treatment phase (24 weeks) and for one year following the end of the active treatment.</detailed_description>
