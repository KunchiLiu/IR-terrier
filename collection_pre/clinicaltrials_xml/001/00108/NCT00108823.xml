Availability of a chest xray dated a maximum of 6 months prior to study baseline visit (B0) or a willingness to have a chest xray performed at visit (B0). Main COPD exacerbation indicated by a treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids not stopped at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit (B0) Non smoker, current smoker or exsmoker (smoking cessation at least one year ago) with a smoking history of &lt; 10 pack years Suffering from any concomitant disease that might interfere with study procedures or evaluation Lower respiratory tract infection not resolved 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit (B0) Diagnosis of asthma and/or other relevant lung disease (e.g. history of bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis, lung resection, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease [e.g. fibrosis, silicosis, sarcoidosis], and active tuberculosis) Current participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or completion of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 2 months preceding the baseline visit (B0). Known alpha1antitrypsin deficiency Need for long term oxygen therapy defined as ≥ 15 hours/day Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values suggesting an unknown disease and requiring further clinical evaluation (as assessed by the investigator) Known infection with HIV, active hepatitis and/or liver insufficiency Diagnosis or history of cancer (other than basal cell carcinoma) or recurrence within 5 years prior to study start Clinically significant cardiopulmonary abnormalities (diagnosed clinically or by xray/ECG) that are not related to COPD and that require further evaluation Pregnancy, breast feeding, oocyte donation or oocyte implantation planned during the trial The female patient is of childbearing potential and is not using and is not willing to continue to use a medically reliable method of contraception for the entire study duration, such as oral, injectable, or implantable contraceptives, or intrauterine contraceptive devices, unless she is surgically sterilized/hysterectomized or postmenopausal &gt; 1 year or any other criteria considered sufficiently reliable by the investigator in individual cases Participation in another study (use of investigational product) within 30 days preceding the baseline visit (B0) or reentry of patients already enrolled in this trial Suspected inability or unwillingness to comply with study procedures Alcohol or drug abuse Inability to follow study procedures due to, for example, language problems or psychological disorders Use of prohibited drugs Suspected hypersensitivity to the study medication and/or contraindication to any ingredients of the study medication (roflumilast) or rescue medication</criteria>
