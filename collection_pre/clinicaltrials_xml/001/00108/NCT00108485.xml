	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and tolerability of Niaspan® to improve the levels of blood fats ("good" and "bad" cholesterol and triglyceride levels) in people who have kidney damage due to diabetes. A secondary goal is to test whether Niaspan® slows down further development of kidney damage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Use of Niaspan for Treatment of Dyslipidemia in Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage kidney disease in the United States. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a markedly increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and traditional risk factors such as hyperlipidemia have been shown to be of critical importance. Almost 90% of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease have lipid abnormalities. Here, we investigate whether Niaspan, taken in addition to lipid-lowering drugs referred to as "statins", will decrease LDL cholesterol and increase LDL particle size, increase HDL, reduce proteinuria, and reduce the speed of loss of renal function.</detailed_description>
