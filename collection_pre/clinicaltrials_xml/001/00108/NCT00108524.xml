	<brief_title>A Low-Carbohydrate, Ketogenic Diet Versus Orlistat for Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight and obesity are increasingly prevalent in the veteran population as well as the general public. For patients with obesity-associated illnesses, there are few effective treatment options available after failed attempts at diet and exercise, even though weight loss has been shown to alleviate these conditions. The purpose of this study is to compare the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (Atkins) with a combination of a low-fat diet and Orlistat. The outcomes examined over a 48 week duration will include body weight, risk factors for heart disease (e.g., lipid profiles), and blood sugar. This is a randomized, parallel-intervention trial. Subjects (n=150) will be recruited from the Durham VAMC Ambulatory Care Clinics. All patients receive one of the two intensive weight loss interventions.</detailed_description>
