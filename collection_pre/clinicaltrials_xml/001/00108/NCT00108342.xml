	<detailed_description>The study was designed to compare sampling of several nicotine replacement treatments (NRTs) in contrast to a computer learning control. The NRTs include: 2 dosages of nicotine gum, 2 dosages of nicotine lozenges and 2 dosages of oral nicotine inhalers. In the sampling group, each participant tries each of the 6 NRTs for 3 minutes. In the control, the individuals read about the treatments. Dependent measures include: quit attempts, use of NRTs, preferences among NRTs, and learning and motivation.</detailed_description>
