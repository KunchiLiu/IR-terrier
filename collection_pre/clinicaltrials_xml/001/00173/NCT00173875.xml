	<brief_title>Iressa as a First-Line Treatment in Chemonaive Patients With Inoperable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for anticancer therapy because it is expressed or highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC.Furthermore, high levels of EGFR expression have been associated with a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients in several studies. EGFR-targeted cancer therapies are currently being developed; strategies include inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor by small molecules such as gefitinib (Iressa [ZD1839]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE). Iressa is an orally active, selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells.</detailed_description>
