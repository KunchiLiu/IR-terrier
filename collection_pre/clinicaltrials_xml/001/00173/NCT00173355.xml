	<brief_title>Clinical Outcome of Pediatric Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue sarcoma was rarely seen in pediatric patients, and pediatric Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (PDFSP) was even rare. To our knowledge, the largest report constituted of 19 cases (five of them had no follow-up (FU) status) (1). So we proposed this retrospective study based on the cancer registry of our hospital. Twelve cases who were diagnosed as DFSP before age of 18 were identified. But all of them had been lost of FU for at least two years. So we will try to contact these patients and asked them to be back to our clinic for routine surveillance (history taking and physical exam and optional local image/chest xray) and quality of life (QoL) evaluation after pathological review if this clinical study was approved (2)</detailed_description>
