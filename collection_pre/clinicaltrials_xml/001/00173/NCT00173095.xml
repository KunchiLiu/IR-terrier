	<brief_title>The Bilirubin Levels in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to Morgan et. al. (J Neurosurg 101:1026-1029, 2004): bilirubin as a cerebrospinal fluid marker of sentinel subarachnoid hemorrhage: a preliminary report in pigs, we're going to test the hypothesis in the cerebrospinal fluid of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. We'll collect the serial cerebrospinal fluid in 15-20 spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage patients to see the time sequence of changes in bilirubin levels.</detailed_description>
