	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Ifosfamide As a Second-Line Systemic Chemotherapy for Cisplatin -Failed Advanced TCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy produces a response rate of 40-70% in TCC patients. However, only less than 10% of the patients can achieve long-term remission. Until now, there is no standard chemotherapy for cisplatin-failed TCC patients. Both gemcitabine and ifosfamide have been identified to have response rates of 20% or more in pretreated TCC patients. It is thus reasonable to combine these two active drugs as a second-line treatment for TCC. Patients enrolled must have a pathologically proven urothelial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and must have exposed to one cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for the advanced disease. GI regimen will be continued until maximal response.</detailed_description>
