	<brief_title>Influence of Assistive Device Use While Performing Dual Task in Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown the effectiveness of using ambulatory assistive devices to increase standing stability of patients with stroke in clinical practice (Maeda et al., 2001). However, literature has also suggested that manipulation of ambulatory assistive devices in dynamic motor tasks, such as walking, inevitably requires additional attention, even in healthy adults (Wright &amp; Kemp, 1992). Given that the majority of patients with stroke suffer from balance control difficulty, which subsequently increases their attentional demands associated with maintaining balance (Brown et al., 2002), it remains an important question as to whether the use of ambulatory assistive devices would take away some attentional resources that would otherwise be used for maintaining balance.</detailed_description>
