	<detailed_description>This study is to develop an IADL Scale for patients with SCI (IADL-SCI) and examine its psychometric properties in three years. In the first year, we will devote ourselves to the development of IADL-SCI – first version. About 150 patients will be recruited in this year. In the second year, the study will be focused on investigating the psychometric properties of IADL-SCI in order to construct the formal version of IADL-SCI in about 120 patients with stable condition. In the third year, we will be engaged in analyzing and comparing the psychometric properties of the three IADL scales (IADL-SCI, Frenchay Activities index, and Lawton IADL) to confirm that IADL-SCI is the best among the three. About 50 inpatients receiving rehabilitation will be recruited in this year.</detailed_description>
