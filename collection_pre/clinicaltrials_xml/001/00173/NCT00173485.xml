	<brief_summary>A progressive decline of plasma triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) concentration indicates a favorable clinical evolution during the recovery phase of sepsis. The expression of TREM-1 in dialysate of peritoneal dialysis patients was not yet documented. We will collect the dialysate of peritonitis in peritoenal dialysis patients and analyze the time serial change.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Infection and Cell Inflammation in Peritoneal Dialysate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and its expression is upregulated on phagocytic cells in the presence of bacteria or fungi (1). Several experiments by Bouchon and colleagues showed that TREM-1 mediates the acute inflammatory response to microbial products. Human tissues infected with bacteria are infiltrated with neutrophils and macrophages that express high levels of TREM-1. Conversely, TREM-1 is only weakly expressed in samples from patients with noninfectious inflammatory disorders. In addition, TREM-1 is shed from the membrane of activated phagocytes and can be found in a soluble form in body fluids. The presence of a soluble form of TREM-1 in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mechanically ventilated patients has been shown to be a good indicator of infectious pneumonia. During sepsis, a progressive decline of plasma sTREM-1 concentration indicates a favorable clinical evolution during the recovery phase of sepsis. In addition, baseline sTREM-1 level may prove useful in predicting outcome of septic patients. We will collect the dialysate of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients and analyze the time serials change.</detailed_description>
