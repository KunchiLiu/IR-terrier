	<criteria>CPR &gt; 10 min without return of spontaneous circulation CPR with traumatic origin unless bleeding was under control, previous irreversible brain damage, terminal status of malignancy, and the age over 75 years. For the patients with postcardiotomy shock requiring ECLS in the operating theater because of an inability of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, they were excluded as well from this ECPR cohort since they did not receive cardiac massage. The patients that had signed "DoNotResuscitate" (DNR) consent were also excluded from ECLS deployment.</criteria>
