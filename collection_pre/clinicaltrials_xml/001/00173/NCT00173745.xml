	<brief_title>Treatment of Drooling With Type A Botulinum Toxin in Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sialorrhea, or drooling, has been reported to be a significant problem in 10%to 37% of patients with cerebral palsy. Excessive drooling may cause skin maceration, increased the burden of caregiver, affect articulation of the patients, and increase the risk of aspiration and dehydration. Many options, including various therapies, medications, surgeries and radiation, have been proposed to treat drooling. Yet none of these is universally successful and many have potential complications. Nerve endings of the parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons secret aceylcholine. Botulinum toxin should be able to inhibit salivary gland secretion by blocking the release of acetylcholine. Very limited case series had proved fair result of botulinum toxin injection to treat drooling. However, most of the subjects were adult patients with neurological disorders. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection to treat drooling in children with cerebral palsy, and to find the most appropriate dosage, duration of effect and side effects.</detailed_description>
