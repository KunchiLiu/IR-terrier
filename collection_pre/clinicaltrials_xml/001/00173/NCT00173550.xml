	<brief_title>Perception and Attitude Toward Estrogen Therapy Among Surgically Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cognition and attitude of menopausal women toward hormone replacement could have been changed since the report from WHI in July 2002. Previously, many women used hormone replacement to prevent cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Recently, the use has been challenged, exaggerated, and also discussed both in media press and academic meetings. Many women dare not to use them. The women who underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy before menopause may immediately face the problems caused by deficiency of female sex hormone. For this group of women, as yet there is no conclusion about whether the women should take hormone replacement therapy for a long time to osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and other chronic disease. The arm for this study from WHI is not closed yet. While the women in our area might have been influenced by this report and have changed their mind. It is essential for us to make a clear understanding about the cognition and attitude for hormone replacement therapy for women who underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy. Therefore, it may be a pioneer study and worthwhile to do this study. Data from a medical center from 2000 to 2004 will be examined for evidence of bilateral oophorectomy &amp; hysterectomy. The cause for the surgery will be confirmed by pathological findings. These women who were under 50 years of age will be candidate of the study. The women will be interviewed about their beliefs, and cognition, regarding their quality of life and health risks as well as their opinion on menopause and hormone replacement therapy.</detailed_description>
