	<brief_title>Male Hormonal Contraceptive Development-ACY-5</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective is to conduct a male contraceptive trial in which we will evaluate the suppressive effects of acyline when administered in combination with Testosterone (T) and the progestin depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). We will be administering combinations of three drugs: Testosterone (T) by gel, Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and Acyline to see their effects on sperm production. The T/DMPA/Acyline combination will allow us to determine if the more rapid and complete gonadotropin suppression mediated by the early addition of a GnRH antagonist will accelerate and enhance suppression of spermatogenesis. In prior studies with testosterone and DMPA these drug, which are hormones, have been found to be safe, and to reversibly suppress sperm counts to zero in about 80% of men. We hope to improve this to 100% of men by adding another drug, Acyline. Acyline is an GnRH antagonist which blocks the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. DMPA is approved by the FDA for use as a female contraceptive. The endpoint will be suppression of spermatogenesis to zero (azoospermia) by the end of the treatment phase.</detailed_description>
