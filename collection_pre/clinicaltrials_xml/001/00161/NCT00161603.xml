	<brief_summary>To explore and illuminate the cultural, social, and psychological factors that either facilitate or serve as barriers to behavioral change in angioplasty patients. Through a series of open-ended questions we will explore and build a better understanding of how culturally different patient groups perceive heart disease and the difficulties in changing health behavior. In addition, we hope to better understand and anticipate barriers and issues that participants face in successfully changing their behaviors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. To explore and illuminate the cultural, social, and psychological factors that either facilitate or serve as barriers to behavioral change in angioplasty patients. Through a series of open-ended questions we will explore and build a better understanding of how culturally different patient groups perceive heart disease and the difficulties in changing health behavior. In addition, we hope to better understand and anticipate barriers and issues that participants face in successfully changing their behaviors. 2. To use the responses obtained in the qualitative interviews to inform how we should operationalize and tailor the positive affect induction and self-affirmation intervention methods in each of the populations under study. Specifically, this involves assessing what small gifts participants prefer to receive and what would be most effective in inducing positive affect.</detailed_description>
