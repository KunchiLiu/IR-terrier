	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of ketorolac for post-operative pain management after heart surgery. Ketorolac appears to provide enhanced pain relief while also decreasing the requirements for morphine during the (immediate) 24-hour post-operative period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current practice at this institution does not include routine use of ketorolac for post-operative pain management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The investigators hypothesize that using Ketorolac as an adjunct to IV morphine can positively impact patient outcomes and reduce the occurrence of possible side effects.</detailed_description>
