	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new antipsychotics, quetiapine (300-500mg/day) and risperidone (3-4mg/day) compared to each other and to fluphenazine (10-15mg/day), a high potency typical antipsychotic in patients who meet the DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia. 2. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine (1200mg/day) in patients who have not responded to conventional and newer antipsychotics. 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine (300-500mg/day), and risperidone (3-5mg/day) compared to each other and fluphenazine (10-15mg/day) in the treatment of hostility and aggression in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. 4. To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine (300-500mg/day) and risperidone (3-5mg/day) compared to each other and fluphenazine (10-15mg/day) on rates of discharge, quality of life, and independent living skills. 5. To assess prolactin levels and to evaluate any relationship with sexual dysfunction and menstrual irregularities. 6. To evaluate the possible differential impact of treatment conditions on cognitive functioning including measures of attention, motor speed, problem solving, verbal and visual memory, and verbal processing speed. 7. To measure changes in weight and health consequences associated with weight changes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Antipsychotic Strategies: Quetiapine and Risperidone vs. Fluphenazine in Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a three arm multi-center randomized double-blind study. After open label treatment with each individual being optimized with routine antipsychotic treatment for 4-6 weeks to prospectively establish lack of response to conventional antipsychotic therapy, approximately 180 patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing clinically significant psychotic symptoms will be recruited (minimum 150 enrolled) in the double-blind period of the study. All participants will sign consent forms before participating in this research study. If participants choose to enroll in the high dose quetiapine arm (period IIIb), they will sign an additional consent form before entering period IIIb.</detailed_description>
