	<brief_summary>Peripheral T cell lymphoma and advanced cutaneous T cell lymphomas are aggressive and refractory diseases that are generally treated with chemotherapy. Despite current treatment modalities, only a subset of patients will be cured by the treatment. In this study, four chemotherapeutic agents (L-asparaginase, Methotrexate, Doxil, and Prednisone) will be administered in a combination regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral and/or advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Each one of these individual drugs have been shown to have activity to lymphomas. The objective of the study is to determine if the combination of these chemotherapy agents results in higher response and cure rates in this patient population. This will be a single institutional study which will included 32 patients in the Peripheral T cell lymphoma group and 32 patients in the Cutaneous T cell lymphoma group.</brief_summary>
