	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of alemtuzumab (Campath) when administered in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy (C-CHOP) in patients with T-cell, null-cell and NK-cell lymphomas. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate response rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival in patients with T-cell, null-cell, and NK-cell lymphomas treated with Campath + CHOP chemotherapy. - To assess the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in patients with these lymphomas treated with the Campath + CHOP combination. - To determine features which might be predictive of resistance to treatment or predictive of relapse, including the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins.</brief_summary>
