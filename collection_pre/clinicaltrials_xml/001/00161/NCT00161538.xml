	<brief_title>Pacing of the Atria in Sick Sinus Syndrome Trial Preventive Strategies for Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in Sick Sinus Syndrome patients treated with pacing is quite high. As AF can cause dizziness, fatigue, thromboembolism and ischemic stroke it is clinically relevant. Due to earlier publications pacing modes and lead placement seem to influence the incidence of AF. In this study the incidence of AF will be compared between 4 different atrial lead positions: 1. Free atrial wall 2. right atrial appendage 3. coronary sinus-os 4. Dual site right atrial pacing: b) plus c). The following primary parameters will be evaluated during the study period of 2 years after implantation: 1. Amounts of AF episodes with a duration of &gt; 48 hours 2. Amounts of AF episodes with a duration of &gt; 30 minutes 3. Consultations of physicians due to AF Secondarily, AF burden, Incidence of AF in total, Quality of Life, implant duration and complications will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
