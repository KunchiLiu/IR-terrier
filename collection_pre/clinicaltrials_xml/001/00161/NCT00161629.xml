	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety of rhBMP-2/CPM administered to subjects presenting with closed distal radius fractures. The key safety variables comprising this assessment are: 1) incidence of delayed union; 2) median time to fracture union (assessed by the investigators); 3) incidence of local neurovascular events (those involving the region under study [RUS]); and 4) rate of fracture displacement. The primary objective will be met if these outcomes in the active and placebo treatment groups are at least comparable to those of the SOC control group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults aged 50 to 80 years of age; alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Acute, closed distal radius fractures (within 4 cm of the tip of the radial styloid process), classified according to AO/ASIF as either A2 or A3 (extraarticular) or C1 or C2 (intraarticular) fractures. Closed fracture reduction and definitive fracture fixation performed within 7 days after injury by means of external skeletal and/or percutaneous pin fixation. Note: fractures that are initially treated by closed reduction and casting, then converted to external or percutaneous pin fixation for definitive fracture fixation within 7 days after injury are eligible for the study. Other inclusion applies. Other fractures of the ipsilateral upper extremity (except for ulnar styloid fractures) or the contralateral upper extremity (except for previously healed fractures without residual functional deficit). Fracture fixation by other means (eg, plate and screw fixation). Planned treatment for the fracture includes any procedure to promote fracture healing (eg, open reduction internal fixation, bone grafting, noninvasive modalities such as ultrasound, electrical stimulation, etc). Note: After 12 weeks have elapsed since administration of the treatment assignment, unanticipated procedures to promote fracture healing are permitted as clinically indicated. Other exclusion applies.</criteria>
