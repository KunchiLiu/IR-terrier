Concurrent use of testosterone and or any hormonal therapy, including health food supplements and herbal products, that could alter serum testosterone levels or affect the prostate (e.g. gonadotropic releasing hormone agonists, testosterone antagonists, anabolic steroids, DHEA, androstenedione, PCSPES, chrysin and tribulus terrestris,). Use of alphareductase inhibitors or prostate phytotherapy within the past 3 months. 7. Use of antidepressant medications, oral glucocorticoids, or opioids. 8. PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml and/or prostate biopsy positive for cancer at screening. Any patient in whom there is a suspicion of prostate cancer must undergo appropriate testing to rule out cancer prior to entry into the study. 9. IPSS score ï‚³ 20. 10. History of malignancy of any type (except basal cell carcinoma). 11. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes. 12. Patients with known or suspected bleeding disorder. Concurrent use of Coumadin and other anticoagulants at the time of biopsy or if discontinuation of such therapy prior to biopsy poses a risk to the patient. 13.
