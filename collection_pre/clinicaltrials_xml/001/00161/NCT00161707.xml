	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the short-term safety of inhaled recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) in subjects with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. The subjects are randomized to receive placebo or one of 4 doses of rAAT. The 4 doses are tested in a consecutive manner from lowest to highest.</brief_summary>
