There are no specific exclusion criteria for this study entry. However volunteers will be assessed for eligibility to receive a third vaccination. Volunteers will be excluded from vaccination and consecutive visits in this study if they: Are not clinically healthy, (i. e. the physician would have reservations vaccinating with FSME IMMUN NEW outside the scope of a clinical trial) Have already been administered a third TBE vaccination elsewhere after the two vaccinations in Baxter study 199 Have had an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since the last vaccination in Baxter study 199 Suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment (e.g. systemic corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics) that can be expected to influence immunological functions Have received banked human blood or immunoglobulins within one month of study entry Are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of the study) since the last visit of Baxter study 199 Have had a vaccination against yellow fever and / or Japanese Bencephalitis since the last visit in Baxter study 199 Had received an investigational new drug within 6 weeks prior to study start</criteria>
