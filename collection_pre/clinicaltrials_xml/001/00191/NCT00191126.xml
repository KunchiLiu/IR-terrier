	<brief_summary>Preoperative chemotherapy is considered to play a role in early stage non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) .The use of preoperative Cisplatin/Gemcitabine chemotherapy has proven feasible and without excessive morbidity or mortality in the Phase II setting. The aim of the present Phase III study is to determine whether 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with Cisplatin/Gemcitabine improves progression free survival of NSCLC patients versus surgery alone. Postoperative chemotherapy will not be utilized in this Phase III trial.</brief_summary>
