	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine and anthracycline combination has shown encouraging activity as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer. An addition of sequential gemcitabine and cisplatin, also a highly active combination in this indication, may result in improvement in pathological response and overall survival. Patients with operable breast cancer will be treated in neoadjuvant setting with gemcitabine plus doxorubicin, followed by gemcitabine plus cisplatin.</brief_summary>
