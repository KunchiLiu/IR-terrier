	<brief_summary>The gemcitabine-paclitaxel and gemcitabine-platinum combinations have shown promise in the treatments of MBC; however, the optimal dosing schedules for these combinations have not yet been determined. The primary objective of this study is to compare the response rates of the gemcitabine-paclitaxel, gemcitabine-carboplatin, and gemcitabine-cisplatin combinations when administered on a biweekly schedule in metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
