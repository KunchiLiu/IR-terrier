	<brief_summary>Based on available data, the concept of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be promising for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The exploration of new drugs and regimens are warranted. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical response rate of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer stage IB, IIA-B, IIIA.</brief_summary>
