	<brief_summary>This is a phase III randomized study comparing induction treatments of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin versus Paclitaxel and Carboplatin, with or without consolidation therapy for patients that do not have any evidence of disease after completion of six cycles of induction therapy. Patients with disease after induction therapy will crossover to receive single agent therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer Study for Patients That Have Not Received Prior Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study (Study B9E-US-S302) is a multicenter, comparative, open-label randomized, superiority, trial evaluating Gemcitabine and Carboplatin to the standard of care. Both treatment arms will be given the option to receive elective consolidation therapy of Paclitaxel 135 mg/m^2 given every 28 days for one year. Patients not achieving a complete response will crossover to the opposite single agent.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Patients with a histologic diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma, epithelial ovarian carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma Stage IC, II, III or IV. All patients must have had surgery for fallopian, ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma to establish the diagnosis and have tissue available for histologic evaluation and confirmation of organ of origin. Patients must be enrolled no more than twelve weeks postoperatively. Patients must be willing to receive their chemotherapy drugs intravenously, as intraperitoneal therapy is not part of this trial. Key Patients with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential (Borderline carcinomas) are not eligible. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis are excluded Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor are excluded With the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies patients who had (or have) any evidence of the other cancer present within the last 5 years or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded.</criteria>
