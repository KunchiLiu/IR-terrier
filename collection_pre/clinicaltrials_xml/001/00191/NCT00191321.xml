	<brief_summary>A pilot study on the use of Teriparatide in severe osteoporotic women with hip fracture and submitted to hip replacement The primary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data, in a pilot group of postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis and a recent hip fracture, who underwent hip replacement 3-6 months before screening phase, about the effect of teriparatide on: - bone turnover markers: CTx, PINP and BSAP when given at the dose of 20 mcg/day by subcutaneous route for 18 months. The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: - Effects of teriparatide on lumbar spine and non-prosthetic femur bone density, as assessed by BMD measurement with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) - Effects of teriparatide on quality of life and back pain during treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Ambulatory postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis, based on the disease diagnostic criteria 2. Presence of more than 1 clinical and/or radiological vertebral fractures OR more than 1 nonvertebral fracture 3. Presence of hip fracture with hip replacement surgical procedure (both uncemented or cemented total hip arthroplastics or endoprosthesis) in the 36 months before screening phase 4. Age range 5585 years 5. Normal or clinically insignificant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the investigator) including serum calcium, PTH(1 84), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and alkaline phosphatase activity. 1. History of diseases which affect bone metabolism, other than primary postmenopausal osteoporosis, such as Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, any secondary causes of osteoporosis (included glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis), hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism 2. Actual cancer disease or history of malignant neoplasms in the 5 years prior to Visit 2, with the exception of superficial basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have been definitively treated. Subjects with carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix treated definitively more than 1 year prior to entry into the study may be enrolled. 3. Increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma: Paget's disease of the bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase; Prior radiation therapy involving the skeleton 4. Significantly impaired renal function 5. Significantly impaired hepatic function</criteria>
