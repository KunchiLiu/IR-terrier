	<brief_title>IL-7 Receptor Polymorphisms and Immune Recovery With HAART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM: To examine the association between the four haplotypes of IL-7Rα gene and a cohort of HIV infected patients who have commenced HAART with varying CD4+ T lymphocyte responses. METHODS: IL-7Rα gene SNPs and haplotypes will be measured by constructing DNA pools, and PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. IL-7Rα expression will be examined using constitutive expression of IL-7Rα, IL-7Rα gene expression, and inducible expression of IL7Rα.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men or women at least 18 years of age First antiretroviral regimen composed of HAART as defined by at least three antiretrovirals Controlled viremia for a period of at least 12 months following commencement of HAART. Controlled viremia is defined as HIV viral load of ≤ 500 copies/mL on bDNA testing (versions 2 and 3) and &lt;400 copies/ml measured by RTPCR assay by 6 months treatment. CD4 cell count &lt;500 at commencement of HAART Measurement of CD4+ cell count on at least 3 time points, in the 12 months post commencement of HAART. Exclude patients treated for HIV seroconversion illness Exclude patients on immunomodulatory therapy such as IL2, hydroxyurea or prednisolone or who have received an HIV therapeutic vaccine</criteria>
