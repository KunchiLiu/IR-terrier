	<brief_summary>A number of blood pressure lowering drugs in the class known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been shown to slow the decline in kidney function of patients with type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney disease. Losartan (COZAAR), is one such drug. The purpose of this research study is to determine if after one year of treatment telmisartan (MICARDIS, GLIOSARTAN, KINZAL, KINZALMONO, PREDXAL, PRITOR, SAMERTAN, TELMISARTAN) 80 mg, another blood pressure lowering drug from the ARB class, is as effective as losartan (COZAAR) 100 mg in reducing the level of urinary protein (indicative of improved kidney function).</brief_summary>
