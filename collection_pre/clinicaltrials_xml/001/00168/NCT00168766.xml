	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether combination treatment (adding methylprednisolone to Avonex) reduces progression of disability over 4 years compared to Avonex alone. The study will also investigate whether combination therapy has any impact on the incidence of relapse and brain atrophy as measured by MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avonex (Interferon-beta-1a) and Avonex Plus Methylprednisolone for the Treatment of Relapsing-remitting MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 340 therapy-naïve MS patients with relapsing-remitting form of the disease will be randomized to receive Avonex alone or Avonex plus methylprednisolone (MP). Patients will receive MP as 500 mg po for 3 days every month or matching placebo. The patients are followed on a 3-monthly basis for 4 years with disability as the primary parameter of efficacy over that time.</detailed_description>
