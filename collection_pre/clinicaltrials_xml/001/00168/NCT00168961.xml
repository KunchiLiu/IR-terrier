	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is frequently occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis and is associated with a poorer outcome, as it determines life quality and affects both morbidity and mortality. Long term prognosis after liver transplantation also depends on the nutritional status. Therefore, the early diagnosis and intervention for malnutrition is an important issue in the clinical management of liver cirrhosis. However, oral intake has been shown to be insufficient due to disease related anorexia or concomitant drowsiness and confusion. Specific aims: To investigate the effect of early nutritional intervention via tube feeding on nutritional status, functional status (hand grip strength and peak flow), life quality and disease related complications such as intestinal permeability, and oxidative stress, as well as liver function.</brief_summary>
