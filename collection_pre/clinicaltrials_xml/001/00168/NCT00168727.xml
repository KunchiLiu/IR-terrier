	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a treatment regimen using Zevalin® plus Rituxan® for patients who have low grade Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) or relapsed Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and have been previously treated. This study will use an experimental scheduling regimen. No chemotherapy will be used in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zevalin® Followed by Rituxan® Maintenance in Previously Treated Low Grade Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine overall response rate, event-free survival, time-to-progression, time-to-next-therapy, and freedom-from-relapse in patients with low-grade lymphoma in first or second relapse treated with Zevalin followed by 2 years of Rituxan maintenance therapy in a multicenter, community-based setting, as well as evaluate relative response rates in populations with and without prior rituximab therapy, in first versus second relapse, and with and without bulky (&gt; 5 cm in greatest diameter) disease. To meet the initial trial enrollment goal of 300 patients over two years, 42 total sites were activated. The study has subsequently closed to accrual. Currently 8 sites remain active to follow the 12 subjects enrolled in the past year.</detailed_description>
