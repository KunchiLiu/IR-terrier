	<brief_summary>Vitamin A given as treatment and pre-treatment has reduced the severity of symptoms after infusion with endotoxin in several animal models. We intend to examine the effect of vitamin A as pre-treatment on the response to endotoxin in humans. We furthermore wish to examine the long-term effects of vitamin A on the response to endotoxin. We hypothesise that vitamin A decreases endotoxin levels and TNF-alfa responses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin A and Response to Endotoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin A given as treatment and pre-treatment has reduced the severity of symptoms after infusion with endotoxin in several animal models. We intend to examine the effect of vitamin A as pre-treatment on the response to endotoxin in humans. As studies in children in low-income countries have indicated that vitamin A has long-term effects on the immune system, we furthermore wish to examine the long-term effects of vitamin A on the response to endotoxin. This will be done in an established model using infusion with endotoxin to male human volunteers. We hypothesise that vitamin A decreases endotoxin levels and TNF-alfa responses. Furthermore, we hypothesise that it reduces oxidative stress and injury.</detailed_description>
