	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. Photodynamic therapy using silicon phthalocyanine 4 may be effective against skin cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy using silicon phthalocyanine 4 in treating patients with actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, skin cancer, or stage I or stage II mycosis fungoides.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using Silicon Phthalocyanine 4 in Treating Patients With Actinic Keratosis, Bowen's Disease, Skin Cancer, or Stage I or Stage II Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of photodynamic therapy using topically delivered silicon phthalocyanine 4 in patients with actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, or stage IA, IB, IIA, or IIB mycosis fungoides. - Determine the safety and toxicity of this therapy with emphasis on whether it induces photosensitivity in non-treated sites in these patients. - Determine the antitumor mechanism of this therapy, by monitoring tissue changes via clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and other biochemical markers, in these patients. - Determine, preliminarily, the dose of this therapy that results in highest clearing rates in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive topical silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4). One hour later, patients undergo photodynamic therapy. Treatment repeats weekly for up to 3 weeks (up to 3 total treatments for the same lesion OR up to 3 lesions treated if multiple lesions are present). Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and visible light until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-45 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
