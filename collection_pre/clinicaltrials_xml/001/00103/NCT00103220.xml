	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SJG-136 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SJG-136, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SJG-136 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicities, pharmacokinetic profile and the recommended phase 2 dose of SJG-136 in patients with an advanced solid tumor. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine preliminary efficacy data and evaluation of correlative markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.</detailed_description>
