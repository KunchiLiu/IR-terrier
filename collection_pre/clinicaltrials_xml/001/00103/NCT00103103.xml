	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with fluorouracil and leucovorin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with fluorouracil and leucovorin works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable stomach cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib, Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine response in patients with previously treated metastatic or unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with bortezomib, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium. Secondary - Determine time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15. One hour after completion of bortezomib, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
