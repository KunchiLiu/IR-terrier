Hepatitis B or C positive (by history or screening HBsAg/antiHCV ELISA). Active or past internal organ, hematologic malignancy, or metastatic cutaneous malignancy. History of, or current autoimmune disease, including but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polyarteritis. Immunodeficiency or unstable medical condition as determined by baseline medical history, physical exam, and laboratory assessment. Received, or plans to receive, licensed live vaccines within 30 days of study vaccination. Received, or plans to receive, licensed killed vaccines within 14 days of study vaccination. Received, or plans to receive, immunoglobulin or other blood products within 60 days of study vaccination. Received, or plans to receive, experimental drugs/vaccines within 30 days of study vaccination. Received, or plans to receive, systemic immunosuppresive therapy, radiation therapy, or highdose inhaled steroids within 30 days of study vaccination. Use of systemic chemotherapy within 5 years prior to study. History of GuillainBarre Syndrome. In addition to the conditions listed above, the following may qualify as a reason to exclude a volunteer from the study: fever along with moderate or serious illness within 3 days of vaccination or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the study evaluations. Pending resolution of these symptoms, a volunteer may be reconsidered for vaccination.</criteria>
