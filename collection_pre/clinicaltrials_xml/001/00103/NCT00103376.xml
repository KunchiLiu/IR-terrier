	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as goserelin, leuprolide, flutamide, or bicalutamide, may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Giving bortezomib with hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib with or without hormone therapy works in treating patients with relapsed prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib With or Without Hormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse after an observed rise in testosterone after combination treatment with hormone blockade and bortezomib. Secondary - Determine the safety of this drug in combination with combined androgen blockade therapy in these patients. - Determine the disease-free interval in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine time to tsetosterone rise in patients treated wtih this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive androgen blockade therapy comprising a 3-month subcutaneous injection of goserelin OR leuprolide OR other FDA-approved method of primary androgen suppression AND oral flutamide or bicalutamide once daily for 3 months. Patients also receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment with bortezomib repeats every 28 days for 3 courses. Patients achieving a CR discontinue treatment and are observed for PSA or metastatic disease recurrence. Patients with a PR or stable disease receive additional combined androgen blockade therapy and 3 additional courses of bortezomib as above. Patients with progressive disease are removed from the study. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-42 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate Relapsed disease after definitive local therapy, as documented only by a rise in prostatespecific antigen (PSA) Experienced PSA relapse after definitive local therapy Rising PSA (≥ 1.0 ng/mL after nadir &lt; 1.0 ng/mL) PSA increase of ≥ 0.3 ng/mL (increase occurred between 2 separate measurements taken ≥ 4 weeks apart) The first of these two PSA values must rise above a previously recorded posttherapy nadir value Ineligible for curative therapy No clinical evidence of local recurrence (i.e., palpable induration or mass in the prostatic fossa) other than PSA elevation No evidence of palpable disease in the prostatic bed No metastatic disease (M0) No nonnodal (&gt; N1) metastasis No evidence of osseous metastasis on bone scan within the past 28 days PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age Over 18 Performance status ECOG 01 Life expectancy At least 1 year Hematopoietic Platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm^3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm^3 Hepatic No known hepatitis B or C positivity Renal Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min Immunologic No known human Tcell lymphotropic virus positivity No hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol No known HIV 1 or 2 positivity No active, ongoing bacterial, viral, or fungal infection Other Fertile patients must use effective contraception No peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 No other disease, condition, or social or geographic constraint that would preclude study participation No other malignancy within the past 5 years except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy Not specified Chemotherapy No concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy See Disease Characteristics At least 6 months since prior hormonal therapy combined with radiation therapy as definitive therapy Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to definitive therapy (e.g., surgery, radiation therapy, brachytherapy, or cryoablation) allowed No other concurrent hormonal therapy Radiotherapy See Disease Characteristics More than 12 months since prior radioactive seed therapy No concurrent radiotherapy Surgery See Disease Characteristics More than 4 weeks since prior surgery No concurrent surgery Other No concurrent secondline herbal preparations, including PCSPES No other concurrent investigational agents</criteria>
