	<brief_summary>TG100-115 is able to reduce the size of heart attacks in pre-clinical models. The hypothesis of this study is that TG100-115 can be given safely to patients who suffer a heart attack and undergo angioplasty to restore blood flow. We will also evaluate whether TG100-115 reduces heart muscle damage.</brief_summary>
