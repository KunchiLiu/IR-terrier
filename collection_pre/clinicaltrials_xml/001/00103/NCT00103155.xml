	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation may be effective treatment for thyroid cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of complications associated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with low-risk papillary thyroid cancer undergoing thyroidectomy. - Determine the utility of RFA as a treatment option for these patients. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. An electrosurgical probe is placed by ultrasound guidance into the center of the thyroid tumor. Patients undergo radiofrequency ablation directly to the tumor until the target temperature is reached* for 5 minutes. Patients then undergo standard thyroidectomy. NOTE: *Takes approximately 15-30 minutes to reach target temperature. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 1, between days 14-21, and then periodically as deemed necessary. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
