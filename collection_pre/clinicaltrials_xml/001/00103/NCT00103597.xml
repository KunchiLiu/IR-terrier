	<brief_summary>Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, are eligible for the study.

Autonomic testing, a symptom questionnaire, bedside blood pressure testing, and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) will be performed after each intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Therapeutic Interventions for Orthostatic Hypotension in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled patients, ages 40-95, must have Parkinson's or MSA, diagnosed by a neurologist, and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Each patient will fill out two validated questionnaires to determine if they are candidates for the study. Baseline patient details, such as their medications and UPDRS, will be recorded. Medications must be held stable during the period of the study. Each patient will then have three weeks of conservative therapy, three weeks of therapy with fludrocortisone, and three weeks of therapy with domperidone. Autonomic testing, a symptom questionnaire, bedside blood pressure testing, and UPDRS will be performed after each intervention.</detailed_description>
