	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells and allogeneic tumor cells may make the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the immunologic effects of adjuvant vaccine therapy comprising autologous dendritic cells loaded with allogeneic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in patients with unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB, or resected stage I-IIIB NSCLC. - Determine the potential clinical efficacy of this vaccine in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to type of prior primary therapy (surgical vs nonsurgical). Patients undergo leukapheresis over 3-4 hours to harvest mononuclear cells for the production of dendritic cells (DC). DC are then pulsed with allogeneic non-small cell lung cancer cells to produce an autologous dendritic cell vaccine. Patients receive vaccine intradermally once a month for 2 months in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 4 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then periodically thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.</detailed_description>
