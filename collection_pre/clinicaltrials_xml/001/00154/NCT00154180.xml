	<brief_summary>The study will examine the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the development of atherosclerosis in menopausal women when hormone treatment is initiated within 3 years of the menopausal transition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The KEEPS is designed to explore the hypothesis that early initiation of hormone therapy, in women who are at the inception of their menopause, will decrease the rate of accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque, indicating a likely delay in the onset of clinical cardiovascular disease. The study is designed as a multicenter, 4 year randomized clinical trial. It will evaluate the effectiveness of of 0.45 mg/day of oral conjugated equine estrogens or 50 mcg/day of transdermal estradiol via skin patch changed weekly (each in combination with cyclic oral, micronized progesterone, 200 mg daily for 12 days per month), versus placebo in preventing progression of carotid intimal medial thickness by sonogram and the accrual of coronary calcium in women aged 42-58 who are within 36 months of their final menstrual period at initiation of treatment. A number of secondary endpoints including biochemical and genetic risk factors for cardiovascular and thrombotic disease, and effects on cognition will also be studied. The study will enroll a total of 720 women in 2005-6, with an anticipated completion of the trial in 2010.</detailed_description>
