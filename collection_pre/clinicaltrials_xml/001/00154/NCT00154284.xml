	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of everolimus in combination with basiliximab, and steroids with and without cyclosporine microemulsion in de novo kidney transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus in a Cyclosporine Microemulsion-free Regimen Compared to a Low-dose Cyclosporine Microemulsion Regimen, in de Novo Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a combined analysis using 81 patients randomized and treated in CRAD001A2419 (NCT00154284) with 33 randomized and treated in CRAD001A2423 (NCT00170807). This approach is reflected in the protocol amendments for each study, and the one clinical study report for both.</detailed_description>
