	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy,response rate,time to treatment failure,overall survival,toxicities of Paclitaxel-HDFL regimen in locally advanced/inoperable and recurrent/metastatic gastric cancers. To evaluate the resectability and relapse pattern after potentially curative resection of neoadjuvant Paclitaxel-HDFL regimen</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel-HDFL for Locally Advanced and Recurrent/Metastatic Gastric Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, paclitaxel followed by weekly HDFL has been shown to have a 55% response rate in anthracycline-resistant patient. Recently, regimen combining paclitaxel and moderately-high-dose 5-FU (1500mg/m2) has had response rate up to 61.5% (including 23%CR) in a small group of gastric cancer patients (8 responders in 13 patients). Thus, the sequential use of weekly paclitaxel followed by weekly HDFL regimen may become a new generation of chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of gastric cancer. Further study with a larger group of patients and further testing of possible schedules of administration are warranted.</detailed_description>
