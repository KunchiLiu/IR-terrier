	<criteria>1. Patients of any race, 18 to 65 years of age inclusive. 2. Patients with a history of migraine (with or without aura) according to the Headache Classification Committee of the IHS. Migraine attacks have to have had an onset before age 50 and have to have been present for at least 12 months. 3. Patients with 412 qualified migraine attacks per month over the past three months prior to Screening, as well as during the four weeks of the Baseline Phase will be eligible for entry into this study. The interval between two qualified migraine attacks should be at least 24 hours to be counted as distinct migraine attacks. A qualified migraine attack without aura is defined as a headache that lasts 472 hours (if untreated or unsuccessfully treated) or if successfully treated (revised per Amendment 01). This attack has at least two of the following characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity that inhibits or prohibits daily activities or aggravation by routine physical activities such as walking up stairs. In addition, at least one of the following symptoms must be present during the headache: nausea, vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia (revised per Amendments 01 and 02). A qualified migraine attack with aura must fulfill the same criteria as the headache attack, plus have an associated aura as defined by the Migraine Criteria of the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society. An aura alone that requires acute migraine treatment will also be considered a migraine attack. 4. Male and female patients will be eligible for enrollment. Females should be either of nonchildbearing potential by reason of surgery, radiation, menopause (one year post onset), or of childbearing potential and practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception (eg, abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD) for at least one month before study randomization and for two months after the end of the study, and have a negative serum BhCG at Screening. Pregnant and/or lactating females are excluded. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (eg, a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD) starting with the Baseline Phase and continuing throughout the entire study period. 5. Patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 to 40 kg/m2 inclusive at Screening. 6. Patients who are willing to participate and have provided written informed consent prior to being exposed to any studyrelated procedures. 1. Patients with chronic daily headaches as defined by more than 14 headache days per month on average during the three months prior to Screening, 2. Patients with cluster headaches and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and other primary headaches (except tensiontype headache) and secondary headaches (defined according to the Headache Classification Committee of the IHS 2004), 3. Patients with a history of being nonresponsive to more than two classes of adequately conducted, prophylactic migraine treatments (e.g., beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclics, MAOIs, valproate (divalproex), topiramate, gabapentin), 4. Patients who use the following medications as described: Use of marketed triptans for 10 days or greater per month on average, Use of ergotcontaining medications for ten days or greater per month on average, Use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or isometheptenecontaining agents for 15 days or greater per month on average, Use of opioids for 10 days or greater per month on average, Use of any two or more of the above medications for 15 days or greater per month on average, 5. Patients with clinically significant neurological illness, other than migraine, that, in the opinion of the Investigators, may have the potential of altering pain perception or reporting, 6. Patients with a history of or currently having major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, or bipolar disorder, 7. Patients who are known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 8. Patients with elevations of liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;= 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), 9. Patients with evidence of significant active hematological disease; white blood cell count cannot be less than or equal to 2500/uL or an absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 1000/uL, 10. Patients with clinically significant ECG abnormality, including prolonged QTc (Fridericia correction) defined as &gt;= 450 msec for males and &gt;= 470 msec for females, 11. Patients with clinically significant active hepatic disease, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, renal, endocrinological, gastrointestinal diseases, and bacterial or viral infections within 30 days prior to Screening or during the Baseline Phase, 12. Patients with known or suspected history of alcoholism or drug abuse within the previous two years, or a positive finding on urinary drug screening of other than prescribed medications, 13. Patients who have had severe allergic reactions to multiple drugs, 14. Patients with any other condition that would make them, in the opinion of the PI, unsuitable for this study, 15. Patients that have participated in a study involving administration of an investigational compound (including E2007) within one month of Visit 1 (Screening), 16. Patients with a known or suspected allergy to lactose, excluding lactose intolerance, 17. Patients who use the following medications for any medical reason during the study: betablockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, calcium channel blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, NSAIDs daily, magnesium supplements at high doses (ie, 600 mg/day), riboflavin at high doses (ie, 100 mg/day), corticosteroids, local anesthetics, botuliunum toxin, or herbal preparations such as feverfew or St. John's Wort. Patients who use nonpharmacological prophylactic approaches that were started at least one month prior to Screening may be continued throughout the study. 18. (revised per Amendment 03) 19. Patients who fail to complete the migraine diary adequately during the Baseline Phase (ie, patients, who do not have complete diary entries for at least 21 days of the Baseline Phase). Randomized patients will be both male and female, 1865 years of age, of any race, with a history of migraine headaches (with or without aura according to the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS, 2004 guideline) for at least 12 months, with an onset before age 50, experiencing 412 migraine attacks per month during both the 3 months prior to Screening and the Baseline Phase. Patients' Body Mass Index (BMI) should be between 19 to 40 kg/m2 inclusive at Screening.</criteria>
