	<brief_title>Paclitaxel (Phyxol) and Cisplatin as First-line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death for women in Taiwan. We have recently demonstrated that combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin, at conventional doses, is highly effective in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the acute and cumulative toxicities of paclitaxel have been troublesome to a significant portion of the patients. Several lines of evidence suggested that weekly paclitaxel, at a much lower dose range of 40 to 50 mg/m2 per week, may be as effective as that of the conventional doses of paclitaxel (80 to 90 mg/m2 per week) for patients with metastatic ovarian and lung cancers. The low-dose regimen of paclitaxel may significantly improve the compliance of the patients. This open-label phase II trial is designed to test this hypothesis.</detailed_description>

Previous chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment is acceptable, if the adjuvant chemotherapy has been completed at least 6 months before entry into in this study 8. If the patients have received hormonal therapy for metastatic disease, there must be definite evidence of disease progression under the hormonal therapy, and hormonal therapy should be discontinued before entry into this study 9. Previous or concurrent radiotherapy is acceptable if the area of radiation does not involve the site of the index tumor lesions 10. Patients of childbearing age should have effective contraception during the study period 11. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines. 1. Patients who are receiving concurrent hormonal or cytotoxic therapy or other experimental therapy. Concurrent therapy with other biological agents, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), is not allowed 2. Patients who refuse portA catheter implantation 3. Patients who have received taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy 4.

Pregnant or nursing patients may not participate. Patients with reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method 9. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years</criteria>
