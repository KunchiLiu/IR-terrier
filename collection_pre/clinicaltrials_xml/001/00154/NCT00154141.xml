	<criteria>Male and female subjects, 18 years or older, requiring elective, primary or repeat vascular procedures with at least one endtoside femoral or upper extremity vascular access arterial anastomosis (e.g. femoralfemoral, femoralpopliteal, femoraltibial, iliofemoral, aortobifemoral, abdominal aortic aneurysm, upper extremity vascular access for dialysis) using uncoated or heparincoated PTFE grafts and polypropylene sutures (size 50 or 60) with a 1:1 needletothread ratio. Following initial arterial clamp release, the study surgeon determines that adjunctive measures are needed to obtain haemostasis at the SAS. Subjects must be willing to and capable of participating in the study, and provided written informed consent. Subjects undergoing revascularisation using autologous conduits (e.g. saphenous vein) or prosthetic material other than uncoated or heparincoated PTFE. Subjects undergoing emergency surgery. Subjects with any intraoperative findings that may preclude conduct of the study procedure. Subjects with known intolerance to heparin, blood products or to one of the components of the study product. Subjects unwilling to receive blood products. Subjects with autoimmune immunodeficiency diseases (including known HIV). Subjects who are known, current alcohol and / or drug abusers. Subjects who have participated in another investigational drug or device research study within 30 days of enrolment. Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.</criteria>
