	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free regimen with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) and everolimus is as safe and well-tolerated as the standard regimen containing enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) and cyclosporine microemulsion, but results in better renal function.</brief_summary>
