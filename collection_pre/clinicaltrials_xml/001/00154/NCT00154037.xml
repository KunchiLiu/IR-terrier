	<brief_summary>The study is designed to test the hypothesis in healthy subjects that candesartan and pioglitazone provide additional vascular relaxing or modulating effects in addition to their blood-pressure and blood glucose level reducing ability, respectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Vascular Relaxing Effects of Candesartan and Pioglitazone.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of oral candesartan and/ or rosiglitazone therapy on the vascular responsiveness of different vasoactive compounds (angiotensin II, insulin, histamine and glyceroltrinitrate) in healthy subjects. Pioglitazone will be given orally (4 weeks 30mg/d, titrated to 45 mg/d for another 4 weeks). Candesartan will be given orally (4 weeks 8mg/d, titrated to 16 mg/d for another 4 weeks) as treatment. Every subject will receive intravenous stimulation with phenylephrine, angiotensin II, histamine, insulin and glyceroltrinitrate before and after an 8 weeks treatment interval with study medication or placebo. In addition, pulse wave velocity will me measured non-invasively before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
