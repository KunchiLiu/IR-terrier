	<brief_title>CE-MRA Using Gadovist in Comparison to IA DSA Using Ultravist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial is to show the diagnostic efficacy of Gadovist for contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CE-MRA) of arteries (specified vessel segments) by analyzing the rate of agreement, image quality, and diagnostic confidence between a CE-MRA based diagnosis and the diagnosis achieved from the comparator procedure IA DSA using Ultravist.</detailed_description>
