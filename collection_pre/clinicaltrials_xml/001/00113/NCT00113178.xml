	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the CryoCor™ Cardiac Cryoablation System for the Treatment of Atrial Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation of arrhythmias has become an accepted alternative to pharmacologic therapy. Cryoablation is a newer alternative to radiofrequency ablations. This study expands the prior pilot experience with the CryoCor™ Cardiac Cryoablation System to a larger cohort of patients with atrial flutter.</detailed_description>
