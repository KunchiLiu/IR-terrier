	<brief_summary>Tree MATA (modified pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with hypersensitivity to tree (birch, alder, and hazel) pollen. Different doses of Tree MATA will be administered and immunological changes following this treatment will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction of Immunogenicity With Different Doses of TreeMATA in Subjects Allergic to Tree Pollen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with proven type I hypersensitivity to tree (birch, alder, and hazel) pollen. The tree pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities, is not seen. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like T cell profile. The purpose of this study is to assess specific immunological changes (IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgE) in allergic subjects following 2 subcutaneous injections of different doses of study medication (Tree MATA) or placebo administered 3 weeks apart. The immunological changes will be used to assess the performance of the R7 IgG reactivity assay over a range of clinically efficacious doses.</detailed_description>
