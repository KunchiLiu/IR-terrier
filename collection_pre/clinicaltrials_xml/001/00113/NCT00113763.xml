	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine that panitumumab, using the proposed regimen, will safely increase progression free survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed available treatment options (i.e., patients who developed progressive disease or relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy).</brief_summary>
