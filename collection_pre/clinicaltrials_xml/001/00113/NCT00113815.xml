	<brief_title>Topiramate as Adjunctive Therapy in Infants 1-24 Months for the Control of Partial Onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a world wide, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of 3 target doses (5, 15, and 25 mg/kg/day) of topiramate compared with placebo as an adjunct therapy in infants with refractory partial onset seizures (POS). There are 4 phases to the study, a screening phase of 3 days, a double blind treatment phase of 20 days, a one year open label extension phase and a posttreatment (taper and withdrawal) phase. The oral liquid formulation will also be assessed during this study, as it is investigational, unlike the marketed sprinkle formulation. 5, 15, 25 mg/kg/day of topriramate sprinkle and oral liquid formulation will be administered during the four phases of the study.</detailed_description>
