	<brief_title>Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition in Children With Mitral Regurgitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: MR causes volume overload and hemodynamic burden on the left ventricle. Initial compensatory mechanisms may fail, leading to increased severity. Patients who have had repair of an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) are selected for this study as they have a relatively high incidence of moderate MR and their regurgitant orifice is mobile and dynamic, contributing to the likelihood that they might respond to medical therapy. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ACE-I therapy in children less than 18 years of age with at least moderate MR who are at least 6 months postoperative from repair of an AVSD. A non-randomized Observational Phase enrolled 181 children who were less than 6 months postoperative from repair of an AVSD, who were then evaluated at 6 months for trial eligibility.</detailed_description>
