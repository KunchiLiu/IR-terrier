	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Cisplatin and docetaxel may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so it can be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and docetaxel together with radiation therapy is more effective than giving cisplatin together with docetaxel in treating non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying cisplatin, docetaxel, and radiation therapy to see how well they work compared to cisplatin and docetaxel in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin and Docetaxel With or Without Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Newly Diagnosed Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed favorable prognosis stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin and docetaxel with vs without thoracic conformal radiotherapy followed by surgical resection and docetaxel. Secondary - Compare median and progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare clinical and pathologic response rates in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Correlate pathological complete response with disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate DNA damage repair genes (ERCC1 and XRCC1), microtubule-related proteins (TUBB-III and MAP4), and shed tumor DNA with response and outcome in patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate protein profiles, using MALDI-TOF proteomic analysis of tumor and serum, with response and prognosis in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the efficacy of fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography scanning in assessing pathological response of the tumor and the mediastinal lymph nodes and in predicting long-term outcome in patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate comorbid conditions with survival of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to T stage (T1 vs T2-3), number of involved mediastinal lymph nodes (1 vs 2 or more vs not evaluable), and nodal micrometastases vs clinically involved nodes (mN2 vs cN2). - Induction therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22. - Arm II: Patients undergo thoracic conformal radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for approximately 5½ weeks (total of 28 doses). Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. - Surgery: Within 4-8 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients with stable disease or better undergo a lobectomy or pneumonectomy with a formal systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection. - Consolidation therapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43 and pegfilgrastim or filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 2, 23, and 44. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, within 2 weeks after completion of induction therapy, and then at 6 and 12 months after surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 574 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
