	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a minimally invasive surgical procedure in up to 160 implanted female patients in which two adjustable balloons (one on each side of the urethra) are implanted to treat urinary stress incontinence. The results will be analyzed to demonstrate the effects of the device as well as its associated risks. Therapeutic success will be based on whether the patients demonstrate at least a one-grade (mean) reduction in the Stamey score at 12 months.</brief_summary>
