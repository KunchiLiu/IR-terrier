	<brief_summary>Patients will be treated with gemcitabine and Orathecin (rubitecan) capsules to evaluate the current estimate of overall survival as a study endpoint prior to launching the blinded randomized phase (versus gemcitabine and placebo) of the study. Toxicity of the drug combination will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
