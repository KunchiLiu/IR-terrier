	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Motavizumab (MEDI-524) After Dosing for a Second Season in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind study in which motavizumab (MEDI-524) or palivizumab was administered to children who previously participated in MI-CP104. Children who received at least 3 doses of motavizumab in MI-CP104 were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive motavizumab or palivizumab at 15 mg/kg by IM injection every 30 days for a total of 4-5 injections during the 2004-05 RSV season subsequent to the season in which they were participants of MI-CP104. All subjects were evaluated prior to and 30 minutes after each injection of study drug with 2 follow-up evaluations, one at 30 days and the other at 90-120 days after the last dose.</detailed_description>
