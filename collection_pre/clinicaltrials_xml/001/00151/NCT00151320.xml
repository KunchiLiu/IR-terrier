	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VELCADE when administered in combination with CHOP + Rituximab to patients with previously untreated diffuse large B cell or mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Secondary Objectives: To assess the response rate (overall and complete), event-free survival and overall survival with VELCADE and CHOP-R in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B cell or mantle cell lymphoma (phase II component) Treatment: Standard CHOP chemotherapy administered every 21 days (full dose) for six cycles Rituximab administered (375 mg/m2) day 1 of each cycle (with usual premedications) VELCADE is administered prior to rituximab and CHOP on day 1 of each cycle. The dose of VELCADE will be determined by the following dose escalation schedule: Level Dose/Schedule (-2) 0.7 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle (-1) 0.7 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 (0) 0.7 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4 (+1) 1.0 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4 (+2) 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial of VELCADE + CHOP-Rituximab in Untreated DLCBL or Mantle Cell NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard CHOP chemotherapy administered every 21 days (full dose) for six cycles Rituximab administered (375 mg/m2) day 1 of each cycle (with usual premedications) VELCADE is administered prior to rituximab and CHOP on day 1 of each cycle. The dose of VELCADE will be determined by the following dose escalation schedule: Once completed six cycles of therapy (~18 weeks), patients will be evaluated every 3 months for the first year post treatment, then every 6 months until disease progression or death for years 2 through 5 post treatment. Patients who have disease progression will be contacted every 6 months until death to assess for survival status.</detailed_description>
