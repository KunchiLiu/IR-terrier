	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that injecting donor bone marrow cells into the recipient thymus gland at the time of heart transplantation in children will prove to be feasible and safe. They further hypothesize that recipients receiving donor bone marrow will experience less acute rejection events with reduced long-term requirements for immunosuppressive medications when compared to controls who do not receive marrow but who are managed under an identical immunosuppressive protocol.</brief_summary>
