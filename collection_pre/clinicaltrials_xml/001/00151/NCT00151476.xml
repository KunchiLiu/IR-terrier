	<criteria>Celecoxib Treated Patients: Diagnosis of FAP based on the expression of the FAP phenotype. Celecoxib treatment prescribed outside of a clinical trial setting with expected duration of celecoxib treatment of at least six months. Historical/Concurrent Control Patients: Diagnosis of FAP based on the expression of the FAP phenotype. Be greater than or equal to 12 years old at the time of study enrollment. Have an endoscopically assessable colonic, rectal, ileal pouch and/or gastroduodenal segment. For the group of postsurgical patients, IRA or IPAA performed from 1985 onward (in order to assure standardized surgical techniques and postsurgical management). Patients whose primary colorectal surgery was performed prior to 1985 will not be eligible to serve as historical controls. Celecoxib Treated Patients: Have received a pharmacological treatment (other than celecoxib) within the last 3 months for their FAP disease including treatment of any extracolonic manifestation of FAP. Have received a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) within the last 3 months, other than celecoxib, for any reason. Historical/Concurrent Control Patients: Have pharmacological treatment recorded for their FAP disease at the defined index date. Have received a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) within the last 3 months for any reason.</criteria>
