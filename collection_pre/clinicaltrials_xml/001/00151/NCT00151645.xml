	<brief_summary>Renal cell carcinoma represents today 3% of the solid tumors of the adult. Their bad prognosis is due to the frequency of metastasis and the resistance to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy (interferon-α, interleukin-2) has shown some good results but an important toxicity. In our study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines an injection of patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with interferon-α and interleukin-2.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Activated Lymphocytes in Renal Cell Carcinoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I and II trials for the treatment of melanoma or renal cell carcinoma have already evaluated lymphokine-activated killer cells and tumor-infiltrating cells. In metastatic renal cell carcinoma, these therapies have shown some complete responses and a low toxicity. In our study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines an injection of patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with interferon-α and interleukin-2. A secondary objective is to improve cell preparation methods and to characterize functionally and phenotypically injected cells.</detailed_description>
