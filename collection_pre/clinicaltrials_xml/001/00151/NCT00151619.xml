	<brief_summary>Patients with congestive heart failure are usually treated with a combination of an ACE inhibitor (or an AT1 blocking agent), a diuretic and a beta-blocker. However, some patients remain symptomatic despite an optimal treatment with these drugs. In patients who also have coronary heart disease, nitrates or some calcium-channel blockers could help to relieve symptoms. Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate the additional benefit induced by a second generation calcium-channel blocker, amlodipine, in patients with chronic heart failure who remain symptomatic despite an optimal treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Amlodipine in the Management of Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with congestive heart failure, a treatment with ACE inhibitor combined with digoxin and a diuretic has shown benefits on morbidity and mortality. However, 40% of these patients have persistant symptoms. The rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers in patients with chronic heart failure lies in their vasodilating action, antiischemic effect, ability to reduce left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The objective of our study is to evaluate the regional and systemic hemodynamic, hormonal and vascular effects and the tolerance to stress test of a 3-months treatment with amlodipine. Patients with stable chronic heart failure (III/IV NYHA) and treated with a combination of enalapril, furosemide and digoxin will be randomized to receive amlodipine 5 or 10 mg or a placebo for a 3-months period.</detailed_description>
