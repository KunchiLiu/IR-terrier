	<brief_summary>In France, 50% of the hepatitis C virus carriers develop chronic clinical hepatitis, which may lead to cirrhosis and liver transplantation. Transplant infection by hepatitis C virus is constant after transplantation. This recurrence usually causes chronic liver disease, in 50 to 80% of the patients. The interest of a long-term treatment with ribavirin alone after transplantation has not been clearly demonstrated. The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of ribavirin as a maintenance treatment after a one year interferon-α / ribavirin therapy on hepatitis C recurrence in the transplanted liver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Recurrent Hepatitis C After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several therapeutic patterns have been described for the treatment of hepatitis C post-transplantation recurrence. A combination treatment associating interferon-α and ribavirin has shown some efficacy, but this efficacy has not been assessed yet in a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. In our study, all included transplanted patients will be treated during 1 year with interferon-α and ribavirin. At the end of this period, they will be randomized to receive a maintenance treatment with ribavirin or a placebo for 1 additional year. Efficacy will be assessed on virological response after 30 months of treatment.</detailed_description>
