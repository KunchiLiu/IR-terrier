	<brief_title>Evaluation of Celsior速 in Liver Transplant Preservation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The quality of organ preservation is a major determinant of initial graft function and survival. Graft viability is based on hypothermia, the organ being stored in a cold preservation solution. Celsior速 has been shown effective for cold preservation of heart and lung and, in laboratory studies, for liver, kidney and pancreas. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Celsior速 in liver transplant preservation. Celsior速 will be considered effective if the failure rate one year after transplantation is not significantly superior to 20% (rate observed in the European transplantation register between 1997 and 2001).</detailed_description>
