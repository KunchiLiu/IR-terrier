	<brief_summary>Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as the presence of serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels within the reference range and a reduced serum thyrotrophin (TSH) level. Evidence is accumulating that it has important clinical effects. The SUBstudy is a randomised, Dutch multicenter trial to study whether radioiodine treatment prevents the development of atrial fibrillation and prevents decreases in bone mineral density in patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subclinical hyperthyroidism [TSH ≤ 0.1 mU/L, fT4 and T3 within the normal range of the own laboratory (determined 2 times in own laboratory) with an interval of at least 2 months]. Endogenous cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism limited to autonomous adenoma or multinodular goiter (diagnosis made by the attending physician, based on palpation and the result of a thyroid scintigram). Informed consent. Medication with antithyroid drugs in the last 3 months (also not allowed during followup); thyroid hormone in the last 3 months (allowed during followup, but TSH levels should be kept between 0.1 mU/L and the upper limit of normal in the own laboratory); and oral glucocorticoids in the last 3 months (allowed during followup when absolutely necessary, but patients in whom glucocorticoids are started cannot be evaluated with respect to changes in bone mineral density [BMD]). Radioiodine therapy in the past. Iodineinduced subclinical hyperthyroidism. Pituitary or hypothalamic insufficiency. Pregnancy. Age &lt;= 40 years. Severe nonthyroidal illness. Drug abuse. Unstable angina pectoris, (history of) atrial fibrillation, (history of) congestive heart failure. (History of) osteoporotic fracture(s). Patients younger than 70 years of age with a bone mineral density Tscore &lt; – 2.5 standard deviations (SD), or older than 70 years of age with a bone mineral density Zscore &lt; 1.0 SD. (These patients can be randomized but in case it is decided to treat them with antiosteoporotic drugs they cannot be evaluated with respect to changes in BMD.) Use of betablockers in the last three months. (These patients can be randomised but cannot be evaluated with respect to general and cardiac symptoms. The same applies to patients in whom betablockers are started during follow up.) Other symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism or obstruction of vital structures which, in the opinion of the attending physician, require active treatment.</criteria>
