	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to compare the use of spinal-epidural versus traditional labor epidural on maternal and fetal effects. The hope is to determine the safest and most effective epidural method of relieving pain during labor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Spinal-Epidural Versus Traditional Labor Epidural</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) was developed to allow excellent pain control for the pregnant woman who arrives in advanced labor and does not have much time for the anesthetic to have its effect. This has been extended recently to women in all stages of labor because of its rapid and excellent control of pain. Recent case series comparing CSE with traditional epidural have shown a slight difference in the rate of hypotension and fetal bradycardia, with the CSE technique having a higher rate of both of these side effects. This study will compare the two techniques in a prospective, randomized method. The aim is to compare the maternal and fetal effects of two neuraxial block techniques for pain control during labor, to document blood pressure changes in upper and lower extremities pre- and post- block placement, and to document side effects (e.g. pruritus) and patient satisfaction with both techniques.</detailed_description>
