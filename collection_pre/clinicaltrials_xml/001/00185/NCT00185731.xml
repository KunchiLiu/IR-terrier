	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. Determine changes in levels of tumor bioactivity upon treatment with atorvastatin. Secondary objective: 2. Determine validity of tumor bioactivity as a biologic endpoint by correlation with clinical response. 3. Determine whether administration of atorvastatin is tolerable and safe in low grade NHL patients. We do not anticipate any significant toxicity since this dose of atorvastatin has been FDA approved for patients with hypercholesterolemia.</brief_summary>

Li creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of childbearing potential must have negative BetaHCG at enrollment Patient has had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study Patient has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than four weeks earlier Patient with stable low grade lymphoma has had rituximab within 3 months Patient with relapsed or refractory disease has had rituximab within 1 month Patient has not recovered from adverse events due to surgery performed 4 weeks earlier Patient is receiving any other investigational agent. Known brain metastases Patient has taken any statin within the past 6 months prior to enrollment in the trial Patient currently abuses alcohol Patient currently takes cyclosporin or gemfibrozil Patient has a prior history of rhabdomyolysis Patient as uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patient is pregnant. Note: Patients are not excluded if they are breastfeeding at the time of enrollment, but breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with atorvastatin.
