	<brief_summary>This double blinded RCT will help to ascertain the usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics in the management of uncomplicated dog bites, utilizing currently best available antibiotics (Augmentin) and an important clinical outcome of infection. By enrolling 100-150 patients in this pilot trial as part of a k-award the investigators plan to utilize the point estimates of infection, side effects and other important outcomes and incorporate these into a cost most to determine the most cost effective management of these wounds and to determine if further study is warranted based on the findings.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients including all children and English speaking/reading persons who present with a full thickness dog bite to participating emergency departments will be considered. NonEnglish speaking/reading subjects for whom we can provide translation for will also be considered. allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid wounds presenting with an active infection (require antibiotics) or greater than 12 hours old. patients with underlying fracture, joint or neurovascular injury, or multiple trauma requiring specialty referral. Specifically any broken skin over a joint will need treatment and be excluded from the study and randomization. patients on immunosuppressive agents, prolonged chronic steroid use (defined as continuous use for &gt; 14 days, 3 times a year) active HIV disease (determined by treating physician on history) or splenectomized.
