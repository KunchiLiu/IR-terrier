	<brief_summary>The study tested a training to improve recognition of abused female patients in family practice.Effect measures of the training were: number of reported cases wherein the doctor suspected and discussed partner abuse and the number of non-obviuos reasons to suspect partner abuse.We assumed that following a training would improve the recognition of abused women. Secondary to this trial we explored gender differences of family doctors in discussing partner abuse and we interviewed women recently identified by their family doctor. Medical histories of recently identified abused women were studied to assess health problems and health-care utilisation.</brief_summary>
