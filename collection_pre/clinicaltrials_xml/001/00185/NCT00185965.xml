	<brief_title>CPG 7909 + Local Radiotherapy in Recurrent Low-Grade Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single institution phase 1-2 trial to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of CpG injections (4 intratumoral injections followed by 6 peri-tumoral injections) combined with local irradiation in patients with recurrent low-grade lymphomas. Patients will receive low-dose radiotherapy to a single tumor site on days 1 and 2 (2 Gy each day). CpG injections will be administered into the same tumor site within the 24 hours before and the 24 hours after the radiation, and on days 8 and 15. Weekly doses of CpG will be then administered subcutaneously in the region of previous injections for 6 additional doses.</detailed_description>

Mycosis fungoides patients must have failed or have been intolerant of at least 2 topical or one systemic treatment. Patients must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral injection of CpG percutaneously Tumor specimens must be available for immunological studies either from a previous biopsy or a new biopsy obtained before the initiation of the treatment. Patients must have measurable disease other than the injection site or biopsy site. 18 years of age or older Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt; 70.

Women of reproductive potential must have negative urine pregnancy test. Life expectancy greater than 4 months. Able to comply with the treatment schedule. A patient may not be enrolled in the trial if any of the following criteria are met. Preexisting autoimmune or antibody mediated disease including: systemic lupus, erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, but excluding controlled thyroid disease, or the presence of autoantibodies without clinical autoimmune disease. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active, prior treatment, or both). Patients with active infection or with a fever &gt;38.50 C within three days prior to the first scheduled treatment. CNS metastases Prior malignancy (active within 5 years of screening) except basal cell or completely excised noninvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar composition to CpG 7909 Current anticoagulant therapy (ASA&lt;= 325mg/day allowed). Significant cardiovascular disease (i.e. NYHA class 3 congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction with the past 6 months; unstable angina; coronary angioplasty with the past 6 months; uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias). Pregnant or lactating. Any other medical history, including laboratory results, deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere with their participation in the study, or to interfere with the interpretation of the results.</criteria>
