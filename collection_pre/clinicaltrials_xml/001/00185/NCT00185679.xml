	<criteria>RECIPIENT INCLUSION CRITERIA Histopathologicallyconfirmed diagnosis of hematological or lymphatic malignancy, defined as one of the following: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as primary refractory disease, or in relapse Acute leukemia in first remission with poor risk factors and molecular prognosis AML with 5,7, t(6;9), tri8, 11 Acute lymphocytic / lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with Phil+ t(9;22),(q34;q11.2), and t(4:11)(q21;23) Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML in accelerated, second chronic phase Myelodysplastic syndrome with high intermediate to high risk categories NonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Refractory &lt; 50 years old at time of registration Donor is related Donor is genotypicallymatched and haploidentical for HLAA, B,C and DRB1, DQ loci Donor differs for 2 or 3 HLA alleles on the unshared haplotype in the GvHD direction No HLAmatched sibling or matched unrelated donor is identified ECOG performance status not more than 2 LVEF &gt; 45% DLCO &gt; 50% corrected for hemoglobin Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min for those above serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL ALT &lt; 2x ULN (unless secondary to disease) Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine betaHCG test within 3 weeks of registration No prior cancer within 5 years with the exception of surgicallycured, nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ cancer of the cervix No prior myeloablative therapy or transplant Dulyexecuted informed consent RECIPIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA Suitable candidate for autologous transplantation Participation in other investigational drugs or devices trials that might influence the study endpoints Evidence of active hepatitis Evidence of active cirrhosis HIVpositive History of invasive aspergillosis Presence of any other uncontrolled, active infection, ie, bacterial, viral or fungal Uncontrolled CNS involvement Documented allergy to murine proteins Documented allergy to iron dextran Lactating female Female of childbearing potential unwilling to implement adequate birth control Medical problem / neurologic/psychiatric dysfunction which would impair his/her ability to be compliant with the medical regimen and/or to tolerate transplantation, in the opinion of the principal investigator Medical problem / neurologic/psychiatric dysfunction which would prolong hematologic recovery and place the recipient at unacceptable risk, in the opinion of the principal investigator would . DONOR INCLUSION CRITERIA Age &lt; 60 years Weight &gt; 25 kg Medical history and physical examination confirm good health status as defined by institutional standards Within 30 days of apheresis collection, seronegative for HIV assessed as HIV Ag; HIV 1+2 Ab; or HTLV I/II Ab Within 30 days of apheresis collection, seronegative for hepatitis assessed as HBsAg; HBcAb (IgM and IgG); or HCV Ab Within 30 days of apheresis collection, seronegative for syphilis assessed as RPR Genotypically haploidentical as determined by HLA typing Female donors of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine betaHCG test within 3 weeks of mobilization Capable of undergoing leukapheresis Has adequate venous access Willing to undergo insertion of a central catheter should leukapheresis via peripheral vein be inadequate Agreeable to second donation of PBPC (or a bone marrow harvest) should the recipient fail to demonstrate sustained engraftment following the transplant Dulyexecuted informed consent Screened for CMV seroreactivity Must be seronegative donor if recipeint is seronegative. Otherwise the donor will be selected on the ability of NK cell alloreactivity based upon HLA typing results and donors who are capable of NK cell alloreactivity will be used preferentially. DONOR EXCLUSION CRITERIA Evidence of active infection (including urinary tract infection, or upper respiratory tract infection) Evidence of hepatitis (on screening) Medical, physical or psychological reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or cooperate with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis Factors placing donor at increased risk for leukapheresis or GCSFrelated complications Lactating female Female of childbearing potential unwilling to implement adequate birth control HIVpositive</criteria>
