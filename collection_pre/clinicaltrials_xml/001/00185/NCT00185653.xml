	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the toxicity and feasibility of non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants for multiple myeloma from unrelated donors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mixed Chimera Allogeneic Transplantation From Matched Unrelated Donors For The Treatment Of Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the protocol is to evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of this mixed chimerism matched unrelated donor allogeneic transplant approach for patients with multiple myeloma. Response, toxicity, survival and graft-versus-host disease will be evaluated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>a) Multiple myeloma which is responsive to therapy. Eligible patients may have early or relapsed disease. Patients must have Stage IIIII disease or have progression after initial treatment of Stage I disease. Patients who have relapsed following autologous transplantation may be eligible for this protocol. b) Age &lt;= 60 years. c) No prior therapy which would preclude the use of lowdose total body irradiation. d) Patients must have their pathology reviewed and the diagnosis confirmed at Stanford University Medical Center. Patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, or amyloidosis will be excluded from this study. e) Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70%. f) DLCO &gt;= 60% predicted. g) ALT and AST must be &lt; 2X normal. Total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl. h) Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 or 24hour creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min. i) Patients must be HIV negative. j) Pregnant or lactating women will not be eligible to participate. k) Patients must provide signed, informed consent. a) Severe psychological or medical illness b) Patients who have undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation will not be eligible for this study. c) Patients who have an HLAidentical sibling donor will be excluded</criteria>
