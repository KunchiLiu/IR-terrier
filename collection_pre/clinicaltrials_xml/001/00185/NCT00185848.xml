	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether [18F]FHBG is suitable for use as an imaging probe in cancer or rheumatoid arthritis patients enrolled in cell or gene therapy trials. In this phase 1 study we will assess the safety and biodistribution of [18F]FHBG in patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The success of cell and gene therapy depends on specific targeting of the therapeutic gene or cell that is administered to the patient. Our goal is to develop an imaging method to non-invasively monitor the location of the therapeutic gene or cell. Imaging should help in the design of better protocols and potentially reduce side-effects of cell and gene therapy.</detailed_description>
