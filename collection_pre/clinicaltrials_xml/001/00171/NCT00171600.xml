	<brief_summary>Title: Antialbuminuric effect of valsartan, lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril in non-diabetic and diabetic renal disease: a randomized (3:3:1), open label, parallel group, 20 weeks follow-up. Objective: To evaluate the antialbuminuric effect of high doses of valsartan vs lisinopril vs combo treatment in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Hypothesis: Combo treatment reduces microalbuminuria and the albumin/creatinine ratio more than monotherapies.. Design: Multicentric, randomized, open label, parallel group, active controlled. Dose / regimen: Valsartan 320 vs Lisinopril 40 vs Valsartan/lisinopril 160/20 Primary Endpoint: Antialbuminuric effect of valsartan 320 mg, lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril 40 mg in non-diabetic and diabetic renal disease following 5 months of follow-up. Description % of change in albuminuria from baseline at 20 weeks. Secondary Endpoint : To investigate the effect of 5 months treatment with valsartan,lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril in GFR (Cl creatinine), also to investigate the effect of 5 months treatment with valsartan, lisinopril and valsartan plus lisinopril on blood pressure and the effect on left ventricular mass index using electrocardiogram and Cornell-Sokolow method.</brief_summary>
