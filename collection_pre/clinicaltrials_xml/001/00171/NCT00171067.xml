	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare if the combination of valsartan 320 mg/lisinopril 20 mg versus the monotherapies of lisinopril 40 mg or valsartan 320 mg will result in a greater decrease of urinary albumin excretion measured as urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) in the first morning urine of hypertensive subjects with previously diagnosed microalbuminuria (MAU).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with mild to moderate hypertension with a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) &gt; 85 and &lt; 110 mmHg for nontreated patients. Previously treated patients with MSDBP &lt; 110 mmHg. Treated is defined as having taken medication until &lt; 2 days prior to Visit 1 Positive urine spot test with Micral dipstick (detection of urinary albumin concentration of at least 50 mg/l) at Visit 1 (day 21). Confirmation of MAU of at least 2 out of 3 measurements determined in the first morning urine samples performed at Visit 1 day21), Visit 2 (day 14) or Visit 3 (day 7). MAU is defined for male patients as urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) &gt; 2.5 mg/mmol and &lt; 25.0 mg/mmol and for female patients as UACR &gt; 3.5 mg/mmol and &lt; 35.0 mg/mmol at both visits. Evidence of renal impairment as determined by any one of the following: serum creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min as determined by Cockroft and Gault formula [Cockroft and Gault, 1976] and/or serum creatinine &gt; 1.25 x ULN at Visit 1, a history of dialysis, or a history of nephrotic syndrome. Serum potassium values &lt;3.5 mmol/l or &gt;5.5 mmol/l at Visit 1 Any medical condition which might significantly alter the urinary excretion of albumin Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
