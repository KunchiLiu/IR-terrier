	<criteria>Diagnosis of at least one cancerrelated bone lesion in cancer patients, confirmed by Xray, MRT or computer tomography Severity of pain ≥ 5 on item 3 of the BPI which is caused by the bone lesion(s) and requires radiotherapy Adequate liver function serum total bilirubin concentration less than 1.5 x the upper limit of normal value Expected survival time ≥ 6 months If the patient is of childbearing potential: negative pregnancy test at screening ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2. Written informed consent Prior treatment with an oral bisphosphonate for more than 3 months or more than 3 intravenous (i.v.) bisphosphonate applications Bisphosphonate treatment within 6 months before study start Previous radiotherapy of the painful areas to be irradiated. An initiation of radiotherapy for the target area(s) up to 3 days at maximum prior to the first infusion is allowed. Skeletonrelated complications (e.g., pathological fractures, orthopedic intervention to treat or stabilize an osteolytic defect, spinal cord compression) during the last 3 weeks prior to the first infusion of trial medication. Initiation of a new chemotherapeutic treatment regimen during the last 2 weeks prior to the first infusion of trial medication Abnormal renal function as evidenced by a calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/minute. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) is calculated using the CockcroftGault formula: CrCl = [140age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)] Corrected (adjusted for serum albumin) serum calcium concentration &lt; 8.0 mg/dl (2.00 mmol/L) or ≥ 12.0 mg/dl (3.00 mmol/L). Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases History of diseases with influence on bone metabolism such as Paget's disease and primary hyperparathyroidism Pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential not on a medically recognized form of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives or implants, intrauterine device [IUD], vaginal diaphragm or sponge, or condom with spermicide) Current active dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or mandibular); dental or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), of exposed bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after dental procedures. Recent (within 6 weeks) or planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g. extraction, implants) Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
