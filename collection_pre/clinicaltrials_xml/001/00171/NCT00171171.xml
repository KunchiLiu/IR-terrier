	<brief_summary>Because patients with beta-thalassemia are unable to actively eliminate iron from the body, toxic and eventually lethal levels of iron can accumulate as a result of repeated blood transfusions. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of deferasirox.</brief_summary>
