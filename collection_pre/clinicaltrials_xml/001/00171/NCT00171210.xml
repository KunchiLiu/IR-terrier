	<brief_summary>A 1-year randomized Phase III core trial (NCT00061750) using deferoxamine as the comparator was conducted to investigate the efficacy of deferasirox in regularly transfused patients with β-thalassemia 2 years of age and older. Patients who successfully completed this main trial may continue in this extension trial to receive chelation therapy with deferasirox for an additional 4 years. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of deferasirox in regularly transfused patients with β-thalassemia 2 years of age and older.</brief_summary>
