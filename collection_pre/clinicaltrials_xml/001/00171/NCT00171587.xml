	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of vatalanib administered orally once daily in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced cancer. The study is also designed to determine the effect of vatalanib on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of vatalanib, and to describe the anti-tumor activity of this combination regimen.</brief_summary>
