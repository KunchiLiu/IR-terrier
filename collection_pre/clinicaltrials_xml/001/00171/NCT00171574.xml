	<brief_summary>Title: Antiproteinuric effect of valsartan, lisinopril and valsartan versus lisinopril in non-diabetic and diabetic renal disease: a randomized (3:3:1), double blind, parallel group, controlled trial, 5 months follow-up. Objective: To evaluate the antiproteinuric effect of high doses of valsartan vs combo treatment in no-diabetic and diabetic patients. Hypothesis: Combo treatment reduces microalbuminuria, proteinuria and the albumin/creatinin ratio more than monotherapies. Design: Multicentric, randomized, double blind, parallel group, active controlled. Dose / regimen Valsartan 320 vs Lisinopril 40 vs Valsartan/lisinopril 160/20</brief_summary>
