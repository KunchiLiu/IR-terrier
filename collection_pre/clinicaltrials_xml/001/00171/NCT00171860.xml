	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are: 1. Evaluation of the safety profile of imatinib mesylate in patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome resistant or refractory to, or intolerant of, prednisone, hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha, or untreated patients carrying the Fip1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein. 2. Evaluation of the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome 3. Analysis of patient's blood samples for the detection of activated kinases.</brief_summary>
