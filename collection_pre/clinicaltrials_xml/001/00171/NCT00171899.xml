	<brief_summary>The study will assess the role of high-dose imatinib mesylate, in patients who have taken imatinib mesylate for at least 1 year at the standard dose, in achieving a major molecular response (a measure of the level of chronic myelogenous leukemia) versus the standard dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Chronic myelogenous leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome 18 years and older Patients must have been taking imatinib mesylate standard dose for at least 12 months and have achieved a complete cytogenetic response but not a major molecular response. Patients with cardiac problems such as congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Patients with an uncontrolled medical disease such as uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal (kidney) disease or active uncontrolled infection. Patients with other current primary malignancy or malignancy requiring active intervention Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
