	<brief_summary>To allow patients treated with deferasirox in the core study to continue iron chelation therapy for 2 years or until the drug became locally commercially available. To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of deferasirox by measuring treatment success, change in liver iron content (LIC) and change in serum ferritin levels. Safety was mainly assessed by incidence of adverse events (AEs)and clinically significant lab parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Deferasirox Treatment in Beta-thalassemia Patients With Transfusional Hemosiderosis (Study Amended to 2-year Duration)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron accumulation is an inevitable consequence of chronic blood transfusions and results in serious complications in the absence of chelation treatment to remove excess iron. Deferasirox (Exjade, ICL670) is an oral chelator with high iron-binding potency and selectivity. This extension study aimed at collecting efficacy and safety data during 2 years of treatment with deferasirox in the extension study or until deferasirox became commercially available in the countries where the centers were located, whichever came first. The population comprised of Î²-thalassemia patients with transfusional hemosiderosis who could not be satisfactorily treated with deferoxamine or deferiprone.</detailed_description>
