	<criteria>Patients with mild and moderate hypertension defined by a MSSBP ≥ 140 mmHG and &lt; 180 mmHG at Visits 1 and 2 for treated and untreated patients Chronic hemodialysis for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 as substitution therapy. If treated with epoetin: patients with a stable hematocrit ≤ 40% (± 5%). Inability to discontinue angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) safely for a period of 1 week, as required by the protocol. Treatment with more than 3 different compounds for the treatment of hypertension at Visit 1. Atrial fibrillation Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
