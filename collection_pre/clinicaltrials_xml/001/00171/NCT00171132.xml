	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to show that valsartan compared to atenolol has favorable effects on exercise capacity, quality of life, diastolic function and elevated blood pressure in hypertensive postmenopausal overweight women with impaired exercise tolerance despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).</brief_summary>
