	<brief_title>Study of Motexafin Gadolinium With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Followed by Stereotactic Radiosurgery Boost in the Treatment of Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive three weeks of whole brain radiation therapy concurrent with daily motexafin gadolinium during weeks 2 and 3, followed by a stereotactic radiosurgery boost concurrent with motexafin gadolinium. Patients will be followed for radiologic response, neurologic progression, and neurocognitive progression.</detailed_description>
