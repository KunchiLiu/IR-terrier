	<brief_summary>In the setting of acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks), the principle objective of the WEST Study is to compare the impact on clinical outcomes of 3 different treatment strategies. The first is using medical (drug) therapy alone with standard care. The second strategy is identical medical (drug) therapy as the first group combined with early heart catheterization (within 24 hours) for angiography and if required, intervention. The third treatment strategy is direct admission (within 3 hrs) to the heart catheterization lab for angioplasty. WEST patients will be enrolled at first medical contact (using emergency medical services, e.g. ambulance) if possible or through Emergency Departments in participating health care facilities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Which Therapy for Acute Heart Attacks? (The WEST Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective of WEST is to compare the impact on clinical outcomes of the following three treatment groups defined as Group A: optimal pharmacologic therapy (prompt administration of tenecteplase (TNKase) and enoxaparin) at the earliest point of medical contact with usual post MI care; Group B: an identical pharmacological reperfusion strategy followed by an early invasive strategy including timely mechanical intervention, Group C: timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), undertaken after enoxaparin and an oral loading dose of clopidogrel. The secondary objective of WEST is to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving optimal pharmacologic therapy and a strategy of usual post-MI care, Group A versus protocol-mandated early catheterisation and PCI, Group B.</detailed_description>
