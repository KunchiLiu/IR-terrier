	<brief_title>The Use of Music Therapy in the Prevention of Falls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls are a serious health issue and are the greatest cause of death in the elderly. The use of music therapy in fall prevention has not been reported in the literature. This investigation will provide experimental support to the assumption that music therapy may prevent falls and that certain music can affect increases in postural stability using randomly selected subjects, validated posturography and a full experimental design. Computer dynamic posturography (CDP) tests will provide stability scores in volunteer subjects who have had no previous history of falls or vertigo. Subjects will be randomized into several different music listening groups and one control group. Examiners will be blinded as to the music listened to and the outcome measurements. Subjects will be blinded as to their posturographic measurements. The music listening groups will be given a daily specific music listening task. CDP tests will be obtained 10 minutes, 1 week and 1 month after subject's treatment. Music selection will include Mozart, Nolwenn Leroy and others suggested to change human stability.</detailed_description>
