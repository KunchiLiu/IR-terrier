	<brief_title>Additivity Study: Additive Effect on Eye Pressure of Azopt and Alphagan P to Travatan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to compare the effect on the pressure inside the eye when Brinzolamide Ophthalmic Suspension, 1% (Azopt), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15% (Alphagan-P), an alpha 2 agonist, are added to Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% (Travatan), a prostaglandin, in patients with primary open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Brinzolamide Ophthalmic Suspension, 1% (Azopt), Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15% (Alphagan-P), and Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% (Travatan) are all currently approved by the FDA and on the market, being used by patients. Even though all three medications are currently approved for the purpose of the study they will be considered study medicines. Glaucoma, Ocular Hypertension and Pseudoexfoliation syndrome have been treated with IOP-lowering medications or surgery to lower the pressure inside the eye to reduce the risk of visual field loss. Today, common treatments for a patient often begins with the prescription of a prostaglandin (Travoprost). If the prostaglandin does not lower the pressure inside the eye enough, a second drug is usually added. Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Brinzolamide) and alpha 2 agonists (Brimonidine) are common choices as additive medicines.</detailed_description>

Childbearing potential is defined as any woman who is not postmenopausal (12 months without a menstrual period) or surgically sterile.
