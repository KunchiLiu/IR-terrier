	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a consequence of liver cirrhosis. In early tumour stages, tumour resection or liver transplantation are therapeutic options; later tumour stages may be treated with locally ablative treatments such as percutaneous ethanol instillation (PEI), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radio-frequency thermoablation. This randomized study investigates the effect of PEI on survival of patients with HCC. All patients will receive hormonal treatment (long-acting somatostatin intramuscularly [i.m.]) and will be randomized for treatment with PEI or no additional treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Long-Acting Somatostatin Plus Percutaneous Ethanol Instillation (PEI) Versus Long-Acting Somatostatin Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized two-arm parallel group study. - Study group: PEI + long-acting somatostatin - Control group: long-acting somatostatin alone Aims of the study: - Does treatment with PEI+ long-acting somatostatin prolong survival as compared to treatment with long-acting somatostatin alone? - Can time to tumour progression be extended in patients treated with PEI + long-acting somatostatin as compared to treatment with long-acting somatostatin alone?</detailed_description>
