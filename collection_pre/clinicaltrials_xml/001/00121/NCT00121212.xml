	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography using carbon-11 acetate, may help find metastases from prostate cancer and may help predict whether prostate cancer will come back after treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well positron emission tomography using carbon-11 acetate works in finding metastases and predicting recurrence in patients with prostate cancer who are at risk for recurrence after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this project is determination of the role of PET in patients with newly diagnosed medium- and high-risk prostate cancer in whom the standard clinical and imaging workup is negative. Thus, the incremental value of PET will be determined in this important group.</detailed_description>
