	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-blinded randomized phase III trial. Patients will be post-surgically stratified at inclusion first according to the participating institution, then according to menopausal status and will be randomly assigned to receive either: - TAC: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks (q3w) in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks. - FAC: 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel in Combination With Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAC) Versus 5-Fluorouracil in Combination With Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (5 FAC) as Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: - To compare disease-free survival (DFS) after treatment with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) to 5-Fluorouracil in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as adjuvant treatment of high risk operable breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes. Secondary objectives: - To compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 above mentioned arms. - To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 2 above mentioned arms. - To evaluate pathologic markers for predicting efficacy (hormonal receptors and c-erB-2).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent Operable breast cancer patients (T1T3) with negative axillary lymph nodes (10 axillary nodes dissection) and high risk criteria according to St. Gallen consensus criteria. Histologically proven breast cancer. Interval between surgery and registration is less than 60 days. Definitive surgical treatment must be either mastectomy, or breast conservative surgery. Margins of resected specimen from surgery must be histologically free of invasive adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS). Lobular carcinoma insitu is not considered as positive margin.

Karnofsky performance status index &gt; 80 %. Adequate hepatic, renal and heart functions. Adequate hematology levels. Negative pregnancy test Prior systemic anticancer therapy for breast cancer (immunotherapy, hormonotherapy, chemotherapy). Prior anthracycline therapy or taxoids (paclitaxel, docetaxel) for any malignancy. Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer. Bilateral invasive breast cancer. Pregnant, or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate nonhormonal contraceptive measures during study treatment . Any T4 or N13 or M1 breast cancer. Preexisting motor or sensory neurotoxicity of a severity grade 2 by NCI criteria. Other serious illness or medical condition Past or current history of neoplasm other than breast carcinoma. Ipsilateral ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS) of the breast. Lobular carcinoma insitu (LCIS) of the breast. Chronic treatment with corticosteroids unless initiated &gt; 6 months prior to study entry and at low dose Concurrent treatment with ovarian hormonal replacement therapy. Prior treatment should be stopped before study entry. Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to study entry. Concurrent treatment with any other anticancer therapy.
