	<brief_summary>A growing body of evidence links Chlamydia pneumoniae to the progression of coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the positive and negative effect of 14 days treatment with clarithromycin 500 mg daily in patients already suffering from stable coronary heart disease. The participants will be followed for at least two years after the treatment. Abbott Laboratories supplied Clarithromycin and placebo tablets.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CLARICOR Trial: Effect of Clarithromycin on Mortality and Morbidity in Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basic science suggests a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of coronary heart disease (CHD), and a large number of clinical studies have reported an association between markers of inflammation and CHD. Consequently, infectious agents have been proposed as promoters of atherosclerosis and/or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Many studies have suggested a relation between Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection and CHD, and C. pneumoniae has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic tissue. Macrolide antibiotics are effective in eradication of C. pneumoniae from atherosclerotic plaques. Two small trials showed significant beneficial effects of macrolides on cardiovascular morbidity in patients with ACS. To corroborate and extend these findings, we undertook a randomised, placebo-controlled trial with clarithromycin in patients with stable CHD in order to test the hypothesis that intervention with a macrolide would reduce cardiovascular risk with regard to mortality and morbidity.</detailed_description>
