	<brief_summary>Intramuscular (IM) administration of HIV lipopeptide vaccines have been shown to be able to induce HIV-1-specific T cell-mediated immune responses. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of LIPO-4 vaccine (HIV lipopeptides including 4 peptides from Gag, Pol, RT and Nef HIV-1 proteins, each peptide linked to TT) intradermally (ID) compared to IM administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dose-sparing strategies that use intradermal (ID) delivery of vaccines may be one approach for improving a vaccines immunogenicity and reducing the cost of vaccines. In this study, 68 HIV-negative healthy adult volunteers, 21-55 years old, all belonging to the "Volunteers for a Vaccine" network set up by ANRS, were randomized to receive at weeks 0, 4, and 12, either 3 IM doses of 0.5 ml of LIPO-4 containing 500 µg of each peptide (n= 35 volunteers), or 3 ID doses of 0.1 ml, containing 100 µg of each peptide (n=33 volunteers). Total follow-up was 48 weeks. Safety was assessed clinically and by laboratory tests. Participants were given diary cards to record adverse events. HIV-1 immune responses were assessed by ELISPOT and lymphoproliferative assay at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 24, and 48</detailed_description>
