	<brief_summary>This study is not being conducted in the United States. Patients who are intolerant of topical corticosteroids (TCS) have either experienced an adverse event resulting from the use of TCS, or require unacceptable levels of exposure to TCS in order to control their AD. This is of particular concern for patients with recurrent flares on delicate skin areas such as the head and neck. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pimecrolimus cream 1%, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is efficacious in treating mild to moderate head and neck AD in patients who are intolerant of, or dependent on topical corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
