	<brief_summary>This is a prospective study to determine whether the Atkins diet reduces seizures, creates ketosis, and is well tolerated in adults with epilepsy. Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled, expecting 20 to complete the 6-month study. The investigators plan to establish the seizure baseline and type, initiate the Atkins diet, then monitor its administration in terms of seizure reduction, ketosis, and side effects for a 6-month period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients are seen in the Johns Hopkins General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) and started on a modified Atkins diet (15g/day of carbohydrates). Medications remain unchanged and labs are drawn. Followup is at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months into the study. After 1 month, carbohydrates and medications can be altered. Ketosis (urine) is measured by patients semiweekly, weight weekly, and seizures daily and recorded on a calendar. This study is ongoing with approximately 20 patients of 30 enrolled as of February 2006.</detailed_description>
