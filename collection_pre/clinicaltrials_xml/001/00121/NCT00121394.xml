	<brief_title>Chlorhexidine Vaginal and Infant Wash in Pakistan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis in mother and infant is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings. Several studies have investigated the likelihood that an anti-bacterial agent, chlorhexidine, administered during labor and delivery to mother and infant could reduce the risk of infection and of subsequent maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. In this trial, chlorhexidine wash and placebo will be randomly administered to women in labor and newborn infants in a public hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Delivery attendants will administer 0.6% chlorhexidine solution every four hours until delivery (4 washes maximum) and one neonatal wash with the same solution. The control group will receive 200 ml of sterile physiologic saline solution. A total of 5000 women will be randomized in the hospital study, 2500 control and 2500 intervention. All women and infants will be evaluated 24 hours post delivery and at a 7-day follow-up. Women who delivered at home will also receive a 28 days post-partum assessment. Women will be carefully monitored for side effects to the dosage. In addition a community-based feasibility trial of 200 patients (100 CHX, 100 control) will be completed.</detailed_description>
