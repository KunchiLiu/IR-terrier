	<brief_title>GN Tobacco Use Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking is regarded as one of the few potentially preventable factors associated with low birth weight, very preterm birth and perinatal death. In an effort to determine the prevalence of tobacco use (smoking and smokeless tobacco) and to collect relevant data in support of a potential smoking prevention or cessation intervention, a multi-site tobacco use survey is being conducted in several countries. The survey will be used to obtain information on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors among pregnant women in diverse populations regarding tobacco products. The primary outcome is tobacco use status during pregnancy. Secondary outcomes include: knowledge and attitudes regarding tobacco products, health hazards of tobacco use and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure. Sample size of 750 per country was calculated under the assumptions that the prevalence of tobacco use could be as low as 0.05 with a coefficient of variation of approximately 15% and a prevalence of 0.10 with a CV of approximately 11%.</detailed_description>
