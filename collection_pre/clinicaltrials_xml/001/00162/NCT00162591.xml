	<brief_title>Bispectral Index as an Analgesia Monitoring in Severely Ill Patient: Effect of Remifentanyl</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain is difficult to estimate in ICU because most of the patients are sedated. Bispectral index could be helpful in detecting this pain in ICU patients. Remifentanil is a morphinomimetic product with short half life that could be interesting for short nociceptive stimuli, as bronchoalveolar lavage. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of remifentanil infusion on bispectral index (BIS) variations during bronchoalveolar lavage. It is a prospective, double blind study, versus placebo on 40 sedated and critically ill patients. The hypothesis is that BIS can study analgesia in sedated patient.</detailed_description>
