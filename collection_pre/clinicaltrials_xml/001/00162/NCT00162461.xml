	<brief_summary>The use of phenytoin metabolism to produce S-HPPH accounts for more than 85% of its metabolism. This metabolic pathway is mediated by the activity of CYP2C9. The purpose of the present study is: 1. To confirm the use of phenytoin metabolic ratio as a marker of CYP2C9 activity 2. To correlate phenytoin metabolic ratio with CYP2C9 genotype 3. To study the frequency distribution of CYP2C9 activity in-vivo</brief_summary>
