	<brief_summary>Folic acid supplementation has been shown previously to be associated with enhanced formation of p-HPPH from phenytoin, a metabolic pathway which is predominantly mediated through the activity of CYP2C9. The metabolism of S warfarin, the more active enantiomer of warfarin, is also mediated predominantly through the activity of CYP2C9. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between folic acid concentration and warfarin pharmacokinetic as well as warfarin dose requirement among patients treated by warfarin. In addition the effect of folic acid supplementation (5 mg/d) for 3 weeks on warfarin pharmacokinetic and warfarin dose requirement will be evaluated in the second part of the study.</brief_summary>
