	<brief_summary>The response to salbutamol varies greatly among individuals. Data from previous studies indicate that some of the variability is accounted for by genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding for the adrenoceptor subtype β2. The current study was designed to evaluate variability in the response to salbutamol among recently diagnosed patients who have not been treated by β2 agonists or corticosteroids. Lung function tests will be performed prior to and following a single dose administration of salbutamol through inhalation. Additional pharmacodynamic indices will be monitored including pulse and blood pressure. Three samples of plasma will be drawn for the evaluation of salbutamol plasma concentration.</brief_summary>
