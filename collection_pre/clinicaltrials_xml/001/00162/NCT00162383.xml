	<brief_summary>The ability to metabolize drugs varies greatly among individuals. Major fraction of this variability lies in genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding for enzymes responsible for both phase I and phase II reactions. The purpose of this study ws to evaluate the phenotypic activity and the frequency of genetic polymorphisms in different phase II and phase I enzymes among various populations residing in Israel.</brief_summary>
