	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether IMMUNATE S/D is effective and safe in the treatment of hemophilia A patients. The study consists of 3 parts: Part 1 is a pharmacokinetic comparison of IMMUNATE S/D and its predecessor IMMUNATE. Part 2 is an evaluation of efficacy and safety of IMMUNATE S/D. Part 3 is a pharmacokinetic study of IMMUNATE S/D.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Plasma factor VIII level as follows: for Parts 1 &amp; 3: Subjects with severe hemophilia A (plasma baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 1% measured at time of screening) for Part 2: Subjects with severe (plasma baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 1% measured at time of screening) or moderately severe hemophilia A (plasma baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 2% measured at time of screening) Males &gt;= 12 but &lt;= 65 years of age &gt;= 35 kg body weight Previously treated with factor VIII concentrate(s) for a minimum of 150 exposure days (as documented in the subject's medical history) Evidence of a protective titer to HAV and HBV at the time of screening Immunocompetent as defined by a CD4+ lymphocyte count &gt;400/mm3 and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500 Signed informed consent obtained from subject or legally authorized representative Documented history of inhibitor to factor VIII with a titer &gt;= 0.8 BU Current evidence of inhibitor to factor VIII with a titer &gt;= 0.8 BU, measured at the time of screening Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL) HIVseropositive individuals with any of the following at the time of screening: CD4+ lymphocyte count &gt;400/mm3 AIDSrelated complex symptomatic AIDS Note: HIVseropositive subjects with an absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count &gt; 400/mm3 are eligible to participate. HIVseropositive subjects receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens are eligible for enrollment if they are not excluded by the above criteria Active hepatic disease (ALT and AST levels &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal) Clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic cirrhosis including (but not limited to) a recent and persistent INR (international normalized ratio) &gt; 1.4, the presence of splenomegaly and/or significant spider angiomata on physical exam, and/or a history of esophageal hemorrhage or documented esophageal varices Known hypersensitivity to IMMUNATE The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug study, or has participated in any clinical study involving an investigational drug within 30 days of study entry The subject is currently receiving, or is scheduled to receive during the course of the study, an immunomodulating drug other than antiretroviral chemotherapy (e.g., ainterferon, steroids at a dose greater than 10 mg/day) The subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to perform study procedures</criteria>
