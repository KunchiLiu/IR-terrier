	<brief_summary>Determine the predictive value of CARDIOLITE速 rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to define a pediatric population with Kawasaki Disease (KD) at high and low risk of developing cardiac events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Use and Safety of CARDIOLITE速 in Pediatric Patients With Kawasaki Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine how well CARDIOLITE速 rest and stress myocardial (heart) imaging can define the pediatric Kawasaki disease (KD) population into high and low risk categories of developing cardiac (heart) events (complications) from 1 year through 3 years after image completion. The safety of CARDIOLITE速 rest and stress heart imaging will also be studied.</detailed_description>
