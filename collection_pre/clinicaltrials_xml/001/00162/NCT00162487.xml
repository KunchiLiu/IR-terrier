	<brief_summary>Several studies have indicated that albuterol administered either intravenously or by inhalation can significantly reduce plasma potassium concentration in patients suffering from chronic renal failure.In conjunction with the decrease in potassium concentration a modest rise in glucose concentration is usually noted. These metabolic effects are characterized by rapid onset occurring as early as 3-5 minutes following salbutamol administration and lasting for at least 1 hour. The role played by ß2AR polymorphisms in determining the bronchial and vascular response to ß2AR agonist drugs, have been confirmed by several studies. The purpose of the present study is to examine possible causal relationships between genetically based alteration in the structure of ß2AR and the metabolic effects of inhaled albuterol.</brief_summary>
