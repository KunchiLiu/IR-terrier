	<brief_title>A Study of Stress Echocardiography in Post-Menopausal Women at Risk for Coronary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial is designed to determine the prognostic value of stress echocardiography as a screening examination in peri-, or post-menopausal female patients with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) based on risk factors to identify patients at higher risk of experiencing future cardiac events.Female patients who are able to adequately exercise will undergo a symptom-limited exercise echocardiogram. Patients who are unable to adequately exercise or are predicted to be unable to exercise adequately (because of orthopedic/neurologic limitations, lung disease or debility), will perform dobutamine stress echocardiography. All patients will receive DEFINITY at rest and stress to enhance wall motion assessment.</detailed_description>
