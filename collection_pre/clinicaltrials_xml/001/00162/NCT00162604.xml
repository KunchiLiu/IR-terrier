	<brief_summary>Prolapse of the uterus, bladder and rectum is a common condition in multiparous and/or elderly women. The number of operations for vaginal repair is increasing in Denmark, but there is no consensus or evidence found about the efficiency of prophylactic antibiotics intraoperatively concerning postoperative infections. The objective of this randomized, controlled trial is to investigate the significance of prophylactic antibiotic treatment in vaginal repair operations.</brief_summary>
