	<brief_title>Prevention of CHOP-induced Chronic Cardiotoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doxorubicin has been one of the most important key drugs in treatment for malignancies. However, its use is limited by dose-dependent cumulative cardiotoxicity. This multi-centers trial was designed to investigate the preventive effect of Valsartan, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) on chronic cardiotoxicity due to doxorubicin based chemotherapy. Patients with untreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who are scheduled to receive at least 6 courses of the standard CHOP (-R) will be randomized by the minimization methods to the treatment group with Valsartan (80mg once daily by oral during entire 6 courses of CHOP) or control group. Cardiac function will be evaluated in detail before and after 3 and 6 courses of CHOP (-R).</detailed_description>
