	<brief_title>Fascia Iliaca Compartment Blockade as Analgesia for Hip Fractures in the Acute Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture patients have severe pain in the acute phase. Traditional analgesic treatment have consisted of intramuscular morphine with its associated side effects.
