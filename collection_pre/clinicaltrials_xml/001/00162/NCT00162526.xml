	<brief_summary>The present protocol is an attempt to prevent/treat mucositis in highly susceptible patients subjected to maximally tolerated doses of subsequently-myeloablative or myeloablative doses of chemoradiotherapy supported by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation. Mucositis is a major problem in the management of transplant recipients which subjects the patients to the risk of sepsis, need for parenteral nutrition and need of narcotics. We are planning a 2 arm study, comparing 2 safe vitamin E based formulations with placebo.</brief_summary>
