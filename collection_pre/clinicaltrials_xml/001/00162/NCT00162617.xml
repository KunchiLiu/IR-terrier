	<brief_title>The Effect of Liberal vs. Restrictive Transfusion Strategies on Rehabilitation After Hip Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of liberal vs restrictive transfusion regimens after hip fracture surgery is unresolved. Liberal transfusion regimens (transfusion trigger hgb. 6.25 mmol/l) leads to an increased use of blood products but may impact positively on rehabilitation outcome, a restrictive transfusion trigger (hbg. 5.0 mmol/l) saves blood products but may also impair postoperative rehabilitation and outcome. the study randomizes 120 elderly patients with hip fractures to either a restrictive or a liberal perioperative transfusion therapy and measures postoperative rehabilitation outcomes within a well defined multimodal rehabilitation regimen.</detailed_description>
