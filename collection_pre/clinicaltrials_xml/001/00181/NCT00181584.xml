	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid to Prevent Bone Loss During Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients will be randomized into 2 groups. At the screening visit, a bone mineral density test will be performed to determine if the patient has osteoporosis or not. Patients with osteoporosis will be treated with Zometa. Patients without osteoporosis will be randomly assigned to receive either Zometa or a placebo. - Zometa is administered intravenously over a 15 minute prior once in this one year study. - All patients will asked to take an over-the-counter oral calcium (500mg daily) and a daily multi-vitamin (containing 400-500 I.U of vitamin D) during the study. - All patients will have clinic visits every 3 months for blood tests and to report any side effects they may be experiencing. At month 12, a bone mineral density test will be repeated.</detailed_description>
