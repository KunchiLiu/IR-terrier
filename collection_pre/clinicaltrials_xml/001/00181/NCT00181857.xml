	<brief_summary>The researchers plan to explore the validity of the category of ADHD NOS by identifying the risk for ADHD in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of ADHD in these children. The researchers hypothesize that the rate of ADHD will be higher in the children of the ADHD NOS probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings of proband children with ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of school failure (as measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and placement in special classes) than their non-ADHD siblings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the Children of Adults With ADHD Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to explore the validity of the category of ADHD NOS by identifying the risk for ADHD in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of ADHD in these children. We hypothesize the rate of ADHD will be higher in the children of the ADHD NOS probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings of proband children with ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of school failure (as measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and placement in special classes) than their non-ADHD siblings. The proposed study includes a one-time fifteen minute survey derived from the ADHD module of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders - Epidemiological Version (KSADS-E) with the proband of an ADHD NOS study regarding his/her children, in order to assess possible ADHD symptoms of that child. We also ask "school questions" regarding certain aspects of a child's educational experience.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must be a biological child of an ADHD NOS proband. The proband must meet the following criterion: 1. Age: above 18 years 2. Sex: male or female 3. Intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80 4. Met criteria for the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder not otherwise specified (ADHD NOS), by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSMIV), as manifested in clinical evaluation and confirmed by structured interview. This is operationalized by either: having at least 6 out of 9 current DSMIV items of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity but &lt; 5 items from either list in childhood, or having 5 out of 9 current DSMIV items of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not having the 6 current symptoms in either category. This second category will be included independent of the presence or absence of ADHD symptoms in childhood. 5. Had a Clinical Global Impression: ADHD score of 4 (moderately ill) or higher illness severity at a clinical evaluation. 6. Has at least one biological offspring 1. No adequate informant is available to answer the survey questions. 2. Sensorimotor deficits. (These include deficits that would impede the survey process, e.g. profound deafness, blindness, inadequate command of the English language, or profound disorders of language.) 3. Psychosis, autism, schizophrenia.</criteria>
