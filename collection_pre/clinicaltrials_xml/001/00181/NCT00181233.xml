	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac death is a tragic event that strikes all age groups and is unfortunately increasing in prevalence. Because it is difficult to predict those at highest risk, this study is designed to test the hypothesis that new imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and computed tomography [CT]) are useful for identifying factors which put people at high risk for sudden death.</brief_summary>
