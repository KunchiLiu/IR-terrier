	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of a nurse-directed, home-based walking exercise program to mitigate fatigue and maintain physical functioning during adjuvant therapy for cancer. The sample will be randomized into exercise (EX) or usual care (UC) groups. The independent study variable is participation in a walking exercise program. Outcomes include: fatigue, sleep disturbance, emotional distress, physical functioning and quality of life. The effects of the walking exercise program will be evaluated using self-report questionnaires administered pre- and post-treatment, patient diaries, and symptoms assessments at defined intervals during adjuvant therapy</brief_summary>
