	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the adminstration of celecoxib, a cox2-inhibitor in patients with stage II-III non small cell lung cancer receiving radical radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that celecoxib will increase the remission rate of radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Celecoxib and Concurrent Radiotherapy in Stage II-III NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is difficult, even with the best classical radiation and chemotherapy schedule results remain disappointing. However, there is evidence that increasing the local control rate by delivering radiotherapy either in a short period of time or concomitantly with chemotherapy improves survival. Drawback of a higher radiation dose or addition of chemotherapy is a higher incidence of toxicity. So radiation dose escalation could lead to further improvements of prognosis, but the radiation dose is however limited by radiation-induced lung and esophageal damage. For NSCLC, non-toxic agents who both increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy and decrease radiation induced lung and esophageal damage are needed. The cox-2-inhibitors seem to be suitable for this purpose. In experimental mice tumor models, it was already shown that COX-2-inhibitors both inhibit tumor growth and enhance the radio-response of the tumor. Moreover, anti-inflammatory agents, such asCOX-2-inhibitors, also lowered the incidence of radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis. In this study the simultaneous favourable effects of COX-2 inhibitors on tumor response and radiation damage in human cancer patients will be investigated. Patients will be randomised to receive Celecoxib or placebo. All patients will receive the same radiotherapy treatment. Primary outcome measure is tumor response, assessed by a CT-scan of the thorax, three months after radiotherapy. The tumor response rate of the experimental group will be compared to the tumor response rate of the control group.</detailed_description>
