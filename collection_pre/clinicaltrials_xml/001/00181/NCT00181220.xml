	<brief_summary>The proposed study will test the safety and efficacy of sodium valproate in the induction of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle antigen expression in tumor tissue of patients undergoing primary therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Up to 20 patients will be given valproic acid for 2 weeks. The primary surrogate endpoint for efficacy will be expression of EBV lytic antigens by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue. Biopsies of primary tumor will be taken after 2 weeks with achievement of a therapeutic concentration of valproate. Expression of immunodominant EBV latency antigens in tumor tissue, EBV viral load by real time PCR, and valproate levels will be measured. Adverse events associated with valproate in NPC patients will be described.</brief_summary>
