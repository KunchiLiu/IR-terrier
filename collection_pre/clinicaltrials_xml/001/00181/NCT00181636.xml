	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the investigational drug galantamine-CR (Reminyl- Controlled Release capsule) is useful in improving problems with memory in bipolar patients with stable mood. This study is being done because a large proportion of patients with bipolar disorder experience significant memory problems, even when their mood is stable, after adequate treatment. These memory problems have been associated with poor daily social functioning. Studying galantamine-CR in this population may provide a new clinical way to combat memory problems in stable patients with bipolar disorder.</brief_summary>
