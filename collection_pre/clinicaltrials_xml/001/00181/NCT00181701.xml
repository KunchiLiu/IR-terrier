	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of giving both paclitaxel and carboplatin in the abdominal cavity by looking at what effects (good and bad) this route of administration has on patients with ovarian cancer. Standard chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously but a number of trials have shown that injecting drugs into the abdominal cavity, or intraperitoneally, have shown promising results.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in the Treatment of Women With Carcinoma of Mullerian Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will have an intraperitoneal port placed at the time of their initial surgery or at a second procedure prior to cycle 2 of chemotherapy. Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles of therapy as an outpatient. They will have 1 cycle of paclitaxel/carboplatin intravenously followed by 5 cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatin intraperitoneally. Chemotherapy treatment is given on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Each cycle is 21 days long. To help reduce the chance of an allergic reaction, patients will also take decadron tablets orally before paclitaxel administration. About 1 liter of standard salt solution will be injected through a catheter into the abdominal cavity with each treatment to help distribute the drugs throughout the abdominal cavity. "Second-look" surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) will be performed 3-8 weeks after the last chemotherapy course (cycle 6) if the patient is in complete clinical remission. This surgery is done to see how effective the chemotherapy was. Tests and procedures will be done throughout the treatment to see how the cancer is responding and to monitor for safety purposes. These tests and procedures include routine history and physical exam, neurological exam, and routine blood tests. As part of this study we will also be checking the amount of paclitaxel and carboplatin in the blood. Participation in this study will last approximately 6 months as long as the treatment is well tolerated, there are no serious side effects and the disease has not progressed.</detailed_description>
