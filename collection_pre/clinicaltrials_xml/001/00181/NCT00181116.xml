	<brief_title>Levetiracetam for Benign Rolandic Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 6 month study in which children on another anticonvulsant would have EEG, language testing, and a clinic visit at baseline. They would then be rapidly transitioned off of their current anticonvulsant and onto levetiracetam (Keppra). Repeat EEG and language testing would be done after 6 months to evaluate for improvement.</detailed_description>
