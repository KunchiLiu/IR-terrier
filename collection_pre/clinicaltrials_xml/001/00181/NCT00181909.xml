	<brief_title>Efficacy of Proactive Telephone Counseling for Pregnant Smokers Enrolled in a Managed Care Organization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of a proactive pregnancy-tailored telephone-delivered smoking cessation counseling program with a “best practice” brief counseling control condition among pregnant women referred by prenatal care providers and a managed care plan in Massachusetts. Intervention group patients received up to 105 min of cognitive-behavioral counseling delivered in a motivational interviewing style by trained counselors throughout pregnancy and for 2 months postpartum. Control group patients received 5 minutes of brief counseling at 1 telephone call. All participants were mailed written self-help smoking cessation material tailored to pregnancy. The primary outcome measure was cotinine-validated tobacco abstinence at the end of pregnancy. Secondary outcomes were cotinine-validated abstinence at 3 months postpartum and self-reported significant (&gt;50%) reduction in daily cigarette use.</detailed_description>
