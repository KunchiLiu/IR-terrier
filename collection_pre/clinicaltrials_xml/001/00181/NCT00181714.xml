	<brief_summary>This study will consist of a six-week open-label treatment period with an extended duration methylphenidate (OROS MPH) followed by subsequent monthly visits for 24 months in a large sample of youths aged 12-17 who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. The researchers hypothesize that OROS MPH treatment will be associated with low rates of cigarette smoking in ADHD youth.</brief_summary>
