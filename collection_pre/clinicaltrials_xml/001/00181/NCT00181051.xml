	<brief_summary>Index computed in real time from Auditory Evoked Potentials have been described parallel to depth of anesthesia. The goal of the study was to compare general anesthesia guided on Auditory Evoked Potentials monitoring to standrad practice in order to assess if AEP monitoring can improve recovery delay (main criteria) or intraoperative hemodynamic stability (secondary criteria). Patients were randomized in 2 groups, stratified by center. Group I : AEP guided anesthesia, Group II: Blind AEP record, standard practice.</brief_summary>
