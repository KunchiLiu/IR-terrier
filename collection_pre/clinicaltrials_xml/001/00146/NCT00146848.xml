	<brief_summary>This study will look at different pacing modes (how a device is programmed to pace one's heart), and how these modes may assist in one's daily activities and how one is feeling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEGASUS CRT Study: Atrial Support Study in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PEGASUS CRT is a multicenter trial that will assess the effect of a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device programmed to DDD-70 or DDDR-40 compared to a CRT device programmed to DDD-40 in heart failure patients. The effect of atrial support pacing in heart failure patients will be assessed using a clinical composite rating. A sub-study will evaluate the effect pacing mode has on exercise capacity in this heart failure population.</detailed_description>
