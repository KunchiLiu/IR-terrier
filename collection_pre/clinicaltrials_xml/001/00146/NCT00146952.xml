	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to explore the hypothesis that vibrotactile channels for indicating spatial orientation can be exploited as a sensory prosthesis. The specific research applications will be used for guiding visual orientation, to provide alternative feedback to vision and vestibular signals for controlling balance, and for directional and lateralisation cueing in patients with neglect syndromes. The programme will study whether vibrotactile feedback improves performance and also if it speeds rehabilitation when used as an adjunct to conventional therapy.</brief_summary>
