	<brief_summary>Background: The aging of the population has lead to a significant increase in the number of older people suffering from cognitive impairment and dementia. The present lack of effective drug therapy for these conditions makes it imperative to investigate other potential therapeutic interventions. Cognitive training has been described as possibly useful in improving cognitive function in elderly subjects with mild impairment and early dementia. However, there have been few well-designed studies to date and the results are equivocal. Most studies have relied on the use of paper-based neuropsychological assessment instruments with limited accuracy and reproducibility. The investigators have developed a validated computerized neuropsychological assessment battery with increased test-retest reliability. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a computerized training program on cognitive function in older persons with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and early dementia. Description: A randomized prospective AB/BA crossover study. Methods: Eligible males and females aged 60 years and older following initial computerized neuropsychological assessment will be randomized to receive either a 12-session computerized cognitive training program, or no treatment. Repeat neuropsychological assessment will be followed by a 4-week no treatment phase, reassessment and crossover phase. Repeat assessments will be performed at three and six months.</brief_summary>
