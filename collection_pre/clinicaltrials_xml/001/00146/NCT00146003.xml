	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a measurable improvement on a validated scale in a small population of adult patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efalizumab for Eczema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involves administration of efalizumab (previously approved for psoriasis) to ten adult patients with atopic dermatitis. Biologic plausibility rests on similarities in pathophysiology of the two conditions. The drug (efalizumab) will be administered according to the dosing approved for plaque psoriasis for a period of 24 weeks. The subjects will self-administer efalizumab weekly and measurements will be performed on a monthly basis. Efalizumab is not being compared to placebo or other drugs.</detailed_description>
