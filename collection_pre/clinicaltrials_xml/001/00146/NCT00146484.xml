	<brief_summary>The optimal insulin regimen for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a split evening injection regimen (insulin injections before breakfast, supper and bedtime) leads to better glucose control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and adolescents with new onset diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Two Versus Three Daily Injections in Children and Adolescents With Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal insulin regimen for children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes remains unknown. No published studies have examined the effectiveness of a split evening (three times daily) injection regimen in this group of patients. Indeed, because the first few years of diabetes management are the easiest (due to a “honeymoon” period characterised by residual insulin secretion), the potential for any benefit from more intensive management (i.e., three daily injections) may be small during this period. In addition, the intensity of the initial insulin regimen may be an important determinant of quality of life, family functioning, and subsequent compliance with diabetes regimens. A randomized controlled trial has been designed to test the hypothesis that a split evening injection regimen leads to better glycemic control and quality of life than twice daily insulin in children and adolescents with new onset diabetes.</detailed_description>
