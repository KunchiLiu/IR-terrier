	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Active Living Every Day Exercise Program for People With Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence has shown that regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves symptoms and function in persons with arthritis. A 20-week behavior-based program was developed by the Cooper Institute, Brown University, and Human Kinetics to help people with sedentary lifestyles become and stay physically active. A randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness and efficacy of a similar program on which Active Living Every Day is based (ALED) on cardiovascular disease risk factors, cost-effectiveness, and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, the current research supporting ALED is limited for people with arthritis. The primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of the Active Living Every Day Physical Activity Program (ALED) for people with arthritis. The primary goal will be accomplished through a twenty week randomized controlled trial conducted with 400 participants residing in the 17 Area Agencies on Aging housed in the Councils of Government in North Carolina, including both urban and rural counties. This project is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ALED program in changing arthritis-related health outcomes and to investigate the feasibility of conducting the ALED program in a public health setting. Objectives: 1. To demonstrate that the ALED program can increase physical activity and fitness levels among people with arthritis. 2. To demonstrate that the Active Living Every Day has arthritis-specific benefits. 3. To evaluate the feasibility of disseminating the Active Living Every Day program through the NC public health network.</detailed_description>
