	<brief_summary>Osteopenia and osteoporosis are increasingly reported in HIV-infected patients, and appear to be more frequent than in general population. However, pathogenesis remains unclear, and published studies still give non concordant results. We therefore started a prospective study, to assess the potential role of ARV in the occurrence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. BMD evolution over a 2-years period of follow-up, will be compared between patients starting ARV therapy, and subjects without HAART (no indication of treatment). A correlation between BMD and several factors will be looked at (see below). This study with individual direct benefice, is conducted in 3 outpatients clinics (Strasbourg, Colmar, Mulhouse) in collaboration with the rheumatologic teams. 60 patients are planned to be included over a 3-years inclusion period</brief_summary>
