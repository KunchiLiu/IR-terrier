	<criteria>Diagnosis of CKD and receiving hemodialysis for greater than or equal to 3 months before randomization Mean HB level between 10 and 13 g/dL (inclusive) (mean of 2 values drawn at least 3 days apart during the screening period) Currently receiving a stable dose of Epoetin alfa RB (i.e., EPOGEN® or PROCRIT®) for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization. Stable is defined as: less than or equal to 25% change in dose over 6 weeks, same frequency and route of administration with no more than 1 missed or withheld dose during each of the two threeweek periods before randomization Exclusion Criteria: Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a predialysis systolic BP greater than 180 and/or diastolic BP of greater than 110 during the screening period Known history of severe hyperparathyroidism (PTH Greater than 1500 pg/ml within 3 months prior to enrollment) Currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy</criteria>
