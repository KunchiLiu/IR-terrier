	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to see if pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) is safe and useful in supporting people through dose-dense chemotherapy, and to see if a long-acting red blood cell growth factor, darbepoetin alfa(Aranesp) can reduce the need for blood transfusion in chemotherapy recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegfilgrastim and Darbepoetin Alfa in Support of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients will receive chemotherapy every 2 weeks for up to 8 cycles (spread out of approximately 16 weeks, total) of treatment. On the day of chemotherapy treatment patients may receive an injection of darbepoetin alfa in addition to chemotherapy if their red blood cell count is below normal levels. - On the day after chemotherapy treatment, patients will receive an injection of pegfilgrastim. There is one pegfilgrastim shot given per treatment cycle, for a total of 8 injections. Once the patient has finished chemotherapy and the last of the pegfilgrastim shots, their participation in this trial will be complete. - While on this study the following procedures will be performed: a physical exam will be done every 2 weeks, vital signs will be done every 2 weeks, and blood tests every 2 weeks. - This study also involves a Quality of Life Questionnaire done at the beginning of study treatment, at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 1 year after starting the study treatment. - Patients will remain on this study unless they experience unacceptable side effects from any of the treatment drugs.</detailed_description>
