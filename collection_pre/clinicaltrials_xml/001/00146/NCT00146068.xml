	<brief_title>EARLY IFNB-1a and Simvastatin Combination Therapy in Clinically Isolated Syndrome Suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interferon beta-1a (IFNB-1a), a FDA approved therapy for relapsing-remitting (RR) MS has several mechanisms of action. It lowers proinflammatory cytokine production and inhibits antigen presentation by class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. It also reduces metalloproteinase activity, which all lead to decreased migration of T-lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS), and subsequent inhibition of inflammatory lesion formation. We propose that combination therapy during early stages of the disease with second immunomodulatory agent that targets different steps in the pathogenesis of the disease may add to the effectiveness of IFNB-1a. IFNB-1a administered intramuscularly at 30 mg per week is particularly suitable for combination therapy due to its proven efficacy in Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS),favorable safety profile and low frequency of neutralizing antibodies (NABs) against IFNB-1a in comparison to other forms of IFNB-1a. Recent studies have reported a significant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of statins, cholesterol-lowering agents. Statins disrupt cellular membrane lipid rafts, which inhibit the clustering of T-cell receptor (TCR), co-stimulatory, and adhesion molecules, required for optimal T-cell activation. Along with inhibiting T-cell activation, statins decrease IFNB inducible MHC class II expression, suppressing an effective antigen presentation. They block migration of activated mononuclear cells from peripheral circulation into the CNS by blocking LFA-1 adhesion molecule and by reducing metalloproteinase type 9 secretion. While their anti-inflammatory effects at tolerable oral doses may not justify their use as monotherapy for RR MS, their pleiotropic mechanisms of action showed synergistic effects with IFNB-1a in studies in vitro. We propose that simvastatin may enhance the immunomodulatory effects of INFB-1a in patients with CIS suggestive of MS and that this combination may even more effectively prevent further disease activity if administered early in the course of the disease.</detailed_description>
