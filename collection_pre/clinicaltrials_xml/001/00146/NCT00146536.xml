	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine how often patients who have atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) on core needle biopsy of an imaging (found by mammogram or breast ultrasound) abnormality will have associated breast cancer at surgical removal of the area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Upstaging of ALH/LCIS Found on Core Biopsy Based on Subsequent Excisional Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will undergo a breast biopsy at which the area found to be ALH or LCIS on core biopsy will be removed surgically through a small incision in the breast. - The surgical biopsy specimen will be carefully examined by a pathologist, and may be useful in guiding further therapy if needed. - In the future, tissue from the surgical biopsy may be used to study genetic changes that may be responsible for cancer formation and prevention. The tissue will be kept for future research for up to 10 years.</detailed_description>
