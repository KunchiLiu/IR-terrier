	<detailed_description>Our prior work shows that d-amphetamine and the dopamine precursor levodopa markedly improve word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether a selective d2/d3 dopamine agonist (pramipexole) or cholinergic neuromodulation (rivastigmine), after a titration period of five days, will yield a learning enhancement comparable to using levodopa in healthy subjects. The expected scientific results will strengthen the basis for transferring neuromodulatory interventions from the laboratory to stroke patients with language dysfunctions.</detailed_description>
