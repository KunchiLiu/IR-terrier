	<criteria>Subject has diagnosis of partial seizures with/without secondary generalization, supported by: Observed ictal events consistent with partial seizures with/without secondary generalization; Documented by reliable observers 1 of following 3: EEG at some time in past demonstrating focal abnormalities consistent with partial seizures If the EEG is inconclusive or does not support partial seizures, then an MRI/CT will be done If the MRI/CT fails to support a diagnosis of partial seizures, the subject may still qualify based on the principal Investigator's clinical diagnosis Subject weighs at least 15 kg (33 lbs). Parent/caregiver is able to keep an accurate seizure diary. Has had status epilepticus in the past 3 months prior to Screening Has a history of any of: Cardiac (including clinically important abnormality on ECG); Renal; Psychiatric (including psychosurgery); Oncologic; Endocrine; Metabolic; Pancreatic; Hepatic disease (including clinical/serological history of hepatitis); Urea cycle disorder Has: Expanding CNS neoplasm; Active CNS infection; Demyelinating disease; Degenerative neurological disease; Progressive encephalopathy; or any Progressive CNS disease Has platelet count less than or equal to 100,000/mcL Has blood chemistry ALT/AST value(s) greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of normal at screening Requires anticoagulant drug therapy Receiving systemic chemotherapy Requires treatment with aspirin Subject is pregnant Has been on ketogenic diet within 30 days prior to screening Considered by investigator to be nonresponder to valproate for treatment of epilepsy (e.g., Despite adequate trial with serum concentrations of 60 mcg/mL or greater, subject continues to have inadequate seizure control)</criteria>
