	<brief_title>Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Topotecan in Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carboplatin-Paclitaxel is the current standard in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. One option to further improve the therapeutic results is the incorporation of a third, non-cross-resistant drug into first line chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer. In two separate, single center phase II studies, a different combination of the three active agents (Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and Topotecan) has been tested. In these studies, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel were given at standard doses and schedules, followed sequentially by Topotecan which was well tolerated at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day given for five days and repeated every 21 days. The prolonged therapy is not associated with cumulative toxicity and the compliance of the patients was good. Study Hypothesis/Comparison: The triple combination (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Topotecan) yields superior outcome in the treatment of first-line ovarian cancer compared with the combination of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel</detailed_description>
