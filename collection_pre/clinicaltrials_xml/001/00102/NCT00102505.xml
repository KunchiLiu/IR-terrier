	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of motexafin gadolinium when administered with docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. A cycle consists of 3 weeks. During week 1, patients receive MGd, docetaxel, and cisplatin treatment followed by 2 weeks without treatment. Eligible patients will receive 1 or 2 doses of MGd, depending on cohort, and a single dose of docetaxel and cisplatin at 75 mg/m² during the first week of each cycle. Additionally, tumor response will be evaluated at the end of even numbered cycles (2, 4, and 6). Patients may stay on the study a maximum of 6 cycles.</brief_summary>
