	<brief_title>Febuxostat Versus Allopurinol Control Trial in Subjects With Gout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 52 weeks duration. Subjects receiving prior urate-lowering therapy underwent a 2-week washout period prior to randomization. Subjects were then randomized to one of three treatment groups: febuxostat 80 milligram (mg), febuxostat 120 mg, or allopurinol 300 mg. Naproxen (250 mg twice daily) or colchicine (0.6 mg once daily) was provided for prophylaxis of acute gout flares during the washout period and the first 8 weeks of double-blind treatment.</detailed_description>
