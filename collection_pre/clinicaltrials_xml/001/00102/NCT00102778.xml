All subjects participating in this study should be counseled on the practice of safe sex using a proven double barrier method of contraception throughout the study. Screening lab result of plasma HIV1 RNA greater than or equal to 50,000 copies/mL and CD4 cell count greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm3. Have CC Chemokine Receptor5tropic (R5tropic) or CC Chemokine Receptor5/CXC Chemokine Receptor4tropic (R5/X4tropic) virus based on viral tropism test at screening visit. Be treatmentnaive, defined as less than or equal to 2 weeks of treatment with a protease inhibitor (PI) or an nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI/ NtRTI), or less than or equal to 7 days of therapy with a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Prior treatment with any entry inhibitor, attachment inhibitor, or fusion inhibitor (experimental or approved) is not allowed. Be able to understand and follow with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to study entry. Exclusion criteria: No detection of CXC Receptor4tropic (X4tropic) virus only, based on viral tropism test at screening. No active Class C AIDSdefining illness. No laboratory abnormalities at screen.
