	<brief_title>Study of Talaporfin Sodium Photodynamic Therapy to Treat Advanced Age Related Macular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 study is a safety and tolerability investigation of LS11 photodynamic therapy in subjects with persistent leaking neovascular membranes in patients with AMD who have a visual acuity of 20/200 or less. This is a sequential group dose escalation trial with the cohorts defined by increasing the light dose. Within each light-dose cohort, three (3) subjects will be treated at a drug dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg.</detailed_description>
