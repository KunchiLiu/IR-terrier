	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized Phase 2 study testing pemetrexed and doxorubicin in combination for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Both pemetrexed and doxorubicin have been combined with other drugs, but they have not yet been combined with each other. It is expected that the patient will benefit from the different mechanisms of action of the two drugs. However, there is no guarantee that the patient will benefit from this treatment.</brief_summary>
