	<brief_title>ARQ 501 in Combination With Gemcitabine in Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, non-randomized study of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine in adult patients with treatment-naïve, unresectable, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study objectives are: Primary Objective: - Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine. Secondary Objectives: - Determine time to tumor progression (TTP) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine - Further characterize the safety of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma Be treatmentnaïve. Have measurable disease per RECIST Criteria. Be ≥18 years old. Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70%. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks. Be male or a nonpregnant, nonlactating female patient. Patients who are fertile agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) to avoid pregnancy. Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug (if patient is a female of childbearing potential). Sign a written informed consent form. Have adequate organ function as indicated by acceptable laboratory values obtained within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Have received any prior therapy for the treatment of their pancreatic malignancy (including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, major surgery, or irradiation, whether conventional or investigational). Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life threatening or clinically significant at the time of treatment. Are pregnant or lactating. Have a psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation, or followup. Have any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Have symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Have a known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine.</criteria>
