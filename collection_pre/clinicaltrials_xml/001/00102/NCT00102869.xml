	<detailed_description>Our prior work shows that d-amphetamine and the dopamine precursor levodopa markedly improve word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether daily administration of levodopa, coupled with several hours of language training every day, will significantly improve naming abilities in patients with aphasia as compared to placebo administration. We furthermore examine with magnetic resonance imaging which brain regions need to be functionally intact for a dopaminergic improvement of language therapy.</detailed_description>
