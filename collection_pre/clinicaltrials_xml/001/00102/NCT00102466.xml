	<brief_summary>This study is not being conducted in the United States. Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain target blood glucose levels when taking a single oral drug. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to that of gliclazide in lowering overall blood glucose levels when added to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes not at target blood glucose levels on metformin alone.</brief_summary>
