	<detailed_description>Pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, nausea, sexual impairment, body image disturbance, relationship strains, existential distress and role losses are all potential "side-effects" of living with cancer and its treatment. Behavioral interventions have shown some success in mitigating distress and QOL impairment among cancer patients. The purpose of this randomized-controlled study is to compare the effects of Mind-body group interventions on the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. Patients are randomized to one of two psychotherapy groups, which occur weekly for eight weeks. Quality of life assessments are conducted at baseline and two and four-month intervals.</detailed_description>
