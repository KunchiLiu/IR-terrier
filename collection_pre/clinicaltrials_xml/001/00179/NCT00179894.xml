	<brief_title>Improving Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Treatment Adherence and Outcome in Primary Care Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The most effective treatment for improving the core symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involves the use of stimulant medications. Most children with ADHD are treated by pediatricians, but the treatment provided is often less than optimal. This study is designed to see if training for pediatricians in following guidelines for management of first-line medicines for ADHD leads to improvement in child behavior, and whether the physicians can adhere to the guidelines. Over 100 studies have shown that stimulant medications are effective for improving the core symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Approximately 70% of children who receive ADHD medications are treated by their primary care pediatrician, but studies show that management is not always optimal. The present study is designed to see if child behavior can be improved by training pediatricians in the use of guidelines for treating ADHD, and whether the physicians can adhere to the guidelines. Twenty-four pediatric practices were randomized to a treatment as usual or specialized care (receiving training in guidelines and computer assisted monitoring of patient progress and medication titration). Children are assessed with parent and teacher reports at baseline, 4-, 9-, and 12-months post initiation of treatment, and classroom observations of behavior are assessed at baseline, 6-, and 12-months. Approximately 400 children are to be enrolled.</detailed_description>
