	<brief_summary>Treatment on this study combines two drugs: Thalomid™ (thalidomide) and carboplatin. Thalidomide has been available for many years and has been used to treat many different illnesses. Carboplatin is an effective medicine in killing cancer cells. Thalidomide works by blocking angiogenesis (the process of new blood vessel formation). If a tumor does not have blood vessels providing oxygen and nutrients, it will not be able to grow. This research will look at how combining the effects of thalidomide (preventing tumor growth) with the tumor killing effect of carboplatin effects the long-term outlook for patients with these tumors. This study will try to find out how well Thalomid™ and carboplatin combined with radiation therapy works in treating children newly diagnosed with brain stem glioma. This study will look at how well Thalomid ™ and carboplatin work in patients with recurrent brain stem glioma. This study will also look at any side effects of these treatments.</brief_summary>
