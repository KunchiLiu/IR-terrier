	<criteria>Adults â‰¥ 18 years of age admitted to the intensive care unit New onset acute renal failure (ARF) or ARF superimposed on chronic kidney disease ARF will be defined by a sustained (over 24 hours) increase in serum creatinine &gt; 0.5 mg/dl from baseline Patients will be recruited for the study within 35 days following establishment of ARF Institutionalized patient Previous kidney transplant Pregnancy Unable to obtain consent from subject or legally recognized representative ARF from urinary tract obstruction or a volume responsive prerenal state. Liver Failure Recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) Coagulopathy defined as: Platelets &lt; 50, PT &gt; 20, INR &gt; 2.0 if the patient requires the placement of an arterial or venous catheter; if the patient does not require the placement of an arterial or venous catheter for the study, coagulopathy will not be a basis for exclusion.
