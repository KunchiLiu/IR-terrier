	<detailed_description>The electrical activity of the small intestine may contain important information that will help us diagnose gastrointestinal diseases. The major impediment to reducing mortality of mesenteric ischemia is the lack of a noninvasive diagnostic test that identifies the syndrome before extensive necrosis occurs. Mesenteric ischemia is caused by the lack of blood flow to the intestine. The Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) measures the magnetic field of the intestinal smooth muscle. By comparing normal smooth muscle and that of patients with mesenteric ischemia, the investigators hope to identify abnormal disease states without surgery.</detailed_description>
