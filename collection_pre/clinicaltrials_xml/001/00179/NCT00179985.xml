	<brief_title>The Impact of Implementing NIDCAP on the Developmental Sensitivity of Nurses Caring for Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapies that have brought about sharp decreases in neonatal mortality have not brought about similar decreases in neurodevelopmental morbidity for preterm infants. Developmentally supportive care is NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) care that seeks to optimize the developmental course and outcomes for preterm infants. In controlled trials, implementation of the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) has been associated with with positive medical and neurobehavioral outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of implementing the NIDCAP on the developmental sensitivity of nurses caring for preterm infants in a tertiary level NICU in a children's hospital in the midwest. The NIDCAP program consists of 1) structured behavioral observations which are conducted at regular intervals during the preterm infant's hospitalization, 2) written plans which outline specific, individualized interventions to address the infant's unique developmental needs which are updated following each observation, and 3) consultations with the infant's caregivers to articulate the infant's current needs and plan. A convenience sample of 32 NICU nurses will be observed during a routine caregiving episode with one preterm infant before and another preterm infant after the implementation of the NIDCAP program with preterm infants in the NICU. Following the observations, the nurse's developmental sensitivity will be scored using a standardized tool. The nurses' developmental sensitivity before the implementation of the NIDCAP program will be compared with their developmental sensitivity following NIDCAP implementation. Informed consent will be obtained from the nurses participating in the study.</detailed_description>
