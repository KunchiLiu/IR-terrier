	<brief_summary>Participants who qualify will receive lenalidomide daily on days 1-21 of every 28 day cycle. Treatment will continue for up to 52 weeks or until disease progression; participants who achieve a complete response (CR) will receive an additional 2 cycles of treatment prior to discontinuation. Participants will be followed for progression free survival following discontinuation from the treatment phase</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide (Revlimid®, CC-5013) in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants who qualified for enrollment into the study entered the treatment phase and received single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle. The treatment phase began on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Study visits were scheduled to occur every 28 days to coincide with the beginning of a new cycle. The start date of a new cycle was delayed if adverse events (AEs) occurred, in which case the visit date for the start of the following cycle was scheduled 28 days after the actual start date of the delayed cycle. Efficacy and safety assessments, including complete blood counts (CBCs) were performed at least every 2 weeks during Cycles 1 to 4 of the treatment phase. Participants continued in the treatment phase of the study for up to 52 weeks or until disease progression developed, lenalidomide treatment was discontinued for any reason, or the study was terminated.</detailed_description>
