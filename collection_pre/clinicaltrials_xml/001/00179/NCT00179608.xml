	<brief_summary>This study will determine the MDT of intravenous DTIC when administered in combination with a fixed dose of oral lenalidomide in subjects with metastatic malignant melanoma previously untreated with systemic chemotherapy. This study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and DTIC. Subjects will be receive lenalidomide for 14 consecutive days and DTIC on day one of each 21 day cycle.</brief_summary>
