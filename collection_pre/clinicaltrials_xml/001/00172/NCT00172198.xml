	<brief_summary>1. A prospective, controlled, randomized, study evaluating the clinical efficacy, including nutritional status, immune function and safety of Omegaven (ω-3 fish oil) supplemented parenteral nutrition in subjects of SICU. 2. Study patients are the critical ill patients in SICU of NTUH and the enrolled patients will be 30 subjects ,including 15 in each treatment group. 3. During parenteral nutrition, fat emulsions will be given separately from amino acid and glucose solutions. Infusion pump must be used.The recommended infusion duration of the daily lipid emulsion is 16 hours (0.0625 g fat/kg B.W./hour) from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm. 4. During the study the assessments of safety and efficacy are to be performed according to case report form. The assessment for safety variables including blood pressure、heat rate 、body temperature、liver function、renal function、coagulation、WBC、lipid profile etc. In addition，the assessments for efficacy variables including lymphocytes、cytokines(IL-1、IL-2、IL-6、IL-8、IL-11、IL-18、OX40 ligand、G-CSF、FN-γ、TGF-β1、TNF-α etc)、incidence of infections、 length of ICU and hospital stay、mortality etc.</brief_summary>
