	<brief_summary>30-40% of patients with lung cancer will develop bone metastases during the course of their disease, which can lead to pain, decreased mobility and skeletal complications. This study will investigate the effect of zoledronic acid on preventing or delaying the development of bone metastases and the impact on disease progression/survival in patients with stage IIIA and IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
