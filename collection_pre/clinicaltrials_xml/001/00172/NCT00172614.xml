	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance and disturbances in energy homeostasis are associated with body weight changes, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, cancer cachexia, aging, and acute or chronic infectious diseases. Cytokines secreted by adipose tissue and inflammatory cells play important roles in the pathological conditions. Several novel cytokines were disclosed recently, but their functions have not been well known. Further investigation of these cytokines, resulting in insulin resistance and energy homeostasis, is very important to elucidate the mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Roles of Cytokines in the Mechanism of Insulin Resistance and Energy Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are studying patients with body weight change, increased or decreased. Healthy people are the control group. We are recording body weight, body height, and physical exam results. In addition, we are drawing peripheral blood for further biochemical and cytokine assays.</detailed_description>
