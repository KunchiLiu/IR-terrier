	<brief_summary>Specific aims of this project were as follows: 1. To investigate the eye-head coordination of patients with cervical spine degeneration. 2. To investigate the relationship of these impairment measurements (range of motion, muscle power, proprioception, sensory threshold, eye-head coordination) and functional outcome (neck disability index, quality of life evaluation). 3. To develop a computer assistant device and software for the proprioceptive training and eye-head coordination. 4. To provide a treatment and prevention program emphasized on proprioception treatment and coordination for employee with neck-shoulder complaints.</brief_summary>
