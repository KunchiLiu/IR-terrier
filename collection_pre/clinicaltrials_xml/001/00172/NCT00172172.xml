	<brief_summary>This study is evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation on the efficacy and safety of recombinant parathyroid hormone (ALX1-11) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate whether increases in bone mineral density (BMD) for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are less than increases in BMD observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium supplementation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium Supplementation in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effects of ALX1-11 on bone mineral density (BMD) have been documented in a dose-finding Phase II clinical trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women, supplemented with calcium and Vitamin D3 but without any other treatment for osteoporosis. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 in the lumbar vertebrae were statistically significant after the 12-month treatment period and more pronounced than any approved therapy. Additionally, animal studies have shown that the new bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good quality both histologically and biomechanically. The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate whether increases in bone mineral density (BMD) for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are less than increases in BMD observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium supplementation. A secondary objective of this clinical study are to evaluate whether changes in other efficacy parameters, such as bone mineral content (BMC) and biochemical markers of bone turnover, for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving no calcium supplementation are less than increases observed for subjects treated with ALX1-11 and receiving calcium supplementation. This is a double-blind, multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study comprised of 3 treatment groups: ALX1-11 injection plus oral calcium, ALX1-11 injection plus oral placebo calcium, and placebo ALX1-11 injection plus oral calcium. All subjects also receive 400 IU oral vitamin D3. The dose of ALX1-11 to be used in this study is 100 μg, self administered by daily sc injection. The calcium dose is 700 mg/day. Additional supplemental calcium and/or Vitamin D3 will not be permitted. Patients will be monitored for the development of hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women who are capable of understanding and giving written, voluntary informed consent before the clinical study screening visit Women with the ability to selfadminister a daily injection or having a designee who will give the injections Women who are postmenopausal with at least one year since their last menstruation. If a subject's menopausal status at screening is in question, because of history or because the subject had a hysterectomy without oophorectomy, a folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 mIU/mL will satisfy the definition of postmenopausal status. Women 4554 years of age with the following Tscore and/or vertebral fracture Tscore &gt;=3.0 standard deviations (SD) below mean peak bone mass of young women at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip Or Tscore &gt;=2.5 SD below mean peak bone mass of young women at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip with a prevalent vertebral fracture verified by the central imaging organization before the subject is enrolled into the study Women &gt;=55 years of age with the following Tscore and/or vertebral fracture: o Tscore &gt;=2.5 SD below mean peak bone mass of young women at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip Or Tscore &gt;=2.0 SD below mean peak bone mass of young women at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip with a vertebral fracture verified by the central imaging organization before the subject is enrolled into the study The following types of vertebral fractures should not be considered for subject enrollment into this study: Pathological fractures due to malignant disease or infection Fractures due to excessive trauma sufficient to cause a fracture in young individuals with normal bone mass A. Vertebral Deformity (assessed as described in Appendix 2 of the protocol, are sufficient for exclusion): · Vertebral deformities Patient has 5 or more vertebral (thoracic and lumbar) fractures Patient has 2 or more lumbar vertebral deformities (L1 to L4) B.

The lesion(s) were fully resected with clear margins described in a written report by a pathologist, and 2. The patient has had no recurrence of lesions for at least one year from the time of the original resection. · Nervous system Significant* neurological or psychiatric disease · Vascular, respiratory and cardiac system Significant* unstable cardiac or pulmonary disease (*) Significance will be determined by the investigator on the basis of history, physical exam, and/or laboratory screens. Significant disorders necessitate ongoing changes in therapeutic medication or frequent monitoring. D. Concurrent Medication: Patients cannot be enrolled into this clinical trial if they have received any of the following therapies at any time: Any PTH or PTH analogs [e.g., rhPTH(184), PTH(134), PTHrP and analogs] Fluoride Strontium Patients must have been off the following agents for the specified times before entering the screening phase of this clinical trial: Any investigational drug (&gt;30 days) Anabolic steroids or androgens (&gt;6 consecutive months) Active Vitamin D3 metabolites and analogs, e.g., calcitriol (&gt;90 days) Provera (medroxyprogesterone) (According to label instructions) Systemic corticosteroids, more than 5mg/day formulation equivalent to 5mg/day prednisone (&gt;12 consecutive month or as acute bolus for nonrecurring condition).
