	<brief_summary>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an important issue for the emergency physicians and co-workers. How to improve the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate and prognosis of these patients challenges the emergency team. When encounters stress, the hypothalamus of human releases corticotropin releasing hormone, which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to release ACTH. Then ACTH acts on the adrenal gland to release glucocorticoid to against stress. Foley PJ et al found the dogs with bilateral adrenalectomy had lower ROSC rate during resuscitation than those without surgery[1]. Karl H. Linder et al showed OHCA patients had high serum vasopressin and ACTH level but low serum cortisol level. Besides, the serum cortisol level had a negative correlation with collapse duration (no CPR duration)[2]. Studies also revealed the successfully resuscitated patients had higher serum ACTH and cortisol level than non-resuscitated ones[2,3]. In addition, the serum cortisol level was found to be correlated with short term survival rate and hemodynamic status in resuscitated OHCA patients[3]. Animal study also showed mice receiving higher dosage of hydrocortisone had higher ROSC rate and lower epinephrine requirement than those receiving lower dosage of hydrocortisone or normal saline. &lt;Reference&gt; 1.
