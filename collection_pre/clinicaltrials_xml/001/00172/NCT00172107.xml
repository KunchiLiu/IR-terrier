	<brief_summary>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of ALX1-11 (recombinant human parathyroid hormone [rhPTH(1-84)])(50, 75 and 100 µg) in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of ALX1-11 (50, 75 and 100 µg) with that of placebo in terms of increasing vertebral bone mineral density, when given daily by subcutaneous injection for 12 months in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of 3 Doses of ALX1-11 (50, 75, and 100µg) in the Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human clinical experience with a synthetic human parathyroid hormone fragment (rhPTH 1-34) and animal studies with ALX1-11 demonstrate consistent increases in bone mineral density. Furthermore, the newly formed bone is normal in structure and composition. Therefore, ALX1-11 (recombinant human parathyroid hormone [rhPTH 1-84]) has the potential to stimulate new bone formation in osteoporotic patients thereby increasing trabecular bone density and preventing fractures. The clinical profile for ALX1-11 can be expected to be unique, since none of the approved therapies for osteoporosis are able to form the quantities of new bone that ALX1-11 is potentially capable of. Patients with bone density below the "fracture threshold" (osteopenia), as well as those with established vertebral fractures (osteoporosis), would be expected to benefit from treatment. Animal toxicology studies have been completed and there were no results to indicate any restrictions in the clinical usage of the drug. Preliminary human clinical experience with ALX1-11 in healthy, postmenopausal females has demonstrated no apparent risk of frank hypercalcemia* at single administrations up to 5.0 µg/kg or daily administrations for 7 days up to 2.0 µg/kg/day. Based on these studies, the anticipated therapeutic range of ALX1-11 is 50-100 µg per day (approx. 1.0 - 1.5 µg/kg/day). Therefore, the dose range to be tested in this study will include an anticipated minimally effective dose, interim dose and maximally tolerable dose (50, 75 and 100 µg). The efficacy of 3 doses of ALX1-11 will be assessed in terms of bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women. The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose-response relationship of ALX1-11 in terms of bone mineral density. The efficacy of the 3 doses of ALX1-11 relative to placebo will be determined by measurement of bone mineral density (by DXA) at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Patients will administer a daily subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL of either 50, 75 or 100 µg of ALX1-11 or placebo every morning for 12 months. Women will be advised to use the provided calcium supplements (500mg elemental calcium) to maintain a total daily intake of 1000-1500 mg/day and vitamin D supplements will also be provided (400 IU/day). A dietary questionnaire will be done at visit screen, 6 and 15. If a patient's total serum calcium measurement, during the treatment phase, demonstrates frank hypercalcemia OR if her pre-dose calcium levels are more than 0.5 mg/dL or 0.125 mmol/L above the upper limit of normal (2.78 mmol/L or 11.1 mg/dL), then the patient's serum calcium level must be repeated. If upon re-test a patient continues to demonstrate frank hypercalcemia OR if her basal pre-dose calcium levels continues to be elevated above the upper limit of normal, then the patient will be withdrawn from the study. *Frank Hypercalcemia: defined as total serum calcium levels above 11.1 mg/dL or 2.78 mmol/L</detailed_description>

Specifically excluded are diseases known to contribute to osteoporosis: hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess, hyper or hypocalcemia, Paget's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteomalacia and severe scoliosis. Evidence of lumbar fusions, osteophytes or excessive degenerative disease which precludes reasonable DXA measurement. History or presence of cancer within the previous 5 years except for superficial basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Treatment with any of the following therapies: Any form of Estrogen within previous 6 months Prior use of Etidronate for more that 2 treatment cycles (2weeks/cycle) and/or any use within prior 6 months Any other bisphosphonate Parathyroid Hormone use within 6 months Fluoride (&gt;10 mg/day) within 12 months Any form of Calcitonin within previous 4 months Thyroid hormone within previous 4 months unless TSH levels found to remain within normal range Other therapies known to influence bone metabolism* within previous 4 months Any investigational compound within previous 3 months Abnormal serum Ca++ level: patients having two (2) consecutive serum calcium above 2.66 mmol/L (10.6 mg/dl) will be excluded. History of positive test for Hepatitis B or C, or urine drug screen. History of alcohol or drug abuse: an excess of alcohol is defined as more than 4 or any combination of more than four (4) of the following per day: 120 mL wine, 360 mL beer or wine cooler or 30 mL whiskey. Weight more than 25% above ideal body weight, (minimum 45 kg) as listed in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables (Appendix 3) Deemed unsuitable, in the opinion of the investigator, for any other reason.
