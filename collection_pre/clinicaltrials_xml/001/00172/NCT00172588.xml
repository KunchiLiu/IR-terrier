	<brief_summary>Our previous results revealed that the expression of killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on NK cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis. It implies that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to abnormal endometrial tissues, but not the aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. In addition, in vitro coculture of macrophages and endometrial stromal cells (ESC) increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA in ESC, which might further enhance the proliferation of ESC and subsequently result in the formation of ectopic endometrial implants in adenomyosis. Besides, another possible mechanism is the abnormal apoptosis of ESC in adenomyosis. In endometriosis, apoptotic endometrial cells were found to be decreased, which possibly accounts for the formation of endometriosis. However, there have not been reports investigating the apoptosis of ESC in adenomyosis. In this study, we try to investigate apoptotic ESC with flow cytometry in women with and without adenomyosis. Annexin V, bcl-2, and caspase-3 were measured to represent the degree of apoptosis in ESC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group). Annexin V-PE, bcl-2-PE, and caspase-3-PE are stained, and flow cytometry is done to measure the degree of apoptosis in ESC. On the other hand, another half of ESC are cultured for 24h, and also Annexin V-PE, bcl-2-PE, and caspase-3-PE are stained, and flow cytometry is done.</detailed_description>
