	<brief_summary>Osseointegrated root form implants have been applied successfully in treating fully and partially edentulous patients and patients with single tooth missing. However, the success rate of osseointegrated dental implants was not as good in patients with poor bone quality. The reasons are believed that poor bone quality reduces the initial stability of dental implants and then reduces the success rate. For increasing initial stability of dental implants, some technical modifications are suggested in literature. However, due to lack of an objective method to evaluate bone quality, they are controversial. The purposes of this clinical study are to develop a standard procedure which using cutting resistance measured by Osseocare in surgery to evaluate the bone quality and to compare with the clinical experiences of oral surgeons. The objective outcome, initial stability of dental implant, is measured with Osstell. The analyzed results are also helpful for less experienced surgeons.</brief_summary>
