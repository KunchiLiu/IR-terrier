	<detailed_description>The primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fracture, and anabolic agents can accomplish this by strengthening bone structure, which is accompanied by changes in BMD. Effects of ALX1-11 on BMD have been previously documented in a dose-finding Phase II clinical trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, who were otherwise naive to osteoporosis therapies. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 on lumbar vertebrae were statistically significant compared to placebo after 12 months of treatment. In addition, animal studies showed that the new bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good quality both histologically and biomechanically (Mosekilde et al., 1991; Kimmel et al., 1993). Protocol ALX1-11-93001 (TOP) assessed the effect of 18 months of ALX1-11 treatment on fracture incidence as a primary efficacy variable, and Protocol CL1-11-002 (OLES) assessed the effect on BMD for up to 24 months of treatment. Subjects who will be enrolled in the current study (TRES) will be those who received placebo in TOP and ALX1-11 in OLES. TRES will evaluate the effects of continued ALX1-11 treatment on the safety and efficacy variables assessed in the OLE study for a maximum treatment duration of 36 months in the OLES and TRES combined.</detailed_description>

Illness was acute in nature and not expected to recur during the remaining treatment period of the study Inhaled corticosteroids. At a dose &lt;1200 mg/day beclomethasone equivalent Intraarticular injections. A single intraarticular injection allowed every 6 months if the dose of corticosteroid injected is less than an equivalent dose of prednisone 40 mg suspension Phenytoin.

Allowed if last phenytoin exposure was &gt;15 years prior to screening for TOP or was between 515 years before screening for TOP and for &lt;2 months duration Provera® (medroxyprogesterone). Allowed if used according to the label Laboratory Values and Physical Examination Findings For excluded laboratory values, the levels shown in the following table are the upper limits for exclusions based on specific test results, with the exception of calculated creatinine clearance and serum 25(OH) vitamin D, for which the limits are lower. All exclusionary laboratory results should be confirmed by a repeat test. Subjects may be excluded for any other clinically abnormal value, as determined by the investigator. Fasting serum total calcium (Ca). Subject excluded if value* &gt;10.2 mg/dL**,*** 24hour urinary Ca. Subject excluded if value* &gt;360 mg/day** Serum total alkaline phosphatase.
