	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the combination test agent, prednisolone acetate 1.0% and tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic suspension compared to PredForte (prednisolone acetate 1.0%) ophthalmic suspension. Bioequivalence will be measured by comparing aqueous humor concentrations of prednisolone acetate.</brief_summary>
