	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Alimta (Pemetrexed) Treatment of Advanced Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The broad range of clinical activity of thymic carcinomas makes the likelihood of detecting efficacy of a single agent such as premetrexed a reasonable objective since these malignancies are relatively slow growing and exhibit a broad range of chemosensitivity to antineoplastic agents.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed invasive, recurrent or metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma not amenable to potentially curative therapy by surgery. Original biopsy of tumor is sufficient for diagnoses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Patients must have measurable disease with at least one bidimensional measurable lesion. Any scans or xrays used to document measurable disease must be obtained with 6 weeks prior to registration. Patients may have had prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease Adequate organ function as defined by: bili &lt;/=1.5; calc. crt clr of &gt;/=45; hematologicgranulocytes &gt;/=1500 &amp; plt &gt;/=100K. Patients who are receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids for myasthenia gravis are eligible. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Acute intercurrent infection or complications pregnancy or lactating patients Inability to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for a 5day period (8day period for longacting agents. Presence of clinically relevant thirdspace fluid collections that cannot be controlled by a procedure</criteria>
