	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to study the effects of antihypertensive therapy based on home systolic blood pressure (BP) with different target levels using two classes of drugs. The HOSP study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint study. The study subjects are 40-79 years old hypertensive patients. After a 4 weeks of baseline period, subjects are randomly assigned to (1) modest control group (morning home BP &lt;140 mmHg) or (2) strict control group (morning home BP &lt;130 mmHg), and to (a) amlodipine group or (b) losartan group. Additional antihypertensive drugs can be used if home BP is not controlled. Home BP is measured in the early morning and late evening. The participants will be followed up for 5 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this trial is to study the effects of antihypertensive therapy based on home systolic blood pressure (BP) with different target levels using two classes of drugs. The HOSP study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint study. Inclusion criteria are 40-79 years old treated or untreated hypertensive patients without serious medical conditions. After a 4 weeks of baseline period, subjects are randomly assigned to (1) modest control group (target morning home BP &lt;140 mmHg) or (2) strict control group (morning home BP &lt;130 mmHg), and to (a) amlodipine group (2.5-5 mg od) or (b) losartan group (25-50 mg od). Additional antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta-blockers and alpha-blockers) can be used if home BP is not controlled. Home BP is measured in the early morning and late evening. Primary end point is combined cardiovascular events.The participants will be followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
