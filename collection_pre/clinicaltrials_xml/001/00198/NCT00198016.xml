	<detailed_description>Congenital coronary artery fistula (CAF) can be defined as a direct communication of a coronary artery with a cardiac chamber, great vessel, or other vascular structure, bypassing the myocardial capillary bed. CAF is an uncommon anomaly, occurring as an incidental finding in 0.1% to 0.2% of coronary angiograms. They are not gender specific. Many patients have symptoms like congestive heart failure, infective endocarditis, myocardial ischemia, or rupture of an aneurismal fistula. Surgical closure of coronary artery fistula was initially reported in 1983 with low rates of morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous treatment appeared as an alternative to surgery. Transcatheter closure of CAF was first utilized in 1983. Along this years, with experience and improvements in catheterization equipment and occlusion devices, CAF occlusion have been successfully performed using microcoils. We report our experience in using microcoils to percutaneous treatment of coronary fistulas.</detailed_description>
