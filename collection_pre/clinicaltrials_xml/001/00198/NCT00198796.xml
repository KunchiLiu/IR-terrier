	<brief_summary>Five subjects will be admitted to the GCRC. The next day they will eat a light breakfast, fast for 90 minutes, ingest ETEC strain H10407, and fast for 90 more minutes. After this challenge they will be monitored closely , and all stools will be collected, graded and weighed. On Day 5, or sooner if indicated, they will begin antibiotics to eradicate the challenge strain. They will be scheduled for discharge on Day 7 but may leave a few days earlier if early antibiotic treatment is given. Hypothesis: A challenge dose of 10(9) CFU of ETEC strain H10407, will cause diarrhea in at least 60% of subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale for validation H10407 in the challenge study proposed at Johns Hopkins University is that this initial challenge study will support additional challenge studies planned for the future. In these future studies, a bovine milk immunoglobulin containing high levels of antibodies specific for CFA/I or CFA/I-derived colonization factor will be investigated as a potential oral prophylaxis to neutralize subsequent challenge against CFA/I-expressing H10407 in the clinical setting. The goal here is therefore to validate a challenge dose of 1x109 h10407 organisms in the hands of the Johns Hopkins investigative team and to then use this dose in the future prophylaxis/challenge studies. Challenge doses equal to or comparable to the 1x109 dose proposed for the JHU study have been used in 6 of the 9 challenge studies that have been done with the H10407 strain. The subsequent challenge studies using H10407 will be registered as part of other protocols.</detailed_description>
