	<brief_summary>The follow-up of patients operated on for lung cancer is heterogeneous. An intensive follow-up including routine clinic visits, chest X-rays, chest computed tomography (CT) scans and fiberoptic bronchoscopies might detect more small, potentially curable, recurrences and second cancers. However, as it appears in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommendations, a large randomized study is necessary to evaluate the survival impact of such a follow-up strategy. This is the main objective of this IFCT-0302 study, which is a large randomized controlled study conducted in France comparing this intensive follow-up to a follow-up with only routine clinic visits and chest X-rays.</brief_summary>
