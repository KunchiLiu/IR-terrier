	<brief_title>Use of Herbal Supplements in Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• The study data collection will occur in two phases, active weight loss (phase 1) and weight maintenance (phase 2). Transition into phase 2 will be individually determined by participant attainment of a goal ‘healthy’ weight. During the 52 weeks participants will pick up supplemental pills, have weight measured, and meet for educational meeting on an every other week basis. Upon entering phase 2, participants will have the option of educational sessions on a monthly basis or every other week. Participants will have a goal ‘healthy’ weight determined at baseline by a combination of personal goals, Harris Benedict Equation goals, body composition goals, and BMI range. All participants will be put on a weight reduction plan to reach these goals and be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups, Biolean, Biolean Free, or Placebo. Since it is expected some participants will reach goal weight before others, the 2nd milestone data collection will occur at attainment of goal weight. To assure all participants have 3 data collection points, any participant who is not expected to reasonably reach their goal weight by 34 weeks will have the 2nd milestone data collection at 26 weeks. The 3rd milestone data collection for all participants is 52 weeks after initial intake of supplement. Upon attainment of goal weight and 2nd data collection point, participants will be educated on a weight maintenance plan and given a new meal plan to achieve long term healthy weight maintenance.</detailed_description>
