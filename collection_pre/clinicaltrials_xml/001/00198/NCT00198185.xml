	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The use of cascade platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) on medium and large sized rotator cuff tears will improve patient results versus the control results by 50%. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of PRFM on rotator cuff repairs. Since locally applied platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has shown early promise in enhancing tendon and ligament healing in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) reconstruction, the investigators believe that locally applied PRFM will enhance the quality of rotator cuff repairs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients 45 years of age and older who have failed conservative treatment for rotator cuff pathology. Patients in this study will have full thickness rotator cuff tears that are classified arthroscopically as medium (1 to 3 cm) or large (3 to 5 cm) and that are treated with arthroscopic repair. Patients who have undergone revision procedures, miniopen, or open procedures will be excluded.</criteria>
