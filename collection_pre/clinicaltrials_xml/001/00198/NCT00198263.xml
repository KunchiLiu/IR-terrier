	<brief_title>Study Using the Medpulser Electroporation System With Bleomycin to Treat Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electroporation therapy is a tumor-specific ablative treatment modality with the potential to manage local tumors without the potentially undesirable side effects of systemic chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy. Surgical resection of solid tumors often leaves subjects with significant organ dysfunction and/or permanent disfigurement requiring reconstructive surgery. In contrast, electroporation therapy may offer equivalent disease control to conventional surgery with lessened need for reconstructive surgery. Electroporation therapy may also provide economic benefits over conventional surgical and or radiation procedures through reduced operating theatre costs, hospital stays and post treatment interventions. The ability to shrink or eliminate local tumors with the MedPulserÂ® System when used in conjunction with intralesional Bleomycin is an important new possible treatment for the conservative local management of SCCHN and provides a possible alternative treatment option to surgical excision in the management of cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. The presence of primary oral cavity, primary pharyngeal, primary laryngeal, salivary gland, limited recurrent and second primary tumors must be confirmed by histological examination of a tissue sample (e.g., biopsy) obtained within 2 months of the subject receiving the study treatment. 2. The length of the longest diameter of the study lesion must be &lt; 5 cm and the calculated treatment volume (tumor volume plus a 0.5 cm margin around the tumor) for the study lesion [where treatment volume = 0.5 (a+1) (b+1)2 and where a = length of the longest diameter (cm), b = the next longest diameter perpendicular to "a" (cm)] must be &lt; 60.0 cm3. 3. Age: 18 years or older. 4. Male or female. 5. Men and women of childbearing potential must be using Investigator prescribed contraceptive methods while undergoing protocol related therapy. 6. Baseline performance status: ECOG 02: Grade 0: Fully active, able to carry on all predisease performance without restriction. Grade 1: Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work. Grade 2: Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare, but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours. 7. Life expectancy of at least 6 months. 8. Subjects must sign a written Informed Consent prior to receiving any study procedures or treatments. 1. Subjects with tumors suspected of involving a 50% or greater encasement of a blood vessel as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. 2. Subjects with tumors having bone invasion. 3. Subjects with hypersensitivity to bleomycin. 4. Subjects who have received or will exceed a total lifetime dose of bleomycin greater than 400 units. 5. Subjects deemed unsuitable for general anesthesia. 6. Subjects with a significant history of emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis. 7. Subjects with indwelling cardiac pacemakers who cannot tolerate a period with pacemaker turned off. 8. Subjects with a history of uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia. 9. Women who are pregnant, or are nursing. Women must have a negative pregnancy test (urine pregnancy tests are acceptable) within 7 days of study treatment.</criteria>
