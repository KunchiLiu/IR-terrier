We present here a survey performed about the management of lung cancer pts aged 70 or more in France. All pts aged 70 or more with histo/cytologically proved lung cancer diagnosed between sept 02 and oct 03 in participating centers were recorded and their characteristics, the diagnostic procedures, therapeutic management and survival were analysed.</brief_summary>
