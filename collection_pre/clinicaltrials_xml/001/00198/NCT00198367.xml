	<brief_summary>Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancers comprising a mediastinal ganglionic invasion N2 account for 20 to 30% of the NSCLCs. They are almost always potentially resectable, but the results obtained by surgery alone or surgery followed by chemotherapy (CT) and/or radiotherapy (RT) are insufficient. The neoadjuvant approach was tested, in randomized tests of exclusive CT, or in noncomparative tests of RT-CT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>These results justify the choice of the study design currently suggested, testing the preoperative feasibility 1. chemotherapy: cisplatin-Gemzar (arm A) or 2. chemoradiotherapy: cisplatin-navelbine-radiotherapy (arm B) or Carboplatin-Taxol-radiotherapy (arm C). The results obtained, in terms of feasibility and toxicity, will make it possible to select the optimal diagrams for a phase III study.</detailed_description>
