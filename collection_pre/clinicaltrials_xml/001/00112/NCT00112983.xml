	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of eculizumab may prevent leukemia and stop the destruction of red blood cells in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well eculizumab works in treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eculizumab in Treating Patients With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of eculizumab in patients with transfusion-dependent hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. - Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of hemoglobin stabilization and the number of packed red blood cell units transfused during the 26-week treatment period, in these patients. Secondary - Compare the occurrence of transfusion avoidance, hemolysis (measured by lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] area under the curve), and the changes in fatigue during the 26-week treatment period in patients treated with this drug vs placebo. - Compare LDH changes, quality of life changes, thrombosis, platelet activity, nitric oxide, and free hemoglobin measures during the 26-week treatment period in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) units transfused 1 year prior to screening (&lt; 15 units vs 15-25 units vs &gt; 25 units). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Within 10 days after PRBC transfusion (administered during the study observation period), patients receive placebo IV over 30 minutes once a week for 5 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 21 weeks. - Arm II: Within 10 days after PRBC transfusion (administered during the study observation period), patients receive eculizumab IV over 30 minutes once a week for 5 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 21 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at weeks 0-4, 12, 20, and 26 during study treatment; then at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients (37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
