	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the remission rate in patients with NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 expressing stage II-IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are still in complete clinical remission 12 months after initial documentation of remission treated with vaccine therapy comprising vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 vaccine and fowlpox-NY-ESO-1 vaccine. Secondary - Determine the NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity, by evaluating NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and CD8+ T cells induced by this regimen, in these patients. - Correlate time to treatment failure with vaccine-induced NY-ESO-1 antigen specific cellular or humoral immunity in these patients. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 vaccine intradermally on day 1 and fowlpox-NY-ESO-1 vaccine subcutaneously on days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, and 169 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-36 months.</detailed_description>
