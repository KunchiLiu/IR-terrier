	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if patients treated with the combination of Taxane/Carboplatin plus Cetuximab (C/T/C) have a longer progression-free survival than patients treated with Taxane/Carboplatin (T/C) alone. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>
