	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A peripheral stem cell, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving busulfan and melphalan with or without antithymocyte globulin before transplant and cyclosporine with methylprednisolone or methotrexate after transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of donor stem cell transplant in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in terms of the incidence of grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease, in young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. - Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality at 100 days post-transplantation in these patients. OUTLINE: - Conditioning: Patients receive busulfan IV or orally 4 times daily on days -8 to -5 (a total of 16 doses) and melphalan IV over 15-20 minutes on days -4 to -2. Patients with an unrelated donor also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -4 to -2. - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic SCT on day 0. - Post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients who undergo cord blood SCT receive cyclosporine and methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients who undergo peripheral blood or bone marrow SCT receive cyclosporine and methotrexate (short course) for GVHD prophylaxis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
