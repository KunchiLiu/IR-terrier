	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of CCI-779 and bevacizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving CCI-779 together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dosing for the combination of CCI-779 and Bevacizumab in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. (Phase I) II. To determine the proportion of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer who are progression free at 6 months. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicity of the combination of CCI 779 and Bevacizumab in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. (Phase II) II. To determine the clinical response rate of CCI 779 and Bevacizumab in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. (Phase II) III. To determine the time to progression (TTP), disease free survival, and overall survival of CCI 779 and Bevacizumab in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify predictive molecular markers of response, both at the tumor level and in the plasma/serum level, in an exploratory manner. II. To correlate blood markers of angiogenesis with clinical activity of the combination of CCI-779 and Bevacizumab. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients are stratified according to study phase (I vs II). Phase I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and bevacizumab IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 and bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive CCI-779 and bevacizumab as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years after study entry.</detailed_description>
