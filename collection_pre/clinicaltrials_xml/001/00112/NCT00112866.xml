	<brief_summary>Cilengitide may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving cilengitide before and after surgery may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme. This phase II trial is studying how well cilengitide works in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cilengitide in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in operative patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme treated with cilengitide. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups for the preoperative treatment component. Preoperative Treatment Group I: Patients receive high-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days -8, -4, and -1. Preoperative Treatment Group II: Patients receive low-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days -8, -4, and -1. Resection: All patients undergo tumor resection on day 0. Postoperative Treatment: Beginning within 2 weeks after surgery, all patients receive high-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per preoperative treatment group) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
