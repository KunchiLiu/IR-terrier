	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Melphalan, a chemotherapeutic agent, has been found to be an effective treatment choice for destroying myeloma cells, especially when given at high (bone marrow ablative) doses. Total marrow irradiation (TMI)/ablative dose radiation therapy is another modality capable of destroying myeloma cells. Autologous peripheral blood/stem cell transplant (ASCT) given after either melphalan or following TMI (aimed at the bone marrow containing areas of the skeleton, the site of origin of myeloma cells) will shorten the duration/alleviate the severity of both melphalan and marrow irradiation-associated side effects. Lenalidomide, an effective agent on its own right for the treatment of myeloma, has been shown to further enhance the beneficial effects of autologous stem cell transplants when given as maintenance therapy. PURPOSE: This previously phase I trial established the maximum tolerated dose of TMI at 1600 cGy. The phase II part of this study is ongoing and is studying the effects of high-dose melphalan and ASCT, followed by TMI and a second ASCT, with subsequent maintenance lenalidomide. The study is conducted in patients with stages I-III myeloma, with specific emphasis on assessing complete and very good partial response rate conversions, progression-free and overall survival, and safety/feasibility of delivering the planned treatment regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan and Radiation Therapy Followed By Lenalidomide in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility and toxicities of tandem cycle ablative therapy consisting first of high-dose melphalan and then escalating doses of fractionated total marrow irradiation (TMI) using helical tomotherapy in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose of TMI using helical tomotherapy. III. To assess response rate, progression free and over-all survival following treatment with tandem cycle ablative therapy consisting first of high-dose melphalan and then escalating doses of TMI using helical tomotherapy with Dexamethasone/Thalidomide maintenance therapy in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. IV. To assess the feasibility of adding decadron and thalidomide as maintenance following the second cycle of high-dose therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To perform cytogenetic, gene rearrangement, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on baseline and post-treatment bone marrow and blood specimens and correlate the presence/persistence of these features with treatment outcome. II. To bank/develop cell lines developed for future investigations of tumor biology, and for potential assessment of efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of total marrow irradiation (TMI). PRIMING AND APHERESIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours. Patients also receive filgrastim IV or subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after the administration of cyclophosphamide and continuing until apheresis is complete. Patients undergo apheresis until an adequate number of peripheral blood stem cells are collected. ABLATIVE THERAPY: Course 1: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -2 and -1. Patients then undergo autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0 and receive filgrastim IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. Course 2: Beginning 6-18 weeks later, patients undergo TMI once or twice daily on days -4 to -1. Patients then undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant and receive filgrastim IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning within 6-8 weeks of day 0 of course 2 (TMI), patients receive oral lenalidomide daily. Courses repeat every 28 days for approximately 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for at least 2 years.</detailed_description>
