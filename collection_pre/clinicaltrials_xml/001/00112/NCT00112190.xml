	<detailed_description>The study lasts approximately 10 weeks. Patients may either receive the real itopride, or a sugar pill called placebo. They have equal chances of receiving either treatment. After having completed this study, patients may be eligible to continue treatment for a longer period. At that point, all patients receive itopride. Patients need to come to the clinic for evaluations 4 times during the trial. Various evaluations are done at these visits, such as a physical exam, lab tests, evaluation of the heart condition, and questionnaires need to be completed by the patient to see if the drug helps them in relieving their symptoms.</detailed_description>
