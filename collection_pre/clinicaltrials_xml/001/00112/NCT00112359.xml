	<brief_title>International Safety and Efficacy Study of Aztreonam for Inhalation Solution (AZLI) in Cystic Fibrosis Patients With P. Aeruginosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CF patients often have lung infections that occur repeatedly or worsen over time. The lung infections are often caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Treatment with antibiotics can stop or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by mouth, intravenously (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZLI, an investigational formulation of the antibiotic aztreonam and administered TID using the PARI eFlowÂ® electronic nebulizer, in CF patients with PA. In this study, participant eligibility was assessed at a screening visit 7 to 14 days prior to the baseline visit (Day 0). Those participants who continued to meet eligibility criteria at Day 0 were randomized and began a 28-day course of blinded study treatment (AZLI TID or placebo TID). Participants returned for clinic visits at Day 14, an end of treatment visit at Day 28, and a follow-up visit 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 42).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documentation of CF diagnosis as evidenced by one or more clinical features consistent with the CF phenotype and one or more of the following criteria: Sweat chloride greater than or equal to 60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test (QPIT); Two wellcharacterized mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; or Abnormal nasal potential difference. PA present in expectorated sputum or throat swab culture at Screening. FEV1 between (and including) 25% and 75% predicted at Screening. Negative pregnancy test at Screening. Ability to perform reproducible pulmonary function tests. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) greater than or equal to 90% on room air at Screening. Ability to provide written informed consent. Administration of antipseudomonal antibiotics by inhalation, IV, or oral routes (including azithromycin) within 14 days of Screening. Current use of oral corticosteroids in doses exceeding the equivalent of 10 mg prednisone/day or 20 mg prednisone every other day. History of sputum or throat swab culture yielding Burkholderia cepacia in the previous 2 years. History of daily continuous oxygen supplementation or requirement for more than 2 liters/minute at night. Administration of any investigational drug or use of any investigational device within 28 days of Screening and within 6 halflives of the investigational drug (whichever was longer). Known local or systemic hypersensitivity to monobactam antibiotics. Inability to tolerate shortacting bronchodilator use at least three times daily. Changes in protocolpermitted antimicrobial, bronchodilator, antiinflammatory, or corticosteroid medications within 7 days prior to Screening or between Screening and the next visit. Changes in physiotherapy technique or schedule within 7 days prior to Screening or between Screening and the next visit. History of lung transplantation. A chest xray indicating abnormal findings at Screening or within the previous 90 days. Abnormal renal or hepatic function at Screening. Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, would have interfered with participant treatment, assessment, or compliance with the protocol. Use of aerosolized hypertonic saline (except for sputum induction) during the 14 days preceding Visit 1.</criteria>
