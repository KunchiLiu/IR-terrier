	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvocidib in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as alvocidib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Alvocidib may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. It may also stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity profile and dose-limiting toxicity of flavopiridol (alvocidib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the immunomodulatory effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine pharmacogenomics of this drug, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in patients who experience clinical response. OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study. Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over 4½ hours once weekly in weeks 1-4. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease after 4 courses of therapy discontinue study treatment. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 1 additional course of therapy beyond documentation of CR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of alvocidib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
