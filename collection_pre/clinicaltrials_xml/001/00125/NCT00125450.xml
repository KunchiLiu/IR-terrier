	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether chest physiotherapy with forced expiratory technique reduces delay of healing in acute bronchiolitis of children between 15 days and 24 months of age.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Chest Physiotherapy for Acute Bronchiolitis in Toddlers (BRONKINOU)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory infection in infants, and the respiratory condition leading to the majority of hospital admissions in young children. It is also probably the most common serious illness of childhood lacking evidence-based treatment. Evidence against the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy with vibration and postural drainage techniques has been described but forced expiratory technique, as described in France, has never been evaluated. The investigators hypothesised that forced expiratory technique was able to reduce the duration of respiratory distress. Comparison(s): The investigators compare physiotherapy with forced expiratory techniques to simple aspiration of naso-pharyngeal secretions.</detailed_description>
