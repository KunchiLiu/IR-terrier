	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is designed to investigate the effectiveness of Tarceva (OSI-774) combined with capecitabine in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tarceva and Capecitabine for Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated once daily with Tarceva, twice daily with capecitabine for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off of capecitabine (a cycle is 21 days). At week 1 of each cycle a physical exam and blood work will be performed. Reassessment of tumor size will be conducted at 6 weeks (2 cycles), 12 weeks (4 cycles) and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients will remain on treatment until one of the following occur: disease progression, illness that prevents further treatment or unacceptable adverse events.</detailed_description>
