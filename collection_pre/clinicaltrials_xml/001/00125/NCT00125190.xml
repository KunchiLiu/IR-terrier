	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Insulin-Like Growth Factor (rhIGF-1) Treatment of Short Stature Associated With IGF-1 Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth failure associated with primary IGF-1 deficiency (IGFD). Primary IGFD is a term that has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular defects in growth hormone (GH) action. In this protocol, primary IGFD is defined as short stature (&lt;-2 standard deviations [SDs] below the mean for age and gender), and abnormal serum IGF-1 (&lt;-2 SDs below the mean for age and gender). The trial is an open-label, concentration-controlled trial conducted at up to 20 centers throughout the United States.</detailed_description>
