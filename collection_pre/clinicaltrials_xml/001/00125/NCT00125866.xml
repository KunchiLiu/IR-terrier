	<brief_title>The Effect of Cocoa Flavonoids on Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Flavonoids are natural substances found in fruits and vegetables, tea and red wine. The investigators know that people who eat a diet rich in these foods are less likely to have heart disease. This, in part, may be due to the blood pressure lowering effect of flavonoids. Cocoa beans are a rich natural source of flavonoids. Unfortunately when cocoa is made into chocolate most of the flavonoids are destroyed. The aim of this study is to find out the effect of cocoa flavonoids on blood pressure after 12 weeks of daily consumption of a specially prepared chocolate drink that is rich in flavonoids.</detailed_description>
