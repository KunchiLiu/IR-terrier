	<brief_summary>This study will examine whether platelet gel positively affects wound healing. Platelet gel will be used to treat punch biopsy wounds and the results will be compared to results from wounds treated with a control treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelets for Acute Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelets contribute to the healing process in soft tissue by providing the initial hemostasis that occurs following injury, a framework for fibrin matrix formation and contribution of growth factors. According to the US National Institutes of Health, surgical procedures are considered a form of controlled injury, so many of the complications faced by surgery patients are very similar to those faced by trauma patients. Scientists are currently investigating ways to treat wounds caused by trauma, burns or surgical inventions with biological agents (i.e. growth factors) or new drugs. Growth factor priming of acute wound sites pre-activates the cellular and molecular components of tissue repair, prior to tissue injury. Objectives are aimed at gathering information to establish evidence that autologous platelet gel positively effects the healing of acute wounds.</detailed_description>
