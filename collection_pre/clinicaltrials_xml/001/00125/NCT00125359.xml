	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of two new anticancer drugs, erlotinib (Tarceva) and bexarotene (Targretin), when treating patients with advanced lung cancer. Erlotinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bexarotene is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This combination of drugs is experimental.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tarceva and Targretin Oral Capsules in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single institution open label phase II trial. Consecutive, eligible patients presenting with the diagnosis of advanced NSCLC are to be enrolled in this study. All eligible patients will receive continuous daily oral erlotinib 150 mg (Tarceva™) with daily bexarotene oral capsules 400 mg/m2 (Targretin®). The two agents will be taken at the same time. We anticipate the maximum accrual of 40 patients to this trial. Patients will be evaluated by history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment every 4 weeks. Radiographic disease assessments by chest radiograph will be obtained every 4 weeks and computer tomography every 8 weeks or longer if clinically indicated. Whole body PET scan will be obtained at 10 days and 8 weeks. All radiographic studies will be sent to Medical Metrix Solutions (MMS) for an independent radiographic review of tumor response.</detailed_description>
