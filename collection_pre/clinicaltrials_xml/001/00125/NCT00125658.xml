	<brief_summary>The results of this study will provide sound, scientific evidence of physiologic mechanisms responsible for upper-extremity weakness; evidence of the processes involved in neuromuscular adaptation; and will elucidate the relationship between impairment and motor disability in post-stroke hemiparesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms of Upper-Extremity Motor Recovery in Post-stroke Hemiparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal extends the work accomplished in our initial study (project #B2405R, 'Effects of Strength Training on Upper-limb Function in Post-stroke Hemiparesis'). In the present study we will conduct a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of staged rehabilitation for the upper-extremity involving sequential delivery of functional therapy and high intensity resistance training. Therefore, this proposal directly compares the effects of functional and resistance training delivered individually. The researchers' previous work investigated a hybrid therapy of functional and resistance training against functional training alone. All subjects will participate in a 5 week run-in period of no treatment. This no-treatment block will afford multiple baseline measurements and, in addition, will provide information regarding the rate and magnitude of any spontaneous recovery without treatment. Following the second baseline measurement, all subjects will be randomized to receive either 10 weeks of functional training followed by 10 weeks of high-intensity resistance training or resistance training followed by functional training. Re-evaluation will occur following each block of treatment, and retention effects will be evaluated after 6 and 12 months with no additional treatment. Subjects will be evaluated with: outcome measures used broadly in Clinical Neurology and Rehabilitation, a battery of biomechanical performance measures including strength, muscle activation, reflex modulation and motor coordination, and with kinematics of free reaching movements. The researchers will investigate persons in the intermediate phase of recovery which they define as between 6 and 18 months post-cerebrovascular accident (CVA), having completed all inpatient and outpatient therapies, with continued experience of residual motor deficits.</detailed_description>
