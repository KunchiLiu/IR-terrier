	<brief_title>Tacrolimus for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus With Membranous Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glomerulonephritis is one of the major disease manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The treatment of membranous (type V) lupus nephritis, a subset that carries a high morbidity, remains unsatisfactory. Recent studies suggest that immunosuppressive therapy targeted against the calcineurin pathway of T-helper cells, for example, tacrolimus, may be effective in the treatment of primary membranous nephropathy. The investigators plan to conduct an open-label single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in the treatment of membranous nephropathy secondary to SLE. Twenty patients with biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy secondary to SLE will be recruited. They will be treated with oral prednisolone and tacrolimus for 6 months, followed by 6 months of maintenance steroids alone. Proteinuria, renal function, clinical and serologic lupus activity will be monitored. Complete remission is defined as 24-hour urinary protein excretion to less than 0.5 gm/day. This study will explore the potential role of tacrolimus in the treatment of membranous lupus nephritis, which is usually resistant to conventional therapy.</detailed_description>
