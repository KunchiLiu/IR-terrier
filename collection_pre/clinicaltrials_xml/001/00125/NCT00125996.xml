	<brief_summary>This is a two-center, randomised, single-blind (physician), prospective, controlled study to assess the acute (8 weeks) and chronic (16 weeks) effects of intravenous (IV) iron sucrose supplementation in anaemic and non-anaemic iron deficient patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The hypotheses are: - Treatment of anaemic and non-anaemic iron-deficient CHF patients with IV iron sucrose improves exercise capacity as measured by peak VO2. - IV iron sucrose is safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe CHF.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Phase and Design: Prospective two-centre, randomized, controlled, open-label, observer-blinded, parallel-group study Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) iron supplementation on exercise tolerance, as determined by peak VO2. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the effects of IV iron supplementation on exercise duration, left ventricular (LV) structure and function, symptom status (NYHA class, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire [MLHFQ], and subjective fatigue score), and haematological and biochemical (haemoglobin [Hb], haematocrit [Hct], iron status, N-BNP, cytokines and oxidative stress) indices. - To evaluate the safety profile of IV iron in subjects with moderate to severe CHF. Sample Size: 42 subjects (28 IV iron, 14 placebo); 50% anaemic and 50% non-anaemic</detailed_description>

	<criteria>≥21 years of age and have signed written informed consent Stable symptomatic CHF; NYHA III/IV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%, or if NYHA II then LVEF must be ≤35%, as assessed within last 6 months using echocardiographic or magnetic resonance imaging techniques. On optimal conventional therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to recruitment and without dose changes for at least 2 weeks. Peak VO2 ≤ 18 ml/kg/min on modified Naughton protocol cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Mean of the 2 screening Hb concentrations (week2 and week1) &lt; 12.5 g/dl (anaemic group, 50% of study population) or 12.514.0 g/dl (nonanaemic group, 50% of study population). Ferritin &lt;100 µg/l or 100300 µg/l with TSAT &lt;20%. Normal red cell folate and vitamin B12 status (according to local lab reference range). Resting blood pressure ≤160/100 mmHg. History of acquired iron overload; known haemochromatosis or first relatives with haemochromatosis; and allergic disorders (asthma, eczema, and anaphylactic reactions). Known hypersensitivity to parental iron preparations. Known active infection, bleeding, malignancy and haemolytic anaemia. History of chronic liver disease and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal range; chronic lung disease; myelodysplastic disorder; and known HIV/AIDS disease. Recipient of immunosuppressive therapy or renal dialysis. History of erythropoietin, IV or oral iron therapy, and blood transfusion in previous 30 days. Unstable angina pectoris, as judged by the investigator; severe uncorrected valvular disease or left ventricular outflow obstruction; obstructive cardiomyopathy; uncontrolled fast atrial fibrillation or flutter (heart rate &gt;110 beats per minute [bpm]); uncontrolled symptomatic brady or tachyarrhythmias. Musculoskeletal limitation that, in the judgement of the investigator, would impair cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
