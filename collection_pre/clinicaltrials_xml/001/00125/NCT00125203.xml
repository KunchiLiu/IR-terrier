	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Myobloc in ALS patients who are having excessive drooling. The primary goal of the study is to determine if the patient perceives a benefit from the Myobloc in controlling excessive drooling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Myobloc in the Treatment of Sialorrhea (Drooling) in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary goals of this study are to: - determine the safety of bilateral injections of Myobloc into the parotid and submandibular glands as an effort to control sialorrhea; - determine by objective measures if the Myobloc injection decreases the saliva produced; - determine caregiver perceived benefit from Myobloc injection.</detailed_description>
