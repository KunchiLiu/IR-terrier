	<brief_title>Internally Versus Externally Guided Body Weight-Supported Treadmill Training (BWSTT) for Locomotor Recovery Post-stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pilot study, we tested two forms of locomotor training for gait rehabilitation in persons post-stroke: traditional locomotor training (partial body-weight support and manual assistance of therapists) vs. robotic-assisted locomotor training (partial body-weight support and robotic guidance with the Lokomat). We enrolled 16 persons with chronic (&gt;6 months) hemiparesis post-stroke who were randomized to traditional/manual or robotic locomotor training. All individuals received 12 sessions (thrice weekly for four weeks) of training. Each session involved 30 minutes of stepping. The complete study results are published.</detailed_description>
