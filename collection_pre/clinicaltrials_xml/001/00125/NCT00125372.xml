Tarceva is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for lung cancer. Targretin is approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This combination of drugs is experimental.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tarceva and Targretin in Stage I-II Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib 150mg and bexarotene 400mg/m2 will be administered orally for 7-9 days prior to thoracotomy. Plasma samples will be collected on the day before surgery and along with tissue samples on the day of the thoracotomy. Analyses will be done on the resected specimen and it will be compared to the pre-study diagnostic specimen.</detailed_description>
