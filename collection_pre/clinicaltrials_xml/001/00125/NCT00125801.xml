	<brief_title>The Pain Pen for Breakthrough Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breakthrough pain is an exacerbation of severe pain that occurs on a background of otherwise controlled pain. Breakthrough pain is common in patients with advanced cancer. Current medications to treat breakthrough pain include oral immediate release opioid formulations and more recently oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. The pain pen study is a randomized controlled double blind cross-over study comparing the efficacy of oral immediate release morphine with that of subcutaneous hydromorphone, injected through a so called pain pen, on breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Preliminary experience with the pain pen suggests that it has a more rapid time of onset of pain relief than oral formulations.</detailed_description>
