	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (candesartan cilexetil– Blopress®) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine besilate– Norvasc®/Amlodin®) in terms of the incidence of cardiovascular events among high-risk hypertensive patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension continues to be a major public health issue in the world. To combat this problem, many antihypertensive drugs have been developed and proven effective at controlling blood pressure in the last half century. In recent decades, antihypertensive drugs have been shown to have cardiovascular benefits beyond the reduction of blood pressure, and the focus has shifted to clarification of these effects. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers are the most widely used antihypertensive drugs in Japan. However, these two classes of drugs have not yet been compared with respect to their efficacy for treating cardiovascular events. Comparison: Response-dependent dose titration and blinded assessment of endpoints in high risk hypertensive patients treated with either an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (candesartan cilexetil) compared to a third-generation calcium channel blocker (amlodipine besilate).</detailed_description>
