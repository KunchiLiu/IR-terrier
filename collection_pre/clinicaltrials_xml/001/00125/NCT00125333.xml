	<brief_title>Topical NF-kappaB Decoy in the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety of repeated application of three concentrations of NF-kappaB Decoy in approximately 75 subjects with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. The face, hands, feet, scalp, or groin may NOT be treated. Other treatment agents are currently available for atopic dermatitis but present significant potential side effects (topical steroids) or are potent immunosuppressives (topical calcineurin inhibitors) with pending longer-term safety data. NF-kappaB Decoy is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligodeoxynucleotide that mimics the NF-kappaB binding sequence on the chromosomal DNA, thereby inhibiting the production of the inflammatory response triggered by NF-kappaB. This mechanism of action presents a unique treatment modality. A comprehensive series of nonclinical data have produced promising results.</detailed_description>
