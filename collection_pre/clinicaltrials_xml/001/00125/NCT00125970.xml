	<brief_title>Safety of and Immune Response to a DNA HIV Vaccine Followed By an Adenoviral Vector HIV Vaccine in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through development of a safe and effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct, readily produced in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an experimental multiclade HIV vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by a similarly structured adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, in HIV uninfected adults. The DNA plasmids in both the vaccines code for proteins from HIV subtypes A, B, and C, which together represent 90% of new HIV infections in the world. Participants in this study will be recruited in North America, South America, and Africa. Each volunteer will participate in the study for 36 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 participants will receive the DNA HIV vaccine at study entry and at Months 1 and 2. At Month 6, Group 1 participants will receive an injection of the adenoviral vector HIV vaccine. Group 2 participants will receive placebo at study entry and Months 1, 2, and 6. There will be 17 study visits, which will occur at study entry and every 2 weeks thereafter until Day 70; at Month 6 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Day 210; and Months 9.5, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. A physical exam, adverse events reporting, HIV and pregnancy prevention counseling, and medication history will occur at each visit. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected visits.</detailed_description>

More information about this criterion can be found in the protocol. Any jobrelated responsibility that would interfere with the study Serious adverse reaction to vaccines. A person who had an adverse reaction to pertussis vaccine as a child is not excluded. Autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency Active syphilis infection Unstable asthma Diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 Thyroid disease requiring treatment Serious angioedema within the past 3 years Uncontrolled hypertension Bleeding disorder Cancer. If a participant has had surgery to remove the cancer and, in the opinion of the investigator, the cancer is not likely to recur during the study period, the participant is not excluded. Seizure disorder Asplenia Mental illness that would interfere with compliance with the protocol Other conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with the study Pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
