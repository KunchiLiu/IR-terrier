	<criteria>1) Patients aged 5160 with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in first or subsequent remission and acute lymphocytic leukemia in first remission with high risk features which include elevated white blood cell count at presentation, cytogenetic abnormalities, extramedullary leukemia, ALL in greater than first remission and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia at any stage who have a histocompatible sibling donor. 2) Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome including patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts or refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. 3) Patients with myeloproliferative disorders which give them poor longterm diseasefree survival, such as myeloid metaplasia or myeloid fibrosis. 4) Patients with secondary myelodysplasia following cytotoxic chemotherapy.
