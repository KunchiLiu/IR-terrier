	<brief_title>Acupuncture and Massage for Depression During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants in this study are randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups that include two types of acupuncture treatment and perinatal massage. The two acupuncture treatments are delivered in a double-blind fashion. Treatments consist of an acute phase during which participants receive 12 treatment sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Responders and partial responders enter a continuation phase during which they receive weekly treatments that end 10 weeks post delivery. At the end of the continuation phase, participants continue to be clinically assessed at 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment to detail the natural course of relapse to the index episode in the three treatment groups.</detailed_description>
