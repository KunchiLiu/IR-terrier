	<brief_summary>Does vaccinating hemodialysis patients with Twinrix® (combination vaccine against hepatitis A and hepatitis B) result in a difference in hepatitis B antibody response in comparison to the monovalent hepatitis B vaccine? Hepatitis B infection is an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Current standard vaccination practices have low efficacy levels in patients (eg. hemodialysis patients) who are most susceptible of infection. Efficacy of the two regiments will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Combined Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Vaccine to Protect Against Hepatitis B in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a human pathogen that causes acute and chronic liver infection. Immunosuppression may be associated with more frequent persistent infection and HBV infections in renal dialysis patients can become chronic. The routes of transmission of the virus is well established; direct percutaneous inoculation of virus via exchange of contaminated blood, blood products, body fluids, and hemodialysis. The Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends immunization in high-risk groups, including hemodialysis patients. Ninety to ninety five percent of healthy, immunocompent adults develop protective anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) with a primary series of hepatitis B vaccination, but the overall efficacy in renal dialysis patients is much lower. The proportion of hemodialysis patients who develop a seroprotective antibody even with higher doses of vaccination is a median 64% (range: 34-88%). Reports suggest that combined vaccination of hepatitis B and hepatitis A (Twinrix®: combination vaccine containing inactivated hepatitis A and recombinant hepatitis B) may improve immunogenicity in healthy individuals. In one study, comparing Anti-HBs geometric mean titres (GMT) at month 6 of the series, subjects receiving the combined vaccine showed a statistically significant higher response than those who obtained the monovalent vaccines. Other studies also reflect the same trend at varying points in the vaccination series. Currently, there are 426 patients in the hemodialysis program at St. Joseph’s Healthcare in Hamilton and 324(76%) patients are susceptible to HBV infection. Our study will determine if the improved immunogenicity observed with combined HAV and HBV vaccine will increase the efficacy of HBV vaccine in hemodialysis patients.</detailed_description>
