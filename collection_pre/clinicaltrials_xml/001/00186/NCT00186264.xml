	<brief_title>Does Concurrent Hydrocortisone With Venlafaxine XR Speed Antidepressant Response?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be treated with Venlafaxine XR for 6 weeks. The dose of Venlafaxine XR will begin at 37.5 mg/day and be gradually increased to a maximum of 225 mg/day. The dose may be kept as low as 75 mg/day if necessary. Study doctor will be assessing mood to determine if some patients respond more quickly than the several weeks often required for an antidepressant to begin working. On the first day of treatment with Venlafaxine XR, participant will be randomly assigned (similar to a flip of a coin) to receive hydrocortisone 15 mg /day or placebo for two days. Placebo is an inactive substance, like a sugar pill. This dose of hydrocortisone is less than a typical replacement dose for patients who are not producing cortisol (hydrocortisone) naturally. The hydrocortisone is administered intravenously (in a vein) over the course of 2 hours for two consecutive days. Neither participant nor study doctor will know which treatment participant is receiving. However, this information is available to study doctor if it is needed.</detailed_description>
