	<brief_summary>This protocol studied the effect of administration of a myeloablative pretransplant preparative regimen followed by an infusion of donor stem cells in children with severe sickle cell disease. The donor graft consisted of bone marrow or cord blood derived from a genetically matched sibling. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate how well the donated cells migrated to the bone marrow and begin producing healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (engrafted), how well the recipients immune system recovered, and assess any regimen related toxicities including a potentially life-threatening transplant related complication called graft-versus-host-disease or GVHD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this protocol evaluated the effect of this transplant procedure on the subsequent clinical course of patients with severe SCD. Specifically, to determine whether pre-transplant organ dysfunction (brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, spleen, etc) resultant from sickle hemoglobinopathy can be reversed following this particular transplant procedure.</detailed_description>
