	<brief_summary>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is studying ways to make ultrasound images clearer - to be able to see blood vessels, body structures, and tumors better. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures, allowing doctors and other medical professionals to "see" inside the body. Researchers are studying a contrast agent (like a dye) called Optisonâ„¢. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital researchers want to learn the best and safest dose of this ultrasound "dye."</brief_summary>
