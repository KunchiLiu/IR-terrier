	<brief_summary>To investigate a new incidence and preventive effect of menatetrenone on vertebral fracture in patients with osteoporosis who were randomly assigned to either treatment arm receiving daily dose of calcium supplement as a monotherapy (calcium monotherapy group) or menatetrenone plus calcium supplement as a combination therapy (menatetrenone combo therapy group) for 36 months, followed by a 12-month follow-up observation to examine the preventive effect on the fracture risk.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inpatient or outpatient is not asked. If using any antiosteoporotic agent other than calcium preparations (i.e., contraindicated for concomitant use stipulated in the protocol of this postmarketing study), such agent must be discontinued. Even after the discontinuation, calcium dosing is permitted with a condition that the subsequent use is started after a 8week elapse from the discontinuation. Patients with primary osteoporosis (diagnosed according to "Diagnostic Criteria for Primary Osteoporosis issued by the Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Research (1995)." Postmenopausal patients aged 50 years or older. Patients who agree to participate in a 4year followup observation. Patients who provide written informed consent. Exclusion Criteira: Patients on warfarin potassium (WarfarinÂ®) therapy. Patients with hypercalcemia. Patietns with renal calculus. Patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to calcium or menatetrenone preparations. Patients with severe complication in the hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, cardio and cerebrovascular system. Patients who underwent bilateral ovariectomy. Patients with radiotherapy in the pelvis or paraaortic area. Patients with the following Xray findings; 1. Patients showing osteophytes connecting with adjacent vertebral osteophytes 2. Patients showing hyperostosis of ligament around the vertebral body 3. Patients showing interbody fusion 4. Patients who experienced surgical intervention(s) in the spine 5. Patients with scoliosis which disturbs a diagnosing of vertebral fracture Patients who have been treated with antiosteoporotic agents, other than calcium preparation, within 8 months prior to the study treatment (but not applied to the following; if discontinued, nontreated, or shifted to calcium monotherapy for 8 weeks or longer before starting the study treatment). Patients who experienced bisphosphonates in the past. Patients who are likely to show insufficient absorption of liposoluble agents such as biliary atresia, impaired bile secretion, etc. Other patients who are judged to be ineligible for study entry by the investigator or investigator.</criteria>
