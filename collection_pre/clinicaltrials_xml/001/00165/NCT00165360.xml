	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine the effects (good and bad) temozolomide has on patients with low-grade glioma. It will also determine whether temozolomide is effective in preventing or delaying future tumor growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolonged Daily Temozolomide for Low-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Treatment with temozolomide is based upon an 11-week cycle (7 weeks on the drug and 4 weeks off). Patients will receive temozolomide once daily for 49 days, then have 28 days without taking temozolomide. - Every two to four weeks a physical and neurological examination and blood work will be performed. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the patient's brain will be done approximately every three months (before each cycle of treatment). - Treatment may continue for a maximum of a year and a half based on 6 eleven-week cycles. The actual duration of therapy will depend upon the response to treatment and the development of side effects or toxicity.</detailed_description>
