	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not cancer cells in the body are affected by PTK and whether it affects the growth of these cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protein Tyrosine Kinases (PTK) in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will take PTK orally once a day for the duration of their time on the study. Each cycle of chemotherapy will last for 4 weeks. Measurement of vital signs will be done weekly during the first month of treatment. Physical exam, vital signs, blood work, a quality of life assessment, and x-ray or MRI wil be performed every 4 weeks. Patients will remain on the study until their disease fails to respond to treatment or there are intolerable side effects. Typically treatment is performed for 12 weeks and up to one year in patients that are stable and responding.</detailed_description>
