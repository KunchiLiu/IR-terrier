	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational stent CoStar™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent- a reservoir based DES system in comparison to a surface coated DES stent (TAXUS™ Express2™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent) in the treatment of single-vessel (one blood vessel) and multi-vessel (two or three blood vessels) coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non -inferiority in 8-month Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) and in-segment late lumen loss at 9 months between the CoStar™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System and the TAXUS™ Express2™ Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of a single de novo lesion per vessel in patients with single and multi-vessel coronary disease.</detailed_description>
