	<detailed_description>Cancer of the oesophagus is notorious for its grave prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of 10-20%. Surgical resection with curative intent remains the most effective treatment for this disease. To improve the survival, a better treatment approach is in need to manage patients with oesophageal cancer. Unfortunately, the use of preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant radiotherapy does not confer any survival benefit to patients with localized oesophageal cancer as proven in most randomized studies. However, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has greater clinical efficacy in achieving complete pathological regression of the tumour as well as the response rate as shown in our preliminary results. In fact, treatment of squamous oesophageal cancer by primary chemo-irradiation without surgery is now feasible. We propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and the patients’ survival by comparing primary chemo-irradiation without surgery versus standard surgical resection as the treatment for squamous oesophageal cancer. Those patients with residual cancer after primary chemo-irradiation will have salvage oesophagectomy to control the disease. Over a 3-year period, a total of 80 patients will be recruited from 4 different hospitals with 100 patients being randomized into each treatment arm. Treatment outcomes will be compared on an intention-to-treat analysis basis.</detailed_description>
