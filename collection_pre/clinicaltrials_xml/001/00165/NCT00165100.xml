	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether this new method of taking pictures called Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT) might be a good way of looking at patients with cancer that is relatively close to the surface of the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT) as an Imaging Modality in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The DAT system resembles a video camera which picks up changes in body temperature which may reflect disease-related changes in blood flow to some areas, particularly those involved with tumors. - Patients with known tumor sites amendable to DAT evaluation will be imaged at the time of staging and at later time points. Thermal profiles will be compared to those of normal adjacent tissues and correlated with the images of the tumors on conventional images.</detailed_description>
