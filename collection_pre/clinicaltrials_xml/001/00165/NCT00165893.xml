	<brief_title>Comparison of IDD Therapy and Non-surgical Treatment for Low Back Pain Caused by Degenerative Disc Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized trial where out of every 3 people, 2 will receive IDD therapy and 1 will have standardized physical therapy. Patients are given surveys to complete that ask about how their back pain is affecting their quality of life before starting treatment, 6 weeks after starting treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months after starting treatment. If at the 6 week point, the patient and doctor do not think the current treatment is working well enough, the patient is given the option to try the other treatment.</detailed_description>
