	<criteria>Part 1 Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumour refractory to standard therapy or for whom no established therapy exists Age &gt;= 18 years Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70% Life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months Absolute neutrophil count of &gt;= 1.5 × 109/l, platelet count of ³ 100 × 109/l, haemoglobin level of ³ 10 g/dl (&gt;= 6.2 mmol/l) (prior transfusion is permitted) Normal hepatic and renal function as defined by serum bilirubin £ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, ALT and AST £ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (£ 5 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of hepatic metastases), creatinine clearance ³ 50 ml/min (by CockroftGault formula) Male and female patients Written informed consent to participate in the study Part 1 More than two previous courses of documented myelosuppresive chemotherapy (epidermal growth factor targeted therapy does not constitute a course of chemotherapy) CNS metastases (a CT or MRI scan should be done if there is a clinical suspicion of CNS metastases) Major surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy (except palliative) within 4 weeks of treatment start Previous investigational cytotoxic treatment for malignant disease within 30 days before the start of the study Any treatment with nononcological investigational drugs within 30 days before the start of the study Pregnancy or breast feeding (all women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test before inclusion in the study; postmenopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months). Female patients must use adequate contraceptive protection. Fertile males not willing to use contraception or whose female partners are not using adequate contraceptive protection Uncontrolled infections Clinically significant cardiac impairment or unstable ischaemic heart disease including a myocardial infarction within three months of study entry History of alcoholism, drug addiction, or any psychiatric or psychological condition which in the opinion of the investigator would impair study compliance History of hypersensitivity to sulphonamides Prior severe or unexpected reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy (which may be explained by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency or hypersensitivity to 5FU) Malabsorption syndrome or other condition which may affect absorption of drug Concurrent or previous malignancy of a different tumour type within five years of starting the study except for adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Treatment within two weeks before the start of the study with any of the following: coumarin anticoagulants, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, theophylline, diazepam, sulphonylurea hypoglycaemics, phenytoin, or carbamazepine Legal incapacity Part 2 Ambulant patients with progressive metastatic CRC who have received prior treatment with 5 FU and irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin either as single agents or in combination. Either 5 FU and/or irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin may have been administered in the adjuvant setting or for the treatment of metastatic disease. Patients who have received both 5FU and irinotecan or oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting only must have experienced disease recurrence within one year of starting chemotherapy. At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria Age ³ 18 years Karnofsky performance status of ³ 70% Life expectancy of ³ 3 months Absolute neutrophil count of ³ 1.5 × 109/l, platelet count of ³ 100 × 109/l, haemoglobin level of ³ 10 g/dl (³ 6.2 mmol/l) (prior transfusion is permitted) Normal hepatic and renal function as defined by serum bilirubin £ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, ALT and AST £ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (£ 5 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of hepatic metastases), creatinine clearance ³ 50 ml/min (by CockroftGault formula) Male and female patients Written informed consent to participate in the study Part 2 Prior chemotherapy other than 5FU, irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin CNS metastases (a CT or MRI scan should be done if there is a clinical suspicion of CNS metastases) Major surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy (except palliative) within 4 weeks of treatment start Previous investigational cytotoxic treatment for malignant disease within 30 days before the start of the study Any treatment with nononcological investigational drugs within 30 days before the start of the study Pregnancy or breast feeding (all women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before inclusion in the study; postmenopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months). Female patients must use adequate contraceptive protection. Fertile males not willing to use contraception or whose female partners are not using adequate contraceptive protection Uncontrolled infections Clinically significant cardiac impairment or unstable ischaemic heart disease including a myocardial infarction within three months of study start History of alcoholism, drug addiction, or any psychiatric or psychological condition which in the opinion of the investigator would impair study compliance History of hypersensitivity to sulphonamides Prior severe or unexpected reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy (which may be explained by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency or hypersensitivity to 5FU) Malabsorption syndrome or other condition which may affect absorption of drug Concurrent or previous malignancy of a different tumour type within five years of starting the study except for adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Treatment within two weeks before the start of the study with any of the following: coumarin anticoagulants, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, theophylline, diazepam, sulphonylurea hypoglycaemics, phenytoin, or carbamazepine Legal incapacity</criteria>
