	<brief_title>Wide Excision Alone as Treatment for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ of The Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients with DCIS are usually treated with the combination of breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy or breast-conserving surgery alone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether localized low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, diagnosed with modern mammography and careful pathologic evaluation, could be treated with wide excision alone (omission of radiation therapy) and result in acceptably low local recurrence rates. - Follow-up consists of physical examinations at least every 6 months by the surgeon or radiation oncologist. Mammograms of the affected breast will be obtained every 6 months for 5 years and then annually. Mammograms of the unaffected breast will be performed annually.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have high quality mammogram including magnification views of the area containing suspicious calcifications. A specimen radiograph is required. If the specimen radiograph does not assure removal of all suspicious microcalcifications, a postoperative mammogram showing removal of all suspicious calcifications is required. The clinical extent of DCIS must be less than or equal to 2.5 cm. Grade 1 or 2 DCIS; patients with lobular carcinomainsitu (LCIS) in addition to DCIS in the breast are eligible. Negative margins are not required on the LCIS. Patients must undergo a wide excision. A reexcision after the initial biopsy might be needed. Complete resection of the area of DCIS with a histologic margin of at least 1 cm must be achieved. Patients must be enrolled on this protocol within 3 months of the last surgical procedure. Patients with invasive carcinoma including microinvasive disease Carcinoma found in the sampled lymph nodes if axillary dissection is done Patients with nipple discharge Patients with adjuvant chemotherapy or Tamoxifen Patients with a history of prior malignancies other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with a history of ipsilateral or contralateral breast carcinoma or DCIS or simultaneous bilateral DCIS.</criteria>
