	<brief_summary>Phase I study: To investigate primary objective (maximal tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity) and secondary objectives (pharmacokinetics, safety, estimation of a recommended dose, and anti-tumor effect by evaluable case) of E7070 in patients with gastric cancer who are extensive or intermediate metabolizer type (EM/IM) to CYP2C9 and CYP2C9 by intravenously administering once every 3 weeks. Phase IIa study: To investigate primary objective (response rate for efficacy assessment) and secondary objectives (frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions, and pharmacokinetics) of E7070 in patient with gastric cancer who are EM/IM type by intravenously administering once every 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
