	<brief_summary>Women undergoing surgical menopause often experience marked menopausal side effects but are reluctant to use estrogen or other female hormones to ease the transition to menopause because of worries that the hormones may increase breast cancer risks. This study will evaluate tibolone in women experiencing surgical menopause to assess its effects on bone health, menopause symptoms and breast density.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Tibilone on Bone Density, Menopause Symptoms and Breast Density in Women After Prophylactic Oophorectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women interested in participating in this study will be allowed to use hormones to manage symptoms for up to 3 months before beginning the study. Those choosing not to take hormones may enroll in the study immediately. All women will have a baseline mammogram, breast examination, and bone study density performed, along with blood and urine analysis for measurement of bone markers. They will also be asked to take a questionnaire. Patients will take either tibolone or placebo once daily for 1 year. Neither the patient or the physician will be aware of which treatment a woman is taking during the study. Patients will return at 6 and 12 months to have a physical examination, blood work, urine collection and bone studies. At one year, a repeat mammogram will be performed. There are also some questionnaires asking about menopause symptoms that will be performed at intervals during the study. It is also recommended that patients take calcium and vitamin D throughout the study.</detailed_description>
