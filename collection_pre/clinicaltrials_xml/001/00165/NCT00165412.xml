	<brief_title>Breast MRI Screening in Women Treated With Mediastinal Irradiation for Hodgkin's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The screening breast MRI and mammography will be performed 6 months or longer after the last mammogram. For pre-menopausal women, the screening will be performed during the second week of the menstrual cycle to reduce cycle-related breast changes. As much as possible, the breast MRI and mammogram are to be performed on the same day. - On the day of the breast imaging studies, the patient will also be asked to fill out a baseline breast health questionnaire, which includes questions on time since radiation therapy, prior screening history, history of prior benign breast biopsies, menopausal status, prior hormonal therapy use, etc. - In patients with suspicious findings or findings highly suggestive of malignancy, the abnormal findings will be reviewed with the patient and recommendations will be made for a biopsy.</detailed_description>
