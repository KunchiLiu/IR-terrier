	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether additional surfactant(Infasurf) doses at 7 to 10 days of life time will improve lung function in premature infants, allowing a decrease in required oxygen concentration and ventilator settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial of Surfactant Therapy For Preterm Neonates 5-21 Days Old With Respiratory Decompensation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary surfactant is required for normal lung function. Preliminary data from previous trials suggest that more than half of chronically ventilated premature infants, greater than 1 week of age, have at least one episode of surfactant dysfunction, as measured in vitro, associated with a low surfactant protein B content. We propose to enroll premature infants less than 1250 gm birthweight, between days 5 and 21 of life who are intubated, mechanically ventilated, with a respiratory decompensation, defined as a severity score (mean airway pressure x FIO2) rising from a baseline of &lt; 1.8 to &gt; 3.5, sustained for &gt; 24 hours. Infants will receive two doses of Infasurf surfactant, 12-24 hours apart, at the standard dose of 3 ml/kg. Primary outcome is the change in respiratory severity score at 72 hours post surfactant treatment compared to pre-treatment. Sample size is 31 infants, study duration is 3 years, and recruitment of study patients will occur at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo.</detailed_description>
