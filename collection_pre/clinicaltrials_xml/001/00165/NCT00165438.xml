	<brief_title>Pulmonary Function in Patients With Hodgkin's Disease Receiving Bleomycin-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The tests and procedures in this study are part of regular cancer care but this study offers more structured timing of these standard tests. - Due to the potential lung toxicity associated with bleomycin-based chemotherapy, pulmonary function tests are routinely performed. Pulmonary function tests will be performed by a licensed, registered respiratory therapist and performed prior to the beginning of treatment, between the chemotherapy and radiation therapy (only for patients receiving both chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and at approximately 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the completion of all treatments. - A CAT scan will be performed prior to the beginning of treatment, and approximately 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the completion of all treatments. - A self-administered questionnaire will be performed on the days the patient is undergoing pulmonary function tests.</detailed_description>
