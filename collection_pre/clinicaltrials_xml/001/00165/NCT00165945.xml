	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators wish to use images obtained from standard of care cardiac MRI's performed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and transfer the images to a different computer in order to analyze them with a new computer. The investigators are hoping to better their understanding and management of complex congenital heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>4-D Visualization Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the Congenital Heart Disease Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients enrolled in this study will be receiving standard of care cardiac MRI as prescribed by their physician. These MRI DICOM images will be transferred to a SGI Fuel workstation, where they will be manipulated using the newly developed 4-D Visualization software. No additional scanner time or new imaging sequences are required as presently prescribed sequences and produced data can be analyzed. The workstation is designed to include acceleration hardware for volume rendering, and was developed for advanced cardiac MRI viewing.</detailed_description>
