	<brief_title>Understanding Treatment Adherence Among Individuals With Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar Disorder (BPD), also known as manic-depressive illness, is a disorder that causes frequent shifts in an individual's mood, energy, and ability to function. An individual with BPD may go through periods of mania, which are characterized by increased energy, irritability, and an excessively "high" euphoric mood. The manic periods are followed by periods of depression, which are characterized by decreased energy, feelings of hopelessness, and anxiety. Rapid cycling bipolar disorder (RCBPD) is a type of BPD in which the individual experiences four or more episodes of mania and depression per year. The rapid shift between the manic and depressive episodes makes it imperative that individuals with RCBPD strictly manage their illness with medication. Many BPD medications have been developed recently; however, there are still many individuals who do not respond well to medication treatment. Research has shown that the way individuals experience illness has an effect on their response to medication. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how individuals with RCBPD perceive and respond to medication treatment. Factors such as gender, degree of social support, drug and alcohol usage, and attitudes towards medication will be evaluated to understand how they affect medication and treatment adherence. This study will consist of 1 visit, which will last approximately 2 and Â½ hours and will include an anthropological interview and numerous standardized psychological questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires will assess participants' attitudes toward BPD treatment; psychiatric illness severity, including symptoms of mania and depression; expectations regarding recovery, stigma, and quality of life; and medication adherence.</detailed_description>
