	<detailed_description>This pilot study aims to test the feasibility of electronic mail recruitment and web screening for alcohol problems, to compare different approaches to encouraging screening, and to estimate the effects of minimal and more extensive feedback in preparation for a future alcohol web-based brief intervention study. To do so, 4300 freshman adult college students will be randomized to receive an electronic mail request to complete a web alcohol screening test using an alcohol-specific or a general wellness approach. The primary outcome is the proportion of respondents who complete alcohol screening. Additional outcomes include readiness to change drinking, help-seeking, alcohol consumption and consequences. The results of this pilot study will provide information useful to 1) colleges deciding how best to implement universal screening for hazardous alcohol use, and 2) in the preparation of a larger study of web-based screening and brief intervention for hazardous drinking in college students.</detailed_description>
