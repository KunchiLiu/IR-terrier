	<brief_summary>This is a study for patients with advanced testicular cancer. This research study involves treatment with oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine, which is an investigational chemotherapy combination. This study is for patients who have not responded to standard cisplatin-containing chemotherapy or the cancer has returned after such treatment. This research is being done to assess the effectiveness of the proposed combination of medications for this type of cancer.</brief_summary>
