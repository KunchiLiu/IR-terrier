	<brief_summary>The subjects in this trial have been diagnosed as having a pre-cancerous disease of the breast called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This condition is associated with the development of breast cancer in up to 50% of cases. The subjects are being asked to participate in this research study. They are being offered voluntary admission to this study to test the effects of a new investigational drug called Fulvestrant (Faslodex). This drug is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer but has not been approved for the treatment of DCIS. However, the FDA has given permission for the drug to be tested in this study. The purpose of this study is to find out if Fulvestrant has any effect on the subject's precancerous changes by comparing samples taken before and after receiving Fulvestrant.</brief_summary>

Women will be considered to be in menopause if they fall into one of the following groups: Age &gt; 60 Age &gt; 45 with amenorrhea &gt; 1 year with intact uterus Status post bilateral oophorectomies FSH/estradiol levels in postmenopausal range for the institution DCIS must have been diagnosed with a minimally invasive biopsy technique, such as a vacuumassisted large core tool (Mammotome) or an equivalent method. There must be available tissue from the diagnostic biopsy to perform molecular markers. Baseline mammogram within 8 weeks of study entry. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl. Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 upper limit of normal (ULN), transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase may be up to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), AGC greater than or equal to 1500, platelets greater than or equal to 100,000, Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dl Peripheral neuropathy grade 01.
