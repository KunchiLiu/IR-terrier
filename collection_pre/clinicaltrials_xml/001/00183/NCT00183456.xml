	<brief_title>A Peer-Oriented HIV Prevention Outreach Program for Individuals at High Risk for HIV and Other STIs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The persistence of HIV and STD epidemics indicates that more effective, sustainable preventive interventions are needed, particularly for low-income, inner-city populations. This study will determine the effectiveness of a theoretically based peer outreach program in preventing HIV and STD transmission among adults in the Baltimore, Maryland area. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a network-oriented peer program emphasizing one's social identity and the goals of protecting one's family and community or group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The peer program will also train participants to provide HIV/STD education to their peers. Participants will be assessed at study entry and during several subsequent follow-up visits. At these study visits, participants will complete questionnaires about their sexual health knowledge and sexual behaviors. Participants and members of their peer network will have follow-up visits at Months 6, 12, and 18.</detailed_description>
