	<brief_summary>This study is for patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has failed to shrink or has returned after previous treatment with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to find out whether patients with these types of cancer will have their tumor shrunk after treatment with a drug called Noscapine. The second purpose is to see what are the side effects of this drug. This drug is being used as an over-the-counter cough suppressor in Europe and Japan, but has also shown to be effective against cancer.</brief_summary>
