	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Long-Term Versus Short-Term Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder With Venlafaxine XR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent, chronic psychiatric disorder. Despite the fact that GAD frequently demands prolonged treatment with medication, very little is known about the benefits of long-term treatment. GAD is characterized by 6 months or more of exaggerated worry and tension that is unfounded or much more severe than the normal anxiety most people experience. People with GAD are unable to relax and often suffer from insomnia. Venlafaxine XR, a drug used to treat depression, has been shown to be effective in the short-term treatment of GAD. However, its benefits over a course of more than 8 weeks have not been assessed. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of venlafaxine XR in treating GAD on a long-term basis and preventing the relapse of GAD after 6 months of treatment versus 12 months of treatment. Participants in this double-blind study will first receive 6 months of open-label treatment with venlafaxine XR. Upon completion of this initial phase, participants will be randomly assigned to either continue on venlafaxine XR or begin taking placebo. After 12 months, participants taking venlafaxine XR will be randomly assigned to continue on the drug or switch to placebo. Participants will have 22 study visits over at least 18 months. Follow-up visits will occur 24 months after enrollment. Relapse of GAD will be assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Global Severity and Improvement Scale. A variety of methods, including questionnaires and standardized scales, will be used to assess secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>
