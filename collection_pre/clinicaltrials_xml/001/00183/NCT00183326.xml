	<brief_title>Treating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Children Exposed to Domestic Violence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 10 million children in the United States are exposed to DV directed at their mothers by intimate partners. DV exposure puts these children at an increased risk for developing behavioral problems, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. While studies targeting PTSD in DV-exposed children are limited, data indicates that TF-CBT is effective in improving PTSD as well as depression, anxiety, and behavioral symptoms. This study will determine the effectiveness of TF-CBT in reducing PTSD and other DV-related psychological symptoms in children from a community DV agency in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This study will last 8 weeks. Children and their mothers will be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of either TF-CBT or CCT. In TF-CBT, patients recall the events of their trauma and try to deal with the emotions that arise. Supportive treatment empowers children to deal with their emotions in general. Both the children and their mothers will complete questionnaires at study entry and at Week 8. Children will also complete self-report scales at study entry and at Week 8. The questionnaires and self-report scales will be used to assess symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. Children and their mothers will be contacted 6 and 12 months after study completion for follow-up interviews.</detailed_description>
