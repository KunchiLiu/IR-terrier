	<brief_title>The Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model for Treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Rates of PTSD are extremely high among people with severe mental disorders and such individuals find themselves at increased risk for depression, substance abuse, and poor overall health. In turn, these issues lead to high rates of utilization of mental health services. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of effective trauma treatments that can be implemented in routine mental health settings. Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM) is a group-based intervention that addresses PTSD and other closely related consequences of sexual and physical abuse among women with severe mental disorders. This study will determine the effectiveness of TREM in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms in women with mental disorders who have experienced sexual or physical abuse. Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either usual care alone or usual care combined with TREM for 18 months. Usual care will include medication, case management, and therapy administered by a primary clinician. Participants assigned to usual care will report to the study site at least once a week, or as often as necessary. Participants assigned to usual care plus TREM will also be assigned to a primary clinician and will receive usual care as often as necessary. In addition, TREM participants will take part in 29 group sessions that will focus on increasing self-esteem and trauma-coping skills and reducing self-blame. PTSD symptom severity, trauma beliefs, depressive symptoms, substance use, and mental health service utilization will be measured at Months 6, 12, and 18 for all participants.</detailed_description>
