	<brief_title>Long Term Follow-Up of HIV Infected Patients Who Have Previously Participated in HIV Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1982, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has been conducting numerous clinical trials on patients infected with HIV-1. Unfortunately, once clinical studies have closed or participants have reached a study endpoint, no additional follow-up data are collected regarding progression of HIV infection and development of HIV-related complications in these study participants. This study will collect long-term data for participants of previous NIAID-sponsored clinical trials to study HIV-related disease processes and complications, benefits and toxicities of investigational medications and vaccines, and medical management of participants with known or suspected HIV infection. Study visits will occur every 6 months. A physical exam, blood collection, and medical history will occur at all visits. Depending on the need of participants, additional laboratory and diagnostic tests will be performed, and standard medical care will be provided.</detailed_description>
