	<brief_title>Prolonged Exposure Therapy Versus Active Psychotherapy in Treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PTSD is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to an event in harm to the life or physical integrity of oneself or others has occurred or was threatened. People with PTSD have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal and often feel emotionally numb, especially with people to whom they were once close. Effective treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder are available, and research is yielding new, improved therapies that can help reduce symptoms of PTSD. Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is a brief cognitive behavioral therapy that has been effective in treating symptoms of PTSD in adults. However, no treatments have been proven effective for the treatment of PTSD in adolescents. This study will compare the effectiveness of PE therapy versus non-trauma directed active psychotherapy in reducing the symptoms of PTSD in adolescents. In addition, this study aims to refine the existing PE treatment protocol for adolescents with PTSD. Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either PE therapy or AP. All participants will receive 12 to 18 therapy sessions, which will be conducted weekly. Assessments of PTSD symptoms, depression, and overall functioning will be conducted at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
