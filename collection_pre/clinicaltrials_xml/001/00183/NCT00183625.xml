	<brief_title>Supported Employment and Skills Training in Conjunction With Pharmacotherapy in Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by disorganized thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and hallucinations. Individuals with schizophrenia often experience reduced emotional, social, and occupational functioning. Data indicate that antipsychotic drug treatment and occupational training and support may be effective in helping people with schizophrenia maintain a stable job. Risperidone and olanzapine are antipsychotic drugs; participants in this study will be taking either risperidone or olanzapine for the duration of the study. This study will provide schizophrenia patients with employment support alone or with behavioral skills training to determine which combination is more effective in helping patients obtain and maintain a job. At study entry, participants will undergo a clinical and diagnostic evaluation to determine the severity of their schizophrenia. Participants will be tapered off their regular medication for schizophrenia over 4 weeks. At the end of Week 4, they will be randomly assigned to receive either risperidone or olanzapine. Participants will then be assigned an Individual Placement and Support (IPS) specialist to assist them in finding a job. After participants secure a job, they will be randomly assigned to receive IPS either alone or with the Workplace Fundamentals Skills Training Module for 2 years. Participants' risperidone or olanzapine treatment will continue during this 2-year period. Participants will have clinic visits at study entry and Months 7, 12, and 24. At each visit, participants will complete questionnaires and will be interviewed about their schizophrenia symptoms and occupational functioning.</detailed_description>
