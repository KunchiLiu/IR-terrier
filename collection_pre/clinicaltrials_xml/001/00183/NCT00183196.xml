	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether, after a period of abstinence, adding 6 weeks of gabapentin (a medication approved to treat seizures) to a standard 16-week naltrexone (an opiate blocking agent approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence) treatment protocol is helpful in decreasing relapse to drinking compared to naltrexone alone or placebo. All participants will receive alcohol counseling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Gabapentin When Used With Naltrexone to Treat Alcohol Dependence Compared to Placebo and Naltrexone Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will enter the trial after maintaining 4 days of abstinence. During this period multiple assessments will be collected. After entering the double blind treatment portion of the study, they will be evaluated weekly for the first month, then bi-weekly until week 12 and again at week 16. There will be two follow-up visits at weeks 28 and 40. Urinary riboflavin and pill counts will be utilized to determine compliance with the medication regime. Comparison(s): Naltrexone (50 mg/day) alone for 16-weeks; naltrexone (50 mg/day) for 16-weeks plus gabapentin (up to 1200 mg/day in divided doses) for the first 6 weeks, or inactive placebos. All subjects will receive up to 20 sessions of individual alcohol counseling.</detailed_description>
