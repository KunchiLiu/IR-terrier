	<detailed_description>Many studies have shown that a brief motivational interview in the context of a routine or emergency health care visit may assist adults to reduce high-risk drinking and drug-taking. Center researchers are conducting a 1,400-person, randomized clinical trial involving teen patients at the Boston Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department in order to determine if a similar approach will be effective with youth. All patients aged 14 to 21 get a brief alcohol and drug screen, and those whose scores indicate they drink or use marijuana are invited to participate in the study. One-third of the enrollees will receive an assessment, a brief motivational interview performed by a trained peer counselor, direct referrals to community-based resources for adolescents, and a 10-day follow-up phone call. One-third will receive only the assessment and a list of community resources; and the final third will receive only the list of resources. All participants will be followed over time and re-screened to measure the impact of the initial brief intervention on their drinking and drug-taking. The key hypothesis is that individuals who receive the brief motivational interview in the emergency department setting will have lower rates of alcohol and illicit drug use and fewer health consequences over time.</detailed_description>
