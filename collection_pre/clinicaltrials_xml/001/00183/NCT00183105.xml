	<brief_title>ASAP Study - Hospital-Based Brief Intervention for Alcohol Problems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use in a diverse group of hospitalized medical patients was tested. We conducted a randomized trial of medical inpatients with the whole spectrum of alcohol problems from risky use through dependence. Subjects in one group received standard care; subjects in the second group received a brief motivational intervention tailored to the severity of his or her alcohol problem. Primary outcomes are alcohol consumption and linkage to alcohol treatment. Additional outcomes include health-related quality of life, health care utilization, alcohol problems, and readiness to change. Costs, and clinical outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life years, a standard metric that allows comparison to other chronic illnesses, will be compared in a cost-effectiveness analysis.</detailed_description>
