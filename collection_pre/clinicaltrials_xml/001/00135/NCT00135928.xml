	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) bone marrow stimulation on circulating stem cells' ability to develop new blood vessels in the myocardium after an acute myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intracoronary infusion of bone-marrow stem cells after a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) seems to improve cardiac function. An alternative strategy is increase of circulating stem cells by mobilisation from the bone marrow with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF). Objective: To determine the short-term (30 days) safety of G-CSF therapy after a STEMI treated with acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: Patients with STEMI treated with PCI &lt;12 hours after symptom onset were randomised (1:1) to G-CSF (10 Î¼g/kg/d) or placebo for 6 days in a double-blind design. Other inclusion criteria: age 20-70 years, culprit lesion in a large coronary artery, and peak CKMB &gt;100 microgram/L. Follow-up was done after 1, 5 and 6 months, with an angiogram at 5 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients between 20 and 70 years with STEMI were eligible if they had a successful PCI within 12 hours after onset of symptoms. The target lesion had to be located in the proximal section of the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX) or right coronary artery (RCA). Only patients with creatine kinase [CK]MB &gt;100 microgram/L or development of Q waves in the electrocardiogram were included.
