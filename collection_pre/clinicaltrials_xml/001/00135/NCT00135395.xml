	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the anti-HIV efficacy, safety and effect of serum lipids of two boosted protease inhibitor-based HAART regimens (ARV/RTV v. LPV/RTV) in HIV-1 infected subjects who have experienced their first virologic failure while receiving a NNRTI-containing HAART regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 years of age infected with HIV Plasma HIV RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL and CD4 cell count ≥ 50 cells/mm3 Currently receiving a NNRTIcontaining HAART regimen or not currently receiving a NNRTIcontaining HAART regimen and have not been treated with an alternative regimen since the documented virologic failure (with genotype performed within 2 weeks of the discontinuation of the failing regimen and the genotype report is available) The failing NNRTIcontaining regimen must be the patient's first virologic failure on treatment and contain a NNRTI and at least 2 NRTIs. The regimen must have been administered for at least 24 weeks and the patient must have documented virologic response to the regimen (HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL) Pregnancy or breastfeeding Reported virologic failure to two or more antiretroviral regimens Active AIDSdefined opportunistic infection or disease Proven or suspected acute hepatitis within 30 days prior to study entry</criteria>
