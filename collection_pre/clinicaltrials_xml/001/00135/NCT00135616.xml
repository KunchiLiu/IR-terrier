	<brief_title>Treatment of Female Stress Urinary Incontinence: Study Comparing Two Suburethral Slings, Retropubic Approach (TVT) and Trans-Obturator (TVT-O) Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary stress incontinence (USI) is a frequent pathology in women. Surgical treatment is required in 30 to 50% of women presenting with USI. Several surgical techniques are currently available. At the present time, the placement of suburethral slings is one of the most efficient techniques. Furthermore, the placement of a suburethral sling is known to be associated with a low rate of complications. Currently, two approaches are available for the placement of a suburethral sling: retropubic approach (TVT) and trans-obturator approach (TVT-O). The efficacy of these two approaches seem equivalents. However, the morbidity related to these two techniques is probably different. In retrospective studies, the retropubic approach is associated with a higher rate of bladder perforation. On the other hand, the trans-obturator approach is supposed to be associated with a higher rate of post-operative pain. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare efficacy and morbidity following the placement of two types of suburethral slings in women presenting with stress urinary incontinence: TVT and TVT-O.</detailed_description>
