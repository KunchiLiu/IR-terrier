	<detailed_description>This study was a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded (placebo run-in will be single-blinded), group comparison study. Paroxetine 20mg/day (achieved via the starting dose of 10 mg/day for the first week) once daily, or placebo was orally administered once daily for 8 weeks (fixed dose was adopted in the Treatment phase) in patients with GAD. For subjects who were classed as non-responders at Week 8, paroxetine at 30 to 40mg/day (once daily) or placebo (once daily) was orally administered with flexible titration regimen for 4 weeks (fixed dose was adopted in the Treatment phase). The subjects underwent a taper phase in case they received Paroxetine 40mg/day, paroxetine 30mg/day or placebo at treatment completion or study withdrawal. A follow-up examination was conducted after 1 to 5 weeks from the last dose of the investigational product. The overall study duration requiring subject participation was 10 to 20 weeks.</detailed_description>
