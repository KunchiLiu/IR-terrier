	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to study fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)-based dose escalation using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Incorporating 18F-FDG-PET Imaging in Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose escalation, based on the FDG-PET signal, is incorporated in the first ten fractions of the radiotherapeutic treatment. The total amount of fractions is 32, equal to a standard radiotherapeutic treatment for these types of cancers.</detailed_description>
