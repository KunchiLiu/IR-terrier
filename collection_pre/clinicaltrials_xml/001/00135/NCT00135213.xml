	<brief_summary>The investigators' long-term goal is to improve the quality of services targeting the prevention of secondhand smoke (SHS). Their specific aims are to: - refine components of office systems and counseling interventions for parental tobacco control in pediatric outpatient settings; and - pilot test the feasibility and efficacy of a parental tobacco control randomized controlled trial in pediatric office settings using 5 intervention and 5 comparison pediatric practice sites. The investigators hypothesize that: - clinicians in intervention practices (compared to those in control practices) will more often implement successful office systems, screen for parental smoking, advise parents to quit and to prohibit smoking and SHS exposure at home, recommend pharmacotherapy, provide adjuncts, and refer parents to cessation programs; and - parents who smoke in intervention practices (measured by 3-month follow-up telephone surveys) will be more likely than those in control practices to have received cessation services, use pharmacotherapy, make lasting quit attempts, and institute rules to prohibit smoking and limit SHS exposure at home.</brief_summary>
