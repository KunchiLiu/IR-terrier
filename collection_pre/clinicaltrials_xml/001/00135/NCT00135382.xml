	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that virologically controlled HIV-infected individuals can successfully switch from a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen to an efavirenz-based regimen while maintaining virologic control, as evaluated by the proportion of subjects who continue to have plasma HIV-1 levels &lt; 50 copies/mL. In addition, a simplified once-daily regimen will improve adherence and quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients randomized to the non Videx enteric coated (ddl EC)+lamivudine (3TC)+efavirenz (EFV) arm would continue their baseline nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) on study.</detailed_description>
