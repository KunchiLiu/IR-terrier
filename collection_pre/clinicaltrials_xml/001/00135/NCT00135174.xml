	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the study is to quantify the true prognostic value and cost-effectiveness of routine follow-up visits in patients who receive an approved pacemaker of any type for the first time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cost-Effectiveness of Routine Follow-up Visits in Patients With a Pacemaker: The Followpace Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific objectives : - To determine the incidence of complications occurring in the first year after implantation of a pacemaker. - To determine the quality of life at one year after pacemaker implantation in comparison with the quality of life before implantation. - To determine which baseline (patient and pacemaker related) characteristics measured during implantation are prognostic predictors for the occurrence of complications and quality of life after one year. - To determine which characteristics measured during follow-up visits truly have added predictive value, and to what extent. - To determine to what extent responsibilities for pacemaker check-up can be safely delegated to non-cardiologists (e.g. pacemaker technicians or manufacturers' delegates).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient aged 18 years or over receiving a pacemaker for the first time in one of the participating Dutch pacemaker implanting centers, is a potential candidate for the study. Patients are not eligible if they refuse to sign informed consent on use of personal medical data. Patients who are taking any investigational (new) drug or have a nonapproved or investigational pacemaker system which requires unusual followup regarding the pacemaker Patients having diseases that are likely to cause death or significant morbidity during the study period such as neoplasia and immune, infectious or degenerative diseases will be excluded.</criteria>
