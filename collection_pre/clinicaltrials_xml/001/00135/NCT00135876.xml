	<brief_summary>In patients with malignant glioma, to determine the efficacy of prophylaxis with LMWH (dalteparin) compared to placebo, both commenced beyond the immediate postoperative period, for the prevention of VTE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dalteparin Low Molecular Weight Heparin for Primary Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Brain Tumour Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive dalteparin 5,000 anti-Xa units s.c. daily versus placebo s.c. daily. The primary outcome is VTE-free survival at 6 months. Progression free survival; overall survival, toxicity, and neurocognitive performance are secondary outcome measures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Both of the following criteria must be satisfied: 1. Patients with newlydiagnosed pathologicallyconfirmed WHO Grade 3 or Grade 4 glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and anaplastic mixed glioma). Tumour histology is based on local pathology review only; 2. Patients 18 years of age or older at time of randomization If one or more of the following criteria are satisfied, the patient is not eligible for the study: 1. The presence of acute or chronic DVT demonstrated by duplex ultrasonography (DUS) or venography. (Note: a screening DUS is not required for study entry); 2. Inability to commence study drug within four weeks of original surgery or biopsy; 3. Serious hemorrhage requiring hospitalization, transfusion, or surgical intervention within four weeks of potential study entry; 4. Presence of a coagulopathy (e.g. INR &gt;1.5 or platelet count &lt; 100x109/L); 5. Symptomatic intracranial or intratumoural bleeding. (Note: postoperative imaging of the brain is not required for study entry. Asymptomatic “routine” postoperative blood products in a postsurgical cavity are not an exclusion; 6. Known acute (symptomatic or actively bleeding) gastroduodenal ulcer; 7. Familial bleeding diathesis; 8. Requiring long term anticoagulants for other reasons (e.g., mechanical heart valves, atrial fibrillation); 9. Uncontrolled hypertension despite antihypertensive therapy; 10. Significant renal failure (dependent on dialysis or creatinine of greater than three times upper limit of normal control); 11. Prior history of documented DVT or PE; 12. Allergy to anticoagulants (UFH, LMWH) including immunemediated heparininduced thrombocytopenia; 13. Pregnant or of childbearing potential and not using adequate contraception; 14. Geographically inaccessible for followup; 15. Having an expected life span of less than 6 months; 16. Body weight &lt; 40 kg.</criteria>
