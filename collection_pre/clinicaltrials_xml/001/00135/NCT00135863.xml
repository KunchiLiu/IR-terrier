	<brief_summary>Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who use peritoneal dialyses with Physioneal(R) (Baxter A/S, Denmark) were allocated to inject either placebo or tinzaparin daily into the morning dialysis bag. Active medication, as well as placebo, was added for three months separated by a one month washout period. At the beginning and end of each treatment period peritoneal equilibrations tests (PE-tests), Kt/V, blood and dialysate samples were analyzed. We, the researchers at Ribe County Hospital, set out to examine inflammation (local and systemic), nutrition and ultrafiltration.</brief_summary>
