	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy. There is limited knowledge about lipodystrophic adverse events in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens. The hypothesis is that nucleoside analogues are responsible for development of lipoatrophy, and, patients receiving an NRTI-sparing regimen will have little risk of peripheral lipoatrophy. The researchers plan to perform a randomized study recruiting 100 antiretroviral naive patients that will be randomized to receive a nucleoside analogue sparing HAART regimen or a protease-inhibitor sparing regimen. The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by dual energy X-ray absortiometry (DEXA)-scanning.</brief_summary>
