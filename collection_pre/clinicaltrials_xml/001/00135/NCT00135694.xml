	<brief_summary>In order to prevent organ rejection, patients receiving liver transplants currently require life-long treatment with immune system-suppressing medications to prevent the rejection of the transplanted liver. However, these medications can cause long-term side effects, such as infection, kidney problems, diabetes, and cancer. In patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), these medications may increase the risk of HCV infection in the transplanted liver. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a slow withdrawal of immune system-suppressing medications is safe in two groups of subjects: those who receive a liver transplant due to HCV, and those who receive a liver transplant due to non-immune, non-viral causes of liver failure. The study will also look at whether slow withdrawal will help reduce the long-term side effects of immune system-suppressing medications and decrease the chance for HCV infection of the new liver in transplant patients with HCV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gradual Withdrawal of Immune System Suppressing Drugs in Patients Receiving a Liver Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in which individuals with liver failure due to hepatitis C or to nonimmune nonviral causes undergo liver transplantation and receive immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are tapered in the 3 months after transplantation and the calcineurin inhibitor is continued. Participants are regularly assessed for evidence of allograft rejection. One year after transplantation, participants eligible for withdrawal are randomly assigned in a 4 to 1 ratio to immunosuppression withdrawal or to maintenance. Participants assigned to withdrawal undergo a scheduled taper over approximately 1 year.</detailed_description>
