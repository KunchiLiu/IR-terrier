	<brief_summary>To evaluate the role of 3 cycles of irinotecan and cisplatin for patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer who received one course of etoposide and cisplatin plus concurrent accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic irradiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Irinotecan and Cisplatin (IP) With Etoposide and Cisplatin (EP) Following EP/TRT for LD-SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) previously conducted a randomized phase III trial comparing irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) with EP in patients with extensive-stage SCLC. The response rate and overall median survival were significantly better for IP, i.e. 84.4% and 12.8 months with IP, versus 67.5% and 9.4 months with EP, respectively. The 2-year survival rates were 19.5% for IP and 5.2% for EP (7). These encouraging results prompted us to explore the use of IP in LSCLC.</detailed_description>
