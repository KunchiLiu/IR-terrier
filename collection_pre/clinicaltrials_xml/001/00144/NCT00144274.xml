	<detailed_description>The purpose of this trial is to investigate efficacy and tolerability of lozenges containing 20mg am broxol hydrochloride relative to placebo in relieving pain of sore throat in adolescent patients suf fering from acute viral pharyngitis. The pain intensity will be assessed by the patient on a 6-point rating scale before taking the first lozenge and 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes thereafter. The patient enters the rating in the patient's diary. Study Hypothesis: It will be tested whether a statistically significant difference exists in the S PIDnorm after the intake of the 1st lozenge between the group treated with ambro xol lozenges and the group treated with placebo lozenges. Comparison(s): Placebo comparison</detailed_description>
