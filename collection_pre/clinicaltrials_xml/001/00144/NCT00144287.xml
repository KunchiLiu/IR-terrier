	<brief_title>Safety Study of Tipranavir Co-administered With Low-dose Ritonavir (TPV/r) in Patients With Advanced HIV-1 Infection and Limited Treatment Options</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this open label study is to assess the safety and tolerability of tipranavir co-administered with low-dose ritonavir (500 mg tipranavir/200 mg ritonavir BID) in HIV-1 infected patients who are triple antiretroviral class experienced with at least two previous PI-containing regimens. The safety assessment will be performed by evaluating: - The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) , all serious adverse events (SAEs), and additional safety laboratory parameters. - The occurrence of PI class-specific AEs, such as hemorrhage, dyslipidemia, hepatic events, hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, and rash. The efficacy assessment will be performed by evaluating: - The quantity of HIV-1 RNA - The CD4 cell count. Study Hypothesis: The purpose of this open label study is to assess the safety and tolerability of tipranavir co-administered with low-dose ritonavir (500 mg tipranavir/200 mg ritonavir BID) in HIV-1 infected patients who are triple antiretroviral class experienced with at least two previous PI-containing regimens. Comparison(s): N.A.</detailed_description>
