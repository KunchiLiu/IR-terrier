	<brief_summary>The median survival at progression after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer is about 2.5 months. There are no data which a possible benefit of second line therapy. for this reason a trial which investigates a possible benefit or chemotherapy compared to best supportive care as second line treatment is urgently necessary. Irinotecan shows response rates of 20% in the first line therapy with high rates od disease stabilization. There are few trials investigating irinotecan in the second line setting. Response rates of 20% are reported in tis setting. Irinotecan is supplied without costs from the company Pfizer.</brief_summary>
