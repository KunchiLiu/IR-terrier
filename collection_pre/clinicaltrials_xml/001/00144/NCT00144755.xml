	<brief_summary>This study is a multicentric randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of R-CHOP given every 14 days compared to R-CHOP given every 21 days in association or not with darbepoetin alfa in order to maintain hemoglobin above 13 g/dl, compared to classical symptomatic treatment of anemia in patients aged from 60 to 80 years with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-CHOP-14 Versus R-CHOP-21 and Darbepoetin Alpha in Patients Aged 60-80 Years With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients aged 60 to 75 years with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the shortening of interval between the courses of CHOP combination (CHOP-14), improves the complete response rate, the progression free survival and the overall survival. The addition of Rituximab to standard CHOP (R-CHOP) has also been shown to improve complete remission rate (CR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in elderly patients with B-DLCL. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the increase of the dose intensity by shortening the interval between two courses of R-CHOP (R-CHOP-14)could further improve the results of the R-CHOP. Anemia is frequent at diagnosis and during the treatment of aggressive lymphoma. In the previous LNH 98-5 study, 72 % of the patients had, at the diagnosis, a hemoglobin level inferior to 13 g/dl. Moreover, during the treatment, 92 % of the patients had a hemoglobin level less than 13 g/dl and 30 % were transfused. The presence of anemia at diagnosis is an indicator of poor prognosis in multivariate analysis. This prognosis impact could probably be explained at cellular level on the tumor. Tumoral hypoxia is increased by the presence of anemia. Due to this hypoxia, the expression of tumor growth factor may be increased: e.a VEGF and the induction of expression of multi drug resistance (MDR1) is observed. This resistance to treatment is also due to the inhibition of genotoxic activity of free radicals induced by ionised radiation and chemotherapy. Experimentally, the negative impact of hypoxia on the efficacy of chemotherapy has been demonstrated in sarcoma cell lines for doxorubicin, vincristine and all most cyclophosphamide. Finally, hypoxia induced over expression of apoptosis resistance genes and induced a growth advantage for apoptosis resistant tumoral lines. Improvement of survival in patients receiving erythropoetin with chemotherapy or radiotherapy was suggested in a study on patients treated with a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for head and neck cancer. Erythropoetin could act to protect several normal tissues during chemotherapy and thus could decrease treatment related morbidity. Darbepoetin alfa is a new recombinant protein stimulating erythropoiesis. Thus, the use of darbepoetin alfa, in association with chemotherapy, could increase CR rate, EFS and OS in patients treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This study is a multicentric, phase III open-label, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of R-CHOP given every 14 days compared to R-CHOP given every 21 days in association or not with darbepoetin alfa in order to maintain hemoglobin above 13 g/dl, compared to classical symptomatic treatment of anemia in patients aged 66 to 80 years with not previously treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with at least one adverse prognostic factor of the age adjusted IPI.</detailed_description>
