	<brief_summary>For HIV-infected individuals with highly resistant viruses, higher drug levels may be required to block the virus. This study investigates that concept by comparing the efficacy of standard fosamprenavir/ritonavir to an increased dose of boosted fosamprenavir and to a combination of fosamprenavir (increased dose)/lopinavir/ritonavir.</brief_summary>
