	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America. The aim of this research study is to compare the efficacy (reduction in HbA1c and in blood glucose levels) of insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin administered as basal insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes and to verify the safety of use (number and severity of episodes of hypoglycemia, body weight, and insulin antibodies and side effects).</brief_summary>
