	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of primary tumor resection on the metabolic activity of metastases in patients with a colorectal primary tumor and synchronous liver metastases by positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro[18F]-D-glucose (FDG-PET) scanning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Metabolic Activity of Liver Metastases by FDG-PET Scanning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the activity of liver metastases before and after resection of the primary tumor. Non-invasive assessment of tumor metabolism is possible in vivo by means of positron emission tomography (PET)-scanning. Therefore, FDG-PET scan offers a suitable approach to determine the influence of removal of a primary colorectal tumor on metabolic activity of the liver metastases. The FDG uptake in the liver metastases is quantified by calculating standardised uptake values (SUVs).</detailed_description>
