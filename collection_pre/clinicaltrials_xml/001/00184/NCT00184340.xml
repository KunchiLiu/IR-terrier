	<detailed_description>This phase (Phase B) concentrates on qualitative evaluation of open clinical single case trials using asynchronous Internet-mediated text-dialogue for psychotherapeutic purposes. Single patients in differing treatment phases, conditions, age and sex categories are interviewed after using Internet-contact as a supplementary tool in psychotherapy. Their therapists are interviewed as well. The purpose is systematically gathering single-case experiences with the tool, to build a hypothesis for research and preliminary guidelines for experimental clinical use of Internet-mediated psychotherapy.</detailed_description>
