	<brief_summary>The study is based on a hypothesis that there is interaction between the activity in the immune system and in the mind. To study this, the investigators register different measures for activity in the immune system on patients unselectedly admitted to an acute psychiatric ward. The psychiatric statuses and diagnoses of these patients are carefully defined as well.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Immune System and Psychiatric Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypotheses are first that activity in the immune system influences the psychiatric status in general, second that changes in activity in psychiatric status affect activity in the immune system and third that there are connections between certain psychiatric conditions/disorders and certain features of the immune system. All patients admitted to a psychiatric acute ward covering an area with a population of 130.000 and with around 1000 admittances to an acute psychiatric ward a year (some readmittances) are asked to participate in the study. Patients fill in a question form regarding psychiatric as well as somatic health with emphasis on diseases involving immune activity. When possible also slight information on the family is registered. Both at the time of admittance and after recovery clinical laboratory tests on somatic status are registered. In addition the level of different cytokines is measured. The psychiatric state and precise diagnoses are registered during the stay. The data will be analysed to uncover connections between psychiatric stress in general as well as specific psychiatric diagnoses and activity in the immune system.</detailed_description>
