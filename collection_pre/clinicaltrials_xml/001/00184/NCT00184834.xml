	<brief_summary>An increasing aggressiveness in the surgical approach of colorectal liver metastases is observed. This seems only justified when, besides prolongation of survival, also the health status of patients is considered. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the impact of surgery on health-related quality of life in this specific patient population operated for colorectal liver metastases.Furthermore, as the indications for hepatic resection are broadened and patients with more extensive liver disease are operated on, the chance of non operable disease at laparotomy will increase. The effects of such an event on HRQol are also studied.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In a prospective study several patients groups were identified. Patients undergoing liver resection and/or local ablative therapy. Patients with non operable disease at (explorative) laparotomy and outpatients with non operable disease as shown during work up for liver resection. Several validated instruments on HRQoL were ompleted preoperatively (baseline), a half month after operation and then every three months.</detailed_description>
