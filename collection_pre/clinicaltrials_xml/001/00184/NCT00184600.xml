	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this research study is to compare the efficacy (reduction in HbA1c and in blood glucose levels) of insulin detemir, insulin aspart and biphasic insulin aspart 30, when added to current OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes and to verify the safety of use (number and severity of episodes of hypoglycaemia, body weight and side effects).</brief_summary>
