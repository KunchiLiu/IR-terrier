	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is first to establish what is the ideal dose of gemcitabine, a chemotherapy agent, when given in combination with radiation. In addition, the investigators want to determine the side effects and the effectiveness of this combination. The investigators will also study several markers to try to identify markers or tests that will predict which patients will benefit more from this treatment.</brief_summary>
