	<brief_summary>Delayed anticipatory muscle activity response in deep low back and abdominal muscles has been observed in patients with low back pain, indicative of a pathological condition. Muscle activity onset is traditionally recorded by intramuscular electromyography, but there is a need for a less cumbersome recording method in large clinical studies. The purpose of this experimental study is to explore whether high-frame rate m-mode ultrasound and tissue velocity imaging could measure anticipatory muscle responses ("onset") in the abdominal muscles reliably and comparably accurate to intramuscular EMG.</brief_summary>
