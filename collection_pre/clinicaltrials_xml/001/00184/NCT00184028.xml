	<brief_summary>This research study is for subjects with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck which is not solely treatable with surgery or radiation. This research study involves treatment with an experimental chemotherapy combination of oxaliplatin and Taxotere. Tha main purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of this combination of medications for this type of cancer. Approximately 54 subjects will take part in this study.</brief_summary>
