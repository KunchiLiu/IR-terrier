	<brief_summary>The study investigates whether endurance training breathing 100% oxygen gives a additional improvement of maximal oxygen uptake in stable Angina Pectoris patients, compared to training without extra oxygen supplementation. In addition work economy, stroke volume and cardiac perfusion is measured. The hypothesis of the study is that increased oxygenation of the air increases performance, stroke volume, work economy and cardiac perfusion.</brief_summary>
