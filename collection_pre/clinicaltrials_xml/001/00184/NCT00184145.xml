	<brief_title>EMDR in the Treatment of Specific Phobia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims: To test the hypothesis that one session EMDR is more effective for the treatment of specific (animal) phobia than relaxation immediately after treatment and at follow-up. Secondly to test whether an additional one-session exposure therapy offered to both treatment groups (EMDR patients and relaxation patients) improves outcome in the EMDR-group and results in equal outcome for both treatment groups.</detailed_description>
