	<brief_summary>Maximal strength training has been shown to increase muscular strength, muscular volume and work economy. An 8 week maximal leg press training regime will be conducted on cardiac heart failure patients to evaluate whether they increase their maximal leg press strength, work economy, serum testosterone and quality of life. The study hypotheses are that: 1. Aerobic work capacity will increase due to increased work economy, without increases in maximal oxygen uptake. 2. Strength training will increase serum testosterone.</brief_summary>
