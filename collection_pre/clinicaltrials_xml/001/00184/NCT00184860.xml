	<brief_summary>Technical developments in radiation oncology are making it possible to deliver a prescribed radiation dose to radiation target volume with increasing accuracy. Therefore it is becoming even more relevant to accurately define the radiation target volumes. The current standard in defining radiation target volumes in patients with head-and-neck cancer is to combine physical examination data with a CT-scan in the treatment position. The goal of this investigation is to analyse the rol of CT-PET-MRI image fusion in defining radiation target volumes.</brief_summary>
