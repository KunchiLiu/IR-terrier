	<brief_title>Prophylactic Treatment of Episodic Cluster Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cluster headache is an unilateral headache with periodic attacks, that usually lasts for 6 to 12 weeks. The pain is usually unbearable. The attacks are treated with injections of sumatriptan (migraine medication)and inhalation of oxygen. The most common prophylactics today has limited effect and a risk of side effects. Candesartan has in one study shown a clinically significant effect in migraine prophylaxis. The angiotensin II receptor blocker, candesartan is well tolerated with side-effects not significantly different from placebo and with few drug interactions. We therefore wish to investigate the prophylactic effect in treatment of cluster in headache patients. This will be a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel study where the prophylactic effect of candesartan is compared to placebo in a period of 3 weeks. First week 16 mg and the following 2 weeks 32 mg.</detailed_description>
