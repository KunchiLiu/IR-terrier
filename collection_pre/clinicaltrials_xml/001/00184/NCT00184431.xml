	<brief_title>Does Intensive Task Specific Training Improve Balance After Acute Stroke?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased risk of falling is a major problem after stroke and impaired balance is one of the main reasons for falling. Early and intensive physiotherapy seems to be beneficial for functional outcome after stroke although it is still unknown whether one specific physiotherapy technique is better than another. Comparison: Traditional follow up care by the community health care system with additional task specific physiotherapy three times a week and a daily self administrated home training program compared to traditional follow up care by the community health care system.</detailed_description>
