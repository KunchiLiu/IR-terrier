In the main period, subjects will receive either active treatment for 104 weeks (two dosing regimens) or no treatment for 52 weeks followed by an extension period where subjects who received active treatment for 104 weeks (two years) will continue with the same treatment for further 156 weeks (three years) while those subjects who received no treatment for 52 weeks (one year) will be randomised to receive two dosing regimens for 208 weeks (four years). In total, subjects participate in trial for 260 weeks (five years).
