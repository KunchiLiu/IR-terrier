	<criteria>Each patient must meet the following inclusion criteria before entry into the study. Has given written consent prior to any studyrelated activity is performed (a studyrelated activity is defined as any procedure that would not have been performed during the normal management of the patient). Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (all stages), in whom endocrine treatment (except for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy) is indicated. This includes patients with rising PSA after having received radical prostatectomy (removal of the entire prostate and seminal vesicles) or radiotherapy with curative intention. Male patient aged 18 years or over. Has a baseline testosterone above the lower limit of normal range. Has an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score equal to or less than 2. Has a PSA value of greater than or equal to 2ng/mL. Any patient meeting one or more of the following exclusion criteria will not be entered into the study. Previous or present hormonal management of prostate cancer (surgical castration or other hormonal manipulation, e.g. GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, antiandrogens, estrogens). However, patients having undergone neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in conjunction with prostatectomy or radiotherapy with curative intention may be included so long as the hormonal therapy did not exceed a total duration of 6 months and was terminated at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit. Currently or recently (within the last 12 weeks preceding the Screening Visit) under treatment with any other drug modifying testosterone level or function. Is considered to be a candidate for curative therapy, i.e., radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy within 6 months from Screening Visit. Has a history of severe asthma (defined as a need for daily treatment with oral or inhalation steroids to control the asthma), anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, angioneurotic edema or Quincke's Edema. Has hypersensitivity towards any component of the investigational products (degarelix or mannitol). Has history of other cancer within the last 5 years except for prostate cancer and surgically removed basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Has elevated serum ALT level more than three times above upper level of normal range or serum total bilirubin level above one and a half times above upper level of normal range as measured by the laboratory at the Screening Visit. Has known or suspect hepatic disease of any sort. Patients with liver disease are not to be enrolled in this study. Has other clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, which in the judgment of the investigator would interfere with the participation of the patient in this study or evaluation of study results. Has a clinically significant disorder (other than prostate cancer) or any other condition, including excessive alcohol or drug abuse, which may interfere with trial participation or which may affect the conclusion of the study as judged by the investigator. Has a mental incapacity or language barriers precluding adequate understanding or cooperation. Has received an investigational drug within the last 12 weeks preceding Screening Visit. Has previously participated in any degarelix study</criteria>
