	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) versus adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for the treatment of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Participants will receive TDF or ADV for 48 weeks (double-blind). After 48 weeks, eligible participants switched to open-label TDF for up to 480 weeks.</brief_summary>
