	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether asthmatics have different adenosine receptor expression profiles than healthy controls. We hypothesize that asthmatics will have increased adenosine receptor expression versus control subjects. We also want to study the effects of allergen inhalation on adenosine receptor expression in asthmatics. We believe that adenosine receptor expression will be upregulated after allergen inhalation. Both hypotheses are being tested in sputum and peripheral blood.</brief_summary>
