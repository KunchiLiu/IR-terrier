	<brief_title>Early Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) With Nutrition and Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies to date indicate that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)—insertion of a feeding tube in the stomach—and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)—mechanically assisted or generated breaths delivered through a tightly fitting nasal or facial mask—improve survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even when introduced late in the disease. Dr. Kasarskis and his research team believe early intervention with these treatments may improve patients outcome even further. However, many issues regarding the early use of these treatments prevent the design of a phase III clinical trial to test this hypothesis. Common to both NIPPV and nutrition is a lack of a reliable indicator of early respiratory or nutritional insufficiency. With respect to nutrition, reliable and cost effective methods are needed to determine a patient's energy (i.e. caloric) requirements at different stages of the illness to establish a basis for recommending PEG on the adequacy of energy intake. For NIPPV, factors that influence acceptance and tolerability of this therapy, and measurements of early respiratory dysfunction need to be identified. The purposes of this trial are to develop and validate strategies to improve tolerability of NIPPV, identify factors that influence acceptance of NIPPV, and evaluate measures of early respiratory failure, other than percentage of forced vital capacity (FVC). Researchers will also develop and validate methods to determine energy balance in and evaluate the nutritional status of patients with ALS that will be applicable to a multi-center phase III study of nutrition and NIPPV. The study will be conducted at 11 other sites across the country. Some study sites will focus on the nutritional aspects of the trial while the other sites will focus on NIPPV treatment. A total of 220 patients will be studied over 2 years. Enrollment will end on June 30, 2007.</detailed_description>
