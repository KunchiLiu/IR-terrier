	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II research study that is designed for patients who have small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that is no longer responding to treatment. Patients will receive picoplatin, a new platinum-based agent that is currently under investigation, in 21-day cycles.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Picoplatin as Second-Line Therapy for Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platinum drugs work by binding to DNA and preventing the rapid cell division of tumors. However, many tumors demonstrate a resistance to platinum drugs. Results from preclinical studies indicate that picoplatin (previously called AMD473 or ZD0473) may be able to overcome or partially overcome platinum resistance. More than 500 patients have received picoplatin in previous Phase I or Phase II clinical trials.</detailed_description>
