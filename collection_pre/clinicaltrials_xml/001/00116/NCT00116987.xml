	<brief_summary>Of the 19,000 pacemakers implanted across Canada in 2002, 1/3 of them were for patients 80 years and older. This is the fastest growing segment of our population, yet no study has specifically been done in this age group to determine the optimal pacing mode. We wish to determine whether dual chamber or single chamber pacing is associated with a reduction in emergency room visits or hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes (e.g., congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF)) resulting in improved quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Chamber Versus Single Chamber Cardiac Pacing in People 80 Years of Age and Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patients who are 80 years of age and older, develop AF or CHF. Physiologic pacing has been shown to prevent AF compared to ventricular pacing. Whether prevention of AF and CHF by physiologic pacing reduces emergency room visits or hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes in this population in unknown. The investigators wish to determine the optimal pacing mode for this patient population that would enable optimal management of cardiovascular problems, resulting in improved quality of life and minimizing use of health care facilities. Patients recruited to the study will be randomized to either DDDR or VVIR pacing, and followed in the clinic every 6 months for the 3 years of the study.</detailed_description>
