	<brief_title>Efavirenz and Lamivudine/Zidovudine for Treatment-Naive HIV Infected People in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infection in China has reached epidemic proportions, especially in poor rural communities. Among the infected are former commercial plasma donors who became infected through contaminated blood collection equipment. This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of an antiretroviral (ARV) regimen given to treatment-naive HIV infected adults. Participants will be recruited in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province. This study will last 1 year. At study entry, all study participants will be given an ARV regimen consisting of lamivudine/zidovudine twice daily and efavirenz once daily. There will be 11 study visits; a physical exam, blood collection, and vital signs measurement will occur at all study visits. Participants will also receive safe sex and adherence counseling at all visits. Participants will be asked to complete an adherence questionnaire and will have their pills counted at most visits.</detailed_description>
