	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gefitinib works in treating patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the 1-year overall survival rate in patients with previously treated locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with gefitinib as maintenance therapy. Secondary - Determine disease-free survival and time to disease recurrence in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, every 12 weeks during study treatment, and then at the end of study treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
