	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress related damage to sperm is believed to be a major cause of male infertility. The object of the Menevit study is to investigate the role of a novel anti-oxidant preparation (Menevit) on sperm function, embryo quality and pregnancy rates in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Menevit Study: Menevit Anti-Oxidant Therapy for the Treatment of Male Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men will be screened for oxidative stress (free radical) related damage to their sperm. This will include screening for lipid peroxidation of sperm using the LPO-586 assay, HOST test and for sperm DNA fragmentation using the Tunel technique. Those men found to have free radical related damage will be enrolled in a randomized control trial in which they will receive either the Menevit anti-oxidant or placebo (in a 2:1 randomization ratio respectively). The Menevit anti-oxidant is a capsule containing several different anti-oxidants, taken orally once per day. The placebo is identical in appearance and taste. After 3 months of Menevit/placebo the female partners of these men will undergo an IVF oocyte retrieval operation and embryo transfer. Pregnancy rates and embryo quality will be compared between groups. Changes in semen characteristics (count, motility, morphology, membrane integrity) and lipid peroxidation (LPO-586) plus sperm DNA fragmentation (Tunel assay) will be assessed at trial entry, 6 weeks and 3 months. Comparisons between the patients embryo quality in the IVF cycle immediately before and during the Menevit trial will also be compared when possible</detailed_description>
