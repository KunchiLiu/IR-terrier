	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Giving gemcitabine and capecitabine together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine and capecitabine together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine progression-free survival of patients with metastatic or unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine, capecitabine, and bevacizumab. Secondary - Determine clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline then weekly for 3 weeks. Patients are followed every 2-4 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for at least 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 8.8-17.5 months.</detailed_description>
