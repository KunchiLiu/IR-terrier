	<brief_title>Efavirenz and Lamivudine/Zidovudine for Treatment-Naive HIV Infected Adults in Senegal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite a relatively low prevalence of HIV infection, all HIV subtypes have been documented in Senegal. Data on mutations that confer resistance to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are limited to HIV subtype B; adherence data are also limited. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an ARV regimen given to treatment-naive HIV infected adults and adolescents. The study will also examine the characteristics of virologic failure and adherence in this treatment group. Participants will be recruited at two sites in Dakar, Senegal. This study will last 96 weeks. At study entry, all participants will be given an ARV regimen of lamivudine/zidovudine twice daily and efavirenz once daily. If toxicity or treatment failure occurs, some participants may require changes in their ARV regimens. There will be 14 study visits during the study; a physical exam, blood collection, and sociodemographic and medication history assessments will occur at each visit. Participants will also be asked to complete quality-of-life and adherence questionnaires. An off-study visit will occur at approximately one month after Week 96, with assessments and procedures similar to visits during the study.</detailed_description>
