	<brief_summary>This study will investigate long-term, low-dose growth hormone administration in HIV-infected patients with reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion and increased visceral adiposity. We hypothesize that low-dose growth hormone will reduce visceral fat. Secondary endpoints will include measures of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), glucose homeostasis, lipids, blood pressure,bone density, cardiovascular risk and safety parameters.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will investigate long-term, low-dose growth hormone administration in HIV-infected patients with reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion and increased visceral adiposity. We hypothesize that low-dose growth hormone will reduce visceral fat preferentially over subcutaneous fat, and increase lean body mass. Secondary endpoints will include measures of IGF-1, glucose homeostasis, lipids, blood pressure,bone density, cardiovascular risk and safety parameters. Dosing of growth hormone will be based on patients' IGF-1 levels and will not exceed 6mcg/kg/day.</detailed_description>
