	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan works in treating patients with metastatic or inoperable thyroid cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Inoperable Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic or inoperable locoregional medullary thyroid cancer treated with irinotecan. Secondary - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response is assessed after completion of 4 courses. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR. Patients who have stable disease receive up to 12 total courses. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
