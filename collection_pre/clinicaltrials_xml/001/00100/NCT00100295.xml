This study will determine the safety and efficacy of an herbal treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. This study will last 9 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an herbal product or placebo three times a day for the duration of the study. Participants will come in for weekly study visits at which their ADHD symptoms and any side effects will be assessed by self-report rating scales.</detailed_description>
