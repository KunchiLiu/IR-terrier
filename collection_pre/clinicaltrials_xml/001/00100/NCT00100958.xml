	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of indole-3-carbinol may prevent cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of indole-3-carbinol and to see how well it works compared to placebo in preventing cancer in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indole-3-Carbinol in Preventing Cancer in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of indole-3-carbinol in healthy participants. - Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these participants. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants. Secondary - Determine the effects of this drug on selected markers of sexual function in these participants. - Determine the effects of this drug on markers of susceptibility to cancer in these participants. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study. Participants at each dose level are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Participants receive a single dose of oral indole-3-carbinol on day 1. - Arm II: Participants receive a single dose of oral placebo on day 1. Cohorts of 3 participants receive escalating doses of indole-3-carbinol until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 participants experiences dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 3 participants is treated at the MTD. Participants are followed on days 2, 3, and 6. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 participants (18 in arm I and 6 in arm II) will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
