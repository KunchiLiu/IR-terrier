	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide information on the risks and benefits of routine blood pressure lowering (regardless of blood pressure level), and intensive lowering of blood glucose levels, in patients with Type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. The major outcomes of the study will be cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke or dying as a result of cardiovascular disease), as well as new or worsening diabetic eye and kidney disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Pressure and Glucose Lowering for the Prevention of Vascular Disease in High Risk Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risks of macrovascular and microvascular disease, both of which are reduced by control of raised blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. Intensive glycaemic control has also been shown to reduce microvascular disease, but the effects on macrovascular disease remain uncertain. This study will examine the hypotheses that blood pressure lowering (with an ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination) and intensive glycaemic control (with a sulphonylurea-based regimen) in high-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes (including hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects) reduces the incidence of both macrovascular and microvascular disease. The study is a 2 x 2 factorial randomised controlled trial that includes 11,140 adults with type 2 diabetes at elevated risk of vascular disease. Following 6 weeks on open label perindopril-indapamide combination, eligible individuals were randomised to continued perindopril-indapamide or matching placebo, and to an intensive gliclazide MR-based glucose control regimen (aiming for HbA1c of 6.5% or lower) or usual guidelines-based therapy. Primary outcomes are, first, the composite of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death and, second, the composite of new or worsening nephropathy or diabetic eye disease. These primary outcomes will be analysed jointly and separately. The average duration of treatment and follow-up is 5.5 to 6 years. The study is being conducted in 214 centres in Australasia, Asia, Europe and North America. ADVANCE is designed to provide reliable evidence about the balance of benefits and risks conferred by blood pressure lowering therapy and intensive glucose control therapy in high-risk diabetic patients, irrespective of initial blood pressure or glucose levels.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus first made at age 30 years or older 2. Age 55 years or older at entry 3. Ability to provide informed consent 4. A substantially elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, indicated by: A history of major macrovascular disease defined as any one of: stroke, myocardial infarction, hospital admission for transient ischaemic attack, hospital admission for unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting), peripheral revascularisation (angioplasty or surgery) or amputation secondary to vascular disease or A history of major microvascular disease defined as any one of nephropathy (albumin:creatinine ratio &gt;300ug/mg), retinal photocoagulation therapy, proliferative retinopathy (new blood vessels on the disc or elsewhere, vitreous haemorrhage, preretinal haemorrhage, or fibrous proliferations on the disc or elsewhere), macular oedema (retinal thickening within one disc diameter of the macular centre) or blindness in either eye (corrected visual acuity 6/60 or worse, persisting for three months or more) not known to be due to nondiabetic causes or A first diagnosis of type 2 diabetes made 10 or more years prior to entry or Another major risk factor for vascular disease defined as any one of: current daily cigarette smoking, total cholesterol greater than 6.0 mmol/l (with or without cholesterol lowering treatment), HDL cholesterol &lt;1.0 mmol/l, microalbuminuria (albumin:creatinine ratio 30300ug/mg) or Age 65 years or over 1. A definite contraindication to treatment with an ACE inhibitor or a thiazidelike diuretic 2. A specific indication for treatment with an ACE inhibitor other than perindopril 24 mg daily (see also section 5.2.3) or a thiazidelike diuretic 3. A definite and specific indication for treatment with gliclazide or a haemoglobin A1c control target of 6.5% or less 4. A definite contraindication to treatment with gliclazide or a haemoglobin A1c control target of 6.5% or less 5. A definite indication for longterm fulldose or bedtime insulin therapy 6. Participation in a trial within the month prior to the Registration Visit or current participation in another trial Other potential reasons for ineligibility include: High probability of nonadherence to study treatment or followup Current clinical instability (e.g. a major cerebral or coronary event or sightthreatening retinopathy or macular oedema within the previous few weeks) Life threatening nonvascular disease other than diabetes and its complications Moderate or severe dementia Major disability that is likely to prevent regular attendance at study clinics Final decisions about eligibility were made at the discretion of the study investigator and the potential study participant, in the light of any requirements or guidance from local ethics committees and other regulatory bodies.</criteria>
