	<brief_summary>The main objective of this trial is to explore the effect of combining an established chemotherapy regimen (FLOX), based on 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®), with the EGF receptor antibody cetuximab (Erbitux®) in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The trial will investigate two regimens of FLOX plus cetuximab, in which FLOX is given continuously or intermittently, compared to standard FLOX without cetuximab.</brief_summary>
