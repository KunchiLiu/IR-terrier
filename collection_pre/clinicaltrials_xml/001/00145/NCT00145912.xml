	<brief_title>Primary Care Based Depression Prevention for Adolescents/Young Adults/Young Adults and Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A web-based depression prevention program will evaluate the interview. Depression is a condition where people feel sad, tired, have changes in sleep, and lose interest in fun things for more than two weeks. This program teaches adolescents/young adults new skills. They learn new skills by talking with their doctor and doing a workbook at an Internet site. Counselors have used some of these lessons to successfully treat, and in some cases, prevent depression. We do not know if these lessons given in a primary care doctor's office or over the Internet will prevent depression. We will have to do further studies to determine this. If subjects are clinically depressed right now, they cannot be a part of this study.</detailed_description>
