	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial was to characterize the long-term (up to 40 weeks) safety and tolerability of asenapine in bipolar I disorder subjects who had not completely responded to continuing treatment with lithium or valproic acid (VPA) for the treatment of an acute manic or mixed episodes upon enrollment into the 12-week lead-in trial, A7501008 (NCT00145470).
