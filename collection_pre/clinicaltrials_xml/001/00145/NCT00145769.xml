	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial of Preoperative Radiotherapy for Stage T3 Adenocarcinoma of Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: - The objective is, in patients with T3 clinically resectable carcinoma of the rectum, to demonstrate that the local recurrence rate in patients treated with a long course (LC) of pre-operative radiotherapy with continuous infusion 5-FU is lower than that in patients treated with a short course (SC) of pre-operative radiotherapy with early surgery Eligibility Criteria: - The main eligibility criteria are that the patient has clinically resectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum, a clinical stage T3 tumour whose lower border is within 12 cm of the anal verge, and no evidence of distant metastases. Endpoints: - Primary endpoint is local recurrence. - Secondary endpoints are overall survival, toxicity, abdminoperineal resection rate, quality of life. Treatment arms: - SC arm: Radiotherapy (RT) 25 Gy in 5 fr in 1 week to be followed by surgery within 1 week and 6 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy 5FU/Folinic acid. - LC arm: RT 50.4 Gy in 28 fr in 5Â½weeks with 5FU 225 mg/m2/day throughout the course of RT, to be followed by surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of RT. 4 cycles of adjuvant 5FU/Folinic acid will be given.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All of the following must apply: Pathologically documented and clinically resectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum. The patient must be considered by the surgeon to be suitable for a curative resection. The patient must be considered by the radiation oncologist to have no contraindication to preoperative radiotherapy. Clinical T3 stage tumour on endorectal ultrasound or MRI. When endorectal ultrasound cannot be performed satisfactorily due to a technical reason, such as stenosis or proximity of the tumour, and MRI is not available, infiltration of perirectal fat on CT scan is also acceptable. Tumour with lower border within 12 cm from anal verge on rigid sigmoidoscopy. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2. Adequate bone marrow function with neutrophil count at least 1.5 x 109/L and platelet count at least 100 x 109/L. Adequate liver function with bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Accessibility for treatment and followup. Written informed consent. None of the following must apply: Evidence of distant metastases. Recurrent rectal cancer. Unstable cardiac disease or clinically significant active infection. Other cancer in the last 5 years except treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Pregnant or lactating females or female patients of childbearing potential who have not been surgically sterilized or are without adequate contraceptive measures. Contraindication to insertion of a suitable indwelling venous catheter e.g. implantable central venous device (infuseaport), Hickman catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter. Prior pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy.</criteria>
