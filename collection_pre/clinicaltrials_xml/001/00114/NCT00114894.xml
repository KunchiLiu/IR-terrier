	<detailed_description>Jellyfish stings are a common occurrence among ocean-goers worldwide with an estimated 150 million envenomations annually. Fatalities and hospitalizations occur annually, particularly in the Indo-Pacific regions. A new topical jellyfish sting inhibitor based on the mucous coating of the clown fish prevents 85% of jellyfish stings in laboratory settings. Clown fish inhabit within the tentacles of sea anemones, which have stinging cells similar to those of jellyfish, yet clown fish are not stung by the sea anemones. In controlled laboratory environments, the jellyfish sting inhibitor, Safe Seaâ„¢ when applied to volunteers' arms, prevented 100% of Chrysaora fuscescens stings and 70% of Chiropsalmus quadrumanus stings. Of the C. quadrumanus stings that occurred, their intensity was diminished. The field effectiveness is unknown. This is a field test to determine the real world effectiveness of Safe Sea to prevent jellyfish stings.</detailed_description>
