	<brief_summary>During 3D-conformal external beam radiation therapy treatments for prostate cancer, the prostate gland moves. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the placement of a prostate immobilization device into the rectum during radiation treatments will decrease the risk of rectal bleeding that is sometimes seen as a late effect from radiation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- MRI using an endorectal coil done prior to treatment for staging. - Baseline Quality of Life (QOL) assessment will be completed prior to treatment. - Total androgen suppression is initiated and will continue for at least 6 months. - Prostate Immobilization Device (PID) placed during the planning session. - PID will be placed daily for the first 15 3D external beam radiation treatments. - QOL assessment and follow-up will take place every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
