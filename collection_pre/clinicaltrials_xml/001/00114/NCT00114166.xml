	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving topotecan in different dosing schedules may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well topotecan works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the antitumor activity of topotecan, in terms of frequency and duration of tumor response, in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens. - Determine the effects of prognostic variables (i.e., initial performance status, age, and mucinous or clear cell histology) in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 38-110 patients (19-55 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 15-30 months.</detailed_description>
