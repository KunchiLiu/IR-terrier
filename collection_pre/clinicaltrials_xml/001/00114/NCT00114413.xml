	<brief_summary>The purpose of ICAC-01 is to determine whether an asthma treatment strategy that measures exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) to indicate disease progression is more effective in treating asthma symptoms when combined with existing asthma treatment guidelines than treatment using the guidelines alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Asthma Treatment Strategy Based on Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurements in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past two decades, the prevalence of asthma has dramatically increased in many parts of the world. The current National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) identifies inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the preferred long-term control therapy for all forms of persistent asthma. However, there is still a significant proportion of patients with persistent asthma who are not receiving ICS therapy or do not follow their treatment plan. Individualized asthma treatment plans are needed. The use of biomarkers, in addition to NAEPP guidelines, may help enhance the level of asthma assessment, guide medication regimens, and improve overall asthma control. This study will determine whether NAEPP-recommended treatment, combined with eNO measurement, is more effective in reducing asthma symptoms than NAEPP-recommended treatment alone. ICAC-01 will last 46 weeks and will comprise 8 study visits. ICAC-01 also includes a mechanistic sub-study (ICAC-02). Its primary objective is to determine whether "highly sensitized", compared to "weakly sensitized" asthmatic subjects have more severe asthma, as defined by the levels at randomization to the completion of ICAC-01. To address the primary objective of ICAC-02, the study will include all the participants enrolled in ICAC-01 with dust mite-, cockroach- and/or alternaria-specific IgE levels within certain parameters.</detailed_description>
