	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of decitabine and FR901228 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine and FR901228, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. FR901228 may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving decitabine together with FR901228 may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine and FR901228 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, or Myeloproliferative Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of decitabine and FR901228 (depsipeptide) in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or myeloproliferative disease. II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 and FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 5 and 12 OR days 5, 12, and 19. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing complete remission for 1 year are removed from the study. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine and FR901228 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.</detailed_description>
