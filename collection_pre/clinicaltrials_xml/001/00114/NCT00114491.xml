	<brief_summary>Recent studies support the hypothesis that aortic stenosis (AS) develops due to atherosclerosis affecting the aortic valve endothelium. The study’s aim was to assess Rosuvastatin on the hemodynamic progression and inflammatory markers of AS by treating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in patients with AS according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) guidelines for one year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Recent retrospective studies support the hypothesis that statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Rosuvastatin on hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis by treating patients with aortic stenosis and elevated LDL-cholesterol for 18 months. Methods: We performed an open-label, prospective study evaluating 121 consecutive patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AVA≥ 1.0 cm2), (mean age 73.7±8.9 years; 57 men and 64 women), treated with and without Rosuvastatin according to the NCEP-ATPIII guidelines. Echocardiographic, serum lipid, and inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and every 6 months for 18 months.</detailed_description>
