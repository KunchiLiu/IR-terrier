	<brief_title>Effects of Walking Analysis on Surgical Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gait analysis testing has been used to assist orthopaedic surgeons in developing treatment plans for children with gait abnormalities, particularly children with cerebral palsy. Previous studies have shown that gait analysis testing significantly impacts surgical decision-making for these patients. However, no controlled studies have been done to determine whether gait analysis and the subsequent changes in surgical decision-making affect clinical outcomes. Consequently, the use of gait analysis in clinical practice remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of preoperative gait analysis on surgical outcomes in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy. Comparison: Surgery with information from gait analysis testing compared with surgery without information from gait analysis testing.</detailed_description>
