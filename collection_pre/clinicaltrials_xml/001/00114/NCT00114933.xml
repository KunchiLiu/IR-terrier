	<brief_summary>Lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy may maintain virologic suppression in patients who have been undetectable for six months while on triple drug antiretroviral therapy. Lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics might prevent resistance development in patients who experience virological rebound after single-drug simplification.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"OK 2004 Study" (Only Kaletra 2004 Study): Study to Evaluate Suspending Nucleosides From Triple-Drug Therapy in HIV Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Study Objective: Efficacy and durability of switching to lopinavir/ritonavir single-drug HAART compared to maintaining therapy based on lopinavir/ritonavir and two nucleosides Secondary Study Objective(s): - Safety (related drug AEs/SAEs and laboratory anomalies G3/4) through 48 w. - Resistance profile on patients with sustained virological failure - QOL comparing stopping nucleosides versus continuing therapy - Pharmaco-economic analysis comparing treatment cost between the 2 study arms. - Predicting factors of failure in the stopping nucleosides arm Subject Population: 200 patients Study Design: RANDOMIZATION: Patients are randomized (1:1) either to continue under the same treatment or stop nucleosides as follows: - Stopping nucleosides arm: Lopinavir/r alone. - Continuing arm: Lopinavir/r + 2 NRTIs STUDY PROCEDURES: A baseline HIV-RNA, CD4 and routine labs will be collected if the most recent results are not collected within the 4 weeks prior entering the study. Patients will be followed for HIV-RNA (and CD4) at w1, w4, w8, w16, w24, w 36 and w48. After w48, durability of response to lopinavir/r single-drug therapy will be studied long-term (up to w96). Routine hematology and clinical chemistry (including fasting triglycerides and cholesterol, total and HDL/LDL ratio) will be measured at w4, w16, w24, w 36 and w48. A central laboratory will be used for HIV-RNA determinations and to archive plasma/cell samples for further genotype test in case of rebound. Treatment adherence will be followed with a self-patient report questionnaire (GEEMA study) All AEs will be collected if suspected relation (possible or probable) to any concomitant ARV drug, and SAEs, related or not, reported within 24h.</detailed_description>
