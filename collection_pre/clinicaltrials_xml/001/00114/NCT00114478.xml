	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see which of the two most common drugs used to treat bronchiolitis works better. A child's participation in this study is expected to last less than 4 hours. Approximately 600 patients will be recruited to participate in this study at Kern Medical Center (KMC). Bronchiolitis is a very common lung infection in babies. There are many drugs used to treat this disease but nobody knows which one, if any, works the best. Two of the most commonly used drugs are albuterol and epinephrine. These are both drugs given during breathing treatments with oxygen and a mask. We are doing this study to see which of these drugs works better or if they are both equally good. The study works as follows: after the consent process the baby gets three treatments. - Nebulizer 1 (Treatment) - Treatment + 30 minutes (approximately) Nebulizer 2 - Treatment + 60 minutes (approximately) Nebulizer 3 - Treatment + 120 minutes (approximately) The baby will be reevaluated and either discharged home or revert to standard therapy. If the baby is discharged directly from the emergency department (E.D.), we will call you in three days time to see how he/she is doing.</brief_summary>
