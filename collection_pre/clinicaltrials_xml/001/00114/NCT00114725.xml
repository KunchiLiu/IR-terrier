	<brief_summary>Laser-assisted intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been suggested as a more effective alterative to conventional ICSI when this method of insemination is indicated for patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Laser-assisted ICSI differs from conventional ICSI in that a laser is used to drill a small hole through the hard outer coating surrounding an egg before the injection needle containing a single sperm is inserted into the egg. The hole eliminates compression of the egg that normally occurs with conventional ICSI, and thus may reduce the chance of damage. Laser-assisted ICSI is hypothesized to result in increased egg survival, and perhaps improved embryo quality, compared to conventional ICSI.</brief_summary>
