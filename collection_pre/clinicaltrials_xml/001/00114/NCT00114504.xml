	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether FDG-PET is capable of detecting atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and monitoring the effects of statins on plaque inflammation. The usefulness of FDG-PET in risk stratification is also investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection of Plaque Inflammation by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-Effects of Simvastatin on Plaque Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays a role in progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. However, currently, no non-invasive method is available for detecting plaque inflammation in clinical practice. FDG-PET can visualize activated metabolic levels of not only tumor cells but also inflammatory cells. Thus, it is possible that FDG-PET can detect atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and that, if so, FDG-PET can monitor the direct effect of statins on plaque inflammation. Additionally, monitoring the plaque inflammation by FDG-PET may be useful for determining the risk stratification of atherosclerotic patients. Originally, we sought to compare patients with FDG-positive plaque with patients with plaque but not with FDG uptake, patients with FDG-positive plaque receiving statin therapy, and patients with FDG-positive plaque receiving diet management therapy. However, because patient number enrolled in the study was too small, the comparison was performed between FDG-positive patients with and without any statin therapy.</detailed_description>
