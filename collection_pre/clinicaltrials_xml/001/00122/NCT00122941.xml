	<brief_summary>Micronutrient deficiencies are common in HIV infected children and are aggravated by poor nutrition, especially in poor resource countries such as Uganda. It appears that micronutrient deficiencies contribute to immune dysfunction, increased morbidity and HIV disease progression. Hitherto, there has been no randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation on morbidity and mortality in HIV infected children in Africa. Therefore, the investigators shall carry out a randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation on morbidity, weight gain and mortality among HIV infected children aged 1 to 5 years in Uganda. Hypothesis: Daily administration of twice the recommended dietary allowance (2RDA) of multiple micronutrients to HIV infected children aged one to five years, for 6 months, will reduce all cause mortality from 24% to 14.4% in one year and result in a weight gain difference of 150 grams.</brief_summary>

A sample size of 373 was calculated assuming that the mortality risk in one year in HIV infected children is 24% (Barhane et al) and that this risk will be reduced to 14.4% in the intervention group (40% effect size) with 90% power and 95% confidence. Assuming a 10% attrition rate (38 study participants), the final sample size in each group is 411.</detailed_description>
