	<brief_summary>It is probable that a mucosal approach is necessary for a prophylactic HIV vaccine protecting against sexually transmitted infection. Mucosal immune responses have been almost non-existent in trials of HIV vaccine candidates in which the antigen was delivered systemically. This study will test the safety and immune response of a recombinant HIV-1gp160 by nasal and mucosal routes alone or formulated with DC-Chol in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Itâ€™s probable that a mucosal approach is necessary for prophylactic HIV vaccine protecting against sexually transmitted infection. Although mucosal immune responses have been almost non-existent in trials of HIV vaccine candidates in which the antigen was delivered systematically. Several animal models have also demonstrated the importance or a mucosal IgA response for protection against viral infections. Mucosal S IgA are essential effectors having different mechanisms of action agglutination of pathogens, interaction with cellular receptor, transcytosis of immune complexes, intracellular clearance of virus. Gp 160 induces the majority of neutralizing Abs activity in patients serum and the immunogenicity of gp 160 can be improved by using and adjuvant such as DC-chol because of its properties to increase the permeation of the nasal epithelium and to facilitate systemic delivery of the vaccine antigen. Before beginning mucosal vaccine trial, we previously tested and validated procedures to collect and process secretion fluids on 6 HIV-1 infected women (K. Petitprez et al, 4th European mucosal immunology group meeting, Lyon France, 8-10 october 2004).</detailed_description>
