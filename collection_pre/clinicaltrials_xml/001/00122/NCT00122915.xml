	<brief_summary>The CONCEPT study has been designed to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS) with a new cortical lead (circular lead, eight electrodes, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, USA) in the treatment of intractable neuropathic pain, in particular for central post-stroke pain (CPSP) and trigeminal neuropathic pain (TGN)/facial pain.</brief_summary>
