	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to prove the efficacy of peginterferon in HIV infected patients with liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) when the treatment to eradicate the virus failed. This scientific proof needs a comparative study to be done including two groups of patients randomly allocated: one with the treatment (peginterferon) and the other without any treatment against HCV with a duration of 2 years. To conclude, two liver biopsies are needed; one before the study and a second 2 years after.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pegylated Interferon on Liver Fibrosis in Co-infected Patient With HIV and Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>C hepatitis in HIV infected patient becomes a major issue although the survival of patients, has improved in the last decades regarding to the advent of HAART, the mortality related to liver disease has increased in this population. Sustained virological response for HCV can be obtained with peg-interferon and ribavirin treatment but more or less 50% of patients experienced failure to this treatment and liver fibrosis due to HCV infection progress and may lead to cirrhosis and hepato-carcinoma. To demonstrate the efficacy of peginterferon therapy to reduce the liver damage causes by HCV infection, a randomised controlled study is needed comparing one group of patient treated by peginterferon and one group without any treatment against HCV infection. In order to show 30% difference between the two groups in reducing one point of fibrosis score (METAVIR scale), 150 patients are needed. The duration of the study is 96 weeks</detailed_description>
