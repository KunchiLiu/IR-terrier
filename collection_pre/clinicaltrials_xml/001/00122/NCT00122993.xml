	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a two-year multi-component environmental intervention to prevent weight gain among city bus drivers at four bus garages. It is hypothesized that transit employees in the intervention garages will gain less weight compared to the transit employees in the control garages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Worksite Program to Prevent Weight Gain Among Bus Drivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Environmental influences that support less healthful food choices and sedentary behaviors have contributed to the epidemic increase in overweight and obesity among U.S. adults. Worksite settings are an effective channel through which to reach adults with interventions designed to prevent excess weight gain and obesity. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This study will implement and evaluate a multi-component environmental intervention to prevent excess weight gain among 1200 bus drivers working in four garages in a major metropolitan area. Four garages will be randomized to the intervention or control group for a two-year period. The environmental interventions are based on a social ecological framework and target four worksite environmental areas: 1) food availability and incentives; 2) physical activity opportunities and incentives; 3) the social environment; and 4) media/promotion related to health food choices, physical activity, and body weight.</detailed_description>
