	<detailed_description>This study uses 2x2 design to test external beam radiotherapy (46 Gy in 23 daily fractions) with and without HDR brachytherapy (2 fractions of 9 Gy versus 4 fractions of 7 Gy) with and without weekly Cisplatin (40 mg/sqm) The overall objective was to test the clinical outcome and toxicity of a resource-sparing schedule of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy treatment for cervix cancer, to detect molecular markers that will predict tumor control/resistance and to establish whether E6 and E7 viral proteins predict cellular radiosensitivity in oxic and hypoxic conditions in vitro and tumor control/resistance in vivo. A new component of the CRP was added, for which the objective is to optimize the data capture, provide more details of normal tissue outcomes following cancer treatments in developing countries and validate this approach using patients participating in the ongoing CRP. This will be achieved by exploring data capture using the questionnaire template on a computer in face-to-face interviews ("active" data collection) and comparing it with standard data collection obtained from the clinical notes ("passive" data collection) during the still ongoing CRP E3.30.24. The method of data collection will be chosen at random for each case stratified by centre. The reason for using an ongoing CRP is that it will test the usefulness of the new method and validate it in a multicentre study. During the performance of the new CRP, the same institutions as for E3.30.24 will be engaged.</detailed_description>

Adequate renal function: creatinine &lt; 1.2 mg/dL or 120 μmol/l (urinary diversion is permitted). Electrolytes and calcium within normal limits for institution. Liver function tests if clinically indicated. Tests have to be obtained within 30 days before registration. Expected good compliance for followup. Written informed consent for participation in this study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Recent malignancy, other than the index cervical carcinoma or nonmelanoma cutaneous cancers, diagnosed within 5 years of entry Life expectancy &lt;6 months, for any reason other than the index cervical carcinoma Any severe medical ailment, continuing pregnancy, or breast feeding, as conditions that interfere in present treatment Previous chemotherapy in past 1 year Severe psychiatric disorder, making compliance and followup difficult. Paraaortic nodes (PAN &gt;1 cm), suspicious or positive for metastatic involvement on radiological imaging. (Note: patients with positive pelvic lymph nodes are still eligible for the study, but they cannot have suspicious or positive PAN.) Bilateral hydronephrosis Prior radiation to the pelvis</criteria>
