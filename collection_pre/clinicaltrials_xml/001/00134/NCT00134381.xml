	<brief_title>Green Tea and Ultraviolet Light-induced Skin Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate if topically applied constituents of green tea [caffeine or (-) - epigallocatechin gallate; EGCG] have a protective effect on skin exposed to ultraviolet light (UV). In the double-blinded study all subjects will receive 311 nanometer UVB light at a dose that is 0.5-1.5X their individual minimal erythema dose (MED). One part of the experiment will involve applying a topical natural product (caffeine or EGCG) and placebo to bilateral symmetric sites. The natural product and the placebo will be applied immediately after and at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 25 hours, and 27 hours after exposure to a 0.5-1.5 MED dose of UV light. Another part of the study involves performing skin biopsies. One will be done prior to UVB exposure, 2 will be done at 24 hours and 2 more will be done at 48 hours.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The subjects will be normal adult volunteers who are 18 to 65 years of age. Subjects who drink more than two cups of coffee, tea, or caffeinated soda/beverages per day. Subjects who are unable to get an erythemic response (i.e., a sunburn).</criteria>
