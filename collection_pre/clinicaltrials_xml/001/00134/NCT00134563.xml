	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to determine the effect of teriflunomide on the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Secondary objectives were: - to evaluate the effect of teriflunomide on the accumulation of disability as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS], the burden of disease as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] and patient-reported fatigue; - to evaluate the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Teriflunomide in Reducing the Frequency of Relapses and Accumulation of Disability in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study period per participant was approximatively 128 weeks broken down as follows: - Screening period up to 4 weeks, - 108-week double-blind treatment period (approximatively 2 years)*, - 16-week post-treatment elimination follow-up period. '*' Participants successfully completing the week 108 visit were offered the opportunity to enter the optional long-term extension study LTS6050 - NCT00803049.</detailed_description>
