	<brief_title>Study of Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine in Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive both gemcitabine and vinorelbine once a week for two weeks and then one week with no chemotherapy (1 cycle equals 21 days). Gemcitabine and vinorelbine will be administered on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle. Blood tests will be performed on each day chemotherapy is administered. A CT scan will be done after every 2 cycles (approximately every 6 weeks) to determine the effects of the chemotherapy on the sarcoma. A physical exam will be performed at the start of chemotherapy and at least every three weeks thereafter. Patients will remain on this study as long as the disease does not progress or there are no unacceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
