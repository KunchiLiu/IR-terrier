	<criteria>angiographic evidence of coronary atherosclerosis Women who are pregnant or lactating, or planning to become pregnant. Subjects with a clinically indicated need for statin (HMGCoA reductase inhibitor) therapy other than atorvastatin or other concomitant therapy with known lipid altering effects on LDLC and HDLC including fibrates and nicotinic acid. Subjects taking any drugs known to be associated with an increased risk of myositis in combination with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors. Subjects with any other medical condition or laboratory abnormality which could affect subject safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render unlikely that the subject would complete the study.</criteria>
