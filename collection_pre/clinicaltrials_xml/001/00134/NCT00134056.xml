	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan are more effective than docetaxel and prednisone in treating prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan to see how well they work compared to docetaxel and prednisone in treating patients with stage IV prostate cancer and bone metastases that did not respond to previous hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0421, Docetaxel and Prednisone With or Without Atrasentan in Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer and Bone Metastases That Did Not Respond to Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the survival and progression-free survival of patients with hormone-refractory stage IV prostate cancer and bone metastases treated with docetaxel and prednisone combined with either atrasentan vs placebo. Secondary - Compare pain progression of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of these regimens in these patients. - Compare the quality of life, in terms of palliation of metastatic bone pain and improvement in functional status, of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare objective response in patients with measurable disease treated with these regimens. - Determine whether a 30% reduction in PSA and the slope of PSA from baseline to 3 months is a surrogate marker for survival in patients treated with these regimens. - Correlate PSA progression with clinical progression and death in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease progression (measurable or non-measurable disease progression vs prostate-specific antigen progression only), use of bisphosphonates at study entry (yes vs no), worst pain, measured by the Brief Pain Inventory "pain" scale (&lt; grade 4 vs ≥ grade 4), and extraskeletal metastases (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive oral atrasentan and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses. Patients with stable or responding disease after course 12 may register for continued oral atrasentan treatment for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression* or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel and prednisone as in arm I. Patients also receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeat every 21 days for up to 12 courses. Patients with stable or responding disease after course 12 may register for continued oral placebo treatment for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression* or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Patients with PSA progression alone will be allowed to continue treatment Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before courses 4, 7, and 10, and then after completion of study treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 3 years from study entry. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 930 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.</detailed_description>
