	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Root Length Measurements Using Intraoral Scan and Panoramic Radiographs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoral digital scans will be taken on patients who have completed orthodontic treatment, and measurements will be made on the crown dimensions. These dimensions will then be applied onto the same teeth as seen on panoramic radiographs and a mathematical relationship will be determined for root length. Changes in root length will be measured from initial records to treatment complete panoramic radiographs and these estimates will be compared to actual root length changes as measured in CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) records.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject has initial records including CBCT scan and panoramic radiograph that are clear. Subject must have no restorations or significant loss in tooth structure in target teeth or teeth adjacent to target. Subjects who have records that are not clear, and who are missing target teeth.</criteria>
