	<brief_summary>Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in industrialized countries. ST elevated acute myocardial infarction is one of its most frequent and deadly manifestation. In the last 20 years, STEMI mortality has been reduced by 50% with the advent of timely reperfusion (primary percutaneous intervention) and significant progression in pharmacologic intervention. However, death and heart failure incidence after STEMI remain elevated: up to 20% at one year. Also, therapeutic management following international guidelines is standardized toward a "one-size fits all" therapeutic management. In order to continue improving myocardial infarction outcomes, there is a need to better understand and individualize therapeutic targets such myocardial reperfusion injury, post reperfusion inflammation, adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling …. This knowledge will allow us to propose new therapeutic strategies and in the long run strive towards personalized medicine. The aim objective of this cohort of STEMI patients is to identify new biological markers of injury and prognosis.</brief_summary>
