	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this proposal is to implement a smartphone application (app) + population management system to monitor rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity between scheduled physician office visits. The population management system includes: 1) a web-based dashboard that consolidates incoming patient-reported data using pre-programmed algorithms to identify increases in disease activity, and 2) the population manager, a trained individual who monitors the web-based dashboard and connects patients with their HCPs. The investigators central hypothesis is that the combined smartphone app + population management system will improve patient satisfaction and management of RA disease activity.</brief_summary>
