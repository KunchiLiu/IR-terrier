	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory disease and musculoskeletal pain is one of the most common symptoms. This study will investigate whether transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve will decrease lupus musculoskeletal pain. This study will additionally investigate the biologic effects of vagus nerve stimulation on inflammation. It will be the first clinical study using one of the body's own pathways of modulating the immune system and inflammatory response, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, in SLE.</brief_summary>

Active infection including hepatitis B or hepatitis C at baseline, 15. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the subject's safety following exposure to a study intervention, 16. Pregnancy or lactation, 17.
