	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic qualities of lung ultrasonography to monitor the position of the intubation probe. The primary assessment criterion is of study the position of the intubation probe with two examinations carried out independently : - sonography - chest radiography A correct position of the intubation probe will be considered if there is : - Highlighting of the extremity of the intubation probe in endo tracheal - Highlighting bilateral lung sliding</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oesophageal intubation can cause death. Selective intubation can induce a poor ventilation, hypoxemia, atelectasis etcâ€¦ It's not rare in paediatric intubation. The prevalence of malposition of endotracheal tube is 30 to 40% in babies and infants less than 1 year old. Currently doctors try to detect malposition of intra-tracheal tube by auscultation and capnograms and chest radiography is needed to confirm it. The Chest X ray is the gold standard. The aim of the study is to confirm the good positioning of the tube with a lung ultrasonography. After each intra-tracheal intubation, for patients with qualifying criteria, a lung ultrasonography will be performed, in bed, by two trained doctors (senior and junior) to determine if the position is right. Then, the chest radiography will be performed as usual.</detailed_description>
