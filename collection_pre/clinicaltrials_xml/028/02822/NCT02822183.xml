	<brief_title>Online Survey of Clinicians to Learn About Their Interpretation of Capnography Waveforms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The capnography waveforms presented were originally collected from patients in various clinical settings, with patients both intubated and non-intubated. The de-identified waveforms are presented along with a statement about whether the patients were intubated or not, the amount of supplemental oxygen provided, and in some cases, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the blood (SpO2). The participants are asked to provide a score between 1 and 10 to indicate their interpretation of the wellbeing of the patient. The participants are also asked to provide up to two sentences of text to describe their interpretation of the patient condition based on the information provided.</detailed_description>
