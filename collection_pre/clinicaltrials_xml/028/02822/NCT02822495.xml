	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter expanded access protocol to provide human leukocyte antigen (HLA) partially-matched third-party allogeneic EBV-CTLs for the treatment of EBV-associated viremia and disease for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to treat the patient's disease or condition. Patients must not be eligible to enroll in clinical trials designed to support the development and marketing approval of Atara EBV-CTLs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Allogeneic EBV-CTLs in EBV-Associated Viremia or Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter expanded access protocol to provide human leukocyte antigen (HLA) partially-matched third-party allogeneic EBV-CTLs for the treatment of EBV-associated viremia and disease for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to treat the patient's disease or condition. Patients must not be eligible to enroll in clinical trials designed to support the development and marketing approval of Atara EBV-CTLs. Allogeneic third-party EBV-CTL will be selected for the patient from the bank of available EBV-CTL cell product lots based on having a partial HLA match and having an appropriate HLA restriction shared between the EBV-CTL donor and the patient's EBV associated viremia/disease or the patient, as appropriate for the disease setting. EBV-CTLs will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle, patients will receive intravenous (IV) EBV-CTLs on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by an observation period to complete a 35-day cycle.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Any of the following diagnoses of EBVassociated disease: 1. EBV+ posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT) 2. EBVassociated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) associated with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency 3. EBVassociated lymphomas and LPDs not associated with immunodeficiency (biopsy required) (eg, EBV+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the elderly) 4. Other EBVassociated malignancies (biopsy required) including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, EBV+ gastric cancer, EBV+ leiomyosarcoma 5. EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 6. Persistent EBV viremia 2. Evidence of EBV positivity as follows: 1. Biopsy showing EBV+ disease (strongly recommended unless required, as noted in criterion #1), OR 2. A combination of circulating EBV DNA AND radiographic appearance consistent with an EBV+ malignancy, if biopsy is not clinically feasible, unless required per criterion #1, OR 3. For EBV viremia only, fulfillment of inclusion criteria 1f 3. Availability of appropriate HLA partiallymatched and restricted EBVCTLs 4. No other approved alternative therapies available for treatment of EBV+ viremia/disease 5. Not eligible for any other trials supporting development of Atara EBVCTLs 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 3 for patients aged &gt; 16 years; Lansky score ≥ 20 for patients ≤ 16 years 7. For patients with PTLD in the alloHCT setting, the underlying disease for which alloHCT transplant was performed is in morphologic remission 8. Adequate organ function per the following (unless deemed to be caused by the underlying EBVdriven process which EBVCTLs are intended to treat, or its prior therapy): 1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/μL, with or without cytokine support 2. Platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL, with or without transfusion support; platelet count &lt; 50,000/μL but ≥ 20,000/μL, with or without transfusion support, is permissible if the patient has not had Grade ≥ 2 bleeding in the prior 6 months (where grading of the bleeding is determined per the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 4.03). 3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5×ULN; values up to 5×ULN for ALT, AST, and/or total bilirubin are acceptable if the elevation is considered due to EBVassociated disease involvement of the liver 4. Creatinine &lt; 3×ULN 9. Patient or patient's representative is willing and able to provide written informed consent 1. Any investigational therapy received ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (coenrollment in a noninterventional study or a study for sample collection only is permitted) 2. Ongoing need for methotrexate or extracorporeal photopheresis; steroid doses &gt; 0.5 mg/kg, as prednisone equivalent, require discussion with the medical monitor 3. Need for vasopressor or ventilatory support, unless deemed to be caused by the EBVdriven process which EBVCTLs are intended to treat 4. Antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, or similar antiT cell antibody therapy, or T cell therapy (donor lymphocyte infusion, other cytotoxic T lymphocytes) ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 5. Pregnancy, except when, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor, the risk/benefit of EBVCTL therapy favors proceeding 6. Female of childbearing potential or male with a female partner of childbearing potential unwilling to use a highly effective method of contraception 7. Inability to comply with study procedures</criteria>
