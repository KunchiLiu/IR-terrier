	<brief_summary>Vitamin D has effects on many tissues, and hypovitaminosis D is frequent. In a French survey conducted among 1587 adults, vitamin D insufficiency (&lt;30ng/ml) has been reported in 80% of subjects, including 43% with moderate deficiency (&lt;20ng/ml) and 5% with severe deficiency (&lt;10ng/ml). Because of the possible consequences of hypovitaminosis D (osteomalacia in adults…), the number of vitamin D determination has increased ten-fold since 2005 in France, reaching 4.5 million € in 2011, and with it the costs for health insurance. However, there is currently no consensus on the strategy for detection, diagnosis and treatment of hypovitaminosis D. We propose to develop a predictive clinical score of hypovitaminosis D based on the accurate assessment of solar exposure, vitamin D intakes and hypovitaminosis D risk factors collected through a self-administered questionnaire.</brief_summary>
