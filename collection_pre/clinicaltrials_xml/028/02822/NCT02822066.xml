	<brief_summary>The pupose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for refractory neoplasms in liver and pancreas, the investigators used preoperative and postoperative US/CEUS/CT/MRI to assess lesions, and laboratory tests including the tumor markers to evaluate the general condition of patients. Intraoperative US/CEUS/CT would be applied to monitor ablation lesions.</brief_summary>
