	<brief_summary>QUTENZA® is a skin patch with a high concentration of capsaicin (8%) which is the component responsible for spicy peppers. QUTENZA® is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic adults either alone or in combination with other analgesics. Acute pain experienced during and after the procedure can be relieved by local cooling methods and oral analgesics but the pain remains intense. The hypothesis is that hypnosis via a standardized hypnotic message would increase the local tolerance of the treatment when applying the patch QUTENZA®. To date, there are no studies that can confirm or refute this hypothesis.</brief_summary>
