	<brief_summary>This single-institution prospective randomized clinical trial will be performed at the Gynecologic Oncology clinic of Ankara University. Patients with endometrial cancer and cervix cancer who will be operated for staging via laparoscopic approach will be included in the study. The included patients will be randomized to two groups before surgery. During the operation of first group instruments with advanced bipolar energy will be used during lymphadenectomy and hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. In the second group the operation will be performed by conventional bipolar energy forceps. The outcome parameters to be measured are intra-operative bleeding, duration of operation, intraoperative complications, postoperative pain score, postoperative complications, postoperative duration of hospitalization, late complications such as lymphocele formation and costs.</brief_summary>
