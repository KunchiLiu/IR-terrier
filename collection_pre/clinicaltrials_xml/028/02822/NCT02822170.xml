	<brief_summary>The purpose of this small pilot study is to refine a combined intervention of IV amino acids and cycle ergometry in critically ill patients, and to gather preliminary data, before proceeding with a larger multi-center RCT. A total of 10 patients will receive the combined intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. &gt;=18 years old 2. Requiring mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with actual or expected total duration of mechanical ventilation or HFNC &gt;48 hours 3. Expected ICU stay &gt;4 days after enrollment (to permit adequate exposure to the proposed intervention) 1. &gt;120 continuous hours of mechanical ventilation or HFNC before enrollment 2. Expected death or withdrawal of lifesustaining treatments within 7 days from enrollment 3. No expectation for any nutritional intake within the subsequent 72 hours 4. Severe chronic liver disease (MELD score &gt;20) or acute fulminant hepatitis. 5. Documented allergy to the amino acid intervention 6.
