	<brief_title>Non-interventional Study of Moderate to Severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-interventional study to determine the rate of control of disease activity in moderate to severe IBD participants. The study will enroll approximately 400 patients. This multicenter trial will be conducted in Brazil. Retrospective data of previous IBD treatments (drug, dose, treatment duration, drug changes), and use of other health resources related with the management of IBD for previous three years will be collected. Prospective data will be collected for a period of 12 months in participants with active disease. UC participants, with no or light disease activity at Day 1 will not continue to 12-month follow up. CD participants, with no or light disease activity at Day 1 but with colonoscopy or calprotectin levels (i.e, calprotectin &gt;200 ug/g) in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of activity will progress to 12-month follow up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female. 2. 18 years or older (at the time of diagnosis of moderate to severe UC or CD). 3. Diagnosis of moderate to severe CD or UC for at least 6 months prior to Day 1 appointment according the clinical or endoscopic criteria. 4. Has provided the written informed consent. For the prospective period, eligible participants should present at least one of the following criteria that will only be applied at Day 1: 5. For CD participants: Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) ≥8 or Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 or Considering that for CD participants, the disease activity may not be clearly documented only with clinical data, some objective criteria may be considered as entry criteria for the 12month prospective period: Colonoscopy in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of activity or, Calprotectin levels in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of activity (i.e, calprotectin &gt;200 µg/g). 6. For UC: partial Mayo Score ≥5. Note : Patients with colostomy and prospective period: Although clinical scales defined above are impacted by colostomy these patients will not be excluded from the protocol to ensure the assessment of different clinical presentations of the IBD. In addition, patients with colostomy must follow the same criteria as above to be eligible to the prospective phase. 1. Indeterminate or not classified colitis. 2. Current or previous participation in interventional clinical trial (within the last 3 years). In addition, for the 12month prospective period, participants will be excluded if: 3. Presenting mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate understanding or cooperation. 4. Hospitalized participants at Day 1. 5. Current off label treatment with Vedolizumab. Study Discontinuation Criteria It will be considered a premature termination the situation in which the subject discontinues the participation, i.e. they are withdrawn from the study before completing the 12 months of follow up period (365 days ± 14 days from Day 1), due to any of the reasons listed below: 1. Withdrawal of consent: subjects who for any reason withdraw the free and informed consent; 2. Lost to followup (no return of the subject on the expected date of visit dropout from the protocol); 3. Death; 4. Study termination; 5. Any situation that places the subject within one of the exclusion criteria. Note: Patients who are eligible for the prospective period, it means, with active disease at Day 1 but who during the 12 months period presents disease remission and/or no activity disease condition, are allowed to continue the participation in the study.</criteria>
