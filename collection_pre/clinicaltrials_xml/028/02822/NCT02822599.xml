	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to determine whether the use of Human Fibrinogen Concentrate (RiaSTAP) will decrease the need for component blood therapy in neonates and infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. RiaSTAP will be administered after termination of Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) at a dose of 70 mg/kg, in a prospective, randomized, controlled study. We hypothesize that the administration of RiaSTAP in this manner will reduce peri-operative bleeding and transfusion requirements.</detailed_description>
