	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test the clinical effectiveness of IOE tube using individually customized 3-dimentional printed guiding tube as an alternative to Levin tube feeding when unconscious patients have no choice but tube feeding.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Oro-Esophageal Tube Feeding Using Individually-Customized 3-Dimensional Printing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to standard Guideine of videofluoroscopic swallow study(VFSS), Patients referred to dysphagia(swallowing dysfunction)who were required to tube feeding and medically stable of vital sign, and agreed to participate. Participants with swallowing dysfunction who were classified into three groups (nasogastric tube, traditional intermittent (IOE) tube, individual 3D printed guiding tube) according to VFSS. Both traditional IOE tube and individual 3D printed guiding tube groups will receive training about procedure prior to the first feeding. All participants will be evaluated with satisfaction for tube feeding (EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35) in 3 days from the start day of the tube feeding. On the day of oral feeding, participants will be evaluated with the questionnaires and clinical examination. If the participant is discharged in a state maintain the tube feeding, investigated further length stay at leaving the hospital. On the 1 month, 3 month from tube feeding, the investigators will follow-up and measure the questionnaires and clinical examination.</detailed_description>
