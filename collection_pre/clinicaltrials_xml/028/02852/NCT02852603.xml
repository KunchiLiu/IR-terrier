	<brief_summary>Mortality of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) remains high because of the huge blood lost from the aorta. Questions about the potentially genetic effects on sporadic TAAD are raised by researchers to explore the possible mechanisms leading to sporadic TAAD and to establish new clinical approaches to prevent TAAD-caused adverse clinical outcomes. This study is intended to collect the gene information in sporadic TAAD patients and to explore the relationship between genetic variation and the incidence of sporadic TAAD for further study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Genetically Affected Sporadic Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a critical clinical condition partly due to the rupture of aortic aneurysm. Mostly, surgical treatment can reduce the symptoms and extend life span of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). However, mortality of TAAD remains high because of the huge blood lost from the aorta. Sporadic TAAD was considered to be a server consequence of hypertension, though most patients with hypertension won't have TAAD as their final outcomes. Previous studies have revealed the associations between genetic abnormalities and familial TAAD, and genetic tests have applied to assist the diagnosis of certain TAAD. Therefore, the potentially genetic effects on sporadic TAAD are explored by researchers to understand the possible mechanisms leading to sporadic TAAD and to establish new clinical approaches to prevent TAAD-caused adverse clinical outcomes. This study is intended to collect the gene information in sporadic TAAD patients and to explore the relationship between genetic variation and the incidence of sporadic TAAD for further study.</detailed_description>
