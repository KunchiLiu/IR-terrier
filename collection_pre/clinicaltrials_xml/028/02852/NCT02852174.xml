	<brief_title>The Veteran Caregiver Reducing Stress Time (VetCareReST) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent estimates indicate that there are 275,000 to one million informal veteran caregivers. Caring for a disabled adult, particularly those with long-lasting impairment, has been associated with elevated levels of stress, depression and anxiety among caregivers. Veteran caregivers are especially vulnerable because of competing demands. For instance, Post 9/11 veteran caregivers are more likely to be the spouse of a veteran, and have experienced the stress of multiple deployments, have a young child in their care, and work outside the home. Recent studies show that veteran caregivers experience higher levels of psychological distress than caregivers in the general population, highlighting the psychological needs of this population. One effective approach at reducing stress, depression and anxiety has been the use of mindfulness training, which has been shown to effectively reduce mood symptoms among professional caregivers. The Veteran Caregiver Reducing Stress Time (VetCareReST) is a randomized control trial designed to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness at reducing stress, depression and anxiety in veteran caregivers in Champaign and Danville County. This study builds on Dr. Lara-Cinisomo's (PI) experience with military spouses. The findings from this trial will serve as pilot data for a large-scale study.</detailed_description>
