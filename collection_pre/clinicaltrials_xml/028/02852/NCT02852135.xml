	<brief_summary>The LMA Proseal and LMA Supreme are the third generation of LMA with potential advantages over the classic LMA.Several publications have reported the successful, safe use of Laryngeal Mask Airway devices in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. However, there have been no studies that have examined the application of LMA in patients during lateral positioned laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy when LMA Proseal and LMA Supreme used in lateral positioned laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of LMA Proseal and LMA Supreme for Efficient Ventilation During Lateral Positioned Laparoscopic Surgeres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We undertook a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial.The patients were randomized to either LMA Proseal group or LMA Supreme group by computer generated allocation. The patients were scheduled for elective lateral positioned laparoscopic surgery, such as laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, laparoscopic renal cyst decortication (LRCD) or laparoscopic adrenalectomy.Inclusion criteria for the patients were: Aged&gt;18 years, ASA physical status grade I - Ⅲ and body mass index ≤30 kg.m-2. Exclusion criteria were: anticipated difficult airway (e.g., Modified Mallampati Class IV, oropharyngeal pathology), severe cardiopulmonary disease, increased risk of regurgitation and aspiration (e.g., gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and pregnant patients), and retroperitoneal laparoscopic procedures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patients belong to ASA physical status grade I and Ⅲ, aged above 18 years and body weight less than 30 kg/m2,who underwent elective laparoscopic urology surgery in the lateral position.
