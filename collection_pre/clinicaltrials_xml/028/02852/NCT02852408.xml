	<brief_title>Liver Cauterization Increases the Postoperative Pain After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has a three component: parietal, visceral and referring (shoulder) pain. Although intensities of them can be various, all of them affects the total pain together.
