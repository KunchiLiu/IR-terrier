	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD), frequent in PLHIV, is a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Micro-albuminuria is an early manifestation of CKD and a marker of vascular risk, notably affecting the small vessels. In the older general population microalbuminuria is associated with greater annual cognitive decline and has been proposed as an easily and inexpensive measured marker predicting future cognitive function decline. Ageing of the PLH leads to an increase of cognitive disorders and chronic renal failure incidence and could imply a common underlying mechanism affecting the renal and cerebral microvasculature. In this setting the investigators undertake this prospective, cross-sectional, case-control study to determine whether the presence of a microalbuminuria at least 5 years ago in PLHs with sustained good combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-controlled immunovirological parameters could be a marker predicting future cognitive impairment. They chose PLHs infected for at least 5 years and with cART-sustained immunovirological control for at least 1 year.</brief_summary>
