	<brief_summary>Red blood cell transfusion (RBC) is the main symptomatic treatment for severe anemia. RBC transfusion has proven its efficacy regarding mortality and morbidity, but it is not without side effects. The infectious side effects of transfusion are largely considered under control, non-infectious side effects are taking center stage. Seeking explanations for the beneficial and deleterious effects of RBC transfusions is necessary to ensure the safe and optimal use of this precious resource. The investigators aim to study the impact of donor and RBC characteristics on patient survival.</brief_summary>
