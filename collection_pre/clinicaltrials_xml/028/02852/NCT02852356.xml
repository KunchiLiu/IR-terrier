	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the MIRI-TL time-lapse incubator and CultureCoin dish compared to standard big-box incubators and standard culture dishes used for embryo culture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Study Using a Time-lapse Morphometry MIRI Imaging Incubator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following randomization and standard ovarian stimulation protocols to obtain a sufficient number of mature (MII) oocytes, these oocytes will be fertilized by Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). If a patient has been randomized to the study group, all inseminated oocytes and subsequently all fertilized diploid (2PN) zygotes will be placed in the CultureCoin and then into the MIRI-TL Time-lapse incubator and cultured as per normal protocol to the blastocyst stage (Day 5/6 or 7). Top quality blastocyst(s) will be transferred and monitored for implantation, pregnancy and ongoing birth. Embryo transfers will either occur in a fresh or frozen embryo transfer cycle.</detailed_description>
