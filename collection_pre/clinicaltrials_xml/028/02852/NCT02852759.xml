	<brief_summary>Insulin resistant volunteers will undergo an 8-week cold treatment, 2 hours per day, to selective regions of the body enriched with brown fat including neck, supraclavicular and interscapular regions) in combination with electroacupuncture (EA). Their insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid homeostasis will be measured. The brown fat activation will be determined by analyzing fat biopsy samples and/or positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT)-scans.</brief_summary>
