	<brief_title>The Effects of Scalp Block on Haemodynamic Response and Postoperative Pain in Posterior Fossa Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study 15 patients will receive scalp block with bupivacaine, 15 patients will receive local infiltration with bupivacaine and 15 patients will receive placebo before surgery. The haemodynamic response to head pin replacement and skin incision will be recorded. Postoperatively all patients will have a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device containing morphine (1 mg/ml) for analgesia. Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain evaluation, sedation scores, and also postoperative morphine consumption will be evaluated and recorded.</detailed_description>
