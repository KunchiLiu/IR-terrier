	<criteria>Other than renal impairment, subjects should be in good health as determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history, physical exam, and laboratory evaluations Subjects must have a BMI between 18.0 kg/m2 and 36 kg/m2, with a body weight of at least 50 kg and no more than 120 kg Additional criteria for renal impairment subjects: Subjects must have stable renal disease without evidence of renal progression in the past 28 days prior to dosing Additional criteria for healthy matched subjects: Matched to at least 1 renal impairment subject by race, age (+/10 years), gender and weight (+/10%) An absolute GFR of at least 90 ml/min Significant acute illness within the two weeks prior to dosing History or presence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history or presence of prolonged QTinterval syndrome History or current diagnosis of cardiac disease indicating significant risk of safety for subjects participating in the study such as uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within 5 years, regardless of where there is recurrence or metastases. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to dosing or evidence of such abuse as indicated by laboratory values at screening or baseline. Additional exclusion for renal impairment subjects: Severe albuminuria &gt; 300 mg/day. Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis. Subjects with renal impairment due to hepatic disease (hepatorenal syndrome).
