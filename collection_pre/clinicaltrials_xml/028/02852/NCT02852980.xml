	<brief_title>Estimate Rate of the Women Who Have Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is recognized that pregnant women who had gestational diabetes (DG) multiplied by 7 subsequent risk of developing type 2 diabetes and this during 25 years. There is at present no formal recommendation of the High Authority for Health (HAS) as an organization of a long term screening for those women. However the recommendations of CNGOF (French Council of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians) and SFD (French society of diabetes) recommend screening for type 2 diabetes after a gestational diabetes in the postnatal consultation. But today how many women views due to a gestational diabetes have realized their screening? It is likely that the rate of occurrence of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes is underestimated today. Otherwise it is possible that the occurrence of type 2 diabetes is associated with some risk factors such as high BMI, insulin therapy during pregnancy. Another interrogation is the role of the doctor to reduce the number of women who do not realize their screening at 3 months postpartum. Better awareness of the importance of long term monitoring would reduce the proportion of women who do not realize their screening.</detailed_description>
