	<brief_summary>Introduction: the physiological aging process induces several structural changes in the musculoskeletal system. These, in turn, result in functional changes that are reflected in the senescent dependency, determining the reduction in their quality of life. Power training has been identified as ideal to mitigate the effects of aging. However, there are indications that an intervention based on the potentiation of the stretch-shortening cycle action is a better choice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plyometric Training for Elderly Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study hypotheses: the participants of the proposed intervention will increase their bone mineral density, muscle volume, functional capacity and will show some improvement in their gait, as well as in their quality of life. Purposes: the main objective of this study was to propose a training model based in the potentiation of the stretch-shortening cycle action and assess its effects on selected parameters of musculoskeletal morphology, functional capacity and quality of life of elderly women.</detailed_description>
