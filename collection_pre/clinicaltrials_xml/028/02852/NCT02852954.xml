	<brief_summary>Immune system suppression effect of Progesterone Induced Blocking Factor(PIBF), it could be questionable whether tumor cells express PIBF for escape of immune system. There are some studies in the literature that evaluate PIBF expression of different malign cells (e.g. glioblastoma multiforme as a malign central nerve system, leukemia, astrocytoma as a primary brain tumor, lung cancer and chorionic carcinoma). According to previous studies PIBF has been used as an anti-tumor immune suppressor by tumor cells. There is no data about the PIBF expression of endometrial tumor cells. Therefore, the investigators aim to determine the PIBF expression levels in the endometrial cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Progesterone Induced Blocking Factor Expression Levels in Endometrial Cancer Cells.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This retrospective controlled study will be conducted at both Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics and Pathology clinics of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital. This study will be conducted with the use of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks immunohistochemically to determine the PIBF expression levels in the samples. There are three groups in this study; endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and normal endometrium and each of the groups contained 20 paraffin embedded blocks provided form the Pathology clinic of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital archives.</detailed_description>
