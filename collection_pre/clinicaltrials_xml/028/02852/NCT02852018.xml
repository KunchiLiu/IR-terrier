	<criteria>Patients implanted for primary prevention, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) single or double room, for severe cardiomyopathy (EF &lt;35%) Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. "Appropriate treatment" group: patients who had a rhythmic event (before or after inclusion) appropriately treated either by administering an electric shock or by antiarrhythmic stimulation Group "no event" patients who have never received treatment or electrical antiarrhythmic stimulation and with a minimum followup of three years before inclusion and did not receive proper treatment during the follow up period of the study Patients implanted with an ICD for primary prevention in the context of a family hereditary disease (long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia catecholergic right ventricular dysplasia ...). Patients with left ventricular function greater than 35%. Patients implanted with a defibrillator function resynchronization. Patients minors, adults under guardianship and protected persons are eligible under this project.</criteria>
