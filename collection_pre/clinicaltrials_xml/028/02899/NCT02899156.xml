	<brief_summary>Delirium within the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with poor outcomes such as increased mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and time on mechanical ventilation. Benzodiazepine (BZD) exposure is an independent risk factor for development of delirium. Reversal of hypoactive delirium represents a potential opportunity for reducing duration of delirium and subsequent complications. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of critically ill adult patients with benzodiazepine-associated hypoactive delirium. The hypothesis is that flumazenil continuous infusion reverses hypoactive delirium associated with BZD toxicity and thereby reduces duration of delirium and ICU LOS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flumazenil for Hypoactive Delirium Secondary to Benzodiazepine Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benzodiazepines are commonly used for discomfort, anxiety, agitation, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in the ICU. End organ dysfunction and extended exposure can increase the risk of complications associated with BZDs, which include increased ICU LOS, time on mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Flumazenil as a 1, 4-imidazobenzodiazepine is a competitive antagonist for the benzodiazepine binding site with weak intrinsic or partial agonistic activity on the GABA receptor. Multiple studies have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of flumazenil for the reversal of sedation. Pilot studies have demonstrated safe reversal of over-sedation and statistically significant improvements in patient cooperation and time to extubation. The current standard for suspected BZD-associated hypoactive delirium is cessation of benzodiazepine administration and supportive care. The role of continuous infusion flumazenil for rapid and sustained reversal of hypoactive delirium in the ICU has not been evaluated prospectively and therefore remains poorly defined.</detailed_description>
