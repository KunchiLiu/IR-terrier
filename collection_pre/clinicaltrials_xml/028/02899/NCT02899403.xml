	<brief_summary>In the perspective to better evaluate the efficacy of new treatment strategies for Alzheimer disease (AD), it appears important to develop experimental paradigms to precisely measure cognitive endpoints/biomarkers that may be used in healthy volunteers as tools to validate drug efficacy profile. The use of Electroencephalography (EEG) may be, therefore, a good candidate. The purpose of the present study is to use EEG to more precisely explore cognitive processes in healthy subjects, with a particular interest in episodic and working memory functions that are usually altered in both AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as well as to better understand underlying neural mechanisms involved in these processes.</brief_summary>
