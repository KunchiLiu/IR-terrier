	<brief_title>Prophylactic Antibiotics in Comatose Survivors of Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postresuscitation management of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) significantly improved and "bundle of care" including therapeutic hypothermia, immediate coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and contemporary intensive care nowadays leads to survival with good neurological recovery. Benefit of prophylactic antibiotics, which may suppress development of postresuscitation infection and especially early onset pneumonia and thereby decrease the severity of postresuscitation systemic inflammatory response, is controversial. Because of these uncertainties, the investigators performed a single-center randomized clinical trial comparing prophylactic versus clinically-driven administration of antibiotics in comatose survivors of OHCA. The investigators hypothesized that prophylactic antibiotics may decrease the severity of postresuscitation systemic inflammatory response by reducing the incidence of postresuscitation infection and especially pneumonia which was further addressed by repeat microbiological sampling.</detailed_description>
