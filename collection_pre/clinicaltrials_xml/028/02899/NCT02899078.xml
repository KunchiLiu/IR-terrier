	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with previously-treated kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving Ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Previously-Treated Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess in a preliminary fashion the feasibility and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously-treated metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in patients with previously treated mRCC.</detailed_description>
