	<criteria>Patients were diagnosed with bone metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) per medical chart. Patients were at least 18 years of age as of the first diagnosis for mCRPC. Patients must have received at least one intravenous injection of Radium223 (Xofigo). First injection of Radium223 must have started between periods 1January2014 to 30June2014 or 15November2014 to present. Patients must have a minimum of 12 months documented followup records following last Radium223 treatment or death within 12 months of last dose.
