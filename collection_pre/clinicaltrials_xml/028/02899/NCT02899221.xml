	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give hyperthermia and high dose rate radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has come back after prior radiation treatment. Radiation therapy, such as high dose rate brachytherapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Hyperthermia therapy may make tumor cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Giving hyperthermia and high dose rate radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperthermia and High Dose Rate Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and feasibility of combined single fraction high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy followed immediately by interstitial hyperthermia treatment of radio-recurrent prostate cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess long-term toxicity. II. To provide a preliminary assessment of efficacy. III. To obtain blood for future analysis of immune response to combined radiation therapy and hyperthermia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% Expected survival of at least 3 years Informed consent signed by the subject Prostatespecific antigen (PSA) blood test within 60 days prior to registration Prostate biopsy within 180 days prior to registration No evidence of metastasis on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis within 90 days prior to registration; registration will occur after subject consent is obtained No evidence of metastasis on bone scan within 90 days prior to registration Within 60 days prior to registration, hematologic minimal values: absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm^3 Within 60 days prior to registration, hematologic minimal values: hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl Within 60 days prior to registration, hematologic minimal values: platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm^3 Men of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months after completion of treatment Histologically proven persistent or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate following prior external beam radiation therapy Concurrent disease patients under treatment for concurrent medical conditions will be eligible for protocol treatment if, in the opinion of the physician responsible for hyperthermia treatment that the concurrent medical condition will neither interfere with the process of the treatment or patient assessments nor add significantly to the risks or complications of the treatment History of urological surgery or procedures predisposing to genitourinary (GU) complications after radiation, i.e., anastomoses, stricture repair, transurethral resection, etc. (will be determined by radiation oncologist) Prior thermal ablative therapy for prostate cancer (e.g. highintensity focused ultrasound [HIFU] or cryoablation) Documented distant metastatic disease Patients not medically suitable for anesthesia Patient with other comorbidities that in the opinion of the treating physician would be a contraindication to protocol participation (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) Mental incompetence or criminal incarceration</criteria>
