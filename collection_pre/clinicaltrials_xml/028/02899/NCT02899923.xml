	<brief_summary>Autoimmune bullous dermatoses are a group of diseases with chronic course. They are provoked by the production of autoantibodies against the dermal-epidermal junction or against the inter-keratinocyte junctions, resulting in the formation of intra-epidermal or sub-epidermal blisters. The diagnosis of autoimmune bullous dermatoses is based on clinical and immunopathological findings, including skin direct immunofluorescence. Systemic corticosteroid therapy is generally considered as the mainstay of treatment for many years both for bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus which are the most frequent diseases.</brief_summary>
