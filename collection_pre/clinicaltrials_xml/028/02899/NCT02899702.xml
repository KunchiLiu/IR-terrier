	<criteria>Child/adolescent: 1 month &lt; Age &lt; 17 yearold, admitted to PICU with a strong suspicion of staphylococcal or streptococcal infection; at least one following criterion, with at least one following criteria: 1. Toxic Shock Syndrom as defined by Centre for Disease Control criteria 2. or group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis (positive streptest) 3. or varicella with infected lesions and rash or positive streptest 4. or erythrodermic rash in menstrual period 5. or pleuropneumonia with erythrodermic rash or positive streptest in pleural fluid 6. or erythrodermic rash and biological fluid positive to streptococcus A or staphylococcus (articular, pericardial, bronchopulmonary, pharynx) With shock resistant to fluid resuscitation, defined as existence, despite 40 ml/kg of fluid bolus within 1 hour, of: 1. hypotension (&lt; 5th percentile) 2. or systolic blood pressure &lt; 2 SD regarding age 3. or need for vasoactive drugs in order to maintain blood pressure at a normal level (dopamine &gt; 5µg/kg/min or dobutamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, milrinone whatever the dose) 4. or 2 signs of hypo perfusion among: 1. metabolic acidosis with base deficit &gt; 5 2. lactate x 2 normal laboratory value 3. diuresis &lt; 0,5 ml/kg/h 4. capillary refill time &gt; 5 sec 5.
