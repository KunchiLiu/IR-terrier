	<brief_summary>Ovarian cryopreservation is one of the available option for preserving fertility prior to potentially sterilizing treatments. In the absence of other techniques such as in vitro folliculogenesis or injection of isolated ovarian follicles, this tissue can only be re-used by autograft. In France, the first live birth after orthotopic ovarian transplantation, was obtained by Roux et al. in 2009. This clinical trial aims to collect data on the efficiency of the graft in terms of restoration of ovarian function and live births. It will also allow us to carry out the patient follow-up after ovarian tissue cryopreservation and after autograft when achieved. In cases of neoplastic malignancies, minimal residual disease detection will be performed on ovarian tissue, to avoid any risk of cancer re-seeding.</brief_summary>
