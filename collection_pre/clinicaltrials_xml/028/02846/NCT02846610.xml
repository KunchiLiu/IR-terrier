	<brief_title>Registry for Acute Pain Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NRA offers the systematic documentation of patient related and procedure related components for acute pain treatments during and after surgery. NRA collects preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data from treating physicians who complete a standard form. Data are collected concurrently with patient care by pain nurses or treating physicians and include detailed information about the medical conditions of patients having acute pain treatment along with the procedure and postoperative course. The registry provides the basis for large scale analyses and benchmarks for several parameters. The registry also aims at performing population-based research. Furthermore, its infrastructure allows for the conduct of prospective studies comparing the effectiveness of processes of care.</detailed_description>
