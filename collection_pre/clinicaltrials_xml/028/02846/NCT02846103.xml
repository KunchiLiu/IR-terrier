	<brief_summary>Increasing evidence suggests that immune responses might be a determining factor in lung cancer tumor progression. The impressive clinical responses obtained with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PDL-1, anti-CTLA-4) indicate that the presence of preexisting antitumor immune response is required for their efficacy and highlight the critical role of antitumor T cell immunity. Recent progress on the fields of tumor immunology underlines the critical role of CD4 helper 1 T lymphocyte (TH1) in the control of innate and adaptive anticancer immunity. Therefore, monitoring tumor specific TH1 response could be relevant in cancer patients. In order to monitor tumor-specific CD4 Th1 responses in most cancer patients, the investigators group have previously described novel promiscuous peptides (referred as UCP:Universal Cancer Peptides) derived from human telomerase (TERT), a prototype of shared tumor antigen. By using UCP-based immuno-assay, pre-existing UCP-specific Th1 responses have been detected in the blood of lung cancer patients (Telocap01). The frequency and magnitude of this response were inversely correlate to the disease stage. Furthermore, UCP-specific responses were significantly found in patients with low PD1+ and TIM3+ T cells. Then in TeloCap02 study, UCP specific Th1 immune responses will be evaluated in lung cancer before and after treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy).</brief_summary>
