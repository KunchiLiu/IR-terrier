	<criteria>Be positive for at least 1 of the following diabetesrelated autoantibodies obtained at study screening: Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), islet antigen 2 (IA2), zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies (ICA), or Insulin (if obtained within 10 days of the onset of exogenous insulin therapy) Have a peak stimulated Cpeptide level greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.2 picomole per milliliter (pmol/mL) following a 4hour Mixedmeal Tolerance Test (MMTT) obtained at study screening Be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [betahCG]) test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at the Week 0 visit Participants (or their legally acceptable representatives) are willing and able to adhere to requirements, prohibitions, and restrictions specified in this protocol Has a history of significant renal, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, or psychiatric disease or immune suppression or immune deficiency. Has significant cardiovascular disease, including history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina, abnormal electrocardiogram or abnormal stress test Has active infections, is prone to infections or has chronic, recurrent or opportunistic infectious disease, including but not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection (example [eg.], bronchiectasis), sinusitis, recurrent urinary tract infection (eg., recurrent pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis), Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, latent or active granulomatous infection, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis or an open, draining, or infected nonhealing skin wound or ulcer Has a clinically active infection with EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) or an EBV viral load &gt;=10,000 copies per 10^6 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) obtained at study screening. Has a clinically active infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or a CMV viral load &gt;= 10,000 copies per milliliter (mL) whole blood obtained at study screening Current or prior (within 30 days of screening) treatment that is known to cause a significant, ongoing change in the course of T1D or immunologic status, including highdose inhaled, extensive topical, or systemic glucocorticoids Has other autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [pJIA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], ankylosing spondylitis [AS], multiple sclerosis [MS], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) excluding clinically stable autoimmune thyroiditis whether treated or untreated Has any of the following tuberculosis [TB] screening criteria: A history of latent or active TB prior to screening (including but not limited to a positive QuantiFERON®TB Gold test), signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical examination, recent close contact with a person with known or suspected active TB Has known allergies, intolerance and/or hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin proteins, golimumab or any of its components or its excipients</criteria>
