	<brief_title>Single Agent and Combined Inhibition After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are: - To assess the safety of single-agent and combined checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk for post-transplant recurrence. - Safety endpoint: The composite endpoint consisting of the occurrence of at least one treatment-related limiting toxicity (after checkpoint inhibitor treatment is initiated) defined as a â‰¥ grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity as specified by the CTCAE. Exceptions listed in section 5.9 apply to this endpoint as well. If 3 of 7 patients in a single cohort experience a treatment-related limiting toxicity, that single cohort will be terminated. - Efficacy endpoint: To assess progression free survival at 12 and 18 months after initiation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk for post-transplant recurrence. The secondary objectives of this study are: - Determine the toxicities resulting from administration of the treatments - To assess blood immune reconstitution, phenotype and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire by sequencing to determine diversity and highest frequency clonal specificities: at screening for patients (at time of informed consent) and within 30 days before allogenic transplant conditioning; for donors, at apheresis (stem cell collection), and then serially for patients the day 1 of week 1 of checkpoint inhibitors and then weeks 4, 7, 12, 18 and 26, and at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months post-transplant and at time of relapse if it occurs within 18 months of check point inhibitor initiation. - To assess tumor site immune phenotype, TCR repertoire and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1/2) expression when bone marrow biopsy is available prior to allogeneic transplantation conditioning and then at time of relapse within 18 months following initiation of check point inhibitor therapy. - To assess complete response rate at 3, 6 and 12 months after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). - To identify specific intestinal microbial strains associated with improved outcome in allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors. The overall microbial composition in stool samples of patients will be analyzed at screening (up to 7 days post-consent), preconditioning (to be collected within 48 hours prior to transplant admission), at engraftment (within 48 hours of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500 on two sequential days), and then serially, on day 1 of week 1 (to be collected within 48 hours prior to clinic visit) and then weeks 4, 7, 12, 18, and 26 and 9, 12, 15 and 18 months post-transplant, and at time of relapse, as it occurs.</detailed_description>
