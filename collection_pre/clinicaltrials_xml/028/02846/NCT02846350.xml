	<detailed_description>Motivational Interviewing (MI) has primarily been utilized as a counseling strategy by therapists to counter addiction and improve lifestyle behaviors. This application proposes to train physicians to utilize MI to promote re-engagement in HIV care and to sustain retention and adherence. The study will increase the reach of the original pilot study and increase its generalizability, expanding the patient population to a wide variety of public and private clinic and hospital patients, including transgender women, drug users, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual men and women.</detailed_description>
