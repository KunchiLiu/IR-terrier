	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect development and outcome data on human embryos which are cultured in a 2nd generation continuous single culture medium (CSCM2) with the objective to demonstrate its performance efficacy in comparison to existing commercially available single culture or continuous embryo culture media.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multi-center (3 sites and 2 investigators), prospective trial with up to 300 patients. Patients will be enrolled from participating sites from the United States. Study sites will conduct this study under the oversight of Sterling IRB. Each study site should enroll enough patients to achieve at least 50 evaluable patients that have undergone a treatment cycle using split case sibling embryos in which half of the embryos are cultured in CSCM2 and the other half in current CSCM (as control). The methods will consist of standard ovarian stimulation protocols at each facility to obtain a sufficient number of mature (MII) oocytes for fertilization by ICSI. Following fertilization, identified diploid (2PN) zygotes will be evenly divided and randomly allocated to the embryo culture treatment conditions of CSCM2 or CSCM and cultured according to standard laboratory procedure (incubated in 5-6% CO2 in air or low O2 concentrations of 5-6%) to the blastocyst stage (Day 5/6 or 7). Top quality blastocyst(s) will be transferred and monitored for implantation, pregnancy and ongoing birth. Embryo transfers will either occur in a fresh or frozen cycle. The procedures in this study are designed to follow the standard medical care at each study site for women having IVF treatment (the participant will sign a separate consent at your clinic for your IVF procedures). The participants study doctor will explain in detail the procedures participants will undergo at the clinic; this form is only meant to explain the details of the research study. This study does not involve randomization of patient participation or any sham procedures.</detailed_description>
