	<detailed_description>Subjects with a haematological malignancy or solid and a diagnosis of a chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy. In a phase-III study patients with chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (NCI CTC grade 2/3) are randomized for an integrated program (IP) including massage, mobilization in posture and transport layers, physical exercises (standard) or with whole-body vibration (WBV) platform training (experimental). 15 training sessions in a time period of 12 to 15 weeks were intended. Evaluation included locomotor and neurological tests and self-assessment-tools. The primary objective of the study was the physical fitness and coordination assessed by the chair-rising test (CRT).</detailed_description>
