	<detailed_description>To determine if diffusion tensor and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging helpful to better understand and diagnose intractable epilepsy in children. All enrolled children will undergo standard preoperative and postoperative MRI imaging, plus a 15 minute set of functional connectivity and diffusion tensor sequence with no additional sedation. This imaging data will be stripped of identifiers and be processed to provide both quantitative analysis, resting state functional connectivity changes and three dimensional modeling of white matter tracts adjacent to epileptogenic foci. This study is being done to determine if diffusion tensor and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging are helpful to better understand and diagnose intractable epilepsy in children.</detailed_description>
