	<brief_title>Plasma GLP1 and Acute Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high mortality and its prognosis differed among patients. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is an effective method to treat AMI. To accurately predict adverse outcomes following pPCI in patients with AMI will help doctors develop precise therapeutic strategy in advance. At present how to predict adverse events before pPCI is still controversial. In our previous studies, the investigators found that glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP-1) can improve cardiac function in patients with AMI after PCI, other studies have reported that plasma GLP-1 levels is negatively correlated with CK-MB in patients with AMI, but the relationship between plasma GLP1 and prognosis of AMI patients after PCI has not been reported, the investigators hypothesized that plasma levels of GLP1 is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after pPCI. The investigators planned to evaluate the predicting role of plasma GLP1 level on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention.</detailed_description>
