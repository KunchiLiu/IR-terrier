	<brief_summary>Anxiety is associated with discomfort but also with an increased risk of pain and/or analgesic consumption. A prescription of anxiolytics is very common in pre-anesthetic consultation but without considering the real anxiety level of the patients. The objective of this premedication is mainly to improve patient comfort, to reduce patient anxiety and to improve patient cooperation. According to a study conducted in the 1990s, 40 to 80% of patients are anxious before surgery. Consequences of anxiety are somatic (tachycardia, hypertension, difficulty to falling asleep), behavioural (aggressiveness, regression, fight against anaesthesia induction) and postoperative pain. Preoperative area is a place of convergence for patients who need surgery or an interventional procedure. Staying in the preoperative area may be a source of anxiety and may affect the patient management. The investigators will interview patients undergoing surgery or interventional procedure to assess their level of anxiety, pain and their experiences during their stay in preoperative area. The objective is to analyse the level of anxiety and / or pain and their clinical consequences, and then to assess the relationship with any potential premedication.</brief_summary>
