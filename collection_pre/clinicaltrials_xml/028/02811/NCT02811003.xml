	<brief_title>Achilles Tendon Repair With Bioinductive Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study conducted under a common protocol designed to evaluate long-term outcomes following open treatment and implantation of the Rotation Medical Bioinductive Implant to treat insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled and treated with the Rotation Medical Bioinductive Implant. Enrollment is anticipated to take up to 12 months and all subjects will be followed for two years after surgery. Therefore, the overall study duration is estimated to be 36 months.</detailed_description>
