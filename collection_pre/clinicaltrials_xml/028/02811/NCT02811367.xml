	<brief_title>The HPV Self-test as a Test of Cure in Madagascar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy and the availability of cold coagulation render it a valuable technique for the treatment of precancerous lesions in low-resource settings. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) test performed by women themselves (HPV self-test) could be an efficient method to assess the long-term risk of recurrent/persistent disease in women with a history of HPV infection and cervical intra-epithelial lesions grade 2 or higher (CIN2+). A total of 443 HPV-positive women, aged 30-65 years, have been selected through a screening campaign conducted in Ambanja, Madagascar, between 2013 and 2015. Of these, 260 have been treated by cold coagulation, conisation or electrocauterization. A follow-up visit at 1-3 years after primary screening will be organized for all HPV-positive women detected at primary screening. Participants will perform an HPV self-test. A sample for cytology and HPV testing will also be collected by the physician. The goal of the study will be the histological search for CIN2+ lesions at one to three years after primary screening. The investigators expect to see that Self-HPV may be an accurate method for the follow-up of women with a history of HPV infection.</detailed_description>
