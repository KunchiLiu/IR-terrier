	<brief_summary>The ultimate aim of this study is to identify a biomarker of suicide risk in MDD by measuring the "hedonic spectrum" (pain and reward responsivity), attention and its associated brain structures using brain scans (fMRI and DTI), as well as the stability of markers over time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. DSM5 criteria for Major Depressive Episode within a MDD, confirmed through MINI diagnosis104 2. Ages between 18 and 70 years 3. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 item (HAMD17) &gt; 14 4. Capable of giving informed consent 5. Groups 1 and 2 participants only: HAMD17 item 3 (suicide) &gt; 2 6. Group 2 participants only: positive history of a suicide attempt within the last six months 7. Group 3 participants only: positive history of a lifetime suicide attempt 1. Pregnancy/lactation 2. Medical condition requiring immediate investigation or treatment 3. Recent (&lt; 6 months)/current history of drug abuse/dependence (other than caffeine, or nicotine) 4. Lifetime history of psychosis, Bipolar I or Bipolar II; other Axis I comorbidities are allowable 5. No current Axis II diagnosis, confirmed by International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE)105 6. Use of a stimulant, sedative hypnotic or atypical antipsychotic within 2 weeks of neuroimaging scans. Individuals receiving a benzodiazepine on a daily basis will be excluded from the study. Those receiving a benzodiazepine on an "as needed" basis (taken, but not every day) or receiving an atypical antipsychotic will be washed out of their benzodiazepine/atypical antipsychotic for two weeks prior to neuroimaging. 7. Participation in experimental treatment trials for the study duration.</criteria>
