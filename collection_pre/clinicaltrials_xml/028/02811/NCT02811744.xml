	<brief_summary>Our proposed study aims to use 11C-acetate PET/CT to preliminarily test and validate methods for imaging astrocyte activation as an early indicator of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 11C-Acetate PET/CT has been shown to quantify astrocyte activation in vivo, but no reports have evaluated its potential in AD. We propose to test 11C-Acetate PET/CT as a marker for astrocyte activation associated with pathologic amyloid deposition in AD. We will compare binding between subjects with early stage AD and healthy controls. Further, we will investigate the correlation between amyloid and acetate binding. If we find increased astrocyte activation in response to cerebral amyloid by showing a group difference in brain acetate uptake between disease and controls or a strong correlation between acetate and amyloid PET/CT binding. Validating neuroinflammation markers in AD ultimately may guide therapeutic modulation of beneficial and damaging neuroinflammation to slow disease progression, as well as providing new insights into AD pathophysiology.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for amnestic MCI cohort: 1. Participants will be at least 65 years of age 2. Positive brain amyloid PET/CT scan within 6 months of study screening 3. Minimental status examination (MMSE) score â‰¥ 24 at screening visit 4. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months of 11CAcetate PET/CT and of adequate quality that scan may be used for the study analysis, subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as a part of this study 5. Participants must identify a study partner who is willing to accompany the patient to study visits 6. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to studyspecific procedures. If the patient is unable to provide informed consent, the patient's legal representative may consent on behalf of the patient but the patient will be asked to confirm assent. Inclusion Criteria for Control cohort: 1. Participants will be at least 65 years of age 2. History of negative brain amyloid PET/CT scan within 6 months of study screening OR negative CSF analysis for AD biomarkers within 6 months of study screening 3. Minimental status examination (MMSE) &gt; 27 at screening visit 4. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months of enrollment to this study and of adequate quality that scan may be used for the study analysis, subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as a part of this study 5. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to studyspecific procedures. Exclusion Criteria for both cohorts: 1. Inability to tolerate or contraindication to imaging procedures (PET/CT or MRI) in the opinion of an investigator or treating physician 2. History of stroke or other neurological disease that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with evaluation of the 11CAcetate scan 3. Any medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study.</criteria>
