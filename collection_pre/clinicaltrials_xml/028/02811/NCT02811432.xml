	<brief_summary>There is uncertainty in the effect of KMC in unstable babies and there is a lack of evidence to guide how stable an infant must be to gain a mortality benefit from KMC. There is therefore, a need for a well-designed RCT that initiates KMC within 48 hours after birth to examine the effect on mortality versus conventional incubator care in infants weighing ≤2000g who are considered by the responsible clinician to be unstable. We propose such a parallel group RCT to be conducted at Jinja Hospital, a resource-limited regional referral facility in eastern Uganda.</brief_summary>
