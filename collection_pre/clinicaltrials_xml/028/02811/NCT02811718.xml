	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine, whether the 3RP is feasible, accepted and efficacious and durable when delivered via Skype to patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who are deaf or have severe hearing loss using Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) and/or American Sign Language (ASL). This will be a substudy of the IRB-approved protocol #2013P002605. It is the same study except it is looking at a particular sub-population: patients with NF2 who are hard of hearing.</brief_summary>
