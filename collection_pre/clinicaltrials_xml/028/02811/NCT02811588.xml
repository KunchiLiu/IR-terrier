	<brief_summary>The prevalence of chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is increasing in industrialized countries. Over the next decade deaths from COPD are projected to increase by more than 30% and COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. There is robust scientific evidence that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy is an effective option for most COPD patients hospitalized with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute disease exacerbation. More recently, NIV has been shown to significantly improve survival and quality of life in COPD patients with chronic stable hypercapnic disease. These data represent an important advance in the field, and indicate that usage of NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD should increase. Such an increase would be expected to improve patient outcomes and have a beneficial impact on the significant healthcare burden incurred by these patients. However, the proportion of stable COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia is unknown. In addition, using NIV at home to treat COPD patients with hypercapnic (type 2) respiratory failure has not often been considered previously and there is a paucity of data regarding NIV usage patterns over time in this setting.</brief_summary>
