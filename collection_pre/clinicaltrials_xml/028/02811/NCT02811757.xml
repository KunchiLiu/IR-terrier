	<brief_summary>Degenerative changes of the long head of the biceps brachii (LHB) are frequent and often associated with cuff tendinopathy. The function of the LHB in the shoulder is still controversial and uncertain, whereas its function in the elbow is certain. The biceps brachii is a flexor of the elbow and supinator of the forearm. Suppression of the pathologic long head of the biceps permits pain relief and is very reliable in the literature. Two options are available for the remaining tendon : simple tenotomy or tenodesis which consists to reattach the tendon to the humerus. Our hypothesis is that there is no difference in strength or endurance of the biceps brachii after tenotomy or tenodesis of the LHB. The aim of this study was to compare the strength and the endurance of the biceps brachii during supination and flexion after tenotomy or tenodesis of the LHB. the investigators proposed a prospective and randomized study. All the patients treated in our department for an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were included in this study after signed consent. Participants will complete isokinetic strength and endurance testing for elbow flexion and supination on the operative and nonoperative sides a minimum of 1 year after biceps tenotomy or tenodesis. The clinical evaluation included the range of motion measurement, Constant Score, Quick-DASH and SSV at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and one year.</brief_summary>
