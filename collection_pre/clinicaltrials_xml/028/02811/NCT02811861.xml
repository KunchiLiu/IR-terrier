	<criteria>Histological or cytological confirmation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clearcell component At least 1 measurable target lesion according to Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70 Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive medications, defined as BP ≤150/90 mmHg at Screening and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1) Adequate organ function per blood work Subjects who have received any systemic anticancer therapy for RCC, including antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, or any systemic investigational anticancer agent Subjects with central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy (eg, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgery or radiosurgery) and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs (eg, radiologic) or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting study treatment Active malignancy (except for RCC, definitively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and carcinoma insitu of the cervix or bladder) within the past 24 months. Subjects with history of localized &amp; low risk prostate cancer are allowed in the study if they were treated with curative intent and there is no prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence within the past 5 years Prior radiation therapy within 21 days prior to start of study treatment with the exception of palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions, which is allowed if completed 2 weeks prior to study treatment start Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study treatment Subjects with urine protein ≥1 gram/24 hour Fasting total cholesterol &gt;300 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (or ˃7.75 millimole per liter (mmol/L)) and/or fasting triglycerides level ˃2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Note: these subjects can be included after initiation or adjustment of lipidlowering medication Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting glucose &gt;1.5 times the ULN. Note: these subjects can be included after initiation or adjustment of glucoselowering medication Prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval to &gt;480 milliseconds (ms) Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy Clinically significant hemoptysis or tumor bleeding within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug Significant cardiovascular impairment within 6 months of the first dose of study drug: history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke, cardiac arrhythmia associated with significant cardiovascular impairment, or a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the institutional normal range as determined by multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram Active infection (any infection requiring systemic treatment) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive Known active Hepatitis B (eg, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactive) or Hepatitis C (eg, hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) [qualitative] is detected) Known history of, or any evidence of, interstitial lung disease Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current pneumonitis Subjects with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with the sponsor Active autoimmune disease (with the exception of psoriasis) that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment</criteria>
