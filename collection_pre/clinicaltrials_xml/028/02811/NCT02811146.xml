	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a cardiovascular syndrome with enormous impact on public health by high morbidity and mortality rates that are associated. Studies show that changes in striated skeletal muscle of those individuals, possibly caused by progressive physical inactivity, contribute to the construction of the pathophysiology of this disease, emphasizing the importance of exercise for these patients. Exercise programs can be traced safer and related form the actual functional capacity thereof. Cardiac rehabilitation it is a set of activities that aims to ensure that patients with heart disease the best conditions, especially physical. In this context, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an alternative to provide an improved tolerance during exercise in patients with HF. GOALS: Evaluate the effectiveness of the use of NIV association to aerobic exercise in exercise programs supervised during cardiac rehabilitation exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with heart failure when compared to performing these exercises without ventilatory support. METHODS: This is a clinical trial, controlled, randomized and blind to be developed with patients arising out of the main Recife reference centers in the care of patients with heart failure. It will be conducted assessments of functional capacity made by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), the Glittre-ADL test and through the questionnaire Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), assessment of quality of life using the questionnaire Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF), and finally, in order to determine a clinical change, will be used to Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIS). EXPECTED RESULTS: This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of NIV continuously in cardiac rehabilitation programs, improvement of exercise tolerance, with consequent reflection in functional capacity and quality of life of this population.</detailed_description>
