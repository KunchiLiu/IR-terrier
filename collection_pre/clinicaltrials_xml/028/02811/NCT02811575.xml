	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is the predominant type of diabetes. Because a quiet evolution, it is difficult to have a rapid diagnose. A better knowledge about pathophysiological mechanisms at the origin of type 2 diabetes and about its complications could make it possible to improve the prevention and the treatment of this disease. Research team developped a new research axis : the microbiota of the intestinal mucosa. They proved a translocation process of intestinal bacteria from the intestinal mucosa to different tissue of the organism implicated in glucose homeostasis. This mechanism is involved in the type 2 diabetes development. A clinical study (MICIMAB) of predictive biomarkers of diabetes and obesity is ongoing. In parallel, the same team explored the role of intestinal immunity modifications in the bacteria translocation from the gut to the blood circulation. They already have some results on animal model but not yet in human. In animal model, a solid reduction of lymphocytes T CD4 Th17 in the intestinal wall is responsable of the translocation of intestinal bacteria and in the induction of a metabolic inflammation wich promotes insulin resistance, abdominal obesity development and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to explore this hypothesis in human to have therapeutic solution later.</brief_summary>
