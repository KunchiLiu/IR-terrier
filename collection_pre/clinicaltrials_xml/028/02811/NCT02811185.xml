	<brief_summary>This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial designed to monitor the occurrence of adverse events associated with [F-18]-FDG Injection manufactured by the Fedoruk Centre. [F-18]-FDG Injection used in this clinical trial will be identical to commercial [F-18]-FDG that is already used at Royal University Hospital (RUH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry Type Study to Monitor for Adverse Drug Reactions to Fedoruk Manufactured [F-18]-Fludeoxyglucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will document the use of Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection (citrate formulation) in patients referred for [F-18]-FDG PET or PET/CT imaging at Royal University Hospital (RUH) in Saskatoon, SK. This investigational agent is produced using procedures, raw materials, equipment and quality standards that are equivalent to commercially-approved [F-18]-FDG Injection (Glucovision®, manufactured by the CPDC in Hamilton ON). This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomized study to monitor for adverse drug reactions among subjects administered Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection. Eligible subjects are those who would normally be referred by their physician for [F-18]-FDG PET or PET/CT imaging at RUH in Saskatoon, SK. The primary goal of this study is to permit immediate access, with appropriate regulatory and REB oversight, to Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection pending commercial approval. Monitoring for adverse drug reactions, during and after subjects are administered Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection, will support the primary objective of this study. Based on the well-established safety profile of [F-18]-FDG and the comparability of Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection to commercially-approved [F-18]-FDG Injection (Glucovision®), it is not expected that any ADRs will be observed.</detailed_description>
