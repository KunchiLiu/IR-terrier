	<brief_summary>Acquisition of knowledge and skills pertinent to the use of fibreoptic endoscopy is an important part of training in various medical and surgical specialties such as anesthesiology, emergency medicine, otolaryngology, and pulmonary medicine. It has been shown that there is a wide variation in the learning curves of residents and the number of attempts to achieve proficiency in performing upper airway endoscopy. recently, combined use of fiberoptic bronchoscope and videolaryngoscope has been suggested to be a good alternative. So, the aim of this study is to compare the number of attempt to achieve proficiency using fiberoptic bronchoscope alone or fiberoptic bronchoscope with Pentax-AWS.</brief_summary>
