	<brief_summary>The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the benefit of unilateral implantation in adults who meet conventional indications for implantation in one ear, but do not meet the conventional indications for implantation in the other ear (asymmetric hearing loss) using the HiResolution Bionic Ear System.</brief_summary>
