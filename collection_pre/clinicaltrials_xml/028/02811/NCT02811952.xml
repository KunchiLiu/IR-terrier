	<brief_summary>In many of urothelial carcinoma patients, one does not find common risk factors such as smoking. The medical center is located in an industrial city with known air and water pollution. The investigators decided to check the presence of nano particles and traces of metals in urinary samples of patients known and suspected for urothelial carcinoma and compare the results to both cystoscopic and cytological findings. The patients will fill a validated epidemiological respiratory disease survey and the results will be compared to a control group.</brief_summary>
