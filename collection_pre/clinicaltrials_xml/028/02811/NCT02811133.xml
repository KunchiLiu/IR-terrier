	<brief_title>Inositol for Comorbid Anxiety in Children and Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorders are a common comorbidity among children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. Treatment with standard pharmacologic agents may worsen mood problems or lead to drug dependency. Inositol has shown benefit for bipolar depression in adults. This is an open multi-case control study. The investigators will enroll 20 children and adolescents ages 8-17 treated at the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Services (CABS) at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. A subjects involvement will be 14 weeks, including the initial titration of the supplement, maintenance, and taper. Primary outcomes will include standard measures of mood and anxiety. Also, physiologic measures including body mass index and bedside glucose will be followed.</detailed_description>
