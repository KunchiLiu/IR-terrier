	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase 3 study is to determine if subcutaneous velcade is non-inferior to intravenous velcade when administered in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in chinese refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (r/rMM) patients. The study will assess the overall response rate at the end of 4 cycles of velcade and dexamethasone administration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have received at least 1 and no more than 3 prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 The toxicities resulting from previous therapy must be resolved or stabilized to less than or equal (&lt;=)Grade 1 prior to drug administration A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) or urine pregnancy tests at screening within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 Have documented evidence of progressive disease/disease progression based on investigator's determination of response by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria on or after their last regimen Received antimyeloma treatment within 2 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic halflives of the treatment, whichever is longer, before the date of randomization. The only exception is emergency use of a short course of corticosteroids (equivalent of dexamethasone 40 milligram per day (mg/day) for a maximum of 4 days) before treatment. A list of antimyeloma treatments with the corresponding pharmacokinetic halflives is provided in the Site Investigational Product Procedures Manual (IPPM) Received autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within 12 weeks before the date of randomization, or the participant has previously received an allogenic stem cell transplant (regardless of timing) Plans to undergo a stem cell transplant prior to progression of disease on this study, that is, these participants should not be enrolled in order to reduce disease burden prior to transplant Is known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C Had myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or clinically significant conduction system abnormalities</criteria>
