	<brief_summary>This multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized crossover design study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied naloxone lotion, 0.5%, for the treatment of pruritus in patients with the mycosis fungoides (MF) form of Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL). This study will also determine if there is systemic absorption of the drug in a subset of subjects and if so, describe the range and mean plasma levels reached after two weeks of three time daily (TID) dosing.

	<brief_title>Naloxone Hydrochloride Study for Relief of Pruritus in Patients With Mycosis Fungoides (MF) Form of CTCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There will be 160 subjects enrolled in the study. The study consists of a Screening Period of up to 7 days during which inclusion / exclusion criteria will be reviewed. Subjects meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria including the diagnostic criteria for MF and a score of at least 5 on the 11-Point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus will complete the one week Screening Period. Subjects will complete a daily diary for NRS for Pruritus scores. At the end of the Screening Period, subjects who have a NRS for Pruritus score of at least 5 recorded in the diary on at least 4 of the 7 days preceding Day 0 will be eligible to continue. Baseline assessments will be recorded for vital signs, pruritic body surface area, skin integrity, and laboratory results. The Baseline period will be followed by a 2 week Treatment Period 1 in which subjects will be randomized to Naloxone Lotion 0.5% or Placebo Lotion to be applied TID for 14 days. During the 2 week Treatment Period subjects will complete daily diaries of NRS for Pruritis scores and Sleep scores. On Day 14 subjects will return to the clinic to review diaries, adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and to record body surface area for pruritus, skin integrity, and laboratory results. Subjects will then enter a Washout Period for up to 28 days until the subject again scores at least 5 on the NRS for Pruritus on 4 consecutive or 4 of the past 7 days. Subjects who remain eligible will enter a 2 week Treatment Period 2 during which the same procedures as Treatment Period 1 will be performed except subjects will receive the alternate treatment to that assigned in Treatment Period 1.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects must meet the following criteria for admission into the study: 1. Signed informed consent has been obtained. 2. Subject is at least 21 years of age. 3. Diagnosis of mycosis fungoides (MF) will be based on a combination of histological, clinical, and immunophenotypical criteria. The histological criteria will be based on skin biopsy from the most representative skin area. The diagnostic criteria used for each subject will be specified in the case report forms. The skin (T), lymph nodes (N), visceral involvement (M), and blood (B) (TNMB) system will be used to classify the stage of disease. 4. Completion of the modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) assessment. 5. A history of pruritus that meets following criteria: At Screening Day 7: present on a daily basis for greater than one month prior to Screening Day 7, NRS for Pruritus score ≥5 as rated by the subject at the Day 7 Visit. At Baseline Period 1 Day 0: NRS for Pruritus score of at least 5 recorded in the subject diary on at least 4 of the 7 days preceding Baseline Period 1 Day 0. 6. Pruritic treatment area of 595% of the subject's total treatable body surface area. 7. Subject can be expected to reliably follow treatment instructions and visit schedule. 8. Nonpregnant, nonlactating females of childbearing potential who agree to use medically acceptable forms of birth control (abstinence, hormonal contraceptives, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or intrauterine device) throughout the study or females of nonchildbearing potential (surgically sterile [hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation] or postmenopausal ≥ 1 year). A negative urine pregnancy test must be confirmed at Baseline screening for all female subjects who are not postmenopausal &gt; 1 year or surgically sterile. 9. The subject agrees not to begin any new concomitant medications during their participation in the study, with the exception of medications necessary to treat infection. 10. Subject has no visual or motor impairments that will make it difficult to complete the Daily Diary or apply the study medication. 11. Subject is able to speak, read, and write English and agrees to participate and comply with the study procedures. 12. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30.5 kglm2 (subjects in pharmacokinetic subset only). Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from study participation: 1. Pregnant or lactating female. 2. History of clinically significant heart failure. 3. Myocardial infarction within the past six months. 4. A history of ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment. 5. A history of convulsive disorders. 6. Any medical condition which would, in the Investigator's opinion, preclude the subject from successfully participating in the study. 7. A known allergy to naloxone hydrochloride or any excipient in the formulation. 8. Previous naloxone use for pruritus. 9. Treatment with any of the following during the restricted time period prior to Baseline, and at any time during the study, is not allowed: Topical medications Topical alphahydroxy acids to any skin surface Systemic narcotic analgesics (e.g. morphine, codeine) Topical antihistamines to any skin surface [e.g. Zonalon® (doxepin)] Systemic antihistamines [e.g. Allegra® (fexofenadine), Benadryl® (diphenhydramine), Clarinex® (desloratadine), Motrin PM® (diphenhydramine), Tussionex® (chlorpheniramine), Xyzal® (levocetirizine), Zyrtec® (cetirizine)], Claritin (loratadine)] Topical steroids to any skin surface Radiation therapy (e.g. electron beam, narrow band ultra violet B (UVB), systemic or topical psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA)) Other investigational drugs (excluding any therapies for the treatment of MF) 10. Stable dose/regimen of the following treatments is allowed during the study if the subject has maintained a stable dose/regimen for at least the stated period of time before entry into the study and will continue with the dose/regimen throughout the study. Sedative/hypnotics [e.g., Valium® (diazepam), Halcion® (triazolam)] 7 days Tricyclic and other antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [e.g., Eutonyl®(pargyline), Nardil®(phenelzine), Parnate® (tranylcypromine), amitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine, doxepin] 30 days Daily systemic corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10mg per day of prednisone) in those patients with erythroderma 30 days Tranquilizers 30 Days Systemic nonnarcotic analgesics or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) 30 days All nonmedicated creams, lotions, or ointments to treatment area 60 days Targretin® (bexarotene) 60 days Systemic cytotoxic agents [e.g. Ontak® (denileukin diftitox), Istodax® (romidepsin), Zolinza® (vorinostat), Trexall (methotrexate), Leukeran (chlorambucil), Toposar (etoposide)] 60 days Photopheresis 3 cycles Alpha interferon 90 days Systemic chemotherapeutic regimens (including investigational agents), carmustine (BCNU), Campath (alemtuzumab) 90 days Topical chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Nitrogen Mustard preparations, 5FU) 90 days or 3 cycles Systemic and oral contraceptives (e.g. contraceptive implants, strogen/progesterone therapy 90 days</criteria>
