	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the impact of preoperative oral carbohydrate drink on gastric emptying and PH of gastric fluid in gastric cancer patients directly. Furthermore, investigators aim to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of preoperative oral carbohydrate in elective gastric cancer surgery, providing direct evidence for clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of 250ml Preoperative Carbohydrate Drink in Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinic, administration of oral carbohydrate 2-3 hours before surgery has been widely applied in elective colorectal surgery. However, no direct evidence has been showed that whether it is safe to do so in gastric cancer patients who are fit for elective radical gastric resection. This study aims to discuss the impact and safety of oral administration of 5% glucose solution 250ml 2-3 hours before elective gastric cancer surgery. It is an equivalence study, which refers to a single-center, prospective, single blind, and randomized controlled study design. Eighty-eight patients with gastric adenocarcinoma are going to be enrolled in the study, who will be allocated into control or treatment group. Patients in control group follow the traditional routine of 6-8 hours preoperative fasting, while those in the treatment group will orally intake 250ml 5% glucose solution 2-3 hours before surgery. The primary end-point is the preoperative gastric residual volume. The secondary end-points include preoperative PH of gastric fluid, assessment of perioperative psychosomatic conditions, rate of perioperative complications, level of insulin sensitivity, recovery of bowel function, and the length of hospital stay, etc.</detailed_description>
