	<brief_summary>Congenital clubfoot(CCF) is a kind of common congenital foot deformities in children. Though Ponseti method can cure most of the CCF patients, there are still part of patients can not get satisfactory recovery, especially those children classified as Dimeglio grade Ⅲ and Ⅳ. Carroll's technique is considered to be an ideal method of surgical treatment. But the postoperative scar is relatively large, and accordingly the postoperative complications is still common. Based on the clinical practice of the investigator's group, a modification of Carroll's technique, minimally invasive Carroll's technique, was applied. For the Dimeglio grade Ⅲ and Ⅳ CCF, the postoperative excellent and good rate was over 90%. Therefore, the investigator conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial on treatment of congenital idiopathic clubfoot with minimally invasive Carroll's technique.</brief_summary>
