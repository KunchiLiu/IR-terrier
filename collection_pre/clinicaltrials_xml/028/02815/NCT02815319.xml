	<brief_summary>Docetaxel chemotherapy is commonly used in patients with breast cancer. With the widespread use of steroid premedication, the incidence of fluid retention and skin toxicity side effects has been minimal. Premedication with dexamethasone (8mg twice daily) is recommended starting the day before chemotherapy and continuing for three days. Patients may forget to take all or part of their premedication prior to docetaxel administration, and additional doses of steroids are frequently give in place of the forgotten oral dose. The processes around treating patients who have incorrectly taken their medication are cumbersome leading to significant delays in patients receiving their chemotherapy while the chemotherapy nurse tries to contact the patients treating physician for guidance on the dose and route of dexamethasone they want administered. Most importantly with the current standard of care procedure, by the time the chemotherapy nurse, pharmacist and medical oncologist have spoken and made a treatment plan, the patient has been waiting for on average of an additional 1-2 hours before actually starting their chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Schedules of Dexamethasone in Patients Incorrectly Taking Dexamethasone Premedication (REaCT-dexamethasone)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will randomize cancer patients to a standard dose of dexamethasone 8mg orally or to contact the physician to see what dose they recommend. The current trial proposal could therefore reduce the time for which patients are waiting to receive their chemotherapy, improving time patients need to spend in the hospital and significantly improving practice not just in Ottawa but globally.</detailed_description>
