	<brief_summary>CHF6297 is a potent and selective inhibitor of human MAP kinase p38 being developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory airways diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and repeat doses of CHF6297 as dry powder formulation in healthy subjects and in COPD patients. This study is the first administration in humans. The study will comprise four parts: Part 1 will consist of two cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Single Ascending Dose (SAD) of CHF6297. Part 2 will consist of four cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) of CHF6297. Part 3 will consist of one cohort of COPD patients to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a repeat dose of CHF6297 Part 4 will consist of one cohort of healthy subjects to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of a repeat dose of CHF6297 after LPS challenge.</brief_summary>
