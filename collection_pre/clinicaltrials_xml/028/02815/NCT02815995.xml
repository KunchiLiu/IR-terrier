	<brief_title>Multi-Arm Study to Test the Efficacy of Immunotherapeutic Agents in Multiple Sarcoma Subtypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive tremelimumab and durvalumab by vein, over about 1 hour each, every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks (4 doses). After Week 16, participant may continue to receive durvalumab alone by vein over about 1 hour for an additional 32 weeks (8 doses). Study Visits: On Day 1 of Week 0: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will have 3 EKGs in a row. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. If participant can become pregnant, part of this routine blood and urine sample will be used for a pregnancy test. - Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood and may be related to participant's reaction to the study drug. The type of genetic testing in this study will be performed to learn how participant's DNA (genetic material) may change how they respond to the study drugs. On Day 1 of Weeks 2 and 6, blood (about 3½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic, and biomarker testing. On Day 1 of Week 4 and then every 4 weeks after that (Weeks 8, 12, 16, and so on) until Week 44: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will have imaging scans. Participant will not have these scans at Weeks 16 and 24. On Day 1 of Weeks 10 and 14, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Length of Study: Participant may receive up to 4 doses of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and up to an additional 8 doses of durvalumab alone. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. If participant completes 12 months of therapy but the disease appears to get worse, they may be able to re-start treatment. The study doctor will discuss this with participant. It is expected that patient's participation in this study may last up to 15 months. Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. End-of-Treatment Visit: As soon as possible after participant's last dose of study drug(s): - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will have an MRI, CT, or positron emission computed tomography (PET)/CT scan. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing. Follow-Up Visit: About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drug(s): - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Long-Term Follow-Up: Every 3 months: - Participant will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan. - Participant may be called to learn how they are doing and if they have started any anti-cancer treatments. If participant is called, it should take about 5-10 minutes. This is an investigational study. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are not FDA approved or commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age: &gt;/= 18 years of age 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed sarcoma that fall into one of the following categories Patients with lowgrade tumors are eligible if there is definite evidence of metastasis or progression (defined as at least a 10% increase in the cumulative sum of the longest diameters within a 3 month period): 1. Adipocytic tumors (Welldifferentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma) 2. Vascular tumors (leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma) 3. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma 4. Synovial sarcoma 5. Osteosarcoma 6. Other sarcoma histologies 3. Must have received and have progressed, are refractory or intolerant to standard therapy appropriate for the specific sarcoma subtype, if there is a standard therapy for the subtype (i.e. Progressing welldifferentiated liposarcoma, clear cell sarcoma etc do not require prior therapy). 4. Subjects must have at least 1 lesion that is measurable by irRECIST a. A previously irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is well defined, measurable per irRECIST, and has clearly progressed. b. Subjects undergoing fresh tumor biopsies must have additional nontarget lesions that can be biopsied at acceptable risk as judged by the investigator or if no other lesion suitable for biopsy, then an irRECIST target lesion used for biopsy must be &gt;/= 2 cm in longest diameter. 5. Subjects must consent to provide archived tumor specimens for correlative biomarker studies. Tumor tissue must be identified and availability confirmed prior to initiation of study therapy. In the setting where archival material is unavailable or unsuitable for use, or there have been multiple intervening therapies subjects must consent and undergo fresh tumor biopsy. A tumor lesion planned for biopsy must not be an irRECIST target lesion unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy and lesion used for biopsy is &gt;/= 2 cm in longest diameter. 6. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 7. Adequate organ function as determined by (lymphocyte count): a. Hematological (without growth factor or transfusion support): i. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1.5 x 10^9/L (1,500/mm^3) ii. Platelet count &gt;/= 100 × 10^9/L (100,000/mm^3) iii. Hemoglobin &gt;/= 8.0 g/dL within first 2 weeks prior to first dose of investigational product b. Renal: i. Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) or 24hour urine CrCl &gt; 50 mL/min CockcroftGault formula (using actual body weight) will be used to calculate CrCl, except for pts with Osteosarcoma who will be allowed to participate with an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &gt; 40 mL/min, as calculated by the CockcroftGault equation. c. Hepatic: i. Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 × ULN; for subjects with documented/suspected Gilbert's disease, bilirubin &lt;/= 3 × ULN ii. AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 × ULN; for subjects hepatic metastases, ALT and AST &lt;/= 5 × ULN 8.

Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy not otherwise specified above within 28 days or 5 halflives of the agent prior to the first dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab. 6. Any concurrent chemotherapy, Immunotherapies or biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for noncancerrelated conditions (eg, insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable. In addition, local treatment (eg, by local surgery or radiotherapy) of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable beyond the first cycle with prior consultation and in agreement with the PI. 7. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 or 1 with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values listed per the inclusion criteria. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by any of the investigational products may be included (eg, hearing loss) after consultation with the medical monitor. 8. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first dose of MEDI4736 or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion: a.
