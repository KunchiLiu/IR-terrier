	<brief_summary>Currently, surgical removal remains the main clinical treatment for cardiac tumor patients. However, malignant tumors are hard to completely resect. Also, as thoracoscopic surgeries induce great operation trauma, some patients cannot tolerate or do not will to take the operation. Therefore, new methods and techniques are in urgent need. Our center have a 12-year experience of intervention treatment for solid tumors and has conducted several animal experiments to verify the effectiveness of transthoracic puncture ablation and radiofrequency ablation for ventricular muscle. The purpose of this study is to conduct new method of direct transthoracic cardiac tumor-targeted Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and Laser induced Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT), make minimally invasive treatment plans for cardiac tumor patients, and verify the safety and validity of intervention treatment in long term.</brief_summary>
