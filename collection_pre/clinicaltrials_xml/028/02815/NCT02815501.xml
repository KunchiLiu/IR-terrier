	<brief_summary>Obstetric complications are common and can be responsible for maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. Thyroid dysfunction has been identified as a possible cause of obstetric complications. Many studies have been conducted to estimate the prevalence and define the nature of obstetric complications observed in patients with thyroid dysfunction. However, women with obstetric complications are not systematically screened for thyroid dysfunction and no published study has evaluated the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in women with an obstetric complication. As no consensus has been reached concerning systematic screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women, the identification of new high-risk populations could possibly result in a change of clinical practice.</brief_summary>
