	<brief_summary>The focus of this project are elderly people who have experienced hip fracture and need at least two weeks rehabilitation after discharge from hospital. The aim is to increase the evidence-based knowledge base for planning and appropriate follow-up intervention for patients with hip fracture on short-term / rehabilitation stays. In this study the investigators want to explore whether training High Intensity Functional Exercises (HIFE) , of short duration ie a 2- 4 week program and frequent intervention ie 5 times per week has a significant positive effect on physical function, pain and quality of life. The main aim is to explore whether a high intensive strength and balance training program has better effect than a low intensive strength and balance training program on functional status measured by Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) in patients with hip fractures. Another aims is to explore whether this high intensive strength and balance training program has better effect than a 'low intensive strength and balance training program' on pain, endurance and quality of life measured respectively Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPR), 6-minute walk test and SF-36. The study is a randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
