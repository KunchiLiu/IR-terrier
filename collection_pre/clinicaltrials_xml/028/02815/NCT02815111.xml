	<brief_title>Evaluation of Ketamine and Multi-modal Analgesics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to study an analgesic regimen of Ketamine and Lidocaine as infusions with Neurontin and acetaminophen delivered orally for postoperative analgesia and the subsequent effect on ventilator days and ICU stay. The investigators expect that pain scores will be either unchanged or better than historic controls. In addition, the investigators expect that ventilator days and ICU stay will be improved due to reduced incidence of delirium and bowel dysfunction.</detailed_description>
