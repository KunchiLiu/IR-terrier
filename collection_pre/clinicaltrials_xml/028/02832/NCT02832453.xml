	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of different doses of supervised exercise training intensity -concomitant to lifestyle counselling- as a Primary Health Care intervention tool for the management of the metabolic syndrome in low active adults with one or more metabolic risk factors. Secondary aims of the study are to investigate the effects of these interventions on systemic inflammation and adipose tissue function, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and sedentary habits, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention with regard to health related quality of life. The general hypothesis is that adults with risk factors for metabolic syndrome participating in interventions for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle that together with counselling strategies will include supervised physical exercise of vigorous intensity will present greater improvements in terms of metabolic risk, physical condition, physical activity/sedentary behaviours and psychological parameters at the end of the intervention and at 6-months follow-up than participants in interventions for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle that will include counselling plus physical exercise of low-to-moderate intensity or interventions based exclusively on counselling. It is a three arms controlled randomized clinical trial implemented in the Primary Health Care setting and of 10 months duration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of different doses of supervised exercise training intensity -concomitant to lifestyle counselling- as a Primary Health Care intervention tool for the management of the metabolic syndrome in low active adults with one or more metabolic risk factors. Secondary aims of the study are to investigate the effects of these interventions on systemic inflammation and adipose tissue function, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and sedentary habits, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention with regard to health related quality of life. The general hypothesis is that adults with risk factors for metabolic syndrome participating in interventions for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle that together with counselling strategies will include supervised physical exercise of vigorous intensity will present greater improvements in terms of metabolic risk, physical condition, physical activity/sedentary behaviours and psychological parameters at the end of the intervention and at 6-months follow-up than participants in interventions for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle that will include counselling plus physical exercise of low-to-moderate intensity or interventions based exclusively on counselling. It is a three arms controlled randomized clinical trial implemented in the Primary Health Care setting and of 10 months duration. Adults aged 30 to 52 years with metabolic risk factors will be randomized in three intervention groups that will be given one of the following: assessment on healthy lifestyle plus high intensity physical exercise supervision (3 individual and 6 group sessions + 16 supervised training lessons); assessment plus low-to-moderate intensity physical exercise supervision (3 individual and 6 group sessions + 16 supervised training lessons) or assessment-based programme without physical exercise supervision (3 individual and 6 group sessions). The main output variables evaluated will be: a) risk factors for the metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure, and plasma triglycerides, high density lipoproteins and glucose), systemic inflammation and adipose tissue functionality, physical activity habits and sedentary conducts, dietary habits, quality of life related to health, self-efficacy and empowerment. The economic cost will also be analysed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the program. These variables will be assessed 3 times alongside the study: at baseline, at the end of the 4 months intervention, and at 6 months follow-up. It has been estimated to recruit 33 participants per group, which are 100 participants.</detailed_description>
