	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine new multiscale signatures for the prediction of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients disease outcome, in particular for advanced stage (stage III, IV) human papillomavirus (HPV) negative patients and to validate prognostic models for overall survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical study is devoted to the validation of a decision support system for HNC patients management in the frame of a H2020 project.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent Histologically confirmed diagnosis of oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma Clinical stage III and IV Patient candidate for curative treatment: ± surgery ± radiotherapy ± chemotherapy Adequate archival pretreatment tumor specimen available (FFPE macrodissected sections) Availability of baseline diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition (nonTRACE ) with more than 3 bvalues (ranging from 0 (included) to 1000 s/mm2), and a field map acquisition. MRI images, T1 and T2 weighted, (slice thickness lower than 3 mm), head and neck in a single volume, and/or CT scan of the head and neck performed with contiguous cuts of 23 mm or less in slice thickness with i.v. contrast Male or female ≥ 18 years old Any previous haed and neck cancer. Patients with previous malignancies in the last 5 years before treatment for head and neck cancer, with the exception of surgically cured carcinoma in situ of the cervix, in situ breast cancer, incidental finding of stage T1a or T1b prostate cancer, and basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Any previous malignancy that was treated with surgery and or radiation of the head and neck region. Histological type other than head and neck squamous cell cancer (nasopharynx, salivary glands and sinus nasal cancer are excluded).</criteria>
