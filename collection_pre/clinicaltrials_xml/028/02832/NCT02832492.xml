	<brief_title>Pupil Near Response on DOC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral assessment is regarded as the gold standard on current evaluation of consciousness and prognostic prediction in patients with disorders of consciousness.(DOC)However,it relies on examiners' subjective interpretation to patients'behavior and is not applicable to patients without motor function. Previous studies suggest pupil near response has relationship with consciousness which are the inspiration of this study.In this study,the prognostic value of pupil near response to DOC patients will be tested on patients in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome(UWS,a new name for vegetative state).If the result is encouraging,it suggests these patients with PNR have been in minimally conscious state(MCS)already in the first CRS-R assessment.Moreover,for PNR can be objectively measured and needs no activation of skeletal muscle,it will be the solution to the problems of current evaluation of consciousness in DOC patients as mentioned above. A PNR test will be conducted on patients who have been diagnosed as UWS by Coma recovery scale-revised assessment to see if their PNR is positive.(CRS-R)According to the results of this test,patients will be divided into 2 groups,one including patients with PNR,the other one including patients without PNR.3 months later,a follow up will be conducted to obtain their prognosis in the form of another CRS-R assessment.Patients diagnosed as MCS will be considered as favourable prognosis,patients diagnosed as UWS or dead will be considered as unfavourable prognosis.Their favourable prognostic difference(difference between each group's proportion of MCS patients diagnosed by CRS-R in the follow up)will then be compared to see if PNR has relationship with consciousness. And for they will not be able to show conscious visual behaviors (visual behaviors in CRS-R which indicate MCS) in the first CRS-R and might have been misdiagnosed for this reason,their difference between recovery of conscious visual function (difference between each group's proportion of patients showing conscious visual behavior diagnosed by CRS-R in the follow up) will be compared to see if PNR is applicable to patients without motor function. Researchers expect to see the group including patients with PNR has greater proportion in both comparison.</detailed_description>
