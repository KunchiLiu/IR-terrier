	<brief_summary>Data on how to avoid POCD are limited. The purpose of this monocentric parallel - grouped observational registry is to collect study data of the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive functioning of the study groups and the control group is measured with a battery of neuropsychological tests, computer-based tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [CANTAB®] and non-computer based tests. The neuropsychological assessment is performed at preoperative baseline, after 5-7 days and at three months follow-up. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) will be classified using different calculation methods, primarily the dichotomous approach established by Rasmussen et al. in the International Study on postoperative cognitive deficits (ISPOCD). This calculation method defines POCD as a reliable change in pre- and postoperative cognitive performance (difference scores) of each individual in the surgical patients cohort as compared to the changes in a non-surgical control group (reliable change index in either a composite score including cognitive test parameters from all tests in the cognitive test battery or in at least two of the chosen cognitive test parameters). Additional calculation methods like "g-factor", "GCP" and arbitrary definitions e.g. "20.20- rule" will be used for detailed methologic evaluation.</detailed_description>
