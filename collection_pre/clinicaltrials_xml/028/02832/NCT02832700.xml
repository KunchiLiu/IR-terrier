	<brief_summary>Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) has anti-inflammatory properties in experimental rodent colitis and using human in vitro inflammation models. Its use as a food ingredient has proven safe and with no influence on dietary intake. In a pilot study the investigators found, that orally administered CGMP seems to have a beneficial effect comparable to that of mesalazine in active distal ulcerative colitis. The investigators now wish to evaluate the effects in healthy subjects by studying the anti-inflammatory and microbiome modulating properties and by assessing possible changes in gastrointestinal symptoms.</brief_summary>
