	<brief_summary>Brain trauma is an important burden in traumatologic intensive care. In these patients the treatment is guided by a cluster of multimodal monitoring parameters. Despite this it is difficult to assess the actual physiopathologic status of the brain. Changing the position of these patients (semi-seated to lying position) causes changes in the hémodynamics brain conditions, so in monitoring parameters . The analysis of these changes can givr us valuable clinically informations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Physiopathological Phenomena and the Haemodynamic and Cerebral Metabolic Effects From Semi-seated Position to Lying Position in Patients With Brain Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe brain trauma (CGS &lt; 8 ) are included. PIC, PA, PVC, EKG, airway pressure, SjO2 and NIRSS are continuously monitored. The patients are in semi seated (30°) position. Once a day they are in supine (0°) for 30 minutes. We record every parameters before and at the end of this supine period. After time domain and frequency domain signal processing, this parameters are compared to deduct clinical relevant conclusions.</detailed_description>
