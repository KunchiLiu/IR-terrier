	<brief_summary>Although exercise training of haemodialysis patients is associated with generally positive outcomes few haemodialysis units routinely offer intradialytic exercise therapy. This is often related to financial cost and/or staffing limitations. Home-based programs could be an alternative means of providing exercise benefits without associated implementation costs The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 4 weeks intradialytic versus home based exercise for haemodialysis patients regarding adherence and strength gains.</brief_summary>
