	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to determine the relation between arterial diameter and flow of carotis interna, brachial artery and radial artery before and after valsalva maneuver. A total of 70 patients in preoperative period will enroll in this study. After a deep inspiration, patients will asked to exhale to a valf system with a flow pressure of 20-40 mmHg and duration of 15 seconds.
