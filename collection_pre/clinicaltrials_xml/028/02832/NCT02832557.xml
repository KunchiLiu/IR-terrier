	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to identify miRNAs that are at increased or decreased levels in the saliva of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay and would be useful biomarkers for the screening of toddlers and young children for ASD. These biomarkers may allow earlier diagnosis of autism, allowing earlier service, and also help us to understand some of the changes in the brains of autistic children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Salivary miRNA Diagnostic Test for Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The central aim of this project is to characterize the expression of microRNA (miRNA) in the saliva of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In 2012 the CDC reported that the prevalence of ASD in U.S. children was 1 in 88. Yet, the biological causes, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease remain ambiguous. Recent research suggests that certain factors that regulate gene expression may play a role in ASD. To investigate this possibility we plan to measure small molecules called miRNAs in the saliva of children with ASD. Studies on miRNAs have shown that they can be extruded from neurons as extracellular signaling molecules and this knowledge provides a new approach for examining the genetic regulation of the central nervous system. In this study we are measuring the expression of extracellular miRNA in children with ASD. Levels of miRNA from saliva will be compared to those of normally developing controls. The goal of this research will be to provide possible biomarkers for diagnostic screening of ASD and identify genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in ASD. The primary endpoints of this study are as follows: 1. Characterization of miRNA in the saliva of children with ASD and normally developing control children from two to six years of age. 2. Identification of miRNAs in saliva that are predictive of ASD diagnosis and severity of symptoms. Secondary endpoints are the identification of miRNA expression patterns that correlate with ASD symptom severity measured with standardized neuropsychologic testing.</detailed_description>
