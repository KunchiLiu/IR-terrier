	<brief_summary>There are different inhibition suboccipital techniques, usually adjuvant of physiotherapy, for treatment of patients with chronic neck pain. In our clinical practice, a favorable effect is observed on patients with chronic neck pain, but there are no published studies evaluating the results of this techniques on pain, mobility and disability. The objective of this trial is to evaluate if the suboccipital manual techniques, provides further improvement in pain intensity, neck disability, range of motion, on patients with chronic mechanical neck pain and rotation deficit of the upper cervical spine, being treated with physiotherapy. For this purpose, investigators conduct a double-blind (patient and evaluator) randomized controlled trial, in a Public Primary Care Center. Seventy four subjects will be randomized (computer application) into three groups: Mobilization Group, Maintained pressure Group and Control Group. All the three groups receive the same protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment during three weeks and, additionally, the Mobilization Group receives six sessions (two sessions in a week during three weeks) of translational dorsal glide mobilization technique grade III of the atlanto-occipital joint and the Maintained pressure Group receives six sessions (two sessions in a week during three weeks) of pressure maintained suboccipital Inhibition technique. The Control Group receives the protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment only. Pain intensity (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Range of motion (CROM), will be measured at baseline, after treatment period, and three months after discharge from treatment. After discharge for treatment the patient subjective opinion about their evolution will be collected through a Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale, and evaluation of headache disability (HIT-6).</brief_summary>
