	<brief_summary>This study has two major purposes: 1. To test developed multiple anatomic and functional MRI methods; 2. To evaluate the potentials of these MRI methods in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of the progression of renal dysfunction. These purposes will be achieved by performing pilot studies with cohorts of patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is observational with no intervention applied for the patients. In this study, multiple anatomic and functional MRI methods will be performed with three cohorts of patients. In addition to anatomic MRI methods, non-contrast enhanced functional MRI methods will also be applied to evaluate tissue perfusion and vascular reactivity in these patients.</detailed_description>
