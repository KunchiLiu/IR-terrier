	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection due to Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae (E-ESBL UTI) become a frequent problem. A too large variety in the prescription of antibiotics for E-ESBL UTI in children and absolute recommendations regarding the optimal treatment of E-ESBL is nearly impossible at this time. Our aim was to describe the characteristics and treatments of urinary tract infections caused by Extended spectrum betalactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Tract Infection Due to Beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this prospective observational study between March 2013 and March 2017, children (0 to 18 years) with ESBL-E UTI were enrolled in 24 pediatric departments in France. Clinical and biological characteristics, risk factors of infection of E-ESBL, first and second lines of antibiotic therapies were analyzed. The investigators used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the time to fever defervescence and hospitalization duration, and Log-rank test to assess equality of survivor functions. The investigators also analyzed the resistance patterns and molecular characterization of ESBL types in the isolates.</detailed_description>
