	<brief_summary>This single center, comparative design study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an experimental stannous fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) after short term use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating the Efficacy of an Occluding Dentifrice in Providing Relief From Dentinal Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single center, three day, randomized, examiner blind, two treatment arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected test teeth), controlled study, in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet all the criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) visits. DH will be assessed at baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and after 3 days twice daily brushing.</detailed_description>

Females of child bearing potential who have a positive urine pregnancy test or who are breast feeding Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients Previous participation in this study or participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes or Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes xerostomia Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of Screening, tongue or lip piercing or presence of dental implants, gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery) within 12 months of Screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of Screening and teeth bleaching within 8 weeks of Screening Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay within 12 months of Screening Tooth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthecounter dentifrice in the opinion of the Investigator Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentine hypersensitivity within 8 weeks of screening Daily doses of medication/treatments which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the perception of pain. Examples of such medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that cause marked or moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquilizers, antidepressants, moodaltering and antiinflammatory drugs.
