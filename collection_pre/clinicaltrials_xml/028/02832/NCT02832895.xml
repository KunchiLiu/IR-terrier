	<brief_summary>Transcranial doppler (TCD) is an established tool for monitoring flows in intracranial cerebral arteries. Its use is recommanded in the last guidelines on traumatic brain injury. The temporal bone window (TBW) is limited in evaluating flow in the anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) because of an unfavorable insonation angle. Thereby TCD could be unfit to detect a segmental lesion on the anterior cerebral arteries (ACA). The frontal bone window (FBW) is a promising approach in evaluating flows in the ACA. However, the utility of the FBW for patients with acute brain injury (ABI) in ICU has not been yet determined. The goal of the present study is to determine the rate of detection of the ACA by using the FBW in patients with ABI in ICU.</brief_summary>
