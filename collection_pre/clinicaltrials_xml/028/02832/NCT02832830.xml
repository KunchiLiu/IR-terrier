	<brief_summary>The aim of this explorative trial is to verify the comparability of a fractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy with a conventional radiotherapy related to quality of life on the one hand and to evaluate toxicity, re-calcification and stability of vertebral body as well as pain relief and local response for palliative patients with painful spinal bone metastases on the other hand. This is a single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial with parallel-group design to determine the quality of life after RT in patients with spinal bone metastases. Two different techniques were evaluated: intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and fractionated conventional external beam RT with 10×3 Gy each. Experimental intervention: IMRT 10 x 3 Gy Control intervention: 3D-RT 10 x 3 Gy</brief_summary>

Experimental intervention: IMRT 10 x 3 Gy Control intervention: 3D-RT 10 x 3 Gy After the baseline measurements have been recorded, the patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups: IMRT 10×3 Gy (n = 30) or fractionated conventional 3D-RT 10×3 Gy (n = 30). The RT will be applied daily (mondy to Friday). Follow-up per patient: The target parameters will be measured and recorded at baseline, at the end of RT (t1), and at 12 weeks (t2) and 6 months (t3) after the end of the irradiation period.</detailed_description>
