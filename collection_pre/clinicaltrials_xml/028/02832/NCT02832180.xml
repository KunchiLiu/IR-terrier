	<criteria>Signed Informed Consent Target population: Healthy females with no clinically significant deviations from normal in medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical measurements, and clinical laboratory tests that are willing to switch to Loestrin during the study. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 to 32 kg/m2. Women of childbearing potential with intact ovarian function and history of regular menstrual cycles must have been on a stable regimen of combination of birth control containing ethinyl estradiol without evidence of clinically significant breakthrough bleeding or spotting for at least 2 consecutive months prior to Day 1. Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drugs (53 days) plus 5 halflives of BMS986142 (3 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 86 days. History of any chronic or acute illness including active TB in the last 3 years, recent infection, gastrointestinal disease, smoking within less than 6 months prior to dosing, alcohol abuse, inability to tolerate oral medication, or inability to be venipunctured. History of jaundice or irregular bleeding associated with taking oral contraceptives, frequent headaches, cerebrovascular or coronaryartery disease, retinal vascular lesions, cancer of the breast or endometrium, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or phlebitis. Vaccination or plans for vaccination with any live vaccine 12 weeks prior to first dose of study drug, during the course of the study, or 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population. History of allergies and adverse drug reaction to any oral contraceptive compounds or Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.</criteria>
