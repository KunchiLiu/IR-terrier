	<brief_summary>The rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke are critical in the reduction of morbidity, disability and stroke associated mortality Under-education about stroke may prevent people from recognizing symptoms early enough to seek immediate care. The studies reported on stroke patients managed in stroke center have shown that 39-42% of patients could not name any symptoms of stroke and 36% to 43% no risk factor of stroke. The stroke patients are therefore a population at high risk for neurological events and cardiac vascular recurrence. However, no studies have evaluated the interest of the development of therapeutic workshops in stroke unit to educate patients about symptoms suggestive of stroke, risk factors and what to do in cases of stroke. Investigators assume that the setting up of a therapeutic education workshop in the stroke unit may allow a better understanding of the symptoms, risk factors and what to do following stroke. So there is a direct benefit to the patient represented by a better knowledge of stroke (warning signs, risk factors, what to do), improved treatment compliance and reduced risk of recurrence. More generally, there is a real benefit to promote these messages to the public through the patient and his relatives</brief_summary>
