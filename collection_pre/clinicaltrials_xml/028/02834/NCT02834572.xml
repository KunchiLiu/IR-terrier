	<brief_summary>Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and transwomen in the US are affected by HIV at severely disproportionate rates. A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk is diagnosing HIV infections through regular HIV testing. A significant proportion of young Black MSM and transwomen have not tested in the prior year. This research study seeks to address low HIV testing rates among young Black MSM and transwomen by testing a brief Internet-based HIV testing intervention optimized for mobile devices. The intervention takes advantage of the variety of HIV testing options now available, including the HIV self testing, couples-based HIV counseling and testing and traditional clinic-based testing and will provide men and transwomen with a tailored recommendation of their optimal HIV testing approach. The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized study among young Black MSM and transwomen followed for 6 months to estimate the intervention's potential efficacy in increasing HIV testing.</brief_summary>
