	<brief_summary>Walking is encouraged for people with type 2 diabetes but there is little evidence that performing a bout of walking can improve glucose control. Furthermore, it is unknown how participant characteristics (e.g., age, sex, medications) impact the acute glucose responses to walking in people with type 2 diabetes. The primary purpose of this study is to examine how a standardized bout of walking impacts glucose control assessed over 24 hours using continuous glucose monitoring. A secondary purpose is to determine whether responses are influenced by age, sex, and medication use.</brief_summary>
