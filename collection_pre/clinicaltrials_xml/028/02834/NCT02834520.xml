	<brief_title>Expression of miRNa-138 and Cyclin D1 in Oral Mucosa of Patients With Oral Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 individuals were subdivided into 3 groups, into 2 groups, 30 patients with oral lichen planus, 30 control individuals having age, gender and periodontal status matched with both patients groups acting as a control group. Relative gene expression of miRNA-138 was estimated using Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technique in oral mucosa of both oral lichen planus patients and control subjects. Sub grouping of oral lichen planus patients were performed into reticular, atrophic and erosive groups (n=10 each). Cyclin D1 gene expression was estimated using Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technique and Cyclin D1 protein level was estimated using immunohistochemistry.</detailed_description>
