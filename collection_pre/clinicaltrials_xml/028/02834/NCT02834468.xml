	<brief_title>DEX Combined With RTX, CSA and IVIG in the Management of Newly Diagnosed ITP Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are undertaking a multicenter trial of 100 primary ITP adult patients from 5 medical centers in China. All participants receive dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days), rituximab (given intravenously at a dose of 500mg once), cyclosporin (given orally at a dose of 2.5-3 mg/kg per day for 28 days) and intravenous immunoglobulin (given intravenously at a dose of 5g per month for 6 months) for the treatment of adults newly diagnosed ITP patients.</detailed_description>
