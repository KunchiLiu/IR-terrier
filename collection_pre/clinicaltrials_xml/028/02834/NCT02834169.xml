	<brief_summary>Despite advances in the management of and changes in clinical practice, little is known about the epidemiology, patterns of care and outcomes of rare peritoneal surface malignancies patients in France. In order to better understand the characteristics of rare peritoneal surface malignancies and to evaluate treatment strategies, the RENAPE registry aims at the collection of data from patients presenting with a rare peritoneal surface malignancy in France. Data will be entered prospectively in a specifically designed and secured web database. All RENAPE's centres and physicians are invited to register patients with a rare peritoneal surface malignancy diagnosis and to participate to the registry. Data will be evaluated within regular time frames, focusing on types of rare peritoneal surface malignancies, treatment modalities and patient outcomes (e.g. survival, recurrence), thereby contributing to the better understanding of these rare cancers.</brief_summary>
