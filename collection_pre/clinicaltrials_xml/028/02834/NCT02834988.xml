	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that performing SLND (instead of complete lymphadenectomy) will decrease complications such as hemorrhage, lower extremity lymphedema and lymphocyst formation while enhancing quality of life in EC patients with low risk for nodal involvement. The investigators also hypothesize that SLND is an effective method of staging these patients. Studies have shown that SLN mapping identifies positive lymph nodes in women with newly diagnosed EC and this prognostic information obtained from SLND could guide selection of adjuvant treatment and improve overall survival. Using SLND as an alternative may also have additional medical and economic impacts. Prolonged hospitalization and associated costs can be avoided by shortening overall surgery duration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection (SLND) in Patients With Apparent Early Stage Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an interventional, prospective, and non-therapeutic study evaluating the clinical utility of SLND for detecting nodal metastasis of early stage endometrial cancer. Patients will undergo surgical staging for EC (sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery, ±hysterectomy, ±bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)). Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy may (or may not) also be performed in addition to SLND, at the discretion of the Surgeon. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) will be removed; that is, all patients will have SLND. Pelvic washings may also be obtained. Pathology assessment of nodal metastasis will be performed in all nodes removed (SLN or any other enlarged or removed lymph nodes). Patients will be staged using International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria and classified into risk strata (either low or high risk EC) as per the Modified Mayo Criteria. Based on the pathologic risk assessment and FIGO stage, patients may then be assigned to receive adjuvant treatment at the discretion of the treating Investigator and as per institutional guidelines; no per-protocol treatment is planned.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed endometrial cancer. 2. Clinically apparent early stage endometrial cancer (i.e. disease confined to the uterus on preoperative work up). 3. Surgical candidate with operable tumor (patient is eligible and willing to undergo surgery for the management of their endometrial cancer) as deemed by an institutional surgeon. 4. Females aged 18 years or older. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status ≤ 2. 6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: White blood cells (WBC) ≥3,000/ul Platelets (PLT) ≥100,000/ul Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 x upper limits of institutional normal (ULN) Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limits of institutional normal) 7. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Patients with lymphadenopathy and/or evidence of metastases, either clinically palpable and/or on preoperative radiological imaging. 2. Any preoperative adjuvant therapy for endometrial cancer (e.g. prior pelvic/abdominal radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or retroperitoneal surgery). 3. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. 4. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients. A pregnancy test is required during Screening for perimenopausal patients who did not have a hysterectomy. 5. Central Nervous System (CNS) restrictions (i.e. brain metastases). 6. History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds with similar chemical or biologic composition to phenylmethane, iodines, isosulfan blue, indigocyanine green (ICG) and any other agent(s) used in this study. If there is an allergy to one of the possible compounds, a patient can be enrolled only if the treating Investigator takes documented precautions to ensure the agent that the patient is allergic to is not used. 7. Any uncontrolled, intercurrent illness including but not limited to concomitant cancer, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia. 8. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness/condition likely in the judgment of the Investigator(s) to interfere or limit compliance with study requirements/treatment.</criteria>
