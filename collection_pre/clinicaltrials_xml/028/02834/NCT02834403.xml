	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The study will be conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. Stage 2 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 60 mg/m2 docetaxel. Five dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg) will be investigated in stage 1. The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. As patients are accrued, a standard Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method (CRM) approach will be used to determine the appropriate L-NMMA dosage. In stage 2, the starting dose will be one dose level above the MTD determined in stage 1. Again the CRM will be used to determine the appropriate L-NMMA dosage.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase Ib study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The study will be conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. Stage 2 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 60 mg/m2 docetaxel. Five dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg) will be investigated in stage 1. The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. As patients are accrued, a standard Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method (CRM) approach will be used to determine the appropriate L-NMMA dosage. In stage 2, the starting dose will be one dose level above the MTD determined in stage 1. Again the CRM will be used to determine the appropriate L-NMMA dosage. Patients will receive up to 6 (21-day) cycles of the L-NMMA and docetaxel combination. L-NMMA will be administered via 2-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1-5 of each cycle. Docetaxel will be administered via 1-hour intravenous infusion approximately 15 minutes after the Day 1 L-NMMA infusion. For L-NMMA-induced hypertension, amlodipine (10 mg) will be orally administered for 6 days at each cycle. Amlodipine administration will start 24 hours before the first dose of L-NMMA. For docetaxel-induced leukopenia, pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered via subcutaneous injection approximately 24 hours after every dose of docetaxel. In addition to MTD and DLT assessment, this study will also determine the recommended phase 2 dose, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics of the L-NMMA as well as explore tissue and blood-based markers of treatment response and toxicity.</detailed_description>
