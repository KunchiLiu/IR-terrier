	<brief_summary>Randomized Controlled Trial to monitor and increase the postoperative mobilization of the patients undergoing major visceral surgery by giving a continuous autofeedback of the step count using activity tracking wristbands.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Perioperative Mobilization (EPM) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing elective open and laparoscopic surgery of colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas and liver for any indication will be included. Further inclusion criteria are: age between 18-75 years, ASA score &lt; 4, and a signed informed consent. Patients are stratified into two subgroups (laparoscopic and open surgery) and will be randomized 1:1 for an autofeedback of their step-count using an activity tracker wristband or for the control group without autofeedback. Sample size (n = 29 patients in each of the four groups, overall n = 119) is calculated on an assumed difference in step-count of 250 steps daily (intervention versus control group). The primary study endpoint is the step-count during the first five postoperative days; secondary endpoints are the percentage of patients in the two groups, who master the predefined mobilization (step-count) targets, the assessment of additional activity data from the devices, the assessment of the preoperative mobility, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, number of patients who receive physiotherapy, 30-day mortality, and the overall 30-day morbidity.</detailed_description>
