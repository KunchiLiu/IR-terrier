	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of Stevia in Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-randomized clinical trial in a type 2 diabetic population aiming to investigate the effect of Stevia rebaudiana bertoni on the glycaemic and insulin secretory response to a mixed meal tolerance test, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. The study has two arms including an intervention arm (test group) and a non-intervention arm (controls) matched for age, sex and body mass index in 2:1 ratio. The intervention is made of two phases including 1. A mixed meal tolerance test with and without 240 mg of Stevia in a randomized order to evaluate the acute effects; 2. An oral intake of 240 mg of Stevia within 30 days as food supplement in order to assess medium-term effects</detailed_description>
