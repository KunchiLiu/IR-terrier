	<brief_summary>Muscle strength can be measured by dynamometry, but the investigators did not find in the literature the study of this technique in the quadriceps of patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Analyze training impact conducted by cycle ergometer in quadriceps muscle strength in patients with chronic kidney disease during hemodialysis. This study will be a prospective, randomized. Inclusion of 46 patients followed by the dialysis unit of a university hospital, over 18 years, of both genders who underwent hemodialysis for more than six months and signed the consent form and enlightened. Patients will be divided into two groups: Intervention (n = 23) and control (n = 23). All will be evaluated for demographics and quadriceps strength given by standardization of technique, with hard and windy belt. The control group will be reassessed after two months of the initial assessment, since the intervention group held two months of training in hemodialysis a physical therapy protocol with the cycle ergometer.</brief_summary>
