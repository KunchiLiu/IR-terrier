	<brief_title>Novel Coating to Minimize Bacterial Adhesions and Tooth Wear in Denture Acrylic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Denture stomatitis is a prevalent disease among removable denture wearers. The cause of this disease stems from a myriad of factors including host immunity and poor oral hygiene. Denture acrylic material is very conducive for the growth and adhesion of bacteria because of its porous nature. The application of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) coatings on the surface of acrylic dentures can produce a less porous surface which may minimize the adhesion of bacteria and therefore colonization. The goal is the application of these coatings will help minimize the occurrence of denture stomatitis. Another issue of removable dentures is the low wear resistance of denture teeth. The application of these coatings on denture teeth should minimize wear of these teeth and prolong the life of removable dentures.</detailed_description>
