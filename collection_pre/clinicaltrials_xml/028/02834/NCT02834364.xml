	<brief_title>BRAF/MEK Inhibition in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (BIRMA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label, single-arm, multi-centre phase II trial for patients with refractory multiple myeloma and with BRAFV600E/K Mutation to evaluate the efficacy of the kinase inhibitors Encorafenib (LGX818 in) combination with Binimetinib (MEK162). The patients must have received at least two prior therapy regimen (at least one immunomodulatory drug and one proteasome inhibitor). The subjects receive LGX 818 450 mg. p.o. once daily and MEK 162 45 mg p.o. twice daily until disease progression or toxicity requiring discontinuation of treatment. 1 cycle is defined as 28 days.</detailed_description>

Patient is a woman of childbearing potential, UNLESS they are using a double barrier method for birth control throughout the trial. 1.

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential 25. Sexually active males unless they agree to use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug. This practice should be continued for another 12 weeks after stopping treatment. Also they should not father a child during the study period or the 12 weeks post study time. A condom is also required to be used by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid; 26. Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's ability to understand the patient information, give informed consent, comply with the study protocol or complete the study. 27.
