	<brief_title>Study of Single And Double Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Graft Cross-sectional Dimensions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators divide 100 patients with ACL rupture into 2 groups. Group A undergo single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Group B undergo double bundle ACL reconstruction. At 3-6 weeks post operation, all the patients undergo 3-D MRI examination of both knees. The investigators reconstruct 3-D models of reconstructed ACL and native ACL, and compare the difference between single and double bundle graft.</detailed_description>
