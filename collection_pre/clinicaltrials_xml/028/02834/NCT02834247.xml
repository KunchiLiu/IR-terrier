	<brief_title>A Study of TAK-659 in Combination With Nivolumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested is TAK-659.This study will look at the determination of the MTD/RP2D and efficacy measured by ORR in participants who take TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab. The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 120 participants, approximately 9-12 in the dose escalation phase and approximately 36 in each of the 3 dose expansion cohorts. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups: - Part 1: Advanced Solid Tumors - Part 2: Metastatic TNBC - Part 2: Metastatic NSCLC - Part 2: Metastatic HNSCC All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day throughout the study. Participants will also receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab (within 30 minutes after the TAK-650 dose) once every 2 weeks. This multi-center trial will be conducted globally. The overall time to receive treatment in this study is approximately 12 months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and PD during the PFS follow-up of 6 months (for participants who discontinue due to reasons other than PD) and OS follow-up of 12 months from the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

Safely accessible tumor lesions (based on investigator's assessment) for serial pre treatment and post treatment biopsies are required for participants receiving TAK659 monotherapy runin treatment for 2 weeks followed by TAK659 plus nivolumab combination treatment [ ~10/30 responseevaluable participants]; adequate, newly obtained, core or excisional biopsy of a metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is required.

An optional biopsy may be taken at PD with additional consent from the participants. One, 2, or 3 prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease and with progression of disease on last treatment regimen. For the purposes of this study, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens do not count as a prior line of therapy.

Participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or ALK genomic alternations should have PD on prior therapy for these aberrations. Safely accessible tumor lesions (based on investigator's assessment) for serial pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies are required for participants receiving TAK659 monotherapy runin treatment for 2 weeks followed by TAK659 plus nivolumab combination treatment (~10/30 responseevaluable participants); adequate, newly obtained, core or excisional biopsy of a metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is required.
