	<brief_summary>This study investigates the effectiveness of a simple treatment to prevent proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Intraoperative intravitreal 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used as a prophylactic therapy in high-risk patients with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Our major motivation is to reduce the incidence of PVR in the group that receives the trial drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Intravitreal 5-Fluorouracil and Heparin to Prevent PVR in High-risk Patients With Retinal Detachment.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a common cause for postoperative failure after vitreoretinal surgery for primary RRD. There is no standard-therapy to prevent PVR. Several attempts using chemotherapeutic agents have been undertaken to prevent this proliferation-process, but none of these was introduced into routine clinical practice. Until recently, it has been challenging to identify patients with high risk for postoperative PVR formation. This is especially important, because in this trial treatment with the trial drug will be restricted to patients at high risk for PVR only. Patients are assigned to the following treatment arms (1:1): (A) Intraoperative adjuvant application of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) via intraocular infusion during routine pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in high-risk patients for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Versus: (B) Routinely used intraocular infusion with balanced salt solution (BSS) during routine PPV.</detailed_description>
