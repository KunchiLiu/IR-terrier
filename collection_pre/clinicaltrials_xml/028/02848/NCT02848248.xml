	<brief_title>A Safety Study of SGN-CD123A in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary estimate of antitumor activity of SGN-CD123A. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: 1. Part A is the dose-escalation portion of the trial, designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SGN-CD123A 2. Part B is the dose-expansion portion of the trial, designed to evaluate SGN-CD123A in patients with differing CD123 expression levels Dose-escalation in Part A will be conducted using a 3+3 study design. Patients with CD123-detectable AML will be enrolled in cohorts at escalating doses of study drug and will receive up to 2 induction cycles of SGN-CD123A treatment at an assigned dose level in 3-week cycles. After completion of dose-escalation, patients will be enrolled in Part B of the study. Patients enrolled in Part B will receive up to 2 induction cycles of SGN-CD123A treatment at a dose level and frequency determined by results in Part A. For both Part A and Part B, a third induction cycle may be permitted with the approval of the study medical monitor. If a patient achieves a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery, optional post-remission cycles of SGN-CD123A may be administered.</detailed_description>
