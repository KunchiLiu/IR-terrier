	<brief_summary>The investigator proposes to perform a phase I/II study comparing two nutraceuticals and placebo that target mediators identified in the investigator's prior dynamic modeling study of Gulf War Illness (GWI). The investigator will repeat the dynamic modeling before treatment and on therapy to assess the modeling and the impact of the interventions on the homeostatic networks that have identified, with an added focus on the glutathione/redox system.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the Investigator's prior study "Dynamic Modeling in GWI", the investigator used an exercise stress model (rest, peak oxygen consumption oxygen uptake, and 7 follow-up sampling points) to measure the mediators of relapse in the context of their interactive homeostatic networks. The investigator surveyed the response of genes and blood-borne biomarkers in order to interrogate and map regulation of neuro-endocrine-autonomic-immune function in these subjects as compared to GW era sedentary healthy controls. The investigator's research team applied an integrative systems-based approach rooted in computational biology connecting gene expression and biomarkers to pathways and to symptoms in order to identify potential therapeutic targets as well as optimal strategies for manipulation of these targets. Using this data the investigator's research team has developed a virtual model of the illness, which has been used to identify potential therapeutic targets.</detailed_description>
