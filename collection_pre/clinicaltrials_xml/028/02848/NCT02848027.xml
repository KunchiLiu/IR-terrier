	<brief_title>Correlating the Osteoarthritic Knee Microenvironment to Clinical Outcome After Treatment With Regenexx®SD Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-center, laboratory blinded to include up to 200 subjects with knee osteoarthritis in unilateral or bilateral knees treated with Regenexx® SD in the osteoarthritic knee/s.Initial study procedures include baseline evaluation of medical history, knee history, knee examination, medication use, MRI, and subject-reported outcomes. Subjects will be enrolled within the 120 days prior to Regenexx® SD injection. A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment. Collection of synovial fluid from the OA knee/s will serve as the experimental condition, i.e. the osteoarthritic knee.Each osteoarthritic subject will undergo withdrawal of knee joint synovial fluid for each knee being treated (0.3-0.5 ml) which will be analyzed by the research laboratory via multiplexed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dimethylmethylene blue assay (DMMB) at pre-injection (2-8 days before Regenexx® SD treatment) and post-injection (2-8 days after Regenexx® SD). Documentation of osteoarthritic joint characteristics and injection procedure details will be recorded throughout the study. The unaffected knee joint will undergo no treatment, but bilateral knees may be treated. Components of the synovial fluid will be correlated to post-treatment clinical outcomes, which include patient-reported questionnaires as well as assessment of post-injection complications, adverse events, re-injections and surgical interventions. Patient-reported clinical outcomes are comprised of the IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation, the Lower Extremity Function Scale, Numeric Pain Scale and a Patient Reported Percent Improvement form.</detailed_description>
