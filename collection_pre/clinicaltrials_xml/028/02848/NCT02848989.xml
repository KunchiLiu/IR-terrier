	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that on-going pain following breast surgery is common and may limit the ability to participate in physical activity, cause tiredness, difficulty in daily chores/activities as well as other problems. This study is evaluating whether participating in a 12-week Qigong program (pronounced chee kung), an exercise program that involves gentle movements combined with breathing/relaxation techniques, also known as mind-body exercise, leads to improvement of pain, physical function, and quality of life among breast cancer survivors that have significant pain following surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qigong For PPSP In Breast Cancer Pain In Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot/feasibility study designed to look at the potential benefits of a 12-week program of Qigong mind-body exercise program. The study applies to women who have completed physical therapy treatment on symptoms such as pain, and difficulty moving/strength of arm in women who are experiencing on-going symptoms after breast cancer surgery. The results of this study will be used to help design future studies of the effect of Qigong programs in breast cancer survivors.</detailed_description>
