	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether epidural levobupivacaine applied for the purpose of post-operative analgesia compared to systemic analgesia with morphine leads to better pain control, stronger suppression of the inflammatory response and the production of inflammatory mediators, faster recovery of patients and consequently less incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients after surgical treatment of femoral fractures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research will be carried out at the Department of Surgery at Clinical Hospital Centre(CHC) Osijek after approval by the Ethics Committee of CHC Osijek and will be organized as a prospective randomized trial. Respecting the including and excluding criteria for participation in the study, the research will include 70 patients aged 65 years and over who are undergoing surgery for proximal femur fractures and will be operated with the same operating technique (osteosynthesis with nail). All participants will receive the same type of anesthesia and one of two forms of post-operative analgesia, so it will be divided into two groups (35 patients) depending on which form of post-operative analgesia receive. Randomization will be performed by drawing an envelope in which the specified one or other form of post-operative analgesia will be written. The study will be stopped in case of serious complications life-threatening (excessive sedation, respiratory insufficiency, hemodynamic instability and profound hypotension, heart rhythm disorders), which could possibly be related to the administration of drugs used for postoperative analgesia.</detailed_description>
