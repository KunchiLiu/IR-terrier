	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to determine the safety and tolerability of increasing doses and different infusion times of AFM11 infusion in patients with adult B-precursor ALL</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study to Assess AFM11 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Adult B-precursor ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive type of leukemia characterized by an overproduction of lymphoblasts or lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood; it is frequently accompanied by suppression of normal hematopoiesis. It can spread to the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, the central nervous system (CNS), and other organs (sanctuary sites). Without treatment, ALL usually progresses quickly. B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells express surface antigens that parallel their respective developmental lineages. Precursor B-cell ALL cells typically express CD10, CD19, and CD34 on their surface, along with nuclear terminal deoxynucleotide transferase. About 20% of adult ALL patients have a cytogenetic abnormality that is indistinguishable from the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1, t(9;22)), according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The rationale for the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both malignant cells via its anti-CD19 domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This results in the formation of the "immunological synapse" and the subsequent T-cell activation on leading to killing of malignant cells. AFM11 has 2 binding sites for CD19 and 2 for CD3, its molecular weight is ~ 105kDa compared to diabodies like blinatumomab with one binding site for each target and a much lower molecular weight ~ 55kDa. In addition, preclinical experiments have shown that AFM11 has about a 100 fold higher affinity to CD3 compared to diabodies and is inducing higher cytotoxicity in vitro in the presence of low effector:target cell ratios. These differences might allow for a shortening of the infusion times and potentially higher clinical efficacy compared to blinatumomab.</detailed_description>

Patients with CD19+ Philadelphiachromosome positive ALL who failed or were intolerant to therapy with at least 2 approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors 3. More than 5% blasts in bone marrow 4. In patients with high tumor burden (e.g., more than 50% blasts, or more than 15,000 blasts /µL blood, or elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) &gt; 2 × upper limit of normal [ULN]), a pre treatment with 10 mg/m2 dexamethasone and 200 mg cyclophosphamide could be administered for up to 5 days. 5. Patients of both genders, age ≥ 18 6. Homogenous CD19 expression on leukemic blasts must be confirmed by either: 1. Prior results from a CD19+ staining or flow cytometry at the most recent available diagnostic bone marrow biopsy or aspirate, or 2. Submission of a recent bone marrow biopsy for staining for CD19 positivity. The results of this testing need to be available prior to start of AFM11 treatment. 7.

Prior treatment with blinatumomab or any other CD19 targeting Tcell engager, including CD19 CART cells 5. Treatment with donorlymphocyte infusions within 4 weeks of start of AFM11 treatment or existing Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) 6. Known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) involvement: 1. Evidence for presence of malignant disease, inflammatory lesions, and/or vasculitis on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 2. Infiltration of the cerebrospinal fluid by malignant Bcells, confirmed by lumbar puncture 7. History of or current relevant CNS pathology as epilepsy, seizure, paresis, aphasia, apoplexia, severe brain injuries, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, psychosis 8.

Therapy with antibody, or antibody constructs within 4 weeks prior to the start of AFM11 treatment, or at least 4 halflives, whichever is longer 10. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to start of AFM11 treatment, or at least 4 times the respective halflife, whichever is longer 11. Contraindication for any of the concomitant medications 12.

History of malignancy other than Bcell lymphoma or Bprecursor ALL within 5 years prior to study entry, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix 14. Uncontrolled infections; known bacteremia 15. Any concurrent disease or medical condition that is deemed to interfere with the conduct of the study as judged by the Investigator 16.
