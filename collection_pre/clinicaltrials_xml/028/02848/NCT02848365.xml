	<brief_summary>Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a common problem following the use of endotracheal intubation during general anaesthesia. It leads to dissatisfaction and discomfort after surgery and can delay a patient's return to normal routine activities. POST has been rated by patients as the eighth most adverse effect in the postoperative period. The incidence of sore throat after endotracheal intubation varies from 14.4-90%. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation also leads to hemodynamic stress response. The response can be deleterious in patient with or without cardiac disease. It is related to the degree of manipulation of the airway during endotracheal intubation and has been studied during intubation for some equipment used for endotracheal intubation</brief_summary>
