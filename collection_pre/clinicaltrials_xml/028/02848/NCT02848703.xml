	<brief_summary>Myocardial perfusion is a major parameter characterizing the status of capillary circulation of the myocardium. Its quantification is possible using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) during the 1st pass of a contrast agent through the capillary system. This technique is radiation-free, but it is difficult to repeat measurements during a single exam. Also, a number of patients suffering from cardiac disease cannot receive contrast agent injections. The investigators have developed a totally non-invasive approach for quantifying myocardial perfusion. It is based on the magnetic labeling of arterial spins. Flowing into the capillaries (Arterial spin labeling, ASL). Goal : The major goal of this research protocol is to validate a totally non-invasive method of myocardial blood flow quantification using MRI without contrast agent injection</brief_summary>
