	<brief_summary>This study investigates the levels of advanced oxidation protein product and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in gingival crevicular fluid in periodontal disease and health. 25 participants with chronic periodontitis, 25 participants with gingivitis and 25 periodontally healthy subjects are included into this study. In each participant, four sites are identified for gingival crevicular fluid samples.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxidative stress is the disequilibrium between the formation of free radicals and antioxidant defense mechanisms via damaging cellular macromolecules (DNA, protein, lipid, etc..) which are susceptible to oxidative damage. Advanced oxidation protein product is identified as a new marker of protein oxidation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is a major chemoattractant for lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages.</detailed_description>
