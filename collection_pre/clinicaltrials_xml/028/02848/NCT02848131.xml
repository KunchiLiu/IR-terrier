Active immunosuppression therapy, 8. Hemoglobin A1câ‰¥10% at screening, 9. History of active substance abuse (including alcohol) within the past 2 years, 10. Current alcohol abuse (&gt;3 alcoholic beverages/day or &gt;21 per week), 11. Body weight &gt;150 kg or body mass index&gt;50 12. Human immunodeficiency virus infection 13. Active hepatitis B or C infection 14. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy 15. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to dasatinib or quercetin 16. Inability to give informed consent 17. Uncontrolled systemic lupus erythematosus 18. Uncontrolled pleural/pericardial effusions or ascites 19. New invasive cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancers 20. Invasive fungal or viral infection 21. Inability to tolerate oral medications 22. Total bilirubin&gt;2x upper limit of normal 23. Subjects taking medications that are sensitive to substrates or substrates with a narrow therapeutic range for CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus). If antifungals are absolutely necessary from an infectious disease perspective, then they will be allowed only if the levels are therapeutic. 24. Subjects on strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. 25. Subjects on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, factor Xa inhibitors, etc). 26. Subjects on antiplatelet agents (e.g. full dose aspirin which is deemed mandatory for treatment, clopidogrel, etc.). Baby aspirin, if necessary for cardioprotection, will be allowed. 27. Subjects on quinolone antibiotic therapy for treatment or for prevention of infections within 10 days 28. Subjects taking H2antagonists or proton pump inhibitors and unwilling to discontinue therapy 1 week prior and 2 weeks following enrollment. 29. Corrected QT interval (QTc)&gt;450 msec</criteria>
