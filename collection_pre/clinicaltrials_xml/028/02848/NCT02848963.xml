	<brief_summary>ASA I-II 3-12 years old children participated to this study. All Participants will divide into the three groups. In Groups I, 2,5 mg/kg propofol and 0,5 mg/kg ketamine will apply at anaesthesia induction. General anaesthesia will be performed with 5/1 ratio of ketamine-propofol mixture with %67 of Mcfarlan dose regiment. In Groups II, 2,75 mg/kg propofol and 0,41 mg/kg ketamine will apply at anaesthesia induction. General anaesthesia will be performed with 6,7/1 ratio of ketamine-propofol mixture with %80 of Mcfarlan dose regiment. In Groups III, 3 mg/kg propofol and 0,3 mg/kg ketamine will apply at anaesthesia induction. General anaesthesia will be performed with 10/1 ratio of ketamine-propofol mixture with %90 of Mcfarlan dose regiment. After than surgical operation recovery time, PAED scores, FLACC scores, Staying time in PACU will be recorded. These data will be evaluated with statistically.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ASA I-II, 3-12 years old children who will operate due to tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. will be participated in to this study. All Participants will divide into the three groups. In Groups I, 2,5 mg/kg propofol and 0,5 mg/kg ketamine will apply at anaesthesia induction. General anaesthesia will be performed with 5/1 ratio of ketamine-propofol mixture with %67 of Mcfarlan dose regiment. In Groups II, 2,75 mg/kg propofol and 0,41 mg/kg ketamine will apply at anaesthesia induction. General anaesthesia will be performed with 6,7/1 ratio of ketamine-propofol mixture with %80 of Mcfarlan dose regiment. In Groups III, 3 mg/kg propofol and 0,3 mg/kg ketamine will apply at anaesthesia induction. General anaesthesia will be performed with 10/1 ratio of ketamine-propofol mixture with %90 of Mcfarlan dose regiment. McFarlan dose regiments include 15 mg/kg/h infusion during 15 minutes, 13 mg/kg/h infusion during second 15 minutes, 11 mg/kg/h infusion from 30 to 60 minutes, 10 mg/kg/h from 1 to 2 h. Anaesthesia dept will be detect with BIS monitoring during operation. After than surgical operation recovery time, PAED scores, FLACC scores, staying time in PACU and extubation time will be record. At the end of the study, these data will be evaluated with statistically.</detailed_description>
