	<brief_title>An Image-guided SBRT for Adrenal Gland Metastasis in Oligometastatic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, single arm, trial for testing efficacy of ablative high hypofractionated dose delivered with VMAT technique in oligometastatic patients with adrenal gland metastases. The potential advantages of this approach include the possibility to lead an increased local control in irradiated adrenal gland metastases. Other purpose of this study is to assess acute and late toxicity in terms of maintenance of endocrine mechanisms of hormonal production.</detailed_description>
