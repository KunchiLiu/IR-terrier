	<brief_summary>Emergence agitation (EA) is highly prevalent in children after surgery. Risk factors for EA are Eye, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain. There are several preventive strategies but none of them completely prevent EA. Topical application of ropivacaine can reduce post-tonsillectomy pain. Therefore, it might reduce the incidence of postoperative EA.</brief_summary>
