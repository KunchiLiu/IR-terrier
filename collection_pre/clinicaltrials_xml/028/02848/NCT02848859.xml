	<detailed_description>For this pilot study, the investigators will recruit up to 30 participants with insomnia and coronary heart disease. Another 30 patients will be recruited from another institution. Patients will be screened with a modified version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a brief self-report instrument validated for identifying insomnia. The investigators will modify the ISI to include exclusionary criteria. The investigators will randomize participants to 6 weeks of access to web based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (wCBT-I) using an internet based CBT-I program plus education provided through access to the Harvard Sleep Education web site (which provides general sleep education information only) compared to 6 weeks of access to the Harvard Sleep Education web site, followed by access to the web-CBT program (a wait list control group). The investigators will test the hypothesis that use of wCBT-I improves sleep quality and sleep duration as measured by sleep diaries and the ISI. A secondary goal of the study is to assess the recruitment yields, retention and adherence rates.</detailed_description>
