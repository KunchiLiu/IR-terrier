	<brief_summary>This study aimed to evaluate the effect on the calcium balance of a concentrate with 1 mM citrate and locate the equivalent concentration of calcium (Ca_eq) at a concentration of 3 mM acetate and traditional with 1.5 mM calcium in HD. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance in the medium term of purifying the concentrate with 1 mM citrate and Ca_eq, compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM acetate and 1.5 mM calcium in HD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to find the formulation of calcium (1.50, 1.65 and 1.75 mM) in the bath with 1 mM citrate which allows the equivalence of calcium balance (Ca_eq) in a sitting HD compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM of calcium acetate and 1.5. Secondary objectives - Evaluate the purifying performance of small and medium-sized molecules in HD with concentrated with 1 mM citrate and Ca_eq compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM calcium acetate and 1.5. - Observe the effects on hemodynamic of the concentrate through the variation of the pre and post-dialysis blood pressure and intradialytic symptoms (cramps, hypotension, headache). - Evaluate the variations of the parameters of mineral metabolism: Predialytic values of PTH, alkaline phosphatase treatments with concentrated Cit (1 mM citrate and Ca_eq) and concentrated with traditional Ac (3 mM calcium acetate and 1.5).</detailed_description>
