	<brief_title>Pretherapeutic Paraaortic Lymphadenectomy in Women With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Versus Definitive Chemoradiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patients will be equally randomized between the 2 following treatment groups: - Standard of care arm: standard chemoradiation (whole pelvis chemoradiation therapy). - Experimental arm: pretherapeutic paraaortic lymphadenectomy followed by tailored chemoradiation. Pretherapeutic lymphadenectomy will be performed via the laparoscopic extraperitoneal or transperitoneal approach using either traditional laparoscopy or robotically-assisted laparoscopy. The surgery (extraperitoneal or transperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy) is considered investigational. Chemoradiation treatment (with either pelvis or tailored radiation) is considered as standard treatment approved in France for the treatment of cervical cancer.</detailed_description>
