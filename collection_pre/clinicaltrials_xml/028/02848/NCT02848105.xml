	<brief_summary>aGVHD remains as complication in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Methylprednisolone at 1~2mg/kg is considered as standard first-line treatment. In recent lab study, we demonstrated that valproic acid (VPA) as histone deacetylase inhibitor can inhibit CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells and control the aGVDH in mice model while preserve the GVL effects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that adding VPA to standard dose steroid treatment may improve the outcome of aGVHD.</brief_summary>
