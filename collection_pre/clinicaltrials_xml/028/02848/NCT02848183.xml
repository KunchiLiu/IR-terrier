	<brief_title>Optimal Treatment Strategy Based on for Pediatric AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I. Risk group assessment Favorable prognosis group: Low risk features + Good response Intermediate prognosis group: 1. Low risk features + Delayed response-1 2. Standard risk features + Good response 3. Standard risk features + Delayed response-1 Poor prognosis group: 1. Any high risk features irrespective of treatment response 2. Any delayed response-2 irrespective of risk features 3. Any refractory state irrespective of risk features 4. Any early relapse II. Chemotherapy Induction-1: Cytarabine + idarubicin Induction-2: High dose (HD) cytarabine + mitoxantrone Consolidation-1: Cytarabine + idarubicin Consolidation-2: HD cytarabine + etoposide Consolidation-3: HD cytarabine + mitoxantrone Consolidation-4: HD cytarabine + etoposide III. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Favorable prognosis group: chemotherapy only Intermediate prognosis group: chemotherapy or HSCT with reduced intensity conditioning Poor prognosis group: HSCT with myeloablative conditioning</detailed_description>
