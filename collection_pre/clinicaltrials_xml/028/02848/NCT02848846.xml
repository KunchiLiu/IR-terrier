	<brief_summary>The NEBIAS ("NEurocontrolled BIdirectional Artificial upper limb and hand prosthesiS") proposal aims at developing and clinically evaluating (in selected amputees) a neuro-controlled upper limb prosthesis intuitively controlled and felt by the amputee as the natural one. This will be possible by means of a novel neural interface able to provide a stable and very selective connection with the nervous system. This goal will be achieved by combining microtechnology and material science and will allow, on one side, recording of the motor-related signals governing the actions of the amputated hand/arm for the motion control of a mechanical prosthesis, and on the other providing sensory feedback from tactile and kinesthetic sensors through neuromorphic stimulation of the adequate afferent pathway within the residual limb. The NEBIAS proposal is also aimed at finding out the 'language' intrinsically linking central nervous system with peripheral nerve signals in order to govern simple and complex hand/fingers movements. To reach this goal, a variety of techniques exploring brain and nerve functions will be assembled and integrated; this includes the analysis of electromagnetic brain and nerve signals, as well as of movement-related changes in brain's blood flow/metabolism.</brief_summary>
