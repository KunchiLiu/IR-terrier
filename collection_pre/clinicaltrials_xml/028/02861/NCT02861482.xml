	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the top reason for maternal deaths in China. The four major causes of PPH include uterine atony, genital tract laceration, placenta factors and systemic medical disorders (including inherited and acquired coagulopathy). Management of PPH contains the application of uterotonic agents, using hemostasis agents, transfusion of blood component products, conservative procedures (intrauterine packing or balloon tamponade, compression sutures, vascular ligation and uterine artery embolization using sponges), and even hysterectomy. The Bakri Balloon has attained its efficacy and popularity ever since it was invented by Doctor YN. Bakri. Although it is recommended by many countries as a routine procedure for PPH management, the Bakri Balloon is not yet a first choice in China due to lack in clinical data of preventive usage. The aim of this study is to prove the efficacy and safety of the Bakri Balloon in early management of PPH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Usage of Bakri Ballon in Managing Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data of 472 patients from 20 different hospitals had a Bakri balloon tamponade. Enrolled patients would follow the next process: assessment of blood loss intrapartum and 2 hours postpartum; laying the Bakri Balloon; assessment of blood loss, uterine contraction and complications after Bakri Balloon tamponade; further conservative surgical measures (uterine placation (B-lynch suture), arterial embolization; artery ligation; cervical cerclage) or even hysterectomy if necessary; recording the puerperium infection and involution of uterus. Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 database. The results were expressed as mean Â± standard deviations or median with interquartile range. Differences between groups were assessed by Student's unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square test as appropriate. Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank correlation method. To identify independent relationships and adjust the effects of covariates, multiple linear regression analyses were performed. P values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</detailed_description>
