	<brief_title>A Study on the Efficacy and Gut Microbiota of Berberine and Probiotics in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the present study, about 400 newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients will be enrolled from multiple centers in China. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by age. After screening, eligible subjects will be given Gentamycin Sulfate Sustained-release Tablets 80mg bid po for a week at the washout period, then all participants will be randomly assigned into one of the following four groups: Berberine hydrochloride tablets（0.6g bid po）and ProMetS probiotics powder（4g qN po), Berberine placebo tablets（6 pills bid po) and ProMetS probiotics powder (4g qN po), Berberine hydrochloride tablets（0.6g bid po）and Probiotics placebo powder (2 strips qN po), Berberine placebo tablets（6 pills bid po) and Probiotics placebo powder (2 strips qN po) for 3 months. Blood, feces and urine samples will be collected before and after treatment. HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), GLP-1 , lipids, amino acids, bile acids and other metabolic related components and parameters will be measured. Furthermore, the change of gut microbiota will be evaluated too.</detailed_description>
