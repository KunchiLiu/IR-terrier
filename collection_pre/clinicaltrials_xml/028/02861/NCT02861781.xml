	<brief_summary>This project aims at identifying new determinants of type 2 diabetes in severe obesity. To do so, a biological collection, including tissues of interest in the field of metabolism, will be collected during bariatric surgery in obese patients. Three different groups of metabolic status of patients, corresponding to different stages of evolution of the disease, will be constituted: type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity. The main objective is to compare, between these 3 groups of patients, several biological processes that may be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and disorders associated with obesity, including: - Abnormalities of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome in all target tissues (plasma, serum, muscle, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, omental artery, liver) - Identification of metabolic signatures, protein and miRNA in plasma - Immunoinflammatory response in adipose tissue - Polymorphisms SNP from whole blood - Histological analysis of tissue sections This main objective will be studied on samples taken at the time of surgery Secondary objectives will be to study the changes in metabolites, proteins and miRNA in plasma level 3 and 12 months after the completion of surgery, according to the initial metabolic state.</brief_summary>
