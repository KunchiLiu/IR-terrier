The prevalence of keratoconus will be compared to known data of literature about general population. The secondary purpose is to search for a relationship between the presence of a keratoconus and activity criteria of IBD. Perspectives are a systematic screening for keratoconus in patients affected by IBD with the amelioration of the ophthalmologic care of IBD patients and confirmation of the recent hypothesis of inflammatory origin of keratoconus.</brief_summary>
