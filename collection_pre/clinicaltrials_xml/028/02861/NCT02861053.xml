	<brief_summary>The chronic fatigue is observed in approximately 40 % of the patients with a chronic quiet inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and impacts the quality of life of the patients. The beneficial role of a regular physical activity on the quality of life of patients having an IBD was demonstrated in 5 studies including only 1 controlled one [Bilski, on 2013]. The mechanism by which the physical activity could improve the quality of life of the patients remains unknown (stress decreased, reduction of the inflammatory process) [Bilski, on 2014]. Several studies concerning other chronic pathologies such as fibromyalgia, have demonstrated the beneficial effect of a regular physical exercise to reduce the fatigue of patients. It was recently demonstrated that the chronic fatigue observed in patients with IBD came along with a physical reduction in the performances during the exercise test and a reduction in the physical activity of the patients [Vogelaar, 2015]. Our hypothesis is that a regular moderate physical activity could improve physical performance during an effort et could reduce the chronic fatigue and improve their quality of life.</brief_summary>
