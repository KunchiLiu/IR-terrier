	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding olanzapine 5mg to standard antiemetic medication can significantly reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy regimens such as anthracycline with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. To help clinicians prescribe antiemetic medications in a more patient-centered, evidence-based and cost-effective manner, we've developed the world's first validated risk-stratification tool for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and because of this, it is now possible to perform a trial of personalized precision antiemetic therapy for breast cancer patients. Despite widespread antiemetic use, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains among the most feared and expected side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer. Inadequately controlled CINV can significantly reduce a patient's quality of life, impair functional activity, lead to chemotherapy dose delays and reductions, and even discontinuation of treatment. The merit of current antiemetic medications is based on their ability to control chemotherapy-induced vomiting, but not necessarily nausea, and nausea is the major issue for breast cancer patients. With olanzapine demonstrating significant promise in preventing acute and delayed nausea, the investigators are proposing to evaluate guideline-recommended aprepitant-based triple regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg) for patients at high personal risk for CINV. For patients at low personal risk for CINV the investigators will also evaluate guideline-recommended double antiemetic regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg).</brief_summary>
