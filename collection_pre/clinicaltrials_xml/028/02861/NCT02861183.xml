	<brief_title>Study of Sodium Hyaluronate to Provide Symptomatic Relief of Lateral Epicondylosis (Tennis Elbow)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of two weekly peri-osteotendinous injections of OVT for relief of pain in patients with lateral epicondylosis in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled superiority study. A total of 186 subjects will be enrolled at up to 20 centers in the US and Europe. The randomization ratio will be 2:1 (2 OVT subjects: 1 placebo subject). The entire study duration from first subject in to last subject out is approximately one year. The enrollment phase is approximately 6 months with a follow-up phase of 6 months. Visits are scheduled at baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 26 weeks. Study injections will be given at the baseline and 1 week visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age 2. Clinical diagnosis of unilateral lateral epicondylosis defined as: 1. Pain reproducible on palpation of the lateral epicondyle / common extensor origin; and 2. Pain reproducible during resisted wrist extension 3. Subject is symptomatic for at least 6 weeks 4. Subject has pain in the index lateral epicondyle after grip strength testing that measures â‰¥ 40 mm on a 100 mm VAS 5. Subject must be willing to abstain from other pharmacological and surgical treatments of the index elbow for the duration of the study 6. Subject is willing to discontinue all systemic and/or topical analgesics including NSAIDs, (except the rescue medication oral acetaminophen/paracetamol), for the treatment of lateral epicondylosis at least seven days before the initial treatment injection and through the completion of the study 7. If pain medication is needed during the study, subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 3.0 grams per day per the package insert) for the treatment of elbow pain for the duration of the study 8. At least twenty four hours prior to the Baseline Visit and each followup visit, the subject must discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol, if used 9. Subject is able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study and voluntarily provides consent 1. Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the hyaluronan or an inability to tolerate acetaminophen/paracetamol 2. Subjects in which the investigator believes the anatomical landmarks for injection are unable to be adequately identified 3. Subjects who have a history of surgery to the intraarticular joint of the index elbow and/or history of index elbow dislocation 4. Any diagnosed pathology or trauma that causes pain or symptoms in the index elbow other than lateral epicondylosis (e.g. intraarticular pathology, ligament injury, cervical radiculopathy, radial tunnel syndrome, osteochondral radiocapitellar lesion or posterolateral elbow plica, pain starting after a motor vehicle accident) 5. Hyaluronic acid injections in the index elbow within the last 6 months 6. Steroid injections in the index elbow within the last 3 months 7. Infections or skin diseases in the area of the injection site or elbow joint 8. Known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, or other preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact healing or affect the ability of the subject to complete the study and comply with the study requirements 9. Subject is taking medications at the time of consent which could interfere with the treatment procedure, healing and/or assessments. This includes but is not limited to oral or injectable anticoagulant treatments, antiaggregant platelet treatment and opioid analgesics. Low dose aspirin (81 mg) used for cardiovascular protection is allowed if a stable regimen is maintained for the duration of the study. 10. Subject is receiving or in litigation for worker's compensation 11. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding at the screening visit or a woman of child bearing potential who refuses to use effective contraception during the course of the study 12. Subject was involved in any other research study involving an investigational product, or a new application of an approved product, within 60 days of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF)</criteria>
