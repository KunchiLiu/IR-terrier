	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental dentifrice containing stannous fluoride, an established dentine tubule occlusion technology, at reducing dentine hypersensitivity (DH) compared to a negative control dentifrice. The test and control dentifrices will be administered for a total of 8 weeks, with assessments (via evaporative air and tactile stimuli) at baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks twice-daily use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Efficacy of an Experimental Occlusion Technology Dentifrice in Dentinal Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, 2 treatment arm, parallel group design study, stratified by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score (of the two selected teeth), with a treatment period of 8 weeks will investigate the clinical effectiveness of an experimental stannous fluoride dentifrice in the reduction of DH. DH will be assessed at Baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks treatment to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent and has received a signed and dated copy of the informed consent form Aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and restrictions. Good general and mental health with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically qualified designee: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities in medical history or upon oral examination and absence of any condition that would impact on the participant's safety or well being or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. At Screening Selfreported history of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) lasting more than six months but not more than 10 years. Good general oral health, with a minimum of 20 natural teeth. Minimum of 2 accessible nonadjacent teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), preferably in different quadrants, that meet all of the following criteria; signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of erosion or abrasion (EAR), tooth with MGI score =0 adjacent to the test area (exposed dentine) only and a clinical mobility of ≤1 and tooth with signs of sensitivity measured by qualifying evaporative air assessment (Schiff sensitivity score ≥1). At Baseline (Visit 2) Minimum of two, nonadjacent accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), that meet all of the following criteria i.e. Tooth with signs of sensitivity, measured by response to a qualifying tactile stimulus (Yeaple ≤ 20g) and evaporative air assessment (Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2). Exclusion Criteria Women who are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the duration of the study. Women who are breastfeeding. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. Participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit, previous participation in this study and participation in another tooth desensitizing treatment study within 8 weeks of the screening visit. Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse. An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family. Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes, presence of a condition which, in the opinion of the investigator is causing xerostomia. Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of Screening, tongue or lip piercing or presence of dental implants and gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery) within 12 months of Screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of Screening. Teeth bleaching within 8 weeks of Screening. Desensitising treatment within 8 weeks of screening (professional sensitivity treatments and nondentifrice sensitivity treatments). Specific Dentition Exclusions For Test Teeth a) Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay within 12 months of Screening b) Tooth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine. C) Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthecounter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator. Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentine hypersensitivity within 8 weeks of screening (Participants will be required to bring their current oral care products to the site in order to verify the absence of known antisensitivity ingredients). Any subject who, in the judgment of the investigator, should not participate in the study, any condition which in the opinion of the investigator would impact on the subject's safety or wellbeing or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. Daily doses of medication/treatments or traditional herbal ingredients/treatments which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the perception of pain (Examples of such medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that cause marked or moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquilisers, antidepressants, moodaltering and antiinflammatory drugs and examples of herbal ingredients/treatments include clove oil, olive oil, or other treatments that are directly applied to the oral cavity for the treatment of oral health conditions). Currently taking antibiotics or has taken antibiotics within 2 weeks of Baseline. Daily dose of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, is causing xerostomia. Individuals who require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures.</criteria>
