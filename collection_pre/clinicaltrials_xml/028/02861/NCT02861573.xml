	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combination therapy in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). There will be three cohorts in this study with 70 participants enrolled in each cohort: Cohort A will receive pembrolizumab + olaparib, Cohort B will receive pembrolizumab + docetaxel + prednisone, and Cohort C will receive pembrolizumab + enzalutamide. Outcome measures will be assessed individually for each cohort.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Combination Therapies in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (MK-3475-365/KEYNOTE-365)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assignment of patients to a cohort will be based on prior treatment. Participants assigned to Cohort A must have previously received docetaxel for mCRPC. Participants assigned to Cohort B must have previously received either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) in the pre-chemotherapy mCRPC state. Participants assigned to Cohort C must have previously received abiraterone acetate in the pre-chemotherapy mCRPC state (prior docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is allowed if ≥4 weeks have elapsed from the last dose of docetaxel).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Has histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell histology Is able to provide tumor tissue from a site not previously irradiated as follows: Cohort A must provide a core or excisional biopsy from soft tissue or bone biopsy within 1 year of screening and after developing mCRPC; Cohort B: must provide an archival tumor tissue sample or tumor tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy from soft tissue if the lesion is clinically accessible; and Cohort C with soft tissue disease must provide a core or excisional biopsy from a soft tissue lesion if clinically accessible within 1 year of screening and after developing mCRPC and an archival specimen if available. Participants with bone metastasis only must provide an archival tumor tissue specimen. Has documented prostate cancer progression within 6 months prior to screening, as determined by the investigator, by means of one of the following: PSA progression as defined by a minimum of 2 rising PSA levels with an interval of ≥1 week between each assessment where the PSA value at screening should be ≥2 ng/mL; radiographic disease progression in soft tissue based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 criteria with or without PSA progression; radiographic disease progression in bone defined as the appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions on bone scan with or without PSA progression Has ongoing androgen deprivation with serum testosterone &lt;50 ng/dL (&lt;2.0 nM). Treatment with luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists or antagonists must have been initiated ≥4 weeks prior to first dose of study therapy and must be continued throughout the study. Participants receiving bone resorptive therapy (including, but not limited to bisphosphonate or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaβ ligand inhibitor) must be on stable doses for ≥4 weeks prior to first dose of study therapy Women of childbearing potential and male participants must agree to use adequate contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Has a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale for Cohorts A and C and a performance status of 0 or 1 for Cohort B For Cohort A: Has received docetaxel for mCRPC. Prior treatment with 1 other chemotherapy for mCRPC is allowed. Up to 2 secondgeneration hormonal manipulations (e.g., abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide) are allowed. For Cohort B: Has received prior treatment with either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) in the prechemotherapy mCRPC state. For Cohort C: Has received prior treatment with abiraterone acetate in the prechemotherapy mCRPC state without prior enzalutamide Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to first dose study therapy or who has not recovered (i.e., Grade ≤1 or at baseline) from AEs due to mAbs administered &gt;4 weeks earlier Is currently participating in and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study drug or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of treatment allocation Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to treatment allocation Has had a prior radium treatment Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis Has previously participated in any other pembrolizumab (MK3475) trial, or received prior therapy with an antiprogrammed cell death 1 (antiPD1), antiPD ligand 1 [antiPDL1], and antiPDL2 Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Has known active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of study therapy Has known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. For Cohort A: Has experienced a seizure or seizures within 6 months of study start or is currently being treated with cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) inducing antiepileptic drugs for seizures For Cohort A: Is currently receiving strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 including azole antifungals; macrolide antibiotics; or protease inhibitors For Cohort A: Is currently receiving strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A4 For Cohort A: Has myelodysplastic syndrome For Cohort A: Has symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or uncontrolled hypertension For Cohort B: Has received prior treatment with docetaxel or another chemotherapy agent for metastatic prostate cancer For Cohort B: Has peripheral neuropathy Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ≥2 except due to trauma For Cohort B: Has ascites and/or clinically significant pleural effusion For Cohort B:Has symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease) For Cohort B: Is currently receiving any of the following classes of inhibitors of CYP3A4: azole antifungals; macrolide antibiotics; or protease inhibitors For Cohort C: Has received prior chemotherapy for mCRPC. Prior docetaxel for metastatic hormonesensitive prostate cancer is allowed if ≥4 weeks elapsed from last dose of docetaxel For Cohort C: Has a history of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure For Cohort C:Has known or suspected brain metastasis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis For Cohort C: Has a history of loss of consciousness within 12 months of the screening visit For Cohort C: Has hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;86 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]) or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;170 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;105 mmHg) at the screening visit For Cohort C: Has received treatment with 5α reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride), estrogens, and/or cytproterone within 4 weeks of the screening visit For Cohort C: Has a history of prostate cancer progression on ketoconazole</criteria>
