	<brief_title>Fractional Microplasma Radiofrequency Technology for Non-hypertrophic Post-burn Scars in Asians: A Prospective Study of 95 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Laser therapy is an emerging, minimally invasive treatment for scars. Among the various techniques, fractional microplasma radiofrequency technology (FMRT) has proved to be effective for various types of scars and skin conditions such as rhytids, striae distensae, and hyperpigmentation. Method: A prospective clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMRT for treating non-hypertrophic post-burn scars in an Asian population. All patients underwent three to five treatment sessions at intervals of 8−16 weeks. The patient and observer scar assessment scales (POSAS) were use to evaluate changes in the burn scars before and after treatment. Intermediate and long-term adverse events were recorded for outcome analysis.</detailed_description>
