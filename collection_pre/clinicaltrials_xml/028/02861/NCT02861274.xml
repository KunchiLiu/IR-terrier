	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate syncope recurrence at follow up in patients with a positive cardio inhibitory response to the head up tilt testing (HUT) evaluation. METHODS: 36 consecutive patients affected by cardio inhibitory syncope to HUT without asystolia (2A type) have been enrolled in this study. These patients have been studied by electrophysiological study (ES). After ES patients have been differently treated (interventional treatment group A, v/s drug therapy group), and followed up during 360 days, to evaluate syncope recurrences.</brief_summary>
