	<criteria>Adult patients diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma who were eligible for highdose melphalan supported with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as part of their treatment plan First mobilization attempt "rhGCSF alone" mobilization regimen Failed mobilization as documented by an increase in CD34+ cell mobilization deemed insufficient to initiate apheresis (below 15/ÂµL), after the 4 first injections of rhGCSF that are administered in the evening Age &lt; 18 years; Primary diagnosis other than MM 2nd or subsequent mobilization attempt Patients who previously received HDCT + autologous HSCT Chemotherapybased mobilization regimen Efficient mobilization, allowing for apheresis and collection of the target cell number (5x106 CD34+ cells/kg for every planned autologous transplantation as per institutional SOPs).</criteria>
