	<brief_title>CONDOL01: Evaluation on the Experience of Bereavement, of a Medical Consultation, Proposed by a Letter of CONDOLence to the Patients' Relatives Versus Standard Practice After the Death of the Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that offering the opportunity to clarify questions about the patients' terminal care will influence positively the grieving process. In particular, the study team hypothesized that psychological morbidity will be reduced (main objective) as well as some aspects of QOL (secondary objective). It is also assumed that the situations of conflict (solicitations for medical records, number of legal procedures) will be reduced.</detailed_description>
