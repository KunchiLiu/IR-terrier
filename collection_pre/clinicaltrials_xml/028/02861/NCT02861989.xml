	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis (OP) and subsequent fractures (OP fractures) are a source of morbidity and high mortality in the elderly. Despite numerous programs aiming at improving OP care, the prevention, diagnostic and treatment remain suboptimal. Barriers to a better care are multiple, both in the general and at-risk population, and in medical practitioners. Since they do not perceive their susceptibility to OP, people do not see the benefit of prevention. In addition, physicians do not give sufficient importance to OP prevention and care, despite the existence of guidelines. The investigators implemented a qualitative study to explore the knowledge and representations regarding osteoporosis in the general and at-risk population and in doctors in Rhône-Alpes Region, France, using focus groups with women and men and semi-structured face-to-face interviews with general practitioners. Understanding barriers to osteoporosis care in patients and general practitioners will help to set up effective strategies to improve prevention and treatment.</brief_summary>
