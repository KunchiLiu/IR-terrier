	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if busulfan with cyclophosphamide (when given with other helper drugs listed below) can help control the diseases listed above when given before a stem cell transplant. The safety of these study drug combinations will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timed Sequential Busulfan and Post Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Allogeneic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: Participant will be assigned to 1 of 2 study groups, depending on what type of stem cells they will receive. - Group 1 will receive stem cells from a haploidentical donor (a donor that is a half match of participant's). - Group 2 will receive stem cells from a matched donor (a donor that is a full match). If participant is in Group 1 they will receive busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, tacrolimus, thiotepa, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). If participant is in Group 2, they will receive busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and tacrolimus. Central Venous Catheter: The chemotherapy participant receives, some of the other drugs in this study, and the stem cell transplant will be given by vein through a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle that will be placed into a large vein while participant is are under local anesthesia. Some blood samples will also be drawn through participant's CVC. The CVC will remain in participant's body during treatment. Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to participant in more detail, and they will be required to sign a separate consent form. Study Drug Administration: For a stem cell transplant, the days before participant receives their stem cells are called minus days. The day participant receives the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after participant receives the stem cells are called plus days. Group 1 only: Participant will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital. If participant receives busulfan as an outpatient, they will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8 and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care. If participant receives busulfan as an inpatient, they will be admitted to the hospital on Day -14 and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care. Participant will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will rest on Days -11 through -8. On Day -7, participant will receive thiotepa by vein over 4 hours. Starting on Day +5, participant will receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 90 days or longer, if the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest. Group 2 only: Participant will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital. If participant receives busulfan as an outpatient, they will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will be admitted to the hospital on Day -7 and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care. If participant receives busulfan as an inpatient, they will be admitted to the hospital on Day -14 and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care. Participant will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will rest on Days -11 through -7. Both Groups: Both groups will receive: - Busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein over 1 hour on Days -6 through -3. - On Day 0, participant will receive the stem cell transplant by vein. - Cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours on Days +3 and +4 to help lower the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as stem cells, attacks the tissues of the recipient's body). - Starting on Day +5, participant will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until they are able to take it by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. Participant will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day for about 3 months. After that, participant's tacrolimus dose may be lowered if they do not have GVHD. Participant's doctor will discuss this with them. - Starting 1 week after participant's stem cell transplant, they will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day until their blood cell levels return to normal. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells and is part of participant's standard care. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing: About 11 samples of blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing at time points before and after participant receives their first dose of busulfan. The study staff will tell participant the blood testing schedule. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points and will help the doctor decide participant's dose of busulfan for Days -6 through -3. If the doctor thinks it is needed, PK blood testing may also be done on Day -6 during participant's dose of busulfan. A heparin lock line will be placed in participant's vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical reasons, participant will be taken off study. The study doctor will discuss this with participant. Length of Study: Participant will be on study for up to 3 years after the transplant. Participant may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if they have any intolerable side effects, of if they are unable to follow study directions. Participant should talk to the study doctor if they want to leave the study early. If participant is taken off study early, they still may need to return for routine follow-up visits after the transplant, if their doctor thinks it is needed. It may be life-threatening to leave the study after participant has begun to receive the study drugs but before they receive the stem cells. Study Tests: As part of standard care, participant will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the transplant. While participant is in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn every day to check for side effects, for routine tests, to check participant's blood counts, to check their kidney and liver function, and to check for infections. After participant is sent home from the hospital, they must remain in the Houston area to be checked for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after transplant. During this time, participant will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week. At each visit, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. About 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant: - Participant will have a physical exam and they will be checked for symptoms of GVHD. - Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn to see how participant's body has reacted to the transplant. - If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, they will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. This is an investigational study. Busulfan, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, filgrastim, MMF, tacrolimus, and thiotepa are FDA approved and commercially available. It is investigational to give cyclophosphamide in combination with busulfan and fludarabine with a stem cell transplant. Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
