	<brief_summary>The aim is to compare effective growth true hypoplastic pulmonary arteries using Right Ventricle Outflow Tract Reconstruction by femoral allogenic vein valve conduit and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choice of Palliative Procedures for Pulmonary Atresia With Ventricular Septal Defect Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of femoral allogenic vein valve conduit for Right Ventricle Outflow Tract Reconstruction is good alternative modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Main advantages is straight, symmetrical, pulsating, systolic blood flow in hypoplastic pulmonary artery, which stimulate growth and prepares for a radical repair. Taking into account the absence randomized studies in this area of medicine, providing investigation evaluating parameters of safety for both methodics is very actual.</detailed_description>
