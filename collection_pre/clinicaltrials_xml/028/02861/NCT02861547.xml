	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality. The Glasgow score alone, assessed at the initial phase, is not enough to determine the prognosis. The aim of this study is to define and to evaluate a prognostic score for early death based on clinical and CT-scan findings in an observational retrospective derivation cohort of patients hospitalized for traumatic brain injury. This cohort will allow us to carry out a uni- and then multi-variate analysis so as to create a prognostic score for early death. We will subsequently test this score in a prospective validation cohort.</brief_summary>
