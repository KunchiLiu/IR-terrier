	<brief_summary>The ACTolog clinical trial IMA101-101 is a first-in-human trial for the ACTolog concept targeting patients with advanced stage solid cancers depending on the expression of ACTolog targets within their tumors. In the IMA101-101 trial, a patient's tumor is first biomarker tested for the expression of ACTolog targets ("antigen warehouse"). Only if the individual tumor is positive for at least one ACTolog target, the patient will be enrolled in the trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within the IMA101-101 study patients with relapsed and/or refractory solid cancers will be treated with autologous CD8+ T-cell products (IMA101) specific for novel targets from the ACTolog warehouse that have been identified by the XPRESIDENT target discovery platform. During production of the autologous T-cell product the patients will receive a further line of established treatment. If this last established therapy option is no longer warranted (e.g. because of disease progression), IMA101 T-cell product will be administered to the patients after a lymphodepleting pre-conditioning with non-myeloablative chemotherapy (Flu/CY). Low-dose IL-2 is given thereafter for 14 days to enhance T-cell persistence.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have pathologically confirmed advanced/metastatic cancer prior to enrollment. 2. HLA phenotype HLAA*02:01 prior to enrollment. 3. Age: ≥18 years and ≤65 years (to select for patients with sufficient proliferative capacity of T cells). 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01. 5. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months prior to enrollment. 6. Patient is a candidate for a maximum of one further line of established therapy (prior to treatment with ACTolog). Additional inclusion criteria as per protocol. 1. Any condition contraindicating leukapheresis. 2. Patients with brain metastases. 3. HIV infection, active Hepatitis B or C infection, or active infections requiring oral or intravenous antibiotics or that can cause a severe disease and pose a severe danger to lab personnel working on patients' blood or tissue. If positive test results are not indicative of an active infection, patients can be included. 4. For the active therapeutic part of the protocol (treatment phase and treatment observation phase): concomitant therapy indicated with any of the following: interferons or other nonstudy immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy (lymphodepleting regimen according to protocol is allowed); immunosuppressive agents; other investigational therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (as long as steroid dose is significantly greater than what is required for physiologic replacement). 5. Previous extensive radiotherapy to the lung or liver during the last 4 months prior to lymphodepletion regimen. 6. The patient has cardiac conditions as follows: uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt; 150/100) despite optimal therapy, uncontrolled angina, ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or above), baseline LVEF ≤ 50%, prior or current cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation with heart rate &gt;100 bpm, unstable ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to starting treatment or angina requiring use of nitrates more than once weekly). 7. Patients with prior stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation. 8. The patient has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease that could compromise participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, severe infection requiring active treatment, severe malnutrition, chronic severe liver or renal disease). 9. Active diverticulitis, intraabdominal abscess, gastrointestinal obstruction, abdominal carcinomatosis or other known risk factors for bowel perforation. 10. History of other malignancies (except for adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ) within the last 5 years. 11. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by serum bHCG, if applicable) or is breastfeeding. 12. Serious autoimmune disease at the discretion of the treating attending: Patients with a history of active serious inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic Lupus Erythematosus or autoimmune vasculitis [e.g. Wegener's Granulomatosis] are excluded from this study. 13. History of hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine or IL2. 14. Immunosuppression, not related to prior treatment for malignancy. 15. History of or current immunodeficiency disease or prior treatment compromising immune function at the discretion of the treating physician. 16. Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures.</criteria>
