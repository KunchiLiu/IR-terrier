	<brief_summary>The present study aimed to evaluate the possible effect of nocturnal melatonin ingestion upon short-term performances, on the following morning. Twelve soccer players from a Tunisian squad (22.9 ±1.3 years, 1.80±0.05 m, and 72.0±8.8 kg) were volunteered to perform three testing sessions, with one test session per day. During each session, MEL (5mg) , MEL (8mg) or placebo were ingested, in a randomized order, before nocturnal sleep. The next morning (08:00h), participants performed the following psycho-cognitive and physical tests: Hooper's index, reaction time, vigilance, handgrip strength , squat jump , modified agility test , Wingate anaerobic test (peak power , mean power and fatigue index ). Rating of perceived exertion was recorded immediately after the WanT, and blood lactate measures were taken after 3min of recovery. Blood glucose was measured before and 3 min after the Wingate test.</brief_summary>
