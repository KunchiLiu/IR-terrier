	<brief_summary>Anemia of inflammation (AI) is a common comorbidity in hemodialysis patients. Paricalcitol is a selective vitamin D receptor activator with potential benefits on anti-inflammatory cytokines expression. The paricalcitol for the secondary hyperparathyroidism control may improve AI decreasing erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) dosage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paricalcitol Improves Anemia of Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia of inflammation and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) are two common clinical complications in patients with chronic kidney disease. Eryptosis (accelerated red blood cell death) is a novel mechanism associated with renal anemia and several factors such us iron, erythropoietin and klotho (anti-aging hormone) deficiency have been associated with this process. The use of the paricalcitol may inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, especially interleukine-6, which is one of the most important cytokine associated with the pathogenesis of the AI. If the use of the paricalcitol for the SHPT control may exert direct influence on the erythropoiesis process is not known.</detailed_description>
