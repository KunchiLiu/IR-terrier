	<brief_summary>Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is considered to be a major surgical procedure resulting in severe postoperative pain, especially in the first 48 hours after surgery. The use of interscalene brachial plexus nerve block remains the cornerstone for analgesia following shoulder surgery; however, with the advent of local infiltration analgesia (LIA), there has been increasing interest in its use for total joint arthroplasty. Since the benefits of local infiltration analgesia within a comprehensive multi-modal analgesia clinical pathway have yet to be established for total shoulder arthroplasty, the Investigators plan to assess and compare analgesia outcomes between three intervention groups: single shot interscalene brachial plexus block (SISB), continuous interscalene brachial plexus block (CISB), and local infiltration analgesia (LIA).</brief_summary>
