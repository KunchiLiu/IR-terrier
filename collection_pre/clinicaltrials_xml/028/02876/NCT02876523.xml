	<brief_summary>The management of hilar biliary strictures remains difficult. These strictures are classified in 4 types (I,II,III and IV). In palliative cases, an endoscopic drainage should be performed in types I and II while a percutaneous drainage is performed in type IV. There is controversy as to whether partial or complete liver drainage should be done. Furthermore there are no standards for drainage types (metallic stents, plastic stents). Morbidity remains high and a multistage procedure can be required. This study aims at evaluating the clinical practices in the investigators' center in order to determine the key factors that contribute to the drainage success or failure.</brief_summary>
