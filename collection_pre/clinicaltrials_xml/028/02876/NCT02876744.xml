	<brief_summary>The contribution of OCT- angiography (OCT-A) allows to consider, in a more or less long term, a drastic reduction in the use of fluorescein angiographies in diabetic retinopathy. The accuracy of the analysis of the vascularization of retinal layers of the posterior pole of the eye by the OCT-A , will detect, early and in a quantifiable manner, whether or not there are areas of macular ischemia in a patient. However, current technical limitations (small field analysis) of OCT-A imaging only allow a limited study of retina at the posterior pole of the fundus. This study seeks to demonstrate whether there is a link between macular ischemia detected by the OCT-A and peripheral retinal ischemia detected by the fluorescein angiographies, in diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
