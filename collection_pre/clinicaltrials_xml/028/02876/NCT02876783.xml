	<brief_title>Analysis of Stroke Rehabilitation Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project involves an interdisciplinary stroke database of demographic variables and clinical measures collected during routine acute care, inpatient rehabilitation admission and discharge as well as follow up questionnaires at 6 month and 12 months to examine stroke recovery. Our aim is to observe and describe the relationships between impairments and function, systematically characterize recovery patterns and examine short and long term rehabilitation outcomes. This project is purely observational, descriptive and non experimental. No rehabilitation interventions or treatment procedures are being introduced, modified or studied.</detailed_description>
