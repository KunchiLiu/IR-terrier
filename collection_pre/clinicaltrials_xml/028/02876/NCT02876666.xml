	<brief_summary>The SCI Virtual Coach study has developed an on-screen, human-like character that will provide support, education and coaching to adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) to aid in the prevention of serious secondary conditions like pressure ulcers. In a randomized controlled trial, participants assigned to "the Coach" intervention will have a touch-screen computer placed in their homes and be asked to interact with the Coach on a daily basis for 2 months. Participants will be asked to complete surveys at baseline and 2 months. The SCI Virtual Coach study aims to measure how accessible and usable participants feel the Coach is, as well as participants' adherence to the Coach's instructions. It will also gauge how effective the Coach is in changing self-care knowledge, health care behaviors, self-efficacy for self-care, and perception of social support in participants.</brief_summary>
