	<brief_summary>In December 2015, Health Canada issued a warning about a potential relationship between suicide and finasteride use and called for further research. No population based studies have assessed the risk of suicide with finasteride use, and this risk is not currently part of the product monograph. Furthermore, the link between depression and finasteride has not been well studied in the older population who are the primary users of this medication.</brief_summary>
