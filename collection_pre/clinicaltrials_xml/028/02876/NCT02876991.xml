	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate if sodium fluoride PET in patients having already undergone a choline PET negative for bone extension (non-metastatic status) modifies the status of patients concerning the existence or not of bone metastases. Secondary purposes are: - To evaluate if detection of bone metastasis by sodium fluoride PET, not detected by choline PET, leads to change of treatment - To evaluate inter-technique concordance (choline vs sodium fluoride PET) of results (metastatic status and number of lesions) - To evaluate the inter-judge concordance of interpretation of sodium fluoride PET - To study the discordance of metastatic status of 2 techniques.</brief_summary>
