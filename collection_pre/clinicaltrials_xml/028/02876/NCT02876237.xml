	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to carry out a prospective analysis of physical impact, psychological, cognitive and social of radiotherapy in all patients over 75 years bearer of localized prostate cancer with an indication of curative radiotherapy. This standardized geriatric assessment will collect social information, functional, sensory, cognitive, emotional, motor, nutritional, and medical related to comorbidities . The quality of life of patients will be evaluated by the QLQ C30 (Quality of Life Questionnaire) European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) before starting treatment, at the end of radiotherapy (2 months) and at 6 months. This short follow-up period seems appropriate in this elderly population and will allow an answer within 2 years to the problem raised in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
