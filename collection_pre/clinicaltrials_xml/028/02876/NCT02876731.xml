	<brief_summary>Prospective, monocentric, comparative, non randomised Primary objective : - to compare the diagnostic accuracy of sodium fluoride PET-CT and MRI using the conventional block and diffusion sequence in the search for bone metastases Secondary objectives : - compare accuracy of MRI diffusion and conventional MRI - explore the evolution of the results of the different types of imaging over time or under treatment for patients with repeated examinations at 6 months</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of NaF PET-CT and Diffusion MRI in the Diagnosis of Bone Metastases (IMMETAOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, monocentric, comparative, non randomised. Organization of NaF PET-CT and MRI on the same day or within a 10 days period. At 6 months : - repeat both exams systematically if one of the initial tests showed a suspicious or doubtful abnormality - final diagnosis by a committee of practitioners using the whole patient's file Scheduled Project inclusion duration of 36 months (possible adaptation of duration in order to obtain the number of required patients)</detailed_description>
