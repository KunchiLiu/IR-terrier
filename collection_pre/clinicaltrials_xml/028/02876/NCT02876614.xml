	<brief_summary>Radionuclide cisternography (RC) is a nuclear medicine examination based on intrathecal injection of [111In]diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ([111In]DTPA). It is prescribed for two recommendations: detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak/fistula and diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus. In the search part of CSF leak/fistula, RC offers the benefit of a 24-hour study of CSF unlike other reference tests. In addition to SPECT/CT imaging, the radiopharmacist performs sampling in nasal cavities and throat of the patient to collect a possible flow of CSF. These samples are analysed by radioactivity measurements and bring an added value to the exam. The interest of this examination for management of CSF leak/fistula remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify and analyse results of all RC examinations performed since 2005 in the Nuclear Medicine department of the Neurological Hospital. The full analysis of patients will allow discussing the role of RC in management of CSF leak/fistulae in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
