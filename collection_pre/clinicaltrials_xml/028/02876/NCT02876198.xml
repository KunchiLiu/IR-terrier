	<brief_summary>The intra-vitreous injection (IVT) of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is currently the standard treatment for retinal neovascularization. The VEGF stimulates endothelial cells' proliferation and migration. It also increases microvascular permeability. If the VEGFs have proven their efficiency in the decrease of choroidal neovascular proliferation, their impact of the head of the optic nerve's microvasculature is yet unknown. Knowing that this microvasculature provides the retinal nerve fibers with oxygen, located in the area of the head of the optic nerve, a vasoconstriction induced by the anti-VEGF may have an incidence on the loss of retinal nerve fibers.</brief_summary>
