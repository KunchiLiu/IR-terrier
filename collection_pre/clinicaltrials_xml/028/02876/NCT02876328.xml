	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three vaccine strategies that may prevent Ebola virus disease (EVD) events in children and adults. Participants will receive either the Ad26.ZEBOV (rHAd26) vaccine with a MVA-BN-Filo (MVA) boost, or the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (rVSV) vaccine with or without boosting, or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two Ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccines, Ad26.ZEBOV (rHAd26) and rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (rVSV), in children and adults. These vaccines will be studied using three different strategies: the rHAd26 vaccine plus a MVA-BN-Filo (MVA) boost, and the rVSV vaccine with or without boosting. During the initial phase of the study, people older than 12 years of age will be enrolled. At Day 0 (study entry), participants will be randomly assigned to receive the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine or placebo. At Day 56, participants who received the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine will receive an MVA boost and participants who received placebo will receive placebo again. When additional safety data for the current lot of the rVSV vaccine becomes available from an ongoing trial in the United States, or when a new lot of the rVSV vaccine becomes available, the trial will be expanded to include the rVSV vaccine strategies and matching placebo. Once this occurs, people 1 year of age or older will be randomized into five groups: the two groups described above, the rVSV vaccine with or without boosting, or a second placebo group. At Day 56, participants who received the rVSV vaccine will receive either an rVSV boost or placebo and participants who received placebo will receive placebo again. Additional study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, and 63, and at Months 3, 6, and 12. Study follow-up may continue for up to 5 years. Study visits may include blood collection and other assessments. Some participants may take part in substudies, which will include blood or saliva collection.</detailed_description>
