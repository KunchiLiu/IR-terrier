	<brief_summary>Study design to define improved management of patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis treated with albendazole and especially make appropriate and timely decision of treatment withdrawal . Based on exploratory analysis of existing and newly developed biological and imaging exams, for diagnosis and follow-up, and study of the relationship of these markers to the viability of the parasite and/or the activity of the parasitic lesions The study included two series of patients: operated on (curative hepatectomy) // non-operated on</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Close follow-up of the patients, based on WHO guidelines (Brunetti, Acta tropica 2010), including albendazole bloods levels determination. Clinical exam, sampling and storing (biobank) of blood specimens at inclusion, M1, M3, M6, M9, M12, M18, M24, M30, M36, M44, M48. Additional sampling for operated on patients : M15 and M21. Imaging each year (US, CT, PET-CT &amp; RMI). Preservation of operative specimens samples at -80Â°C: samples taken at different location (center and periphery of the lesions) and in distant non-infected liver, for further studies of the immune response, RNA detection, and albendazole dosages.</detailed_description>
