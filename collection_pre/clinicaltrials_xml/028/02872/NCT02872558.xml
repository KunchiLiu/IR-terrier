	<brief_title>Shared Decision Making in Parents of Children With Acute Otitis Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our long-term goal is to promote evidence-based, patient-centered evaluation in the acute care setting to more closely tailor antibiotic use to disease risk for Acute Otitis Media (AOM) in children. We will conduct a single-center cluster randomized control trial comparing the efficacy, safety and patient-centered outcomes of the shared decision-making decision aid 'Acute Otitis Media Choice' to usual care among children diagnosed with acute otitis media in the ED for whom antibiotics are being considered to engage parents in shared decision-making.</detailed_description>
