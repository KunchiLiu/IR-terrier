	<brief_title>Integrated Mental Health Care and Vocational Rehabilitation to Individuals on Sick Leave Due to Anxiety and Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Depression and anxiety are important contributors to the global burden of disease and causes negative effects on both the individual and society. Depression and anxiety are very likely to influence the individual's workability and up to 40 % of the people on sick leave in Denmark have common mental disorders like depression and anxiety. There is no clear evidence that mental health care alone will provide sufficient support for vocational recovery for this target group. Integrated vocational and health care services have shown good effects on return to work in other Scandinavian countries. Objective: The purpose of the Danish IBBIS study is to examine the efficacy of 1) a stepped mental health care intervention and 2) an integrated mental health care and vocational rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of depression and anxiety in Denmark. Method: This three-arm, randomized, controlled trial is set up to investigate the effectiveness of the stepped mental health care model and the integrated mental health care and vocational rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of depression and anxiety in Denmark. 603 patients are recruited from Danish job centers in four municipalities. The primary outcome is return to work at 12 months. Results/discussion: This study will contribute with new knowledge on vocational recovery and integrated vocational and health care interventions in a Scandinavian context.</detailed_description>
