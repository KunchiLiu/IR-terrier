	<brief_summary>Cycloergometer is a validated method for different care. This kind of device allow passive and active care for patient. The interest of cycloergometer for patient hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit for Sepsis has never been demonstrated. The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of early mobilization by cyclo-ergometer in association with standard physiotherapy, on the ICU length in patients with septic shock The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the impact of early mobilization by cyclo-ergometer in association with standard physiotherapy on: 1. the duration between hemodynamic stability* and the removal of sedation 2. the duration between the removal of sedation and ICU discharge 3. the mechanical ventilation duration (invasive and noninvasive)</brief_summary>
