	<brief_summary>Title: Embolization of Gastric Arterial Supply for Weight Loss Sample size: 10 patients Study Population: Morbidly obese patients who were seen by the bariatric surgery program at Toronto Western Hospital but are either not interested or not eligible for surgery. Study Design: Single center, randomized, prospective, non-blinded pilot study. Study Duration: 12 months (November 2015 - December 2015). Agent: 150-250 micron polyvinyl alcohol particles Primary objective: To further evaluate the safety of embolization of the left gastric and gastroepiploic arteries. To determine if either or both will result in significant weight loss and decrease in waist circumference among obese patients. Primary objective measure: The number of adverse events in a 1 year period will be recorded. The weight change from baseline will be recorded.</brief_summary>
