	<brief_title>Power Spectral Analysis of EEG During Equi-MAC Inhalation Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volatile anesthetics vary in their relative hypnotic potency. Recent studies demonstrated that equi-minimum alveolar concentration of various volatile anesthetic agents may produce different spectral entropy or bispectral index values. However, there were no studies that demonstrate the difference of hypnotic potency using power spectral analysis of electroencephalographic signals (e.g., spectral edge frequency 95%, total power, % value of each bandage). The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare hypnotic effect of sevoflurane and desflurane at equal minimum alveolar concentrations using power spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram.</detailed_description>
