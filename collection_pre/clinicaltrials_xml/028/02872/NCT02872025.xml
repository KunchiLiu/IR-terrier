	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab in High-risk Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will include 3 dose cohorts using a 3+3 cohort dose escalation design (see figure 1) followed by a 4th cohort at the maximum tolerated dose. Unless a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), defined any grade 3 or 4 toxicity, is observed requiring expansion of a cohort or a subject withdraws, 3 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort in the dose escalation phase. Subjects, upon diagnosis with high risk DCIS, will be offered 2 doses of pembrolizumab injected intralesionally (IL) 3 weeks apart (+/- 1 week) with surgery 3 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after the 2nd dose. The subject will then undergo the surgical treatment as determined by the surgeon and the subject (partial mastectomy or mastectomy). The primary objective of this phase of the study will be safety and feasibility of intralesional injection of pembrolizumab. The maximum tolerated dose will be used in the expansion phase. The expansion cohort will have a target enrollment of 30 subjects randomized to either the control group or the treatment group. 10 subjects will be randomized to the control group and 20 subjects will be randomized to the treatment group. The control group will proceed to surgery alone following the diagnosis of high risk DCIS. The treatment group will receive 2 doses of intralesional pembrolizumab 3 weeks apart (+/- 1 week) prior to surgery. All subjects in the expansion cohort will also undergo a baseline MRI at diagnosis and undergo a 2nd MRI prior to surgery. Baseline and pre-surgical MRI images will be evaluated for changes in tumor volume.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Plan on having surgical treatment to remove the lesion Have at least 2 of the following high risk features associated with her DCIS highgrade (grade IIIII), palpable mass, hormone receptor negative (less than 1%), Her2 positive, young age (less than 45 years old), and large size (greater than 5 cm) Patients with a history of tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibitor use for treatment or prevention are eligible but should discontinue these medications at least 2 weeks prior to starting this trial Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. Be &gt;=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1 Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values All screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. Hematological Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;=1,500/mcL Platelets &gt;=100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;=9 g/dL or &gt;=5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Renal Serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) &gt;=60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 xULN OR Direct bilirubin &lt;= ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;= 2.5 X ULN Albumin &gt;=2.5mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) &lt;=1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) &lt;=1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference Section 5.7.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Is not interested in surgical treatment of her DCIS Has invasive breast cancer Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis) Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.,, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Has history of/active pneumonitis that required/is requiring steroid treatment or had history of/active interstitial lung disease. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies). Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMistÂ®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.</criteria>
