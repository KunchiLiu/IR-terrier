	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET) imaging utilizing 18F-FSPG [(S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid], a glutamic acid derivative, to image patients with ovarian cancer before undergoing surgery or transplant. Diagnostic procedures, such as 18F-FSPG PET, may help find and diagnose ovarian cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Have a presumed diagnosis of advanced stage epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal. a. Pelvic mass and/or omental caking with Ca125:CEA ratio 25:1. Adequate organ function: 1. PCV &gt; 30 (with or without transfusion) 2. WBC: 3000 10,000 The lower level of normal for total WBCs is 4,000, but the NCI considers levels of 3,000 4,000 as mild suppression for drug trials, specifically not requiring treatment. 3. Platelet count &gt; 150, 000 and &lt; 1,000,000 4. Cr &lt; 1.5 5. LFTS &lt; 1.5 x ULN Have undergone or have agreed to undergo standard of care CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 18FFSPG PET imaging will be performed as investigational studies. No prior treatment for ovarian cancer ave undergone or agree to undergo standard of care imaging for ovarian cancer with CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Have noninvasive or nonepithelial ovarian cancer on pathological confirmation. Pregnant and breastfeeding Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL). Other poorly controlled medical conditions that in the opinion of the surgeon, make them not a candidate for primary cytoreductive surgery. CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis demonstrates: 1. Any disease in the thoracic cavity &gt; 1 cm. 2. Any suprarenal lymphadenopathy &gt; 1 cm. 3. Liver metastases &gt; 1 cm. 4. Disease in the porta hepatis or gallbladder fossa &gt; 1 cm. 5. Pleural effusion &gt; 50% volume of the chest cavity on chest xray. 6. Omental extension to the stomach, spleen, or lesser sac. 7. Extension to the pelvic sidewall (this criteria may also be assessed on physical examination. 8. Involvement of the root of the mesentery.</criteria>
