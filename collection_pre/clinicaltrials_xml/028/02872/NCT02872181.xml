	<brief_summary>During Cesarean Delivery pregnant women are frequently tilted to the left 15 degress to reduce compression of the major blood vessels by the uterus. Despite this common practice, there is no conclusive evidence to support this practice. In fact it may even be deleterious to have women positioned in this position. The aim of the study is to determine whether or not tilting women to the left during cesarean section (CS) is helpful or detrimental. The authors hypothesize that left uterine displacement of 15 degrees, which is commonly employed, is useless for preventing compression of these blood vessels. To investigate this question, women will be randomly assigned to either be tilted 15 degrees to the left during CS or positioned flat on the table. Fetal acid base status, vasopressor/phenylephrine use, patient satisfaction, maternal complications, and fetal complications will all be collected and compared.</brief_summary>
