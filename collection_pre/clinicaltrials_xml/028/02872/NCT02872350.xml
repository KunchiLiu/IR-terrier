	<brief_summary>Enterocolitis necrotizing (ECUN) is a common and serious gastrointestinal disease in premature infants. The diagnosis of ECUN based on clinical and radiological criteria. The abdomen plain film to date is the reference examination to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Indeed, the presence of pathognomonic signs (pneumatosis, aéroportie) on the abdomen of cliché can confirm the diagnosis. The prognostic value of these radiographic findings is currently controversial. Abdominal ultrasound is a test whose possibilities in diagnostic and prognostic term began to be considered for some years. It also has other advantages, including that of not being a radiating examination. Studies on the prognostic value of abdominal ultrasound are rather few. Moreover, they involve a series of heterogeneous patients in terms of gestational age. Or the pathophysiology of ECUN in children born at term and in children born prematurely is not the same. The objective is to study prospectively the prognostic contribution of abdominal ultrasound in the ECUN in premature under 33SA.</brief_summary>
