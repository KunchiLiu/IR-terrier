	<brief_summary>Healthy (non-injured) and concussed college-aged participants will complete two testing sessions that include (1) clinical symptom, balance, and cognitive evaluations and (2) a progressive exercise session to establish symptom exacerbation or maximal exercise capacity. Individuals randomized to the control group will receive no intervention between sessions, while individuals randomized to the intervention group will complete 30 minutes of stationary bike exercise at least 3 days/week.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Concussion Therapy Intervention Training in Healthy and Concussed Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy and concussed participants will be randomized to ACTIVE training (intervention) or control (no intervention) groups. Participants, regardless of group assignment, will receive clinical symptom, balance, and cognitive evaluations as well as a progressive exercise assessment at study outset. Concussed participants will enroll into the study within three days of injury and study participation will termination following 24 consecutive hours with no reported concussive symptoms. Healthy participants will have arbitrary start dates and will terminate the study 10-14 days later to approximate the general length of concussion recovery and, therefore, make the time between session in the healthy and concussed cohorts as equivalent as possible. Participants in the intervention group will complete stationary cycle ergometer workouts for 30 mins at least 3 days per week between testing sessions. Healthy participants will complete six ACTIVE training sessions, while concussed participants will complete ACTIVE training at least three days per week until asymptomatic. Concussed control participants will follow physician guidelines for rest and activity, while healthy control participants will be asked to follow their typical routines for rest and activity. Participants will repeat the identical testing session assessments prior to study termination.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Brain Concussion</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Diagnosed as having a concussion by a physician within three days of study enrollment (concussed participants only) Glasgow Coma Scale &gt;13 (concussed participants only) Participants must be active, which is defined as 30 or more minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity 3 or more days per week. All healthy participants must met this definition and concussed participants should have met this definition prior to injury. Good cardiovascular health (subject to approval from study physician) Recreational drug use over the course of study participation Associated injuries (broken bones, etc.) that would limit the ability to successfully complete ACTIVE training For healthy participants, no history of concussion within the last year For concussed participants, skull fracture or brain bleed at time of the injury UNC Varsity athletes</criteria>
