	<brief_summary>The rational of intra-articular Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) administration is based on both the biological and mechanical properties of PRP, which exerts positive effects on the modulation of the entire joint environment through the local release of a milieau of growth factors and other bioactive molecules that act on all the articular tissues, contributing to minimize the inflammatory distress following surgery. The aim of the present double blind controlled study is to evaluate the effects in terms of pain control and functional recovery provided by a single intra-operative injection of PRP performed at the end of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. Patients included in this trial will be randomized in two treatment groups: the first one will receive a single injection of 3-5 cc of PRP (which will be produced directly in the operating room (OR) using a dedicated centrifuge) at the end of the arthroscopic meniscectomy, whereas the second group will be treated by surgery alone. In order to ensure the double blinding of the trial all the patients enrolled will undergo blood harvesting before anesthesia, and PRP will be produced just for the patients included in PRP group. All patients will be evaluated basally, and then at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days after surgery by the following evaluation tools: IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) subjective, VAS (Visual Analogue Score) for pain, EQ-VAS for general Health Status, KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and Tegner score. Furthermore, during the basal evaluation and at each follow-up visit up to 2 months, active and passive Range of Motion (ROM) of both the operated and contralateral knee were documented; also in addition, the trans-patellar circumference of both knees was registered to assess the trend of knee swelling over time. Drugs assumption during the follow-up period will be recorded for each patient. All eventual adverse events occurred during the follow-up period will be registered.</brief_summary>
