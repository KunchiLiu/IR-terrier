	<brief_summary>The current study aims to explore the role of prebiotic supplementation in adults with and without Asthma/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (A/EIB). All participants will be asked to consume a prebiotic supplement, and a placebo, each for a total duration of four weeks, separated by a four-week wash out period. The investigators hypothesise that improvements in pulmonary function observed following prebiotic supplementation will be attributed to gut microbiota mediated improvements in host immune function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Prebiotics on Gut Bacterial Parameters, Immune Function &amp; Exercise-Induced Airway Inflammation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study will investigate the effects of a prebiotic based nutritional intervention on airway inflammation/bronchoconstriction in adults diagnosed with Asthma/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (A/EIB). Previous research conducted in adults diagnosed with A/EIB has reported significant improvements in pulmonary function following three weeks of prebiotic supplementation. The significant improvements in pulmonary function were attributed to an attenuation of various markers of airway inflammation, potentially regulated by gut microbiota mediated improvements in systemic immune function. Prebiotics are a type of non-digestible carbohydrate/dietary fibre that can only be digested by certain beneficial bacterial species. As part prebiotic digestion, beneficial bacteria produce energy/metabolites that can be used to support a variety of human immune functions, such as reducing the level of airway inflammation that occurs following exposure to relevant triggers (e.g. exercise). Imbalances and/or deficiencies in gut bacterial composition have been identified in adults diagnosed with long-term allergic asthma. However, the potential mechanisms behind how manipulating gut bacterial composition may lead to reductions in the severity of A/EIB have yet to be investigated. Participants with and without A/EIB will be allocated two separate nutritional supplements following a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. During the first phase of the nutritional intervention, participants will consume the first supplement (either prebiotic, or placebo), for a total duration of four weeks. A four-week wash out period will then be completed before the remaining nutritional supplement is administered for an equal duration. Analyses of gut bacterial composition, and key bacterial metabolite production, will be carried out alongside assessments of immune and pulmonary function at baseline, and throughout all phases of the nutritional intervention. As a result, data will be obtained that will enable the role of the gut microbiota in mediating improvements in immune function to be explored. Current understandings of the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of A/EIB will be expanded through the investigation of novel pathophysiological mechanisms, helping to inform future treatment prospects.</detailed_description>
