	<brief_summary>Single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial using PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) under A/P chemoprophylaxis for immunization and PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) for repeat CHMI. A total of 30 adult, healthy, malaria naïve volunteers will receive three injections by Direct Venous Inoculation (DVI) of either placebo (n = 10), 51,200 PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) (n = 10), or 150,000 PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) (n = 10) under chemoprophylaxis with A/P at 4 week intervals. The placebo will be NaCl 0.9%. Ten weeks after the last dose of PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) for immunization, volunteers will undergo first CHMI and followed until asexual blood stage parasitemia, detected by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) or thick blood smear microscopy. If parasitemic, they will be treated with A/P (used in this case as a standard treatment regimen). In the event of no parasitemia, volunteers will be followed until Day 28 post-CHMI and will not receive A/P. Forty-four weeks after the last immunization, a second CHMI will be administered to assess longevity of protection. All volunteers will be followed up to 28 days post-inoculation. Those developing parasitemia will be treated with A/P.</brief_summary>

History of P.falciparum malaria. Planned travel to malaria endemic areas during the study period.

Contraindications to the use of the following antimalarial medications: A/P, artemetherlumefantrine History of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ). History of serious psychiatric condition that may affect participation in the study Any other serious chronic illness requiring hospital specialist supervision. Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as defined by an alcohol intake of greater than 60 g (men) or 40 g (women) per day or a carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) level ≥2.5%.
