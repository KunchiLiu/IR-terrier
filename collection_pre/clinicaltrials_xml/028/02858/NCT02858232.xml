	<brief_summary>Multiple Target Antigen Stimulating Cell Therapy (MASCT-I) is a new immunotherapy that dendritic cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood. The DC can then be loaded with antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous T-cell proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)，similarly re-infused. The previous research data showed that MASCT had the modest overall response and less adverse effects for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients. The study is aimed to evaluate the safety of MASCT-1 in patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MASCT-I Treatment for Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety study in small samples, and the second stage is the sample size expansion phase. 40-50 patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who had failed after standard treatment will be recruited in this study.</detailed_description>
