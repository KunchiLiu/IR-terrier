	<brief_title>Concussion in Motor Vehicle Accidents: The Concussion Identification Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study, Concussion in Motor Vehicle Accidents - The Concussion Identification Index (CIDI), focuses on the psychometric properties of the relationship between acute injury events, i.e. head impact, loss of consciousness (LOC), and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), commonly reported post-crash signs and symptoms, and neurocognitive outcomes. Cohort 1 is the validation group and will be used to confirm the optimal cut-off score of the Concussion Identification Index (CIDI) with the score on the ImPACT. Cohort 2 is the cross-validation group.</detailed_description>
