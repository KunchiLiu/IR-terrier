	<brief_summary>A point-of-care laboratory (POC) was set at North Hospital, Marseille, France for the diagnosis in less than two hours of meningitis caused by known pathogens, close to the reception of Emergency service. In this instance 30% of patients have no etiological diagnosis after the POC diarrhoea tests . This lab has discovered over 200 new species of bacteria in humans, including vector bacteria and opened the field of large Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA ) viruses. Also, the laboratory of emerging viruses discovered many Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) viruses transmitted by arthropods. Based on this collection of new pathogens described in POC laboratory, this study proposes to expand the etiological diagnosis strategy of meningitis after POC test.</brief_summary>
