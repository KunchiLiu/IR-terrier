	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 6-dose regimen of vesatolimod (formerly GS-9620) (at 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg dose levels) in HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to evaluate the virologic effect of vesatolimod as measured by changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key HIV1 infection Aged ≥ 18 years at Prebaseline/Day 13 On antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for ≥ 12 consecutive months prior to PreBaseline/Day 13 The following agents are allowed as part of the current ARV regimen: NRTIs, raltegravir, dolutegravir, rilpivirine, and maraviroc The following agents are NOT allowed as part of the current ARV regimen: HIV protease inhibitors (including low dose ritonavir), cobicistatcontaining regimens, elvitegravir, efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine A change in ARV regimen ≥ 60 days prior to baseline/Day 1 for reasons other than virologic failure (eg, tolerability, simplification, drugdrug interaction profile) is allowed Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening Documented plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL (according to the local assay being used) for ≥ 12 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using a licensed assay with a lower limit of quantitation of at least 40 copies/mL) Unconfirmed virologic elevations of ≥ 50 copies/mL (transient detectable viremia, or "blip") prior to screening are acceptable. (If the lower limit of detection of the local HIV1 RNA assay is &lt; 50 copies/mL, the plasma HIV1 RNA level cannot exceed 50 copies/mL on two consecutive HIV1 RNA tests) If ART regimen is changed ≥ 60 days prior to PreBaseline/Day 13, plasma HIV1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at Prebaseline/Day 13 visit is required. No documented history of resistance to any components of the current ARV regimen Availability of a fully active alternative ARV regimen, in the opinion of the Investigator, in the event of discontinuation of the current ARV regimen with development of resistance. Hgb ≥ 11.5 g/dL (males) or ≥ 11 g/dL (females) White blood cells (WBC) ≥ 2,500 cells/μL Platelets ≥ 125,000/mL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000 cells/μL CD4 count ≥ 300 cells/μL Albumin ≥ 3.9 g/dL Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2 × upper limit of the normal range (ULN) Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min No autoimmune disease Key Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Positive antiHBs antibody and negative HBsAg results are acceptable Hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb) positive Positive antiHCV antibody and negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results are acceptable Documented history of preART CD4 nadir &lt; 100 cells/µL Unknown preART CD4 nadir is acceptable A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within 90 days prior to screening Acute febrile illness within 35 days prior to prebaseline/Day 13 Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
