	<criteria>Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representatives [LARs] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female child between 3 and 4 months of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parents/LARs of the subject prior to performing any study specific procedure. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born fullterm. Child in care Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine during the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs during the period starting since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs at any time during the study period Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last dose of vaccine administration, with the exception of hepatitis B and other vaccines given as part of the national immunisation schedule and as part of routine vaccination practice, that are allowed at any time during the study period. Seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine can be given at any time during the study, and according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and national recommendations. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib diseases. History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib diseases. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects. Serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥38.0°C for rectal route. Subjects with a minor illness without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.</criteria>
