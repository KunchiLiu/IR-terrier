	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a behavioral lifestyle intervention on weight, glycemic control, and vascular inflammatory marker outcomes. A total of 26 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited from an underserved minority community health center in Houston, TX. They were randomly assigned into one of the three groups: 1) Behavior intervention with smart phone based self-monitoring, 2) Behavior intervention with paper diary based self-monitoring, and 3) Usual care group. Both Mobile and Paper groups received a total of 11 group sessions and 1 individual session in a 6-month intervention. Mobile group received an android-based smart phone with two applications loaded to help them record their diet, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose, while the paper group is using paper diaries for these recordings.</detailed_description>
