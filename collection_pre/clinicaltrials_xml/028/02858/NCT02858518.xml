	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a rhythmic cardiac activity disorder disturbing hemodynamic blood flow. It is a public health problem with 600,000 to 1 million people involved in France which 2/3 are aged over 75 years. a FA untreated exposes the patient to a significant risk of embolism responsible for a rate stroke (stroke) ischemic estimated at 85%. The anticoagulant standard treatment helps prevent the occurrence of this complication. However, oral anticoagulation also exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding. The bleeding risk can be assessed using scales: several being proposed (HEMORR2HAGES, HAS-BLED, ATRIA and scores Shireman and Charlson ...). moreover, in geriatric hospital care, every patient has a "standardized geriatric assessment" to assess and quantify functional capacity, autonomy, cognitive abilities, nutritional status, psychological state and its environment social. Thus, the objective of the investigators study was to determine the frequency of each item of each bleeding risk assessment score and geriatric assessment in patients 80 and older hospitalized geriatric ward in the department and with anticoagulant.</brief_summary>
