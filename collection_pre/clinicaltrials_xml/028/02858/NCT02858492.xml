	<brief_summary>This study is the first study with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase inhibitor, in subjects with moderate to severe RA who are currently being treated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 in subjects with moderate to severe RA. In addition to the PK, a number of experimental and clinical endpoints will be employed to obtain information on the PD, and preliminary efficacy in subjects with active RA. Although no formal hypothesis will be tested, these endpoints will enable a broader understanding of the mechanism of action and potential for clinical efficacy of GSK2982772 in RA. After a screening period of up to 30 days, approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to receive either GSK2982772 or placebo for 84 days (12 weeks), followed by a follow-up period (28 days). The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 20 weeks from screening to the last study visit.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Subjects that do not have any medical conditions, other than moderate to severe RA, that in the opinion of the Investigator put the subject at unacceptable risk or interfere with study assessments or integrity of the data. These medical conditions should be stable at the time of screening and are expected to remain stable for the duration of the study. Subject has had a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis according to the revised 2010 ACREULAR classification criteria. Disease duration of &gt;=12 weeks (time from onset of patientreported symptoms of either pain or stiffness or swelling in hands, feet or wrists) at screening. Swollen joint count of &gt;=4 (28joint count) and tender joint count &gt;=4 (28joint count) at screening. Subject has a DAS28 CRP disease activity score of &gt;= 3.2 and CRP &gt;= 5.0 mg/liter (L) (&gt;=4.76 nanomole (nmol)/L) at screening. Subject must have received at least 12 weeks of nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy or MTX/DMARD combination therapy prior to screening and must be on stable dose throughout the study. Subject is naive to any biological therapies for RA or subject may have had previous exposure to a single antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agent which was discontinued for reasons other than primary nonresponse more than 8 weeks (or 5 half lives whichever is longer) from first dose. For subjects who have consented to synovial joint biopsy: • Subject has an involved knee, wrist, or ankle suitable for biopsy, as assessed by a rheumatologist at screening. A body mass index (BMI) within range of 18.5 35 kilogram/meter^2 (Kg/m^2) (inclusive) at screening. Male and female subjects Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the contraception requirements specified in the protocol. Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Nonreproductive potential as defined in the protocol. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until at least 30 days after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in the protocol which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Subject with a positive antidouble stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA [antidsDNA]) and confirmed diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Subject with current history of Suicidal Ideation Behavior (SIB) as measured using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) or a history of attempted suicide. An active infection, or a history of infections as follows: Hospitalization for treatment of infection within 60 days before first dose (Day 1). Currently on any suppressive therapy for a chronic infection (such as pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster and atypical mycobacteria). Use of parenteral (intravenous [IV] or intramuscular) antibiotics (antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, or antiparasitic agents) for an infection within 60 days before first dose. A history of opportunistic infections within 1 year of screening (e.g. pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus [CMV] pneumonitis, aspergillosis). This does not include infections that may occur in immunocompetent individuals, such as fungal nail infections or vaginal candidiasis, unless it is of an unusual severity or recurrent nature. Recurrent or chronic infection or other active infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator might cause this study to be detrimental to the patient. History of Tuberculosis (TB), irrespective of treatment status. A positive diagnostic TB test at screening defined as a positive QuantiFERONTB Gold test or Tspot test. In cases where the QuantiFERON or Tspot test is indeterminate, the subject may have the test repeated once, but they will not be eligible for the study unless the second test is negative. In cases where the QuantiFERON or Tspot test is positive, but a locallyread follow up chest xray, shows no evidence of current or previous pulmonary tuberculosis, the subject may be eligible for the study at the discretion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor. Electrocardiogram QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt; 480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block at screening. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual over read. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined and documented prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35 percent) at screening.

Pacemakers or other implanted cardiac rhythm management devices and nonMR compatible heart valves, Inner ear implants, History of claustrophobia which may impact participation. The subject has received treatment with the prohibited therapies listed in the protocol, or changes to those treatments, within the prescribed timeframe. • Other medications (including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements) will be considered on a casebycase basis, and will be allowed if in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study. History of sensitivity to any of the study treatments, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.
