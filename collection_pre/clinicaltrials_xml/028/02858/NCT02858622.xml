	<brief_summary>Alleviating pain in children undergoing renal transplant is extremely challenging. Large incisions as those of renal transplant (Gibson's incision) require special techniques of pain control that don't affect hemodynamics or renal function. Since the transplant incision doesn't cross midline; a dual-TAP block is thought to be effective in providing pain control in such procedure as it will anesthetize the dermatomes T6-T12, the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall together with the underlying parietal peritoneum.</brief_summary>
