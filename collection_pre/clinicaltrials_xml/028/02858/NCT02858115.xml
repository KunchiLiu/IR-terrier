	<brief_summary>During thoracic surgery, an excessive use of fluid results in pulmonary complications. Dynamic fluid responsiveness predictors are not easily usable during one lung ventilation. The investigators hypothesized that the assessment by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) of subaortic velocity time index (VTI) variation after 100 ml of crystalloid would predict fluid responsiveness in patients receiving one-lung ventilation. This retrospective, observational, single center study was from January 2014 to December 2015. The investigators included 105 patients requiring one lung ventilation lung resection. The investigators analysed 39 patients presenting an acute circulatory failure. 100 ml of crystalloid was infused over 1-min. After an echocardiographic assessment at 1-min, remaining 400 ml were administered over 14-min Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in the VTI above 15% after infusion of 500 ml of crystalloid.</brief_summary>
