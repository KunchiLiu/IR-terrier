	<detailed_description>The investigators will test our hypothesis and accomplish our objectives by pursuing three Specific Aims: To investigate the interrelationship between macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and free T4 in patients with PAH with a working hypothesis that an increased release of MIF into the pulmonary vasculature during cardiopulmonary exercise changes the normal balance between plasma MIF and T4.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be at least 18 years of age and have confirmed pulmonary hypertension (PH) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). ILD was identified on high resolution computed tomography along with a total lung capacity (TLC) &lt;70% of predicted value on pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram. PAH group patients were defined as patients with a mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25 mmHg at rest and a wedge pressure of &lt;15 mmHg (millimeters of mercury), measured by right heart catheterization (WHO group I PAH). PH+ILD group, subjects with evidence of ILD on high resolution CT Scan and mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25 mmHg on right heart catheterization. Patient with evidence of Chronic thromboembolic disease on CT angiogram and mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25mmHg on right heart catheterization. (WHO group IV) Patient with Pulmonary Hypertension due to other conditions, such as Sarcoidosis, Gauchers disease, Hemolytic Anemia and Myeloproliferative disorders. Normal control group: Subjects without cardiopulmonary disease, with a normal PFT and ECG. Failure to obtain informed consent; Pregnancy Subjects with cardiopulmonary disease other than PH and ILD; Unexplained abnormal PFT, ECG, Routine blood/chemistries test History or existing other sever organ/system diseases Defined Acute pulmonary embolism Age &lt; 18 years</criteria>
