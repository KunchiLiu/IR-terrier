	<brief_summary>Neuropathic pain is a medical condition involving allodynia (painful perceptions in response to stimuli that normally are not) and spontaneous pain (occurring at rest, without stimulation). This pain is secondary to nervous system injury affecting the sensory system. The lesion is either at the nerve endings of the spinal cord or brain. It induces a loss of sensitivity and reorganization of brain activity. Previous studies in functional neuroimaging have focused on brain areas activated during allodynic stimuli compared to non-painful stimuli. The abnormalities have been reported, but it was not possible to conclude formally. The objective of this study is to understand the brain dysfunction that induces allodynic pain considering the deafferentation of each patient and possible cortical losses.</brief_summary>
