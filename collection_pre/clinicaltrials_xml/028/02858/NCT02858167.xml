	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to define a reference population for FDG-PET neurological examinations starting from patients having FDG-PET to supervise a non-complicated lymphoma (tumor in remission, low disabling chronic tumor).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creation of a Normal Database for FluoroDeoxyGlucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) Neurological Examinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will also check normality of cerebral functions in this population and analyse the influence of various variation factors, such as age, sex ratio, education level, professional activity and neuropsychological test results on normal data. This database could be later used as comparison to patient images defining the gravity and localization of their cerebral functional disorders.</detailed_description>
