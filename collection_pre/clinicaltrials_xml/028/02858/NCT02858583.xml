	<brief_summary>Research question In newborn infants requiring CPR, does CC superimposed by sustained inflation compared to 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio improves return of spontaneous circulation? Overall objective: CC superimposed by sustained inflation will improve short- and long-term outcomes in preterm and term newborns. Hypothesis to be tested Primary hypothesis: By using CC superimposed by sustained inflation (CC+SI) during CPR the time needed to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) compared to the current 3:1 compression to ventilation (C:V) will be reduced in asphyxiated newborns.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All infants (term or preterm infants) requiring CC in the delivery room will be eligible for the trial. Infants will be excluded if they have a congenital abnormality or condition that might have an adverse effect on breathing or ventilation (e.g. congenital diaphragmatic hernia), or congenital heart disease requiring intervention in the neonatal period. Infants would be also excluded if their parents refused to give consent to this study.</criteria>
