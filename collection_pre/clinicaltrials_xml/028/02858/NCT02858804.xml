	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. determine the efficiency of EDOCH (etoposide,dexamethasone,doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and vincristine) alternating with DHAP (cisplatin, cytarabine and dexamethasone) regimen combined with rituximab or not in young mantle cell lymphoma patients (age≤65 years); 2. determine the efficiency of rituximab and thalidomide plus prednisone as maintenance regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EDOCH Alternating With DHAP for New Diagnosed Younger MCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled patients will receive EDOCH (etoposide,dexamethasone,doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and vincristine) ±R /DHAP(cisplatin, cytarabine and dexamethasone) ±R alternating chemotherapy. If a partial remission or better response achieves, patients will be recommended to receive autologous stem cell transplantation as consideration therapy or another two cycles EDOCH ±R /DHAP±R chemotherapy (based on patient's choice). Patients with less than partial remission (PR) response will quit this study. After treatments finished, maintenance therapy with rituximab or thalidomide plus prednisone will be given less than two years. The determination of maintenance regimens is dependent on patients choices.</detailed_description>
