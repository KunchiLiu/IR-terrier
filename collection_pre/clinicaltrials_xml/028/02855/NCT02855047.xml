	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate plasmatic concentrations of free PGF and sFlt1 for blood samples taken before a first low-molecular-weight-heparin injection and also for blood samples taken on the 4th day of injections (the latter correspond to the first systematic control of platelet counts) in women who have an obstetric antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and who are initiating a new pregnancy with recommended treatment. Our goal is to test the prognostic value of these data on the occurrence of: - pregnancy loss categorized as embryonic loss (before 10 weeks gestation), fetal death (before 20 weeks gestation), stillbirths (from 20 weeks gestation to delivery), and neonatal death defined before reaching 28 days of age. - ischemic placental pathology (pre-eclampsia, retro-placental hematoma, birth of a small-for-gestational-age infant)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Three unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation (the recurrent embryo loss subgroup) OR One unexplained death of a morphologically normal fetus (fetal loss) at or after the 10th week of gestation (fetal loss subgroup). Women in the APS subgroup: persistently positive for LA, and/or aCL and/or aBeta2GP1 Women initiating a new pregnancy during the 18 month observational period after obstetric APS diagnosis Any history of thrombotic events or any treatment given during previous pregnancies that might have modified the natural course of the condition Women whose pregnancy losses could be explained by infectious, metabolic, anatomic or hormonal factors, or associated with paternal or maternal chromosomal causes Seropositivity for HIV, hepatitis B or C Women with antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency, and women with abnormal fibrinogen or with the JAK2 V617F mutation were further excluded.</criteria>
