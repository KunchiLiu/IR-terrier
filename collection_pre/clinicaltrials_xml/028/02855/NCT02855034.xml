CT scan is expesive and irradiating with the risk of increasing the cancer in children. Protein S 100B and copeptine are biomarkers which have shown their ability to detect cerebral lesion in children with head injury. (protein S 100B and /or in adults (protein S 100B and copetine. It is the first clinical biological evaluation of severity of head injury based on dosing of copeptine alone or associated with proein S 100B.</brief_summary>
