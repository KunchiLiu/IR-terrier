	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I/II trial studies the best dose of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW and how well it works in detecting tumors in patients with malignant glioma who are undergoing surgery. Cetuximab-IRDye 800CW is an optical imaging agent that may help detect tumor cells when a special camera is used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab-IRDye 800CW in Detecting Tumors in Patients With Malignant Glioma Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the efficacy of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW (cetuximab IRDye800) in intraoperatively identifying malignant glioma compared to surrounding normal central nervous system tissue, as measured by tumor-to-background ratio. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tolerability of the cetuximab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in subjects undergoing resection of malignant glioma. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts. COHORT I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and a lower dose of cetuximab IRDye800 IV over 30 minutes to 1 hour on day 0. COHORT II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 30 minutes and a higher dose of cetuximab IRDye800 IV over 30 minutes to 1 hour on day 0. All patients undergo standard of care surgical resection of tumor on days 2-5. After completion of study, patients are followed up at days 10 and 30.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with suspected brain tumors undergoing surgical removal as their standard of care will be eligible; these may include subjects status post chemotherapy and/or radiation or subjects who have undergone diagnostic biopsy for their original diagnosis and are felt to be candidates for resection Subjects must be eligible for resection as determined by the operating surgeon Planned standard of care surgery Life expectancy of more than 12 weeks Karnofsky performance status of at least 70% or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod level 1 Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dL Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Magnesium, potassium and calcium &gt; the lower limit of normal per institution normal lab values Thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) &lt; 13 micro international units/mL Received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to first dose of cetuximab IRDye800 Myocardial infarction (MI); cerebrovascular accident (CVA); uncontrolled congestive heart failure (CHF); significant liver disease; or unstable angina within 6 months prior to enrollment History of infusion reactions to cetuximab or other monoclonal antibody therapies Pregnant or breastfeeding Subjects who have a serious reaction with the test/loading cetuximab dose for which they were not able to receive the full dose Evidence of QT prolongation on pretreatment electrocardiogram (ECG) (greater than 440 ms in males or greater than 450 ms in females) Lab values that in the opinion of the primary surgeon would prevent surgical resection Subjects receiving class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents Subjects not deemed to be appropriate candidates for optimal resection of tumor based on location, involvement of eloquent brain, satellite lesions, or other factors not specifically listed here</criteria>
