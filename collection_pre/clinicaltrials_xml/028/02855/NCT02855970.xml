	<brief_summary>The aim of this work is to develop and validate a scale adapted to French cultural characteristics. It will be based on the SS-QoL scale and be simple and quick to use in everyday practice. It is not simply a translation. This transcultural adaptation requires linguistic and psychometric validation, by studying its validity, its reliability and its sensitivity to change, as though it were a new instrument. The investigators will then develop a short version by reducing the items and conduct a psychometric validation. The translation and validation of a short French version of the SS-QoL scale will generate a reliable and sensitive, easy-to-use tool suitable for use in everyday practice. The final objective is to use this tool as a principal judgement criterion in future therapeutic trials and in patients of the Dijon Stroke Registry to bring to light prognostic factors that affect quality of life so as to provide better management of this disease.</brief_summary>
