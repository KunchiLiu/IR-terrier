	<brief_summary>This is a prospective diagnostic pilot study to create hypotheses regarding immunocytochemistry (ICC) PD-L1 analysis of pleural effusions in NSCLC patients as compared to the reference standard of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). This comparison will be done to assess sensitivity and specificity of PD-L1 detection by ICC in pleural effusions.</brief_summary>
