	<brief_summary>The scientific interest of this study is to improve post-operative comfort in patients after thyroid surgery using simple, inexpensive techniques. The investigator expects that local applications of ice or cortisone aerosols will reduce swallowing discomfort and control post-operative pain (POP). The investigator hopes that local cryotherapy will decrease post-operative oedema (vasoconstriction) and the volume of liquid drained (action on the serous fluid at the site of the thyroidectomy).</brief_summary>
