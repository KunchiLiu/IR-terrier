	<brief_summary>The human gut microbiota has become the subject of extensive research in recent years, particularly in regards to the role it plays in obesity. Although lifestyle factors, diet, and lack of exercise contribute largely to this obesity epidemic, there is increasing evidence that the human gut microbiota also influences weight gain. The investigators hope to learn more information about the change in gut microbiota, especially with regards to those who are successful with weight loss, versus those who don't lose weight, after participating in a lifestyle modification program at the Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center (DAHLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gut Microbiota Changes in Obese Individuals Undergoing Dedicated Lifestyle Modification Programs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gut microbiome is altered in obesity and is being increasingly studied given its role in energy harvest and fat storage with the hopeful goal of discovering a modifiable intervention to affect obesity and its consequences. Mouse models have already shown that transplantation of an obese microbiota into germ-free mice yields increased adiposity compared to transplantation of a lean microbiota. In humans, initial studies looked at the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in obese versus lean individuals and then followed those obese individuals who lost weight on low-calorie diets. The relative proportion of Bacteroidetes was decreased in obese people, and this then increased with weight loss. While certainly provocative, the findings were not consistently reproduced. Subjects will include members of the Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center (DAHLC) program or the Healthy Living Program (HLP) at Mayo Clinic Rochester, who are seeking advice for weight management concerns.</detailed_description>
