	<brief_summary>HDClarity will seek to enroll approximately 600 research participants - 500 of whom will be at different stages of Huntington's disease (HD) and 100 healthy controls. The primary objective is to collect a high quality CSF sample for evaluation of biomarkers and pathways that will enable the development of novel treatments for HD. The secondary objective is to generate a high quality plasma sample collection matching the CSF collections, which will also be used to evaluate biomarkers and pathways of relevance to HD research and development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants will attend a screening and sampling visit. During the screening visit, medical history, and clinical and phenotypic data will be obtained. Participants who meet the eligibility requirements are willing to continue in the study, will return for a sampling visit during which ≤20ml CSF and approximately 50ml blood will be collected following an overnight fast: blood will be obtained via venipuncture and CSF will be obtained via lumbar puncture using local anaesthetic if required. Approximately 120 participants (including 20 controls) will be invited to attend an optional repeat sampling visit 4-6 weeks after the original sampling visit.</detailed_description>

Will have had an EnrollHD visit within three months of the Sampling Visit. 2. For the Early Premanifest HD group, participants eligible are persons who meet the following criteria: 1. Do not have clinical diagnostic motor features of HD, defined as Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Diagnostic Confidence Score &lt; 4; and 2. Have CAG expansion ≥ 40; and 3. Have burden of pathology score, computed as (CAG 35.5) × age, &lt; 250. 3. For the Late Premanifest HD group, participants eligible are persons who meet the following criteria: 1. Do not have clinical diagnostic motor features of HD, defined as Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Diagnostic Confidence Score &lt; 4; and 2. Have CAG expansion ≥ 40; and 3. Have burden of pathology score, computed as (CAG 35.5) x age, ≥ 250. 4. For Early Manifest HD group, participants eligible are persons who meet the following criteria: 1. Have clinical diagnostic motor features of HD, defined as UHDRS Diagnostic Confidence Score = 4; and 2. Have CAG expansion ≥ 36; and 3. Have Stage I or Stage II HD, defined as UHDRS Total Functional Capacity (TFC) scores between 7 and 13 inclusive. 5. For Moderate Manifest HD group, participants eligible are persons who meet the following criteria: 1. Have clinical diagnostic motor features of HD, defined as UHDRS Diagnostic Confidence Score = 4; and 2. Have CAG expansion ≥ 36; and 3. Have Stage III HD, defined as UHDRS TFC scores between 4 and 6, inclusive. 6. For Advanced Manifest HD group, participants eligible are persons who meet the following criteria: 1. Have clinical diagnostic motor features of HD, defined as UHDRS Diagnostic Confidence Score = 4; and 2. Have CAG expansion ≥ 36; and 3. Have Stage IV HD, defined as UHDRS TFC scores between 0 and 3, inclusive. 7. For the Healthy Control group, subjects eligible are persons who meet the following criteria: 1. Have no known family history of HD; or 2. Have known family history of HD but have been tested for the huntingtin gene glutamine codon (CAG) expansion and are not at genetic risk for HD (CAG &lt; 36). 1. For all groups, participants are ineligible if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: 1. Current use of investigational drugs or participation in a clinical drug trial within 30 days prior to Sampling Visit; or 2. Current intoxication, drug or alcohol abuse or dependence; or 3. If using any antidepressant, psychoactive, psychotropic or other medications or nutraceuticals used to treat HD, the use of inappropriate (e.g., nontherapeutically high) or unstable dose within 30 days prior to Sampling Visit; or 4. Significant medical, neurological or psychiatric comorbidity likely, in the judgment of the Site Principal Investigator, to impair participant's ability to complete study procedures; or 5. Needle phobia, frequent headache, significant lower spinal deformity or major surgery; or 6. Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy within the 14 days prior to sampling visit, including but not limited to: aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban; or 7. Clotting or bruising disorder; or 8. Screening blood test results outside the lab's normal range for the following: white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT); or 9. Screening blood test results for Creactive protein (CRP)&gt;2× upper limit of normal; or 10. Predictable noncompliance as assessed by Site Principal Investigator; or 11. Inability or unwillingness to undertake any of the study procedures; or 12. Exclusion during history or physical examination, final decision to be made by the Site Principal Investigator; including but not limited to: any reason to suspect abnormal bleeding tendency, e.g. easy bruising, petechial rash; or any reason to suspect new focal neurological lesion, e.g. new headache, optic disc swelling, asymmetric focal long tract signs; or any other reason that, in the clinical judgment of the operator or the Site Principal Investigator, it is felt that lumbar puncture is unsafe without brain imaging.</criteria>
