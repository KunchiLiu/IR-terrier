	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of insulin glargine (U300) and Lantus in terms of change of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to endpoint (scheduled at Month 6, Week 26) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary Objectives: - To compare insulin glargine (U300) and Lantus in terms of occurrence of hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia. - To compare insulin glargine (U300) and Lantus in terms of reaching target HbA1c values (all and reaching target without hypoglycemia). - To compare insulin glargine (U300) and Lantus in terms of controlled plasma glucose (all and reaching target without hypoglycemia). - To compare the frequency of occurrence and diurnal distribution of hypoglycemia by category of hypoglycemia (documented symptomatic, asymptomatic, nocturnal, severe, probable and relative). - To assess the safety and tolerability of insulin glargine (U300). - To assess the development of anti-insulin glargine antibodies (AIA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with noninsulin antihyperglycemic drug(s). Signed written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt; legal age of adulthood. HbA1c &lt;7.0% (&lt;53 mmol/mol) or &gt;11% (&gt;97 mmol/mol) (at screening). History of type 2 diabetes mellitus for less than 1 year before screening. Less than 6 months before screening with noninsulin antihyperglycemic treatment. Change in dose of noninsulin antihyperglycemic treatment in the last 3 month before screening. Initiation of new glucoselowering medications and/or weight loss drug in the last 3 months before screening visit and/or initiation of glucagon like peptide1(GLP1) receptor agonist in the last 6 months before screening visit. Patients receiving only noninsulin antihyperglycemic drugs not approved for combination with insulin according to local labeling (Note: noninsulin antihyperglycemic drugs not approved for combination with insulin are to be discontinued at randomization). Current or previous insulin use except for a maximum of 10 consecutive days (eg, acute illness, surgery) during the last one year prior to screening. Severe hypoglycemia resulting in coma/seizures, and/or hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis in the last 6 months before screening visit. Unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy or any other rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy or macular edema likely to require treatment (eg, laser, surgical treatment or injectable drugs) during the study period. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
