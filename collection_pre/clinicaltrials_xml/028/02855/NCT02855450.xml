	<brief_summary>An 8 Week phase Ib, monocentric, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled, parallel groups, study with a 24 Week follow-up period to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of a 180 Î¼g/ml recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution versus vehicle in patients with glaucoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of rhNGF Eye Drops Solution Versus Vehicle in Patients With Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a masked, randomized, single-dose, monocentric trial of 60 study participants with chronic primary open angle glaucoma. Participants may qualify with either progressive optic neuropathy despite maximal current therapy (i.e. IOP reduction), or with stabilized IOP but diminished vision (central or peripheral). Participants with a qualifying eye will be randomized 2:1 to topical recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) therapy or vehicle placebo control. Examinations for safety and efficacy will occur one week following initiation of therapy, and at 4, 8, 12 and 32 weeks. All participants in either arm will be followed clinically at 4 weeks after cessation of therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients 18 years of age or older. Participant must understand and sign the informed consent. If the participant's vision is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed consent document, the document will be read to the participant in its entirety. 2. Participant's clinical diagnosis must be consistent with glaucoma characterized by the following features: a) clinical evidence of progressive RGC dysfunction and degeneration using visual field and/or a structural modality. There must be at least 3 reliable visual fields within 14 months prior to entering into the study; b) residual visual field preservation in at least 1 quadrant. 3. Participant must be medically able to undergo the testing required in the flowsheet of exam procedures. 4. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective form of birth control. 1. Participant has another optic nerve or retinal degenerative disease or comorbidity causing significant vision loss, irrespective of whether it is currently treated or untreated, that could limit the possibility of visual recovery. 2. Participant is blind in one eye. 3. Participant has a requirement of acyclovir and/or related products during study duration. 4 Participant has evidence of corneal opacification or lack of optical clarity. 4. Participant has evidence of corneal opacification or lack of optical clarity. 5. Participant has undergone lens removal in the last 3 months, with or without intraocular lens implantation, or has undergone intraocular lens replacement within 3 months, or has undergone any other ocular surgery within 9 months prior to initiation of study drug. 6. Participant is receiving systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive medications. 7. Participant is currently participating in or has within the last 3 months participated in any other clinical trial of a nonclinically approved drug by ocular or systemic administration. 8. Participant has uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease. 9. Participant has diabetic macular edema. 10. Participant has a history of ocular herpes zoster. 11. Participant is on chemotherapy. 12. Participant has a history of malignancy, not counting basal cell carcinomas, UNLESS it was treated successfully 2 years prior to inclusion in the trial. 13. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications. 14. History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction. 15. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or post menopausal for at least 1 year) are excluded from participation in the study if they meet any one of the following conditions: 1. are currently pregnant or, 2. have a positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening/Baseline Visit or, 3. intend to become pregnant during the study treatment period or, 4. are breastfeeding or, 5. not willing to use highly effective birth control measures, such as: Hormonal contraceptives oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected and/or mechanical barrier methods spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or diaphragm or IUD during the entire course of and 30 days after the study treatment periods.</criteria>
