	<brief_summary>Suicidal behavior (SB) is a major public health problem in France, with more than 10,000 suicides and 220,000 suicide attempts per year. According to the commonly accepted model for understanding suicidal behavior, individuals who carry a suicidal act when subjected to stress factors (environmental stress, depression, substance ...) are those which have a specific vulnerability. These vulnerabilities can be considered as clinical parameters (propensity to despair, aggressive and/or impulsive traits), neurobiological parameters (dysfunction of the serotonergic system, ...) and cognitive parameters (taking disadvantageous decision ...). Suicidal vulnerability is partly underpinned by genetic factors. The interest of current researches is to identify biomarkers that will improve the opportunities for early identification of subject with a risk for SB. Numerous scientific studies, including post-mortem studies of the brains of suicide completers, have established a link between dysregulation of the ribonucleic acids editing (RNA) of certain genes, the enzymatic activity of Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARS) responsible for this edition and suicidal behavior. A prospective study is needed to quantify and qualify in the blood of depressed patients (with or without a history of suicide) and healthy controls, the editing changes and the expression and alteration of the activity of ADARS.</brief_summary>
