	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor(G-CSF) on decreasing adhesion reformation and improving fertility outcomes after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis in patients with moderate to severe intrauterine adhesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of G-CSF Against Adhesion Reformation After Hysteroscopic Adhesiolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, patients with moderate to severe intrauterine adhesions will be allocated into 2 groups randomly, with COOK ballon and estrogen and progesterone sequential therapy given to prevent adhesion routinely. 7 day later, G-CSF or normal saline will be injected into the uterine cavity by Tom catheter after removing the balloon respectively. A second hysteroscopic examination will be performed in 2 months to check up the adhesion reformation. In addition, the endometrial thickness after surgery and fertility outcome will be followed up.</detailed_description>
