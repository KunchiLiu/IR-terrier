	<brief_title>Modulation of Immunity-related Gene Expression Under the Chinese Herbal Formula SS-1 Treatment for Sjögren's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To evaluate the modulation of immunity-related gene expression for the Sjögren's syndrome under Chinese herbal medicine (SS-1) treatment. Method: The evidence of the regulation of oxidative-related cytokines and the antioxidant capacity could be provided from the previous randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, two-center clinical trial for evaluating the effect of Chinese herbal medicine (SS-1) for the Sjögren's syndrome patients. However, the clinical trail could not find out the modulation of immunity-related gene expression for SS-1 treatment, and it did set up a healthy control group for SS-1 comparison. This study want to establish a healthy control group for evaluating the normal range of oxidative stress and cytokines, which this work could be used to compare with the 72 SS-1 subjects in previous study. And This study also want to analyze the 770 immunity-related gene expression for the Sjögren's syndrome under the SS-1 treatment: (1) The best 20 (at least) efficacy SJS subjects who were evaluated before and after SS-1 treatments. (2) The 10 (at least) healthy control subjects. The findings could provide the evidence on the modulation of immunity-related gene expression for clinical manifestation, oxidative stress and cytokine in Sjögren's syndrome patients. Expected Results: 1. Establish the normal range of oxidative stress and cytokines for healthy control group. 2. To evaluate the regulatory effect on oxidative stress and cytokine secretion between SS-1 group and healthy control group. 3. To evaluate the immunity-related gene expression for the Sjögren's syndrome under the SS-1 treatment. 4. To evaluate the immunity-related gene expression among the best efficacy SJS subjects and healthy control subjects. 5. To evaluate the immunity-related gene expression with the characteristic of TCM tongue diagnosis. 6. To analyze the correlation among clinical manifestations, Sjögren's syndrome -related clinical questionnaires and immunity-related gene expression.</detailed_description>
