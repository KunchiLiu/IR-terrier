	<brief_summary>Even though cognitive-motor performances are impaired in frail elderly subjects compared with healthy elderly subjects, exercising cognitive-motor processes in an implicit manner can improve the carrying out of real actions in everyday life. No training programme using virtual reality and serious games oriented towards the perception/action system has been tested in frail elderly subjects. The expected results are: - In the short term, greater strengthening of motor and cognitive abilities in subjects trained with the virtual reality and serious games, thanks to stimulation through action and through the underlying processes. - In the long term (+1 and +3 months at the end of the training period) better preservation of motor and cognitive abilities in subjects who took part in the virtual reality and serious games programme.</brief_summary>
