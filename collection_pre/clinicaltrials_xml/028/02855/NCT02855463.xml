	<brief_summary>The discovery in 2003 by isolation of amoebas Mimivirus, the world's largest virus at the Research Unit on Tropical and Emerging Diseases in Marseille revealed fascinating information about the definition and evolution of viruses. Its genome encodes about 1,000 proteins. Three other viruses were then isolated from amoebas in this unit:Two other giant viruses, Mamavirus Marseillevirus then, and the first virus a virus, named virophage, which led to highlight the role of amoeba (Acanthamoeba spp. ) such as spawning giant viruses and compounds of bacterial origin or cellular proteins This project focuses on the detection and analysis of new viral agents (viruses and virophages giant amoeba environmental) and their involvement in human pathology. The objectives of this study are observational: detect and document the presence of giant viruses and virophages of amoebae in the faeces of children presenting to the pediatric emergency reception service of the North Hospital in AP -HM with or without clinical evidence of gastroenteritis.</brief_summary>
