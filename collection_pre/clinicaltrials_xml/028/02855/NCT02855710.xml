	<brief_summary>This project aims at assessing the opposite relation, namely the effect of a training of the general timing abilities on gait in Parkinson's disease. Timing rehabilitation will be done by the means of a serious game. Serious games are more and more used to improve the compliance and the efficacy of reeducaiton programs. Overall, we propose to test a low-cost tool for rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Training of the Rhythmic Skills With a Serious Game to Improve Gait and Cognitive Abilities in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Auditory rythmic cueing is a method consisting in presenting a regular auditory stimulus (metronom or music) when someone is walking. It is known to improve gait in pathologies such as Parkinson's disease. It has also an effect on general timing abilities (e.g. tapping the beat of the music). This project aims at assessing the opposite relation, namely the effect of a training of the general timing abilities on gait in Parkinson's disease. Timing rehabilitation will be done by the means of a serious game. Serious games are more and more used to improve the compliance and the efficacy of reeducaiton programs. Overal, we propose to test a low-cost tool for rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
