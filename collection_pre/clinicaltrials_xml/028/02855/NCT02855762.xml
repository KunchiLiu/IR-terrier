	<brief_summary>The gut microbiome is a new target to improve burden of disease measures in mood disorders, yet novel interventions to affect the gut microbial complement and improve psychiatric outcomes have not been developed. Animal studies show causative influence of the gut microbiome on developmental trajectories of central neurochemical systems to effect anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Preliminary studies in humans show psychiatric benefit of pre- and pro-biotic supplementation in depressed individuals. However, it has not been determined which gut microbes are beneficial or detrimental to human mental illness and how to specifically target them for therapeutic benefit. Our long-term goal is to determine effective methods to target the human gut microbiome to improve mental health treatment outcomes. The objective of this study is to determine how specific dietary control alters the microbiome composition to effect clinical outcome measures in a longitudinal study of individuals with bipolar disorder. Our central hypothesis is that a low carbohydrate (CHO) / high polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diet will increase the fractional representation of specific butyrate producing members of the Firmicutes phylum in the gut microbiome, which will attenuate host inflammation, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety in bipolar patients. The rationale for the proposed research is to take the first step in a continuum of studies to develop personalized novel approaches to treat mood disorders, including the need to address gut dysbiosis, which often co-occurs with mental illness. The investigators will test our hypothesis and achieve the objective of this proposal with the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the taxonomical change in the stool microbiome following a low CHO / high PUFA diet; and 2) Determine the changes in sleep quality, anxiety, and depression following a low CHO / high PUFA diet. These aims will be achieved using the unique resources at the University of Michigan, including the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory for dietary intervention, the Host-Microbiome Laboratory for microbial assays, and the ongoing Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder. At the end of the proposed studies the investigators expect to set the stage for future studies to assess neurochemical mechanisms. These data will provide a greater understanding of the mechanism by which diet controls the specific microbes in the gut microbiome to affect mood disorders and gut dysbiosis and improve response to psychiatric treatment paradigms.</brief_summary>
