	<brief_title>Metronomic Chemotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 80% of patients with advanced gastric cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment options including systemic chemotherapy with or without radiation. Commonly used maximally tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy such as DCT, ECF, FOLFOX regimens induce responses in the range of 20 to 50% with median survival in the range of 10 to 12 months. Metronomic chemotherapy has been found to have more consistent anti-tumor effects through anti-angiogenic and immunomodulating effects. Preliminary clinical studies of weekly POLF have found very encouraging clinical activities and low overall toxicities in pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer. Here we conduct a formal clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy and side effect profiles of this regimen in patients with advanced gastric cancer.</detailed_description>
