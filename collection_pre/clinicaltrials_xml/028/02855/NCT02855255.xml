	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Stop Smoking Intervention Efficacies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study comprises a randomised control trial (n = 620) which will compare the efficacy of two psychological stop smoking interventions, amongst people living and working in the Lambeth and Southwark boroughs of London. Specifically, Allen Carr's Easyway smoking cessation programme comprising one 5/6 hour group session (plus one or two 3 hour booster sessions over the following 3 months for those who require them) and a 1-1 counselling service available via the NHS (comprising one 30 minute session and four weekly follow ups of 10-15 minutes) will be compared. The efficacy of both treatments will be followed up at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment. The evaluation will be compliant with the Russell 6 Standard (which requires, amongst other things, a double blind, randomised design, chemical verification of quit outcomes, and the inclusion of all participants who received treatment in the final analysis). The findings will add to the evidence base around the use of the Allen Carr method, in particular by testing it in non-commercial settings.</detailed_description>
