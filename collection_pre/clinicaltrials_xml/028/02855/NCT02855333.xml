	<detailed_description>Between 2004 and 2013, 14 pts had transhiatal resection of median 8 (6-10) cm of distal esophagus including the gastroesophageal junction. Locoregional lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients with (suspected) early adenocarcinoma. In case of vagus nerve resection, pyloromyectomy and cholecystectomy were done. A pediculated isoperistaltic jejunal segment of 15-18 cm length was interponed between esophageal stump and remaining stomach by end-to-side anastomoses. At least one postoperative contrast examination of the anastomoses was done in all pts. Quality of life was assessed by using the EORTC QLQ-OES18 survey, recording patients' general activity and condition and specific gastrointestinal symptoms.</detailed_description>
