	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), systemic sclerosis (Ssc) and inflammatory myopathy (IM) are rare diseases, whose prevalence is estimated at 43, 15 and 10 cases, respectively, for 100 000 inhabitants in France. These diseases belong to the group of auto-immune diseases and require specialized follow-up in an expert centre. The repercussions of SLE, Ssc and IM on the everyday life of patients are heavy, and notably linked to skin involvement, to diminished functional capacities and psychological problems. The vast majority of these diseases concern middle-aged, professionally-active individuals, for whom the socio-professional repercussions are major and too often neglected. The aim of this study is to analyse the consequences of auto-immune diseases on quality of life. Current quality of life questionnaires are not suitable, and do not reveal the reality of the situation and its different nuances. In this research, the quality of life of patients will be envisaged through their everyday lives. How do these patients construct the social reality of the disease? How do they perceive their health status and their social situation? How do they organize their everyday lives around the disease: work, leisure, relationships with their entourage... ?</brief_summary>
