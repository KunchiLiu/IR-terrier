	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disease. Dementia will affect 80% of these patients during their evolution. In addition, treatments of motor signs have a potential impact on these disorders and conversely. The purpose of this study is to show focal abnormalities in brain metabolism in the precuneus and posterior cingulate region are predictive of the onset of dementia within 2 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction of Dementia in Parkinson's Disease by Measuring Cerebral Metabolism With PET Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment and dementia have become major factors of disability induced by Parkinson's disease. The prediction of dementia in any given patient may be useful for prognosis but also for discussion of setting up heavy therapeutic techniques, especially surgical. Currently, known predictors are disease severity, age and existence of pre-cognitive disorders; other assumptions are discussed. Among these, morphological imaging techniques (MRI) and functional techniques (MRI, PET) are proposed. Use increasingly early of heavy, expensive and potentially ineffective surgical treatment in dementia makes it necessary to find independent, early and reliable markers of the onset of dementia in Parkinson's Disease.</detailed_description>
