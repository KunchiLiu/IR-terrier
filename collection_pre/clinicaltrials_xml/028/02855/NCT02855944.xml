	<brief_title>ARIEL4: A Study of Rucaparib Versus Chemotherapy BRCA Mutant Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD). The safety and efficacy of rucaparib has been evaluated in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. An oral formulation is the focus of current development efforts. Rucaparib is currently being investigated as monotherapy in patients with cancer associated with breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2 mutations. While PARP inhibitors have demonstrated consistent robust clinical activity in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer associated with HRD, prospective studies evaluating efficacy and safety of PARPi versus standard of care chemotherapy have been limited. The primary purpose of this Phase 3 study is to compare the efficacy and safety of rucaparib versus chemotherapy as treatment for relapsed ovarian cancer in patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in their tumor.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be 18 years of age at the time the informed consent form is signed Have a histologically confirmed Grade 2 or Grade 3 endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer Received â‰¥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and have relapsed or progressive disease as confirmed by radiologic assessment Have biopsiable and evaluable disease. Note: biopsy is optional for patients known to harbor a BRCA1/2 mutation Have sufficient archival formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor tissue available for planned analyses History of prior cancers except for those that have been curatively treated, with no evidence of cancer currently (provided all chemotherapy was completed &gt;6 months prior and/or bone marrow transplant &gt;2 years prior to first dose of rucaparib). Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor Symptomatic and/or untreated central nervous system metastases Preexisting duodenal stent and/or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib Women who are pregnant or breast feeding Hospitalization for bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to enrollment</criteria>
