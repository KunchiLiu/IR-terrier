	<brief_summary>The cervical spine should work as a functional unit. If hypomobility should exist in any of the segments it would limit the mobility of the spine as a whole. Although it is frequent that certain cervical segments present hypomobility, they are not always related to symptomatology. The effects of inhibition sub-occipital techniques on cervical mobility have not been evaluated. The objetive of this trials is to assess and compare the effects on cervical mobility, of the manual technique of sub-occipital inhibition by applying pressure and self-treatment by way of Occipivot® cushion, in subjects with no cervical symptomatology but with limited mobility assessed by the flexion-rotation test.</brief_summary>
