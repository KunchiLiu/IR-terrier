	<brief_summary>Open pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard treatment for a wide array of periampullary and pancreatic diseases including malignant and benign conditions. The outcome of PD has improved over the last two decades due to advances in surgical techniques, anesthesia and perioperative care. Although studies from high volume centers demonstrate reduce in the operative mortality to less than 3%, the postoperative morbidity rate is still ranging from 30% to 60%. Laparoscopic surgery is being used increasingly as a less invasive alternative to traditional interventions for pancreatic resection. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) is a difficult procedure that has become increasingly popular. Nevertheless, comparative data on outcomes remain limited. In this prospective randomized study, investigators evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgical and oncological outcomes of minimally invasive PD compared to conventional open PD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Open pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard treatment for a wide array of periampullary and pancreatic diseases including malignant and benign conditions. The outcome of PD has improved over the last two decades due to advances in surgical techniques, anesthesia and perioperative care . Although studies from high volume centers demonstrate reduce in the operative mortality to less than 3%, the postoperative morbidity rate is still ranging from 30% to 60%. Laparoscopic surgery is being used increasingly as a less invasive alternative to traditional interventions for pancreatic resection. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) is a difficult procedure that has become increasingly popular. Nevertheless, comparative data on outcomes remain limited despite several improvements in surgical devices and techniques that have allowed surgeons to approach the pancreas laparoscopically, laparoscopic PD remains challenging. LPD represents one of the most advanced abdominal operations owing to the necessity of a complex dissection and reconstruction. Recent reports note that complete laparoscopic PD including laparoscopic resection and reconstruction is both technically feasible and safe. In this prospective randomized study, investigators evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgical and oncological outcomes of minimally invasive PD compared to conventional open PD</detailed_description>
