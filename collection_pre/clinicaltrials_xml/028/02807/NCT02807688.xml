	<brief_title>Physical Co-morbidity, Poor Health Behaviour and Health Promotion in Verona Patients With Functional Psychoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies investigating the mortality and physical health of mental patients have provided substantial evidence of an excess mortality and of a substantially higher prevalence of physical co-morbidity as compared to the general population. These findings have been related to a higher prevalence of risk factors like high blood pressure, high plasma cholesterol and obesity, unhealthy lifestyles, medication side-effects. The number of clinical trials and intervention studies in this area is still scanty and their scientific strength is relatively modest. The present research project aims at implementing preventive strategies related to dietary habits and physical exercise, and studying their efficacy with a randomized controlled study.</detailed_description>
