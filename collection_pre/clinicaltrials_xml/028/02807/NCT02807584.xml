	<brief_summary>This study will look at whether ELECT, a new adhesive foam dressing, can offer an alternative to traditional wound care methods. Patients will be treated with ELECT for 14 days. Data relating to wound healing, the performance of the dressing and the opinion of the doctor will be collected. The hypothesis of this study is that the ELECT foam adhesive dressing is 'fit for purpose' and will be effective at treating a variety of wounds.</brief_summary>
