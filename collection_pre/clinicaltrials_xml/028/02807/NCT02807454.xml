	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter study to confirm the safety and efficacy of durvalumab + daratumumab (D2) in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also explore the safety and efficacy of the addition of pomalidomide + dexamethasone to durvalumab + daratumumab (PD3).</brief_summary>
