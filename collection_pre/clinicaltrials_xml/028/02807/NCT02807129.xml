	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate frailty in patients aged â‰¥ 65 years with cancer. The elderly population is very heterogeneous, it is necessary to evaluate these elderly patients before treatment to assess the risk-benefit balance. To date, this assessment relies on subjective clinical methods often not optimal, and slow to implement. An innovative method of evaluation could be the determination of elastin peptides. Indeed, the rate of these peptides, which are linked to serious conditions associated with age, rising inexorably with age and dose could help determine more objectively the type of treatment to offer older patients. Expected results : This study will allow better identification of the group of frail elderly through more relevant biological marker that clinical assessment, often subjective and not available within a period compatible with the treatment of newly diagnosed cancer. This biological assessment will also enable optimal management of elderly patients in particular by allowing the geriatrician better efficiency.</brief_summary>
