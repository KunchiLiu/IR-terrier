	<brief_title>Meeting the Needs of Pregnant Women With PTSD in Prenatal Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in pregnant women in public payer settings have shown rates 5 or more times that of other populations, and rates as high as 33% of lifetime PTSD sub-threshold symptoms. PTSD during pregnancy has been linked to poor prenatal care and high risk behaviors such as drug and alcohol use and smoking. Further, PTSD may pose a barrier to care as obstetric procedures and pregnancy may trigger PTSD symptoms and avoidance of care. PTSD is also associated with pregnancy and birth complications and negative postpartum outcomes including excessive weight gain, preterm birth, low birth weight, risk for parenting problems, and increased barriers to breastfeeding. However, screening, identification, and support for PTSD is lacking. This study will screen 750 pregnant women at risk of trauma-related stress symptoms, and adapt and test an evidence-based intervention for pregnant women with PTSD and sub-threshold PTSD symptoms served by two public payer community health centers.</detailed_description>
