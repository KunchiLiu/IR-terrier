	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to determine the mechanisms of vascular healing. The study will evaluate subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) who require an endovascular intervention of the femoro-popliteal (SFA) artery to restore blood flow to the leg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intima Versus Adventitia Drug Delivery to Elucidate Mechanisms of Restenosis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects at least 12 million Americans annually with more than half a million patients undergoing an endovascular or surgical revascularization procedure in order to treat the disease. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of patients still have blockages in the leg arteries, even after these procedures. Advances in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer promise for understanding the mechanism of failure through insights into vessel wall composition, remodeling, and inflammation. Restenosis has a known relationship to inflammation. Advances in micro-catheter technologies offer the ability to deliver anti-inflammatory medications such as Dexamethasone (DEX) directly to the adventitia and advances in drug delivery on balloon surfaces to deliver paclitaxel to the intima of the artery. This study aims to investigate if patient-specific parameters affect angioplasty outcomes, if DEX has a biological effect on the vessel wall, and if this effect is through the reduction of inflammation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening: 1. Male or nonpregnant female ≥ 35 years of age 2. Atherosclerotic, infrainguinal PAD 3. Rutherford Clinical Category 26 4. Stenosis detected by radiology that in the clinicians opinion is the reason for the PAD symptom 5. Patient is willing to provide informed consent and comply with the required follow up visits, testing schedule, and medication regimen Procedural Criteria: 1. Successful angioplasty of the target lesion or portion of the target lesion defined as ≤30% residual lumen stenosis compared with adjacent nondiseased lumen diameter, without flowlimiting dissection 2. De novo atherosclerotic lesion qualifying for angioplasty 3. &gt;50% diameter stenosis between the superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery (between the profunda and tibioperoneal trunk) 4. Reference vessel diameter ≥3 mm and ≤ 8mm 5. Successful wire crossing of lesion 6. A patent artery proximal to the index lesion. Concomitant inflow procedures including open femoral artery endarterectomy or stenting of the iliac arteries is permissible. Screening Criteria: 1. Any contraindication to receiving an MRI 2. Pregnant, nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant in &lt; 2yrs 3. Life expectancy of &lt; 1 yr 4. History of solid organ transplantation 5. Patient actively participating in another investigational device or drug study 6. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months 7. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days of index procedure 8. Chronic renal insufficiency with eGFR &lt; 45 9. Prior bypass surgery, stenting, atherectomy or angioplasty of the target lesion 10. Inability to take required study medications 11. Contraindication or known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone sodium phosphate, contrast media, gadolinium, or aspirin or Plavix 12. Systemic fungal infection 13. Acute limb ischemia 14. Prior participation of the index limb in the current study (contralateral treatment is allowed) 15. Patient is receiving longterm oral steroids for unrelated condition. This does not include inhaled steroids for bronchial diseases. Procedural Criteria: 1. Lesions extending into the trifurcation or above the profunda. Note the outflow can be treated concomitantly. Similarly the common femoral artery can be treated concomitantly with either an open endarterectomy and patch angioplasty or by endovascular methods. However the index lesion cannot be contiguous with either the CFA or the trifurcation. 2. Circumferential calcification at index lesion, which in the judgment of the investigator would prevent penetration of the microinfusion catheter needle through the vessel wall 3. Inadequate distal outflow defined as absence of at least one patent tibial artery (no lesion &gt;50% stenosis) with flow into the foot. The outflow vessel can be established at the time of primary treatment 4. Use of adjunctive therapies other than angioplasty. The Chocolate balloon and other scoring balloons are allowed however stay below reference diameter.</criteria>
