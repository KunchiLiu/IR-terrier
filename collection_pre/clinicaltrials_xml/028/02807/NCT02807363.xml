	<brief_summary>This Phase 2a, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study will determine the safety and provide evaluation of the PK/PD metrics of two different oral doses selected upon the results of the study LOPDT-PH1-01 - 4 mg oral tablets administered over 28 days as QD and BID regimens. The PK/PD profiles of the study drug will be compared to the leuprolide formulation approved for the treatment of endometriosis (a monthly intramuscular injection, Lupron Depot 3.75 mg). Major PK (e.g., a total exposure to leuprolide) and PD parameters (e.g., rates of the estradiol suppression and cessation of the menstrual period) will also be evaluated against the Lupron Depot historical data.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Profile of Orally Administered Leuprolide in Healthy Female Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic effects of the two Leuprolide Oral Tablet dosing regimens: Leuprolide Oral Tablet, 4 mg, administered QD for 28 consecutive days and Leuprolide Oral Tablet, 4 mg, administered BID for 28 consecutive days in comparison to leuprolide administered intramuscularly, Lupron Depot 3.75 mg. The study is designed as a randomized, open-label, parallel-group active-control trial. Up to thirty-two (32) subjects (12 subjects in each Leuprolide Oral Tablet treatment group and 8 subjects in the Lupron Depot group) will be randomly assigned to the study drug in a ratio of 3:3:2. The randomization schedule will be balanced by using permuted blocks. The randomization schedule may be further stratified by the study site, if necessary. The study consists of two major periods: approximately one month of dosing (either 28 consecutive days of daily oral dosing, or a single intramuscular injection on Treatment Day 1) and approximately 1 month (28 days) of post-dosing PK/PD evaluations. The total study duration, from screening to the final study visit will be up to approximately 3.5 months. After the 28-day dosing period, four follow-up visits will be scheduled at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the last dose. During each follow-up visit, serum samples will be drawn to assess leuprolide (via a single blood draw) and LH, FSH, E2, and progesterone concentrations. During each follow-up visit, subjects will be asked about onset (or absence) of menstrual period. The primary statistical analyses of PK data will be conducted on the population of subjects completing 28 days of dosing. Supporting evaluations will be performed for the cohort of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and provided any pharmacokinetic data. Similarly, the primary statistical analyses of PD data will be conducted on the population of subjects completing 28 days of dosing. Supporting evaluations will be performed for the cohort of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and provided any pharmacodynamic data. The safety analysis will be performed on all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.</detailed_description>
