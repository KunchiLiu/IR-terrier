Germany, United Kingdom, France, USA and South Korea also used ginkgo leaves to produce drugs for treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Ginkgo root, containing ginkgo lactone C, M, A, B, is sweet, warm, plain and nontoxic, and can be used to treat leucorrhea disease and emission. A study about late Alzheimer disease found that ginkgo can improve vascular patency, thus has notable effect in anti-aging of brain function in elderly people, and enhancing memories. Subjects with ginkgo juice supplement showed significant improvement in memory, attention and complex movements compared to the control group, patients who take ginkgo juice have significantly improved.</detailed_description>
