	<brief_summary>Female sex workers (FSWs) frequently experience violence from their intimate partners (non-paying lovers), which compromises their health and increases their the risk of infection with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Samdevena Plus is a complex multi-level intervention that works with FSWs, their intimate partners, the sex worker community and the general population. The intervention aims to reduce partner violence and increase consistent condom use within these relationships. The intervention consists of: (i) couples counselling sessions between FSWs and their intimate partners; (ii) separate group work among FSWs and intimate partners to increase self-esteem and encourage reflection about violence; (iii) strengthening supportive crisis management systems that address domestic and sex worker violence; (iv) training male 'champions' to encourage action against violence; and (v) training media to promote informed discussions about violence and HIV risk.The program involves changing perceptions on acceptability of physical violence as a form of discipline, challenging assumptions that give men authority over women, and working with men and women to encourage new relationship models based on equality and respect. The intervention will reach 800 FSWs and their intimate partners living in 47 villages in north Karnataka, India. The evaluation uses a cluster-randomized control trial design that introduces the intervention into half of villages for the first 24 months and the remaining half receive the intervention thereafter. The primary outcomes of the trial are: the proportion of FSWs who report: i) consistent condom use in their intimate relationship; and ii) experiencing partner violence within the past 6 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Female sex workers (FSWs) are at increased risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) compared to women in the general population, and frequently experience violence in their working and domestic lives from a variety of perpetrators, which can enhance this risk. While progress has been made in addressing violence by police and clients, little work has been done to understand and prevent violence by intimate partners (IPs) among FSW populations. Samvedana Plus is a multi-level intervention programme that works with FSWs, their IPs, the sex worker community, and the general population, and aims to reduce violence and increase consistent condom use within these 'intimate' relationships. The programme involves shifting norms around the acceptability of beating as a form of discipline, challenging gender roles that give men authority over women, and working with men and women to encourage new relationship models based on gender equity and respect. The programme will aim to cover 800 FSWs and their IPs living in 47 villages in Bagalkot district, northern Karnataka. The study is designed to assess two primary outcomes: the proportion of FSWs who report: (i) physical or sexual partner violence; and (ii) consistent condom use in their intimate relationship, within the past 6 months. The evaluation will employ a cluster-randomised controlled trial design, with 50% of the village clusters (n=24) randomly selected to receive the intervention for the first 24 months and the remaining 50% (n=23) receiving the intervention thereafter. Statisticians will be blinded to treatment arm allocation. The evaluation will use an adjusted, cluster-level intention to treat analysis, comparing outcomes in intervention and control villages at midline (12 months) and endline (24 months). The evaluation design will involve quantitative and qualitative assessments with (i) all FSWs who report an IP (ii) IPs; and process/ implementation monitoring. This is an innovative intervention programme that aims to address violence by IPs as part of HIV prevention programming with FSWs. Reducing violence is expected to reduce vulnerability to HIV acquisition, and help women to work and live without fear of violence.</detailed_description>
