	<brief_summary>This low interventional study, whose unique intervention will be to measure the blood level of a biomarker called NT-proBNP in chronic heart failure patients daily followed-up by Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) in Europe, will assess if the cardiologist referral guided by NT-proBNP measurement in patients who are currently judged by PCPs as being stable, will lead to optimization of HF treatment, defined in adherence to treatment recommendations of the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the treatment of heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Evaluation of Natriuretic Peptide Based Referral of CHF Patients in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the majority of European countries, the primary management of chronic heart failure patients is performed by General Practitioners in collaboration with cardiologists (specialists). Previous studies have shown that many patients suffering from CHF do not receive optimal pharmacological and/or device treatment for their disease. An increase in natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in heart failure patients. The purpose of the present study is to assess if a referral of clinical stable chronic heart failure patients with reduced ventricular ejection fraction (EF &lt; or = 40%) and NT-proBNP level &gt; or = 600 pg/mL to a specialist (cardiologist) will lead to treatment optimization, defined as adherence to the treatment recommendations according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. In addition, data obtained in this study will be used to describe demographic, clinical (including NT-proBNP levels) and treatment characteristics of CHF patients who are managed in the primary care setting across Europe..</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Willing and able to provide written informed consent and accept study procedures and time schedule. Age ≥ 18 years. Patients suffering from chronic heart failure (the heart failure diagnosis must have been made or confirmed by a cardiologist and/or hospital physician at any time in the patient's medical history). Patients with reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%) as confirmed at any time point in the patient's medical history. Use of investigational drugs either within 5 halflives of enrollment, or within 30 days, or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer. Major surgery in the last 3 months prior to baseline or planned major surgery or cardiac intervention during the study. Cancer or other significant comorbidities implying that the patient's condition is unstable. Comorbidities that can be associated with elevated natriuretic peptide (NP) levels: renal insufficiency, (eGFR &lt; 25 ml/min/1.73 m² calculated according to MDRD formula), recent (less than 3 months) cerebral trauma or recent (less than 3 months) cerebrovascular incident, novel diagnosis or acute exacerbation of COPD within the last 3 months. Patients who are primarily managed and regularly followedup by a cardiologist for their HF Highly frail patients whose estimated lifespan due to comorbidities by the judgement of the investigator is less than 6 months.</criteria>
