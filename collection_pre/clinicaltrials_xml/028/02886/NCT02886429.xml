	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain is the most undesired consequence of surgery, and if not managed adequately, can lead to delayed recovery and increased hospital stay. Surveys continue to reveal that postoperative pain is insufficiently managed throughout the first world, let alone in the Third World. An American survey over 20 years showed that only one in four patients had adequate relief of postoperative pain. This has led recovery room protocols to include pain as a fifth vital sign that needs to be addressed before patients are discharged to the ward</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, parallel assignment clinical trial will be done after receiving approval from the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University. A written informed consent will be taken after discussing a detailed description of the study with the patients. Patients will be allocated randomly into two equal groups by computer programs and will be contained in sealed opaque envelopes. Patients will be premedicated with midazolam (0.1mg/kg), 30 min before the operation. Patients will be monitored with ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, exhaled CO2 (end tidal capnography), and train of four. In both groups, general anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2mg/kg) and fentanyl (1 mcg/kg). Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane (1-2 %) and cisatracurium (0.05 mg/kg per dose). Fentanyl (0.5mcg/kg) will be repeated if heart rate (HR) and/or mean arterial pressure (MAP) rise 20 % above baseline values. After the end of anesthesia induction and before surgical procedure Technique of ultrasound guided paravertebral block will be done in both groups.</detailed_description>
