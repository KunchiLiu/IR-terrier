	<detailed_description>Two-thirds of people living with HIV (PLWH) show sub-optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and one-third engages in risky sex. Both non-adherence and risky sex have been associated with emotional distress and impulsivity. In this trial, the investigators will examine the utility of phone-delivered mindfulness training (MT) for PWLH. The primary outcomes comprise feasibility and acceptability of phone-delivery; secondary outcomes are estimates of efficacy of MT on adherence to ART and safer sexual practices as well as on their hypothesized antecedents. Fifty participants will be enrolled in this parallel-group randomized clinical trial (RCT). Outpatients recruited from an HIV treatment clinic will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to either MT or to health coaching intervention; both interventions will be administered during 8 weekly phone calls. ART adherence (self-reported measure and unannounced phone pill counts), sexual behavior (self-reports and biomarkers), mindfulness, depression, stress, and impulsivity will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months post-intervention.</detailed_description>
