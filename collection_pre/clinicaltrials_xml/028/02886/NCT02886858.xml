	<brief_summary>While electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in major depression is effective, high relapse rates and cognitive side effects limit its long-term use. There is no consensus about optimal continuation pharmacological treatments after a ECT course. Adjunction of tDCS to pharmacological continuation treatment after ECT may decrease relapse rates.</brief_summary>
