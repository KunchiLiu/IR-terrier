	<brief_summary>Background: Combinations of dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cell (D-CIK) based adoptive immunotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody may enhance the immune response and stop cancer cells from growing. Objective: Phase II clinical trial to investigate the safety, clinical activity and toxicity of combinations of D-CIK and anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors. Methodology: Phase II clinical trial in patients with advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma,bladder cancer,colorectal cancer,non-small-cell lung cancer,breast cancer and other solid cancers. The D-CIK was isolated from peripheral blood of participants,then activated,expanded and incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody before infusion. The enough number (1.0-1.5 *10^10 cells) of D-CIK were infused back into participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Combinations of D-CIK Immunotherapy And Anti-PD-1 In Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from participants over a 2-week period. PBMCs were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, suspended in X-VIVO 15 serum-free medium, and culture with 1000 U/ml rhIFN-γfor the first 24 h, followed by stimulation with 100 ng/ml OKT3 , 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 and 100 U/ml IL-1α to activate the CIK.Dendritic cells were incubated with CIK. Fresh medium containing 1000 U/ml rhIL-2 was added every 2 days and the cell density was maintained at 2×10^6 cells/mL.D-CIK were harvested, washed, and resuspended after culture for 14 days. Before cell transfer,D-CIK were incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody,and a fraction of the D-CIK were collected to assess their number, phenotype, and viability of cells, and to test for possible contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins. Then, autologous D-CIK (1.0-1.5*10^10 cells) were transferred to patients via intravenous infusion. Generally, participants received at least 4 cycles of treatment at 2-week intervals or received doses until disease progression occurred. If the participants were disease-stable, additional cycles of maintenance treatment were eligible. Participants will be evaluated for the safety, clinical activity and toxicity. The primary end point was the objective response for each participant at the time of D-CIK and anti-PD-1 infusion as assessed by RECIST. Peripheral blood of patients were also assessed for related cytokine using ELISPOT assays. Additional,the investigators will evaluate tumor markers in participants with clinical response/non-response by immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections from previous diagnostic or therapeutic biopsy samples to determine the predictive biomarker that may be used in future studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participantswith treatmentrefractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma,bladder cancer,colorectal cancer,nonsmallcell lung cancer,breast cancer and other solid cancers. Age 18 to 75 years. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document. Life expectancy of greater than three months. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for up to four months after receiving the preparative regimen. Adequate organ function. Serology: Seronegative for HIV antibody. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus. Hematology: WBC (&gt; 3000/mm(3)). Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3). Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl. Chemistry: Serum ALT/AST less or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl. Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl. Previous treatment with antiCTLA4 and antiPD1/PDL1. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease). History of autoimmune disease Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities). Concurrent antineoplastic therapies and systemic steroid therapy.</criteria>
