	<brief_summary>This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Smoldering Multiple Myeloma. The following intervention will be involved in this study: - Lenalidomide - Durvalumab - PVX-410</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of PVX-410, a Cancer Vaccine, and Durvalumab +/- Lenalidomide for Smoldering MM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. In this research study, the investigators are studying Smoldering Multiple Myeloma. Smoldering Multiple Myeloma is an early precursor to a rare blood cancer known as Multiple Myeloma, which affects plasma cells. The vaccine in Combination with Lenalidomide is being used to hopefully provide immunity against Myeloma. Durvalumab is a check point inhibitor which is being combined here to further augment the immune activity of the vaccine. It is a monoclonal antibody known to take the brakes off the immune system to restore immunity. Lenalidomide in previously studied trials has demonstrated an increase in immune activity. It is the hope of the investigators the combination of the vaccine, Lenalidomide, and Durvalumab will augment immunity even further. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PVX-410 as a treatment for any disease.Durvalumab is also not approved for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Lenalidomide as a treatment option for Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient has confirmed SMM according to a definition derived from the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) definition (International Working Group, 2003): serum Mprotein ≥3 g/dL or BMPC &gt;10%, or both, along with normal organ and marrow function (CRAB) within 4 weeks before baseline. C: Absence of hypercalcemia, evidenced by a calcium &lt;10.5 mg/dL. R: Absence of renal failure, evidenced by a creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL (177 µmol/L) or calculated creatinine clearance (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula) &gt;50 mL/min. A: Absence of anemia, evidenced by a hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL. B: Absence of lytic bone lesions on standard skeletal survey. Patient is at higher than average risk of progression to active MM, defined as having 2 or more of the following features: Serum Mprotein ≥3 g/dL. BMPC &gt;10%. Abnormal serum FLC ratio (0.261.65). Patient is aged 18 years or older. Patient has a life expectancy of greater than 6 months. Patient is HLAA2+ (Double and Triple Combination Cohorts only). Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patient has adequate bone marrow function, evidenced by a platelet count ≥75×109/L and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0×109/L within 2 weeks before baseline. Patient has adequate hepatic function, evidenced by a bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL and an alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤2.5×ULN within 2 weeks before baseline. If of childbearing potential, patient agrees to use adequate birth control measures during study participation. If a female of childbearing potential , patient has negative serum pregnancy test results within 2 weeks before baseline and is not lactating. If assigned to receive lenalidomide and a female of reproductive potential, must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS® program. If assigned to receive lenalidomide, patient must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the REMS® program. Patient (or his or her legally accepted representative) has provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. Patient has symptomatic MM, as defined by any of the following: Lytic lesions or pathologic fractures. Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL). Hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL). Renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL). Other: symptomatic hyperviscosity, amyloidosis. Patient has a history of a prior malignancy within the past 3 years (excluding resected basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer). Patient has abnormal cardiac status, evidenced by any of the following: New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF). Myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months. Symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or persisting despite treatment. Patient is receiving any other investigational agent. Patient has a current active infectious disease or positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis A virus (HAV). Patient has a history of or current autoimmune disease. Patient has been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks before study vaccination. Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including durvalumab. Had involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study by association with the Sponsor, study drug supplier(s) or study center or was previously enrolled in the present study. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first dose of durvalumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Frediricia's Correction. Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). History of primary immunodeficiency. History of allogeneic organ transplant. History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab or any excipient Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.</criteria>
