Epinephrine is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for anaphylaxis. A delay in epinephrine administration may contribute to an increased risk of death. Therefore, the World Allergy Organization recommends that, for the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine solution be administered intramuscularly in the mid-anterolateral thigh. In France 3 auto-injector pens are available: Anapen®, Epipen® and Jext®. For weight&gt; 30 kg, the devices have a needle size respectively of 7.49 mm, 15.02 mm and 15.36 mm. For the weights between 15 and 30 kg needle size is 7.49 mm to 12.7 mm and Anapen® for Epipen® and Jext®. Several studies suggest that the needle length needle is sometim</brief_summary>
