	<criteria>1. Male or female with age from 45 to 80; 2. Acute ischemic stroke; 3. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 515 and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 25; 4. mRS score less than 1 before onset of stroke symptom; 5. Onset of stroke symptoms within 4.5h before initiation of intravenous rtPA thrombolytic therapy; 6. Good compliance for Remote Ischemic Conditioning(RIC) therapy; 7. Informed consent obtained. 1. Stroke or serious head trauma within the previous 3 months 2. Major surgery or severe trauma with in the preceding 3 months 3. Intracranial hemorrhage 4. Systolic pressure greater than 185 mm Hg or diastolic pressure greater than 110 mm Hg, or aggressive treatment intravenous medication) necessary to reduce blood pressure to these limits 5. Symptoms rapidly improving 6. Symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if CT scan was normal 7. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or urinary tract hemorrhage within the previous 21 days 8. Arterial puncture at a noncompressible site within the previous 7 days 9. Seizure at the onset of stroke 10. Platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter 11. Received heparin within the 48 hours preceding the onset of stroke and had an elevated partialthromboplastin time 12. Received oral anticoagulation therapy preceding the onset of stroke and INR greater than 1.7 or prothrombin times greater than 15 seconds 13. CT showed a multiple infarction (low density area greater than 1/3 cerebral hemisphere) 14. Use or plan to use intervention for diagnosis or treating 15. Intracranial neoplasm, cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation 16. Any of the following unequivocal cardiac source of embolism: rheumatic mitral and or aortic stenosis, prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sick sinus syndrome, left atrial myxoma, patent foramen ovale, left ventricular mural thrombus or valvular vegetation, congestive heart failure, bacterial endocarditis, or any other cardiovascular condition interfering with the participation 17. severe hepatic or renal dysfunction 18. Contraindication for remote ischemic conditioning: severe soft tissue injury, fracture, or peripheral vascular disease in the upper limbs. 19. Life expectancy&lt;1 years 20. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 21. Unwilling to be followed up or poor compliance for treatment 22. Patients being enrolled or having been enrolled in other clinical trial within 3 months prior to this clinical trial</criteria>
