	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate patient comfort and oxygen delivery efficiency when providing supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to volunteers using an instrumented oxygen delivery system. The goals of the study are to evaluate different oxygen flow rates and oxygen delivery modes. In addition, the investigators will investigate if the system can detect apnea (cessation of breathing) and removal of the nasal cannula. The investigators will also investigate how well high flow oxygen delivered only during inspiration is tolerated and how much the end-tidal oxygen increases after two minutes of high oxygen flow delivered only during the inhalation phase of the breath.</brief_summary>
