	<brief_summary>Multiple clinical studies have indicated that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common chronic sleep disorder, may affect neurocognitive function, and that treatment for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has some neurocognitive protective effects against the adverse effects of OSA. However, the effects of CPAP treatment on neurocognitive architecture and function remain unclear. Therefore, this multicenter trial was designed to investigate whether and when neurocognitive architecture and function in patients with OSA can be improved by CPAP treatment, and to explore the role of gut microbiota in improving neurocognitive function during treatment.This study will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with allocation concealment and assessor blinding. A total of 148 eligible patients with severe OSA will be enrolled from five sleep centers, and randomized to receive CPAP with best supportive care (BSC) intervention or BSC intervention alone. Cognitive function, structure and function of brain regions, gut microbiota, metabolites, biochemical variables, electrocardiography, echocardiography, pulmonary function, and arterial stiffness will be assessed at baseline before randomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition, the investigators will enroll 74 healthy controls and assess all of the aforementioned variables at baseline.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Multiple clinical studies have indicated that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common chronic sleep disorder, may affect neurocognitive function, and that treatment for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has some neurocognitive protective effects against the adverse effects of OSA.

Methods/Design This study will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with allocation concealment and assessor blinding.

Cognitive function, structure and function of brain regions, gut microbiota, metabolites, biochemical variables, electrocardiography, echocardiography, pulmonary function, and arterial stiffness will be assessed at baseline before randomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Ethics and Dissemination Ethics approval was given by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (approval number 2015-79). The findings from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at conferences.</detailed_description>
