	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are serious diseases with poor prognosis despite recent advances. Currently, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered a cell proliferative disorder, which has not been adequately characterized due to the lack of markers. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this proliferative disorder will allow the identification of new therapeutic targets for HP. The objective of the project is to identify cell proliferative processes in severe forms of PH. Patients with PAH (n=20), CTEPH (n=20) and healthy controls (n=20) will undergo characterization of microRNAs (miRNAs) contained within circulating microparticles (MPs) analysis and mitochondrial functionality and FDG-PET to compare cell metabolism in the lungs and the right ventricle between patients and controls.</brief_summary>
