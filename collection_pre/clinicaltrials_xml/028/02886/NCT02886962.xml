	<brief_summary>Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists for atrial fibrillation whenever the CHADS2VASC score is superior or equal to 2. As there are no specific guidelines for the hemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation, the general guidelines apply. However, several retrospective studies suggest that these patients do not benefit from the oral anticoagulation regarding the risk of stroke and may even experience more bleedings and deaths. The aim of this prospective study is to prospectively compare the hemorrhagic and thrombotic risks of oral anticoagulation in comparison with no anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
