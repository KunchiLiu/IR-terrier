	<brief_summary>To evaluate the optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual field (VF), Visual evoked po-tential(VEP) characteristics between neuromyelitis optica- related optic neuritis (NMOSD-ON) and multiple sclerosis- related ON (MS-ON) in a Chinese cohort.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Correlation Between AQP-4 Ab and the Visual Function of Patients With Demyelinating ON at Onset</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were sub-divided into an AQP4 seropositive group and an AQP4 seronegative group, according to the results of the AQP4-Ab test. All patients with complete medical histories underwent routine neurological examinations, brain MRIs, and ophthalmological examinations, including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, slit lamp and fundus examination, VF and VEP, laboratory testing, including blood routine, HIV HBV HCV Syphilis, mitochondrial DNA sequencing, and a profile of autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (SSA/SSB), rheumatoid factor (RF), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), and antithyroglobulin antibody.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Optic neuritis patients The presence of significant refractive errors (3D of spherical equivalent refraction or 2D of astigmatism), intraocular pressure of 21 mmHg or higher, systemic conditions that could affect the visual system, and a history of ocular trauma or concomitant ocular diseases, including a history of media opacification, ocular pathologies affecting the cornea, lens, retinal disease, glaucoma, or laser therapy. All patients in the study groups had an episode of ON more than six months before the study inclusion time point.</criteria>
