	<brief_summary>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often becomes chronic if not treated. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is recommended psychological treatment. The OCD-team at Haukeland University hospital has developed a concentrated 4-day treatment format which has been evaluated as part of standard care. Next step in the methodological development is to conduct a randomized controlled trial where the 4-day format is compared to self-help and waiting list. The study will be conducted at Solvang DPS, Sørlandet Hospital. Participants (16 in each group) are ordinary patients (&gt;18 yrs) entitled to care in the specialist health care.</brief_summary>
