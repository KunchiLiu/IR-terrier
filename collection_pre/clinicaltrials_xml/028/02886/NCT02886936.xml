	<brief_summary>The goal of iFIT Prosthetics, LLCÂ® was to create and commercialize a modular, immediate fit, fully adjustable, transtibial prosthesis system suitable for mass production using high strength injection molded polymer materials. This goal was achieved and the aim of this project is now to conduct a feasibility and effectiveness study and to assess the design of the device. The investigators will be fitting up to 30 transtibial amputees that are current prosthesis users with the iFIT device. Patients will wear the device for 2 weeks and evaluate for comfort, stability and ease of use as compared to their conventional device. The investigators will also be obtaining socket pressures and gait biomechanics of participants wearing both devices.</brief_summary>
