	<brief_title>Auto-administered Questionnaire by Screening of Disorder of the Haemostasis in Preoperative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent recommendations formalized by experts of the French society of anaesthesiology on systematic pre-interventional examinations recommend assessing the risk of bleeding from personal and family history of bleeding diathesis and after physical examination . They recommend not to prescribe a systematic hemostasis laboratory tests in patients with a history and physical examination do not suspect a disorder of hemostasis. However, there is currently no validated questionnaire in the general population to assess the preoperative bleeding risk allowing a reliable assessment of the personal and family bleeding diathesis. The establishment of a structured questionnaire, the patient could filled before surgery consultation to guide the possible prescription of a balance sheet, could meet the new recommendations. It seems therefore important to establish this type of questionnaire in order to optimize the operation of the structure, and to limit the requirements of routine hemostasis balance sheets. To do this, the investigator wants to carry out a preliminary study to ensure the interest of the established questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed in this study is drawn from existing specialized questionnaires, the description of hemostasis disorders described factor for deficits from the doctor in charge of hemophilia expertise center and expertise of a psychologist, to refine best.</detailed_description>
