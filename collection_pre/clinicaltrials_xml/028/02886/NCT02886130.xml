	<brief_summary>In order to attain the elite level on the national scene, volleyball players need several attributes. In addition to mastering technical and tactical skills, great jumping ability is another important asset. Maximal power output needed to achieve height during a jump necessitates coordinated neuromuscular recruitment and muscle mass among others. Interestingly, there are claims that alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (A-GPC) increases acetylcholine synthesis and enhances exercise-induced increases in plasma growth hormone concentrations, two factors that could theoretically be associated neuromuscular transmission and muscle mass. However, until now only a few studies have investigated the role of A-GPC in human exercise performance. Published results were mixed. One recent study showed that isometric peak force was slightly but significantly increased when subjects had ingested a daily dose of 600 mg of A-GPC over a period of 6 days (Bellar et al., JISSN, 2015). The objective of our study is to evaluate the longer-term effects (4 weeks) using a higher dose (1000 mg/day) of A-GPC on jumping capabilities in elite male and female volleyball players.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha-GPC and Physical and Cognitive Performances in Volleyball Players.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study design will be a placebo controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Varsity male and female volleyball players (n=28) will each be asked to participate in both arms of the study, i.e. placebo and A-GPC (1000 mg/kg/day). The duration of each arm of the study will be 4 weeks separated by a 7-day washout period. The order of treatment (placebo or A-GPC) will be determined randomly. Athletes will be asked to maintain their training load during the duration of the experiment.</detailed_description>
