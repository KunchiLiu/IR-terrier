	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects aged 18 - 45 years.The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, lymphoproliferative and plasmablast responses to MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To Assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to the study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by transcriptomics. 3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study group to filovirus antigens.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects aged 18 - 45 years. The two heterologous prime-boost groups will also receive MVA-BN®-Filo at day 366. Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of four study groups (15 per group).Subjects and study staff will be blinded to a subject's study vaccine assignment within study vaccination schedule (e.g., enrollment into Group 1 or 4 versus 2 or 3 will be known). The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, lymphoproliferative and plasmablast responses to MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To Assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to the study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by transcriptomics. 3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study group to filovirus antigens. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess antigen-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to the study vaccination by study group.2) To Assess antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses to the study vaccination by study group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must be able to read and provide consent after completing the informed consent process. Subject must be able to understand and comply with planned procedures. Subject must be a man or woman aged &gt;/=18 to &lt;/=45 years. Subject must have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;/= 18.5 and &lt; 35 kg/m2. Subject must be healthy on the basis of patientreported medical history, physical examination, and the investigator's clinical judgment. Subject must have acceptable laboratory parameters* within 28 days of enrollment. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test during screening and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior to each study vaccine administration. Women of childbearing potential must have an acceptable method of contraception* from 28 days before the prime vaccination until at least 3 months after the last boost vaccination. Female subject agrees to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction from the start of screening onwards until at least 3 months after the last boost vaccination. Male subject who has not had a vasectomy and is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable method* of birth control until at least 3 months after the last boost vaccination. Male subject must also agree not to donate sperm for the purposes of assisted reproduction from the start of screening onwards until at least 3 months after the last boost vaccination. Subject must be available and willing to participate for the duration of the study visits and followup (up to 19 months from enrollment). Subject must provide identification. Subject must have a means to be contacted. Subjects must have consistent access to the internet to perform electronic data entry. Has been vaccinated with an Ebola vaccine. Has been diagnosed with Ebola disease, or exposed to Ebola including travel to West Africa in 20142016. Note: West Africa includes but is not limited to the countries of Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone. Subjects who anticipate traveling to epidemic Ebola areas before the end of the study will also be excluded from enrollment into the study. Known or suspected receipt of an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)based vaccine. Known or suspected receipt of any licensed or investigational small pox (vaccinia)based vaccine* Note: Includes any MVAbased candidate vaccine (Imvamune or Imvanex), Dryvax, or Acam2000. Military history should be reviewed with potential subjects for receipt of vacciniabased vaccine. The presence of a typical vaccinia scar should be considered exclusionary. Positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen Positive antibody to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine products. Has an acute illness or temperature &gt;/= 38.0ºC within the 3 days prior to Day 1. Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in the study or within 3 months after the last boost vaccination. A history of bleeding or clotting disorders. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation. History of malignancy other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, unless there has been surgical excision that is considered to have achieved cure. Prior organ and/or stem cell transplant. Major surgery (per the investigator's judgment) within the 4 weeks prior to study entry or planned major surgery through the course of the study. History of myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, transient ischemic attack or stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with clinically significant findings, or features that would interfere with the assessment of myocarditis/pericarditis. History of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone. Thyroidectomy or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12 months. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;/= 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;/= 90 mmHg. Note: Vital signs must be normal by protocol toxicity grading scale or determined to be normalvariant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be remeasured. Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility Received a licensed live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study, or plans to receive a licensed live vaccine within 30 days before or after each study vaccine. Received a licensed inactivated vaccine within 14 days prior to enrollment in this study, or plans to receive a licensed inactivated vaccine within 14 days before or after each study vaccine.
