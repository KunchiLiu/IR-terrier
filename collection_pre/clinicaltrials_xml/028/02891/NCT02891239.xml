	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center study. Subjects in this study will receive up to eight (8) treatments in 11±5 weeks (6-16 weeks) interval, with the PicoWay device using the 785 nm wavelength alone or combined with 1064 nm or 532 nm wavelengths. Subjects will return for one follow‐up (FU) visit at the clinic at 8 weeks following the last treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>785nm Picosecond Laser for Treatment of Benign Pigmented Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the PicoWay device for benign pigmented lesion treatment. Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, who are seeking treatment/clearance of benign pigmented lesions, will be enrolled at up to 3 participating study sites. Subjects will receive up to eight (8) PicoWay treatments at 11±5 (6-16) week's intervals. Prior to each consecutive treatment, the investigator will decide, based on degree of clearance assessment, should the subject undergo additional treatment or proceed to the 8-weeks follow-up (FU) visit with no more treatments.</detailed_description>

History of squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma 7. History of keloid scarring, abnormal wound healing and / or prone to bruising 8. Use of oral isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 12 months of initial treatment or plans on using during the course of the study. Note: Skin must regain its normal degree of moisture prior to treatment, e.g., lack of noticeable skin flaking, skin peeling and skin surface roughness 9. History of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders (including HIV infection or AIDS) or currently using immunosuppressive medications 10.

Subjects with pigmented lesions that are considered not acceptable by the study doctor or any condition that, in the study doctor's opinion, would make it unsafe to treat 13. As per the investigator's discretion, any physical or mental condition which might make it unsafe for the subject to participate in this study.</criteria>
