	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, 2-arm phase II, multi-center study to evaluate the overall response rate in newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible patients receiving 9 cycles induction therapy with either KTd or KRd followed by randomization to either carfilzomib maintenance treatment for 12 months or to observation only. Maintenance is given for 12 cycles or progression of disease, whatever occurs first.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Comparing KTd vs. KRd Induction Therapy and Investigating a K-mono Maintenance Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma, a clonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, is the second most common hematologic malignancy and accounts for approximately 72,000 annual deaths worldwide. There are an estimated 11,000 deaths per year in the US and more than 19,000 deaths per year in Europe. This study examines the efficacy of carfilzomib (K) in combination with thalidomide, an old, well established first line immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiD) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma versus K in combination with lenalidomide in 1st line. This trial will also evaluate the adherence to and the safety of a thalidomide containing triplet by using a non-neurotoxic proteasome inhibitor. Moreover, weekly dosing of carfilzomib addresses the need for a more convenient dosing schedule. Finally, yet importantly, this trial will assess the efficacy of a less cost intensive triplet and a strategy to keep lenalidomide as backup for later lines.. The second part of the study - after completing 9 cycles induction therapy with KTd or KRd - patients of both arms will be pooled and again randomized 1:1 stratified by induction therapy into two arms (K-monotherapy versus observation-only).</detailed_description>

Calculation should be based on the Cockcroft and Gault formula: [(140 Age) ∙ Mass (kg) / (72 ∙ Creatinine mg/dL)]; multiply result by 0.85 if female Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a confirmed negative serum pregnancy test within the 21 days prior to randomization (performed at a central laboratory). Females of childbearing potential and male subjects who are sexually active with FCBP must agree to use effective concomitant method(s) of contraception during the study and for 30 days (women) and 90 days (men) following the last study drug treatment administration.
