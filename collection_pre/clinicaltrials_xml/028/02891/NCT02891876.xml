	<brief_title>3-months Success Rate of Direct Pulp Capping With Biodentine®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context : When a pulpal exposure happens on a vital tooth (without irreversible inflammation), direct pulp capping can be realized by using different biomaterials : CaOH2, MTA or Biodentine®. Biodentine® is the most recent material and its success rate for direct pulp capping is poorly documented. Objective : The main aim of this study is to determine the 3 months success rate (defined as clinical and radiographic successes together) of direct pulp capping realized with Biodentine®. The other aims are to determine the factors which have an influence over the success or the failure of direct pulp capping. Method : The patient's non-opposition is obtained after a loyal explanation of the study in order to collect clinical data, if a pulpal exposure (&lt;2mm) happens on a vital tooth during decy excavation. The operator registers the following data: age of the patient, type of the concerned tooth, volume of coronal pulp, surface of the pulp exposure, location, area and duration of pulp bleeding. An evaluation is realized 3 months later with the same clinical evaluation and a radiographic evaluation. If the pulp vitality is normal, the final coronal filling is then realized. A statistical analysis will be performed to determine the success rate (binomial distribution with p=0.05). The predictive factors of success or failure will be analyzed with a logistic regression (with p=0.05).</detailed_description>
