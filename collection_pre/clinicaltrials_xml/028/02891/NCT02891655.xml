	<brief_summary>Corneal stromal thinning observed in keratoconic eyes could result from an increased synthesis of MMP at the level of the anterior stroma and the corneal epithelium induced by an overexpression of the Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer (EMMPRIN) and Galectin-3 by epithelial cells. A differential expression of EMMPRIN, Galectin-3 and metalloproteinases (MMP) may be observed between the apex of the keratoconus and the peripheral cornea. Highlighting the implication of EMMPRIN and Galectin-3 could lead to the development of specific inhibitors to slow or to stop keratoconus evolution.</brief_summary>
