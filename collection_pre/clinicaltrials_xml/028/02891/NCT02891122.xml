	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine if prolonged fasting represents an independent risk factor for hypotension during induction of general anesthesia in the elderly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of the Duration of Preoperative Fasting on Hypotension Induced by General Anesthesia in the Elderly Person</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative fasting aims to reduce the risk of adverse events (eg, inhalation), but may be responsible for dehydration whose consequence is a major hypotension. This problem of hypotension is important because it (MAP &lt;55 mmHg) is directly correlated to the occurrence of pejorative events on the cardiac and renal level and even more so that the duration of the hypotension is long.</detailed_description>
