	<brief_summary>The mechanism of bone loss in anorexia nervosa is complex. Marrow adipose tissue seems to play a role in the regulation of bone metabolism. Adipocytes secrete cytokines and adipokines that either stimulate or inhibit adjacent osteoblasts. This study consist to explore the relationship in anorexia nervosa patients with change in bone mineral density and adipokines like leptin, adiponectin and Préf-1 Bone mineral densities will be measure in 180 anorexia nervosa patients at inclusion and every two years during 6 years.It is assessed blood and urinary calcium and phosphate levels, bone remodelling markers and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin and Préf-1)</brief_summary>
