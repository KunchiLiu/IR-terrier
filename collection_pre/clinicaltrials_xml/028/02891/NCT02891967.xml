	<brief_title>One-year Clinical Evaluation of Bulk-fill Versus Conventional Incremental Posterior Restoration by FDI Criteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treated cavities will be divided into 2 groups, cavities will be incrementally layered with resin composite and each increment will be cured as directed by the manufacturer with the light curing unit (XL 3000; 3M/eSPe), with an energy higher than 450 mW/cm² (±50 mw/cm²) and other group of cavities will be restored by bulk fill composite (3M ESPE) as one increment then will be cured as directed by the manufacturer with the light curing unit. Articulation will be checked carefully with an articulating paper and occlusal adjustments will be performed using flame shaped carbide and diamond finishing burs (DENTSPLY) using water spray, restorations will be finished occlusally with finishing burs and finally polished with aluminium oxide polishing paste and a rubber cup (DENTSPLY).</detailed_description>
