	<detailed_description>Diabetes is a public health problem. The functional prognosis is partly conditioned by the occurrence of wounds at the level of the foot affected by neuropathy and/or arteriopathy. Preventive measures are necessary to avoid such complications: education, pedicure, suitable footwear, insoles. There are many types of orthopedic shoes, standard or custom-made. A key objective is to avoid excessive pressure found at the level of the front-foot, favoring the appearance of lesions like ulcers. In this context, the Anglo-Saxons have developed a type of shoe ( "rocker sole"), allowing to decrease the pressures on the front-foot with a rigid sole system associated with an elevation of the front-foot. Some, however, have shown that this type of shoe may be responsible for disorders of equilibrium to the healthy subject, what about at the diabetic patients, already at higher risk of postural disorders and falls?</detailed_description>
