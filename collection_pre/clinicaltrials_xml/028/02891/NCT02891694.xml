	<brief_summary>Recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) syndrome can be observed either in the context of a dystrophy of the basement membrane or following corneal trauma. This syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of ocular pain more or less associated with localized separations between the outer epithelium and the epithelial basal lamina (basement membrane) because of anchorage abnormalities between these two corneal layers. This could be the result of an increased expression of metalloproteinases cleaving the hemidesmosomes which anchor epithelium to the basement membrane. The investigators hypothesis is that episodes of RCEs are favored by a hyper- expression of matricial metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) induced by EMMPRIN and Galectin-3. The identification of such induction could lead to development of therapeutics inhibiting EMMPRIN and Galectin- 3 in the RCE syndrome.</brief_summary>
