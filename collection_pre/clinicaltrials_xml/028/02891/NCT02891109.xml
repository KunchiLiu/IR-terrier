	<brief_summary>The chronic immune thrombopenia is an autoimmune disease caused by B cells. These cells produce anti platelets and megakaryocytes antibodies. Some B cells, named regulatory B cells, are known to control other cells. Their action in chronic immune thrombopenia is actually unknown.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The chronic immune thrombopenia is an autoimmune disease caused by B cells. These cells produce anti platelets and megakaryocytes antibodies. Some B cells, named regulatory B cells, are known to control other cells. Their action in chronic immune thrombopenia is actually unknown. In our cohort of chronic immune thrombopenia and controls, we realized a flow cytometry analyze of B and T cells and a co-culture to determine regulatory B cells functionality.</detailed_description>
