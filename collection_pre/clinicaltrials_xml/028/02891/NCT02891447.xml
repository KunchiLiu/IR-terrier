	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether cytoreduction surgery (surgery to reduce or remove lesions), gastrectomy (where all or part of the stomach is removed), and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC, a heated chemotherapy treatment delivered directly inside the abdomen during surgery) can help control the disease in patients with gastric and/or gastroesophageal cancer. The safety of these procedures will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cytoreduction, Gastrectomy, &amp; Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemoperfusion (HIPEC) in Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Carcinomatosis or Positive Cytology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures: If participant is eligible and agree to take part, they will have the following procedures: - Standard-of-care cytoreduction surgery - Standard-of-care gastrectomy - HIPEC treatment during surgery, where participant will receive mitomycin and cisplatin over about 60 minutes. HIPEC treatment means participant will receive mitomycin and cisplatin over about 60 minutes. Heated mitomycin and cisplatin will be delivered through plastic tubing that is connected to a pump into the abdominal cavity. The pump pushes the heated mitomycin and cisplatin into the abdominal cavity and then pulls it out and recirculates the mitomycin and cisplatin. The skin of the abdominal cavity is temporarily closed during the abdominal wash. A pump will be used to pump the heated mitomycin and cisplatin in and out of the abdominal cavity over 60 minutes while the surgeon gently presses on the abdominal wall so the mitomycin and cisplatin reaches all areas in the abdominal cavity. After 60 minutes, the mitomycin and cisplatin is removed and the abdominal cavity will be washed. The remaining fluid will be removed before the surgeon permanently closes the abdominal cavity with stitches. - Participant will also receive sodium thiosulfate to help protect the kidneys and lower the risk of side effects from cisplatin. Participant will sign separate consents for the cytoreduction and the gastrectomy that will explain what is done and the risks involved. Length of Study Participation: Patient's active participation in this study will be over after their surgery. Follow Up: Within 4 weeks after participant's surgery and again every 6 months after that, they will visit the clinic or be called on the phone. Participant will be asked how they are feeling and if they are having any problems. If participant is are called, these calls should last about 5 minutes. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a CT scan, MRI, or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan of their abdomen, pelvis, and/or chest to check the status of the disease. This is an investigational study. Mitomycin and cisplatin are FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal cancer. The combination of drugs and surgery is investigational. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Distant metastatic disease not limited to peritoneum: a. Solid organ metastases (liver, central nervous system, lung). 2. Infections such as pneumonia or wound infections that would preclude protocol therapy. 3. Women with a positive urine or serum pregnancy test are excluded from this study; women of childbearing potential (defined as those who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months) must agree to refrain from breast feeding and practice adequate contraception as specified in the informed consent. Adequate contraception consists of oral contraceptive, implantable contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, a double barrier method, or abstinence. 4. Subjects with unstable angina or New York Heart Association Grade II or greater congestive heart failure. 5. Subjects deemed unable to comply with study and/or followup procedures. 6. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to protocol systemic chemotherapy that was lifethreatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.</criteria>
