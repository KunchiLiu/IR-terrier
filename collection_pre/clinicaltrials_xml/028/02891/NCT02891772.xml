	<brief_summary>Hypotension often happens immediately after anesthetic induction. Particularly in 5-10 minutes after anesthetic induction it is reported to happen more frequently. Patients may have preexisting hypovolemia resulting from dehydration and impaired compensatory responses, which increase the risk. However, it is still challenging to assess intravascular volume status in spontaneously breathing patients before anesthetic induction. Recently, the measurement of corrected flow time in carotid artery was introduced as quite useful, simple and noninvasive for the evaluation of circulating blood volume. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether corrected carotid artery flow time as determined by ultrasonography in spontaneously breathing patients before general anesthesia can predict hypotension after induction.</brief_summary>
