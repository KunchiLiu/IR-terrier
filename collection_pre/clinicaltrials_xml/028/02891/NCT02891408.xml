	<criteria>Cohort 1 (Mild Hepatic Impairment): Male and nonpregnant/nonlactating females, ages 1870 years inclusive with mildly impaired and normal hepatic function. Individuals will be current nonsmokers (no use of tobacco, nicotinecontaining or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)containing products within the last 14 days). Each individual in the control group will be matched for age (± 10 years), gender, race, and body mass index (± 15% 18 &lt; body mass index (BMI) &lt; 36 kg/m^2) with an individual in the mild hepatic impairment group. Individuals with mild hepatic impairment must have a score of 56 on the ChildPughTurcotte (CPT) Classification at screening, have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), and stable hepatic impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3 months (or 90 days) prior to study drug administration (Day 1). Cohort 2 (Moderate Hepatic Impairment): Male and nonpregnant/nonlactating females, ages 1870 years inclusive with moderately impaired and normal hepatic function. Individuals will be current nonsmokers (no use of tobacco, nicotinecontaining or THCcontaining products within the last 14 days). Each individual in the control group will be matched for age (± 10 years), gender, race, and body mass index (± 15% 18 &lt; BMI &lt; 36 kg/m^2) with an individual in the moderate hepatic impairment group. Individuals with moderate hepatic impairment must have a score of 79 on the CPT Classification at screening, have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), and stable hepatic impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3 months (or 90 days) prior to study drug administration (Day 1). Cohort 3 (Severe Hepatic Impairment): Male and nonpregnant/nonlactating females, ages 1870 years inclusive with severely impaired and normal hepatic function. Individuals will be current nonsmokers (no use of tobacco, nicotinecontaining or THCcontaining products within the last 14 days). Each individual in the control group will be matched for age (± 10 years), gender, race, and body mass index (± 15% 18 &lt; BMI &lt; 36 kg/m^2) with an individual in the severe hepatic impairment group. Individuals with severe hepatic impairment must have a score of 1015 on the CPT Classification at screening, have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), and stable hepatic impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3 months (or 90 days) prior to study drug administration (Day 1).</criteria>
