	<brief_title>Pilot Study of a Symptom Monitoring Intervention for Hospitalized Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with cancer may experience a considerable symptom burden, often requiring hospitalizations for symptom management. This study will pilot test an electronic symptom monitoring intervention, "Improving Management of Patient-Reported Outcomes Via Electronic Data (IMPROVED)," versus usual care in hospitalized patients with cancer. The goal of this study is test a model where patients' symptoms are monitored during their hospital admission electronically via tablet computers. The investigators are studying whether patients whose clinicians receive their patients' detailed symptom reports each day have improved symptom management compared to those whose clinicians do not receive their patients' detailed symptom reports each day. The study takes place at Massachusetts General Hospital and involves participating in a study for as long as the participants are admitted to the hospital. The information the investigators collect will help them determine if electronic symptom monitoring improves the care of patients with cancer.</detailed_description>
