	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I study with the goals of determining the feasibility, safety, and toxicity of administering sertraline in combination with timed-sequential cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in adults with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Primary objective: - To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of sertraline administered in combination with timed-sequential cytosine arabinoside in adult patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia. - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sertraline given in combination with timed-sequential cytosine arabinoside in adult patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sertraline and Cytosine Arabinoside in Adults With Relapsed and Refractory AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemias are characterized by net drug resistance. At the root of this drug resistance is an enhanced survival that relates to intrinsic cell cycle dysregulation and aberrations in the overall process of the repair of DNA damage. These malignancies represent a continuing therapeutic challenge, since currently no "standard treatments" for these diseases exist. Approximately 30% of adults with newly diagnosed AML are primary refractory to chemotherapy and at least 50% of those who achieve remission will relapse. For patients with relapsed or refractory AML, the expected CR/CRi rates with traditional multi-agent chemotherapies range from &lt; 10% for primary refractory AML to 25-30% for relapsed AML and cure rates &lt; 20%, even with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Thus, novel treatment approaches are needed.</detailed_description>

Patients with infection under active treatment and controlled with antibiotics are eligible Presence of other lifethreatening illness Patients with mental deficits and/or psychiatric history that preclude them from giving informed consent or from following protocol Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to potential teratogenic and/or abortifacient effect of this combination chemotherapy. Nursing mother should stop breastfeeding to be eligible due to potential risk for adverse events in nursing infant Subjects with the following cardiac risk factors must be excluded: transmural MI within prior 6 months, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, cerebrovascular accident or TIA or seizure disorder within 6 months prior to study drug administration. In addition, patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure will be excluded Patients requiring treatment with other antidepressive medications including the selective and nonselective MAO inhibitors (including linezolid), 5 HT receptor agonists (triptans), tryptophan or antidopaminergic agents (antipsychotics, metoclopramide, promethazine, haloperidol) Patients requiring prolonged treatment with fluconazole, voriconazole, or posaconazole.
