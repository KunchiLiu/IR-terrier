	<brief_title>Description of the Appearance of Brown Fat in Scanner</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brown fat is metabolically active adipose tissue. It can be responsible in PET-CT of a fixation of 18-FDG and a look of pseudo-infiltration of fat. These aspects can be sources of false positives. The objective here is to gain a better knowledge of the scanner in areas of brown fat.</detailed_description>
