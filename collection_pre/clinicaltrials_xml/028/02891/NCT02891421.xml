	<brief_summary>The project partnered with U.S. military veterans with a premier accredited therapeutic riding center for six weeks. The veterans interacted with horses by grooming and learning about them, as well as riding them for one hour per week during which they gained a variety of skills. We hoped the veterans would experience a reduction in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and loneliness, while improving their social and emotional health and self-efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Horsemanship in Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large numbers of post-deployed U.S. veterans diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and/or Traumatic Brain Injury make effective interventions urgent, to reduce symptoms and increase veterans' coping. PTSD includes anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbing. Symptoms expand health care costs for stress-related illnesses making veterans' civilian life difficult. The proposed study used a randomized experimental design with repeated measures and waitlist control group testing the efficacy of a 6-week human-horse interaction and systematic therapeutic horseback riding program in: decreasing PTSD symptoms, increasing coping self efficacy, emotion regulation, and social engagement. The Riding Group spent one hour weekly interacting with and riding the same horse at one of two PATH-accredited riding centers in Mid-Missouri supervised by an Occupational Therapist, Profession Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship (PATH) International-certified instructor, leader and side walkers as needed. Riding was directed by a systematic lesson plan. Data collection occured at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. The Control Group was assessed at the same intervals and again 3 weeks and 6 weeks after joining the Riding Group.</detailed_description>
