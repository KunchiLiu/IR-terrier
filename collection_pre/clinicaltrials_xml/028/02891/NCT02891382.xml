	<brief_summary>This pilot study aims to compare the implementation process of three different interventions that use economic incentives to promote lifestyle behavioral changes in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to identify barriers and facilitators linked to the process of implementing each of the interventions. The interventions are based on economic incentives directed to the patient (individual incentives) or a team comprised by the patient and a partner (mixed incentives). Design: Three-month randomized control pilot study to test the feasibility of implementing three types of intervention with economic incentives. Setting: Diabetes outpatient clinics from a public hospital in Peru. Population: Subjects are eligible if they (1) have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, (2) are between 18 - 70 years of age, (3) have a body mass index between 25 - 39.9 kg/m2, (4) do not have blindness or amputations or foot ulcers or are on dialysis, and (6) have the ability to provide informed consent. To be eligible as a "partner" for the participant with diabetes, the partner has to (1) be between 18 and 70 years of age, (2) not have a physical or mental impairment that does not allow him to help the participant to lose weight, (4) be available and committed to supporting the participant in achieving their weight loss goals, and (5) be able to provide informed consent. Outcomes: Feasibility of conducting a three-arm incentives-based pilot study. Secondary outcomes: Weight loss, and change in glycated hemoglobin after 3 month.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study on the Impact of Economic Incentives to Improve the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description: Economic incentives have been used to promote changes in habits such as smoking and weight loss. However no studies have been done to determine the impact of this strategy on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Additionally, previous studies do not describe ways to determine the amount of an economic incentive to promote behavioral changes, e.g adherence to treatment, increased physical activity and adherence to a healthy diet. There are also questions regarding the frequency of incentives, the type of incentive (cash or other prize), and the preferred payment method that this study will let us answer. Furthermore, we want to test whether a "team work approach" (mixed incentives) vs. an "individual approach" (individual incentives) can also play a role in introducing behavioral changes. Specific Aims are to: Compare the implementation process of three different interventions that use economic incentives to promote behavioral changes in patients with T2DM, with the end goal of identifying barriers and facilitators tied to the implementation process of each intervention. - Learn about the experience of participants with T2DM with economic incentives. - Learn about the experience of the partners of the participants with T2DM. - Evaluate patients's receptiveness to and comprehension of the educational materials used to promote behavioral changes. - Evaluate the feasibility of reaching the proposed clinical goals in terms of weight loss and glycated hemoglobin. - Evaluate patient and partner receptiveness towards the received economic incentive as a tool for promoting behavioral changes. - Explore partner activities that are most effective in helping with T2DM management of patients. - Explore whether patients with T2DM are able to keep a daily record of their efforts to manage their diabetes. - Evaluate the feasibility of packaging and implementing a future clinical trial that evaluates the impact of the use of economic incentives and teamwork in people with T2DM. Intervention: Intervention 1: Individual Incentives. A diabetes educator (DE) explains the study to potential participants and answers their questions. The informed consent of each participant with T2DM and their partner is obtained. Baseline information including demographics, socioeconomic status, time of disease, treatment and co-morbidities, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, blood pressure), chronic complications of T2DM, and glycated hemoglobin (A1c) are collected. Follow-up meetings take place every two weeks over three months. After randomization: 1. Participants receive information about the study, specifying that they will receive a prize of 80 PEN at each meeting if they lose one kilogram in a period of two weeks. 2. The DE conducts an initial evaluation to determine their weight and provide the results of their A1c. 3. A plan is created to determine the amount of kilograms loss every 2 weeks. 4. Participants receive education about nutrition, physical activity and importance of treatment adherence every two weeks. 5. Participants receive a manual with information about nutrition and physical activity for people with T2DM, as well as their weight loss plan. 6. Participants are provided with a logbook to register their efforts to manage their diabetes and loose weight. The information in this logbook provides the starting point for conversation at each session with the DE about barriers and successes in the implementation of their weight loss plan. 7. In addition to the introductory meeting, participants will have seven follow-up meetings and a final session where they are awarded with 200 PEN if the participant achieves a decrease in 1% of A1c and 400 PEN if achieves a decrease of more than 1% of A1c or a A1c of 6.5% or less. Intervention 2: Mixed Incentives 1 Intervention activities of this study arm will be the same as those established for the individual incentives group. After randomization, participants and their partners receive information about the study, specifying that the participant will receive a prize of 80 PEN at each meeting if he/she manages to lose one kilogram over a two-week period. In this intervention arm, the prize is for the participant. Partners will receive information in a brochure to guide the support process of the participant and his/her support will be recorded. Intervention 3: Mixed Incentives 2 Intervention activities of this study arm will be the same as those established for the individual incentives group. After randomization, participants and their partners will receive information about the study, specifying that they will receive a prize of 80 PEN at each meeting if the participant manages to lose one kilogram in a two-week period and if the partner is present at the bi-weekly appointments. On the day of each meeting, in this intervention group, the prize is split 50/50 between the participant and their partner. Moreover, partners receive information in a brochure to guide the support process of the participant and his/her support will be recorded.</detailed_description>
