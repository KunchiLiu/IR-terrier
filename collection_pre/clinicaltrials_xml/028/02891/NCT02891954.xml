	<brief_summary>Five daily doses of canagliflozin (300 mg) will be administered to healthy volunteers. Pharmacodynamic responses to canagliflozin will be assessed both at 2 days and 6 days after administration of the first dose of canagliflozin. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) will be conducted to search for genetic variants that are associated with each of the pharmacodynamic responses to canagliflozin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining informed consent, healthy Amish research subjects will be screened for eligibility. Immediately after obtaining blood samples for baseline clinical chemistry tests wills, patients will initiate 5 days of canagliflozin (300 mg) treatment. Fasting blood samples will be obtained to assess pharmacodynamic responses at both 48 hours and 120 hours after initiating canagliflozin. The principal pharmacodynamic responses will include 24 hour urinary excretion of glucose, serum chemistries (phosphorus, FGF23, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), glucagon, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, procollagen type I N-terminal peptide (P1NP), and beta-CTX). Research subjects will undergo genotyping, and a genome-wide association study will be conducted to search for genetic variants that are associated with pharmacodynamic responses to canagliflozin.</detailed_description>
