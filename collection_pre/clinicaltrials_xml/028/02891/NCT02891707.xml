	<brief_summary>This joint research project between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) will demonstrate that the implementation of the Mobile Device Outcomes-based Rehabilitation Program (MDORP) will improve the quality of rehabilitative care at a decreased cost to the healthcare system and a reduced burden for service members (SMs) and veterans with lower limb loss. The development of the MDORP will be executed by a multisite translational clinical care team that will use web-based mobile computing devices designed to assess mobility, enable remote prescription of targeted exercise program, and provide continual measureable outcomes to document the continuum of care with the intent of maximizing prosthetic performance while minimizing adverse medical events. The information obtained from this web-based mobile device application will be used by clinicians to promote continuity of care from the DoD and VA facilities nationwide to the community and at home.</brief_summary>
