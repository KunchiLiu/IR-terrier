	<brief_summary>Traditional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has enabled clinicians to measure disease activity but there are inherent limitations. Clinical/radiographic dissociation can be seen in some patients and the abnormalities are not specific. This pilot study is an opportunity to determine the relationship between quantitative advanced MRI measures and OCT with PET measurements of microglial activation and myelin health.</brief_summary>
