	<brief_summary>Traumatic coagulopathy is frequent and is an independent risk factor of mortality. Its detection mainly relies upon classic biological test like the prothrombin time and the international normaliezd ratio (INR). These tests are not available at the bedside. Point of care (POC) device for INR measurement are now available like the Coaguchek, Roche, France. The aim of the present study is to test the correlation between the POC INR and the laboratory INR.</brief_summary>
