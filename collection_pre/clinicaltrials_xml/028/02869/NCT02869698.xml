	<brief_title>Spectral Dynamic Imaging of Cognitive Functions in Epileptic Patients Explored Stereoelectroencephalography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive deficits after epilepsy surgery are poorly known particularly because the tools used to evaluate them. In addition, the prevention of certain postoperative deficits, is extremely difficult because of the lack of robust markers to anticipate. The various examinations conventionally used for this purpose (neuropsychological testing, functional MRI and cortical stimulation) does indeed provide insufficient information or difficult to interpret, so the development of improved methods appears as an imperative in the field of the epilepsy surgery. SID appears as such particularly adapted to the case of epileptic patients explored SEEG to provide individualized cognitive map millimeter thereof without requiring, for additional invasive act, or risk of inducing unintended crisis. In practice, this clinical research project should lead to the definition of several simple cognitive tasks which, together, could be achieved by each volunteer patient in two or three hours, and then analyzed in a similar time to provide fast, even the patient is still explored SEEG and even before cortical electrical stimulation, a list of brain regions involved in most major cognitive functions.</detailed_description>
