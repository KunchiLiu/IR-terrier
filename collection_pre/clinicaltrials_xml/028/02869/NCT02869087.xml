	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to prospectively collect information to evaluate the safety and performance of the Akesys Prava Sirolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Peripheral scaffold system for the treatment of symptomatic primary atherosclerotic stenoses and occlusions of the superficial femoral artery (SFA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The DESappear Study: Drug Eluting Scaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a mutli center, prospective ,single arm study enrolling up to 60 patients at up to 12 centers in New Zealand and Europe. The purpose is to prospectively collect information to evaluate the safety and performance of the Akesys Prava Sirolimus eluting bioresorbable scaffold system in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Patients will be treated with the investigational device and followed up clinically at 1 month, 6 Months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months post procedure. Patients will undergo non-invasive assessments such as Duplex Ultrasound (DUS), Ankle/Brachial Index (ABI) measurements and will complete a Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) and Quality of Life Questionnaire (VASCUQoL) at each follow up interval. Data will be collected via electronic data capture (EDC) and reportable Events will be reviewed by a medical monitor and classified using the MedDRA system. The information entered by the research centres will be source data verified (monitored) by an independent Contract Research Organisation (CRO.) A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with appropriately qualified members independent of the study will meet to review and adjudicate on events at predetermined intervals, according to the charter. Primary safety and efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at 6 months There will be no formal hypothesis testing in the study, endpoints will be evaluated with 95% confidence intervals around the observed point estimates. The endpoints will be evaluated with Kaplan-Meier methodology.</detailed_description>

Subject's life expectancy is at least 1 year. 4. Subject is diagnosed as having symptomatic claudication (RutherfordBecker Clinical Category 24). 5. For females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test within 14 days before index procedure is required 6. Subject is able to take a P2Y12 receptor antagonist (e.g. clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel or ticagrelor) and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Angiographic inclusion criteria: 1. A single, de novo native disease segment of the SFA 2. Proximal margin of target lesion is ≥1 cm distal to the common femoral artery bifurcation; distal margin of target lesion is within the SFA. 3. Vessel diameter from ≥5.0 mm to ≤6.0 mm evaluated by online quantitative vascular angiography (QVA) after predilatation per core laboratory guidelines. 4. Target lesion diameter reduction ≥50% 5. Target lesion length ≤53 mm 6. Patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% diameter reduction; 7. Patent distal popliteal artery free from significant lesion (≥50%) with angiographic demonstration of at least one fully patent distal outflow artery (anterior tibial, posterior tibial, or peroneal) to its terminus. Clinical exclusion criteria: 1. Previous bypass surgery or stenting at the TL; 2. Percutaneous or open surgical revascularization of the contralateral iliac or infrainguinal arteries ≤30 days prior to the planned index procedure. Iliac artery lesions may be treated during the index procedure if necessary for approach to the TL; 3. Failure to successfully cross the target lesion with a guide wire; 4. Subject has a known abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;4 cm in diameter, a known iliac artery aneurysm &gt;3 cm in diameter, or history of open surgical abdominal aortic or iliac revascularization. 5. Lesion within or adjacent to an aneurysm or presence of a popliteal aneurysm; 6. Subject is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus); 7. Acute limb ischemia; 8. History of a bleeding diathesis; 9. History of a hypercoagulability syndrome; 10. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3; a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm3; or hemoglobin &lt;10.0 g/dL; 11. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or &gt;176 μmol/L), or on chronic hemodialysis; 12. Severe liver impairment as defined by total bilirubin ≥3 mg/dl or two times increase over the normal level of SGOT/AST or SGPT/ALT; 13. Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, or heparin, contrast agent (that cannot be adequately premedicated), or drugs similar to sirolimus (i.e. tacrolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus) or other macrolides; 14. Subject requires planned procedure within 30 days that would necessitate the discontinuation of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor; 15. Subject is on chronic Coumadin therapy 16. Subject has had or is planned to have treatment with DES or drug coated balloon (DCB) within 90 days pre or postindex procedure; 17. Subject is nonambulatory; 18. Subject has undergone percutaneous intervention of the coronary, carotid, or arterial bed exclusive of the &lt;30 days prior to the planned index procedure. 19. Subject has received, or is on the waiting list for, an organ transplant; 20. Subject had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the previous 30 days prior to the planned index procedure; 21. Subject has had a stroke within the previous 30 days of the planned index procedure and/or has deficits from a prior stroke that limit the subject's ability to walk; 22. Subject has unstable angina defined as rest angina with ECG changes; 23. Subject has a groin infection, or an acute systemic infection that has not been treated successfully or is currently under treatment; 24. Subject has acute thrombophlebitis (superficial or deep) in either extremity; 25. Subject has other medical conditions (e.g., cancer, congestive heart failure or substance abuse) that may cause the subject to be noncompliant with protocol requirements or confound data interpretation; 26. Subject is currently participating or wanting to participate in a clinical trial following 6 months after the index procedure in an investigational drug, biologic, or device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints.

Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator, is unable to give informed consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse personal circumstances or lack of autonomy; 30.
