	<brief_title>ROLL vs WGLL for Non-palpable Breast Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to compare the radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) technique with the wire-guided lesion localization (WGLL) technique to assess the optimal localization and excision of nonpalpable breast lesions in patients at a unique reference medical center. A controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the WGLL and ROLL techniques in women presenting with breast lesions diagnosed by mammography or ultrasound at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología in Bogotá, Colombia from March 2006 to June 2011. This study evaluate 129 patients; 64 (49.6%) patients were treated using ROLL and 65 (51.4%) using WGLL.</detailed_description>
