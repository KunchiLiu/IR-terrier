	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the suppression ratio monitored by Bispectral Index for prediction of neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. All patient admitted to our intensive care unit after a cardiac arrest are included. The results of the suppression ratio will be collected in the 6 first hours of admission. We will evaluate the link between suppression ratio and cerebral performance category score collected at three months.</brief_summary>
