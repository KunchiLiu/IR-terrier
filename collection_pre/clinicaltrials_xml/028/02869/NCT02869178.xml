	<brief_summary>Introduction : Patients with heart failure (HF ) with systolic dysfunction of moderate to severe exhibit significant reduction in the ability to exercise compared to those with mild dysfunction , and have worse prognosis. However, some clinical markers of severity and diagnosis widely used in this population such as ejection fraction (EF) , are not always able to translate the actual degree of cardiac damage as well as their relationship with the cardiorespiratory fitness of these individuals and prognosis . Objective: To evaluate the ability of the global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) in predicting exercise tolerance in heart failure patients with moderate and significant systolic dysfunction.</brief_summary>
