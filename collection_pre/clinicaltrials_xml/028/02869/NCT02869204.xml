	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate whether a combination of a local injection of platelet rich plasma (PRP) combined with a daily supplement of vitamin C, zinc, L-arginine, as well as high protein diet (1.5 g of protein per kilo body weight per day) can promote tissue healing in patients undergoing open upper-abdominal surgery. Primary endpoint is cases of wound infection and secondary endpoints are time of tissue regeneration (days), judged by traditional clinical observation and experimentally assessed by ultrasound. The experiment is performed as a parallel two-armed, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 40 subjects will be included in the trial i order to ensure the power of the study, despite a drop off of up to 25%.</brief_summary>
