	<brief_title>Package of Mentholated Measures for the Relief of Thirst in the Anesthesia Recovery Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative thirst is intense and has a high incidence. There is evidence that strategies using cold and menthol could be viable alternatives to reduce thirst and the discomforts arising from it. For that reason, this study evaluated the efficacy of a mentholated package of measures (lip moisturizer and ice popsicle) compared to a non-mentholated package of measures in alleviating thirst in the anesthesia recovery room.</detailed_description>
