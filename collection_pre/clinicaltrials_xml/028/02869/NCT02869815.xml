	<brief_summary>The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy is controversial. Lower detection rate and higher false negative rate are the main problem. The purpose of this study is to determine the detection rate and the false negative rate of SLNB by indocyanine green (ICG) in addition to blue dye (methylene blue) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with large or locally advanced breast cancer. This is a single arm clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients indicated for neoadjuvant therapy would be recruited in this study. During the surgery, SLNB using the dual tracing method would be applied before axillary clearance. After the surgery, histological results of the SLN and non-SLN would be analysed.</detailed_description>
