	<brief_title>A Study of CAN008 for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAN008 is a glycosylated fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CD95 (APO-1/Fas) and the Fc domain of human IgG1. CAN008 blocks the interaction between CD95 and its cognate ligand CD95L. The target of CAN008 is the inhibition of CD95L. CD95L is expressed in glioblastoma whose cells are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. CD95L was shown to be a crucial trigger in invasion and migration of tumor cells and neutralizing CD95L abolishes the invasive capacity of glioblastoma cells. The purpose of the study is: 1. To describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. 2. To determine the duration of disease free survival and overall survival associated with this therapy.</detailed_description>
