	<brief_summary>To date, there is no treatment strategies for these patients according to American Association of the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines and Baveno V consensus. Thus, we aim to compare the safety and efficacy of TIPS and conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic therapy and/or anticoagulation) in patients with PVT and CPTV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TIPS for Variceal Rebleeding in Cirrhotic Patients With Occlusive Portal Vein Thrombosis and CTPV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is about 16% in cirrhotic patients. Chronic PVT often cause two main undesirable consequences: symptomatic portal hypertension (such as variceal bleeding or ascites) and cavernous transformation of portal vein (CPTV). The former could lead to death and the latter increases the difficulty of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) treatment, which is considered as a main effective treatment for symptomatic portal hypertension. Some patients with CPTV and variceal bleeding only have to receive conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic therapy and/or anticoagulation). With advances in technology, modified TIPS procedure could significantly improve the operation success rate of patients with CPTV. To date, the difference in safety and efficacy between TIPS and conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic therapy and/or anticoagulation) in patients with PVT and CPTV is still unclear.</detailed_description>
