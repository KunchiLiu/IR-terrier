	<brief_summary>The sequence type 131 (ST131) is a predominant lineage among extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli. It plays a major role in the worldwide dissemination of E. coli that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of ESBL producing ST131clonal group in our university hospital. All patients with an infection due to ESBL E. coli will be prospectively included for a 2-year period. ST131 isolates will be identified and risk factors associated to ST131 will be determined in comparison to non-ST131 ESBL E. coli.</brief_summary>
