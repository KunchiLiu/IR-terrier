	<brief_summary>Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells. Myeloma accounts for almost 14% of all hematologic cancers and is essentially incurable. Myeloma commonly evolves from a precursor disease, Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Despite intensive study, the etiology of MGUS and myeloma are unknown and no lifestyle or environmental exposure factors have been identified that are consistently linked to increased risk of MM, MGUS or the transition between the two. The overall goal is to identify risk genes for dysglobulinemia, and more specifically Multiple Myeloma. This will involve the conservation of cells in a bank and genetic sequencing on samples obtained from families with at least two cases of dysglobulinemia. Material used for sequencing is likely to include fresh peripheral blood cells or lymphoblastoid lines established from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients.</brief_summary>
