	<detailed_description>Low bone mineral density (BMD) is commonly reported in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Oral and intravenous calcium, vitamin D and bisphosphonates have been commonly used to treat BMD, but their efficiency is may be inadequate due to limited absorption and compliance. Denosumab represent a new drug, which helped to prevent osteoclast development and activation, hence decreased bone resorption in some studies. The aim of the study was to assess its value in chronic intestinal failure patients receiving HPN. Between November 2011 and March 2013 denosumab was administered to 16 HPN patients (9 F, 7 M mean age 55.4) with intestinal failure. Regional dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of spine and hip were performed before the therapy was initiated, and after 12 months. BMD, T-score and Z-score were measured.</detailed_description>
