QT/QTc interval prolongation) Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication Current smoker or exsmoker who quit smoking less than 30 days prior to screening Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 20 g per day for females and 30 g per day for males) Drug abuse or positive drug screening Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication or intended donation during the trial Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to administration of trial medication or during the trial Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males or repeatedly greater than 470 ms in females) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome) Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance, because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study History of major bleeding events (e.g. gastric bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage) based on the investigator's judgement Intake of drugs that may interfere with fluvoxamine such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tizanidine. Intake of hormonal contraception or ovary hormone replacement therapy in female subjects Subjects with a medical history of suicidal behaviour History of increased intraocular pressure Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or plans to become pregnant within 30 days after study completion Lactation period</criteria>
