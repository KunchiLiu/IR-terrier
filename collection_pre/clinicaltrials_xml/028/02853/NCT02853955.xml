	<brief_summary>Percutaneous edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative treatment option for selected patients at high risk for cardiac surgery. Patients with recurrent mitral regurgitation after surgical mitral valve repair (sMVR) are per se at increased risk for another cardiac surgery. The purpose of this multicenter retrospective analysis of patients treated with a MitraClip速 after sMVR, is to evaluate the effectiveness and durability of this minimally invasive treatment option in this subset of patients.</brief_summary>
