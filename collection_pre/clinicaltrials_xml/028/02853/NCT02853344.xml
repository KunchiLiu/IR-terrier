	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of monotherapy pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There will be two cohorts in this study: Cohort A will consist of participants with clear cell (cc) RCC and Cohort B will consist of participants with non-clear cell (ncc) RCC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cohort A (clear cell RCC cohort) participant must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell RCC or RCC with clear cell component (with or without sarcomatoid features). Cohort B (nonclear cell RCC cohort) participant must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of nonclear cell RCC (with or without sarcomatoid features). Participants with tumors that have a component of clear cell histology are not eligible for inclusion in Cohort B. Has locally advanced/metastatic disease, i.e., Stage IV RCC per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) or have recurrent disease. Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. Has received no prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Must provide adequate tissue for biomarker analysis for Cohorts A and B from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Participants receiving bone resorptive therapy (including but not limited to bisphosphonate or RANKL inhibitor) must have been on stable doses for ≥4 weeks prior to treatment allocation. Has Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70%, as assessed within 10 days prior to treatment allocation. Demonstrates adequate organ function. Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. Male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to allocation, has had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to allocation or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to allocation, or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or to Baseline) from AEs due to prior treatment. Had prior treatment with any antiprogrammed cell death 1 (antiPD1), or antiprogrammed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1), or PDL2 agent or an antibody targeting any other immuneregulatory receptors or mechanisms. Examples of such antibodies include antibodies against indoleamine2,3dioxygenase (IDO), PDL1, interleukin 2 receptors (IL2R), glucocorticoidinduced tumor necrosis factor receptorrelated protein (GITR). Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment, except in the case of central nervous system (CNS) metastases (see below). Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic or immunosuppressive agents. Has a known additional malignancy that has had progression or has required active treatment in the last 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or carcinoma in situ are not excluded. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Has known active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of treatment allocation. Has had a prior solid organ transplant. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study drug.</criteria>
