	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the Infanrix hexa booster dose given at 12-18 months of age to infants who received primary vaccination at 6-12 weeks. All infants in this booster study were born to pregnant women who participated in the study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047].</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects' parent(s)/Legally acceptable representatives (LAR(s)) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits). Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to performing any study specific procedure. A male or female child 9 months of age at the time of enrolment. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Subjects born to mothers who were vaccinated in 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)047] study. Child in care Concurrently participating in another clinical study, within three months prior to the booster vaccine dose and at any time during the present booster study, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device). Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs during the period within six months prior to the booster vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥0.5mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs at any time during the study period (e.g. infliximab). A vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol administered during the period starting from 30 days before the booster dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after*, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine and other vaccines given as a part of the national/regional immunization schedule, that are allowed at any time during the study period. In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g.: a pandemic) is organised by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunization program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that vaccine provided it is licensed and used according to its SPC or Product Information (PI) and according to the local governmental recommendations and provided a written approval of the Sponsor is obtained. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Major congenital defects. Serious chronic illness. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period within three months before the booster dose of study vaccines or planned administration during the study period. Encephalopathy defined as an acute, severe central nervous system disorder occurring within 7 days following vaccination with Infanrix hexa and generally consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, generalised or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, with failure to recover within 24 hours. History of Hib, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcal, poliovirus and hepatitis B diseases since the conclusion visit of study 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)048 PRI]. Previous booster vaccination against Hib, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcus, hepatitis B and/or poliovirus since the conclusion visit of study 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)048 PRI]. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines (e.g: antigen, excipients). Hypersensitivity to latex. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal route. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.</criteria>
