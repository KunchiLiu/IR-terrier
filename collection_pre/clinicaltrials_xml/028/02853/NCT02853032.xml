	<brief_summary>Mounting amounts of evidence suggests that non-invasive stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) maybe a safe and effective treatment modality for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However the large variability in the magnitude of clinical outcomes reported is likely related to the current lack of knowledge of ideal side of stimulation (left vs right) and the limited precision in the targeting of brain circuits needed to obtain an optimal treatment response. In this protocol the investigators will: 1) generate individualized treatment plans based on an individual's functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and meta-analytical based connectivity analysis to guide the delivery of adjunct, imaging-based &amp; robotically delivered rTMS to active duty military (ADM) subjects with PTSD participating in an intensive program providing integrated evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacological management (Treatment as Usual (TAU)). 2) To use clinician ratings and self-report PTSD symptom scales, as well as other indicators of clinical change, to determine whether compared with TAU, addition of adjunct rTMS improves clinical outcomes. 3) To conduct neuroimaging-based assessments aimed to measure rTMS effects on network connectivity in ADM receiving treatment for PTSD and the potential correlation of connectivity changes with clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Image-guided, Robotically Delivered TMS Treatment for Combat-Related PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, 20 consecutive day trial of adjunct rTMS to the right DLPFC for ADM with PTSD receiving TAU at Laurel Ridge Treatment Center (LRTC; San Antonio, TX). Methods: Consenting ADM receiving TAU for PTSD at LRTC will be randomized to receive 20 consecutive days of adjunct rTMS according to one of these two treatment arms: Arm 1 TAU plus rTMS to the right DLPFC and Arm 2 TAU plus sham rTMS. At UTHSCSA's Research Imaging Institute (RII), where all brain imaging and neurocognitive assessments will be conducted, rTMS treatment plans will be generated based on (pre-treatment) anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to guide the optimal robotic positioning of the TMS coil to accurately target each subject DLPFC. Initial diagnostic interview and weekly clinical follows ups will be conducted at the LRTC by research clinicians blinded to subjects' research group. A comparison of baseline brain connectivity measurements with subjects' neuroimaging follow ups conducted at treatment Week 3 will be conducted to identify network connectivity changes potentially associated to treatment response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female Englishspeaking patients (either activeduty military or civilian) receiving treatment at LRTC between the ages of 1865 years; 2. Patients must have a diagnosis of PTSD confirmed by the ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale (CAPS5) at screening, 3. Subjects must have a minimum PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSMV (PCL5) symptom severity rating of 35. 4. Treatment resistance (i.e. meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMV) CAPS criteria for PTSD) despite completing at least one adequate trial of an Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) or SerotoninNorepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) at an FDArecommended dose for at least 68 weeks. 5. Subjects on SSRIs or other antidepressants, hypnotic medications including modulators of GammaAminobutryic Acid (GABA)A receptor function, trazodone, atypical neuroleptic or prazosin may enter the study if they are deemed to be on a stable dose of their medication. 1. Subjects with a diagnostic history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or currently exhibiting psychotic features as confirmed by the MiniInternational Psychiatric Interview (MINI). 2. Serious, active suicidal risk as assessed by evaluating psychiatrist. Serious active suicidal risk is determine as imminent risk of suicide reflected in a patient having a plan and the intent to end his or her life. History of suicidality in itself is not exclusion for participation in this protocol so long as the evaluating psychiatrist determines that there is an absence of serious active suicidal risk and the means to keep patients safe. 3. Substance use disorder during the 3 months prior to screening; except for Mild or Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder according to DSMV criteria. 4. Any history or signs of serious medical or neurological illness including seizure disorders. Except for seizures, a subject with a clinical abnormality may be included only if the study clinician considers the illness will not introduce additional risk and will not interfere with the study procedures. 5. History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with loss of consciousness for 20 minutes or more as determined by the Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen (TBI Screening Tool). 6. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening. 7. Any history or signs of metal objects (e.g. surgical clips, cardiac pacemakers, metal implants, etc.) in the body at the time of screening. MRI can have risks for persons with foreign bodies implanted in their body.</criteria>
