	<brief_title>Misoprostol as First Aid Measure to Address Excessive Postpartum Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a quasi-experimental, pre-post intervention study that will be conducted over a period of 12 months and will span two phases: Phase 1 (baseline) (6 months): Data on deliveries will be collected for pregnant women who deliver during this phase. Data will also be collected on the treatment administered in any PPH cases. Women will be counseled on and also receive educational materials on how to identify excessive bleeding and the importance of seeking care at a facility if excessive bleeding occurs. Phase 2 (misoprostol) (6 months): During this phase, the study will pilot the first aid concept. Women will be provided with a single dose of 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol (200 mcg x 4 tablets) during their third trimester to use in the event of excessive postpartum bleeding, as well as the educational materials and counseling provided during the Phase 1. The misoprostol is intended to serve as a first aid treatment measure and although seeking additional care is challenging in this setting, women and families will be advised to have a plan ready to seek immediate care at a health facility as soon as they take the misoprostol. During both study phases, data will be collected on maternal, clinical, and neonatal outcomes for all deliveries that occur in the study area. If women receive any care related to their delivery, data collectors will document this information.</detailed_description>
