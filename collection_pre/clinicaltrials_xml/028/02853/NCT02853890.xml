	<brief_summary>Obstetric analgesia is a requirement of our times. The different applicable methods vary in effectiveness. The essential part is represented by epidural analgesia which remains one of the most effective methods. It is important to know other methods to respond to all requests. The applications of these methods, patient satisfaction and psychic experience, complications or incidents remain poorly or partially evaluated in France. The main objective is to describe the different techniques of anesthesia/analgesia actually used in France for the management of pain during vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections on a representative sample of all maternity hospitals at a given time(7 days per maternity hospital, 63 maternity hospitals (levels I,II,III), so about 2500 births). Secondary objectives will be multiple : - Describe the results of analgesic methods on the physical pain of patients during labor by a global visual analog scale - Describe the feeling of pregnant women relative to the different anesthesic and analgesic techniques, by an analysis of the questionnaire responses - Describe the frequency of adverse events of birth</brief_summary>
