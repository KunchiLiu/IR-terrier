	<brief_summary>Anhedonia and avolition reflect emotional and motivational disorders, respectively. However, if these disorders play a major role in the symptomatology of schizophrenia, their mechanisms remain poorly understood, and existing treatments are inefficient on these symptoms. The literature suggests that the impairment does not concern emotion or motivation per se, but rather their influence on cognition. This project aims at using recent advances in the fundamental domain to better understand the cognitive and neuronal mechanisms of the patients' alterations, and especially how emotion and motivation influence cognition in schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
