	<brief_summary>Main purpose：In the face of listening to nerve injury at early stage, utilizing autologous adipose stem cell transplantation in the treatment of makes the acceptance micro vascular decompression hemifacial spasm patients to nerve function to obtain a better recovery. Secondary purpose ：To clarify the efficacy of stem cells in the treatment of cranial nerve dysfunction, and to provide evidence for the treatment of other cranial nerve dysfunction. Cases in group：Appearing on the surface of microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm to decrease neural electrophysiological index of patients research design：Single center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled Observation index：Facial nerve clinical score, facial nerve muscle compound action potential, electrical measurement, cerebrospinal fluid index Evaluation of therapeutic effect：Facial nerve function evaluation (House-Brackmann classification, facial nerve function classification scale SFGS), facial nerve electrophysiology evaluation (facial nerve muscle compound action potential), electric measurement Safety evaluation：Clear evaluation of hemifacial spasm and micro vascular decompression were listening to nerve in intracranial segment wrapped around the autologous fat stem cell therapy overall safety and evaluation methods including adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram.</brief_summary>
