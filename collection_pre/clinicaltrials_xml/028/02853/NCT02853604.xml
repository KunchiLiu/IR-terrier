	<brief_summary>High-risk locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix (HRLACC) following concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This is a group of patients with a significant unmet need. The estimated probability of disease recurrence or death within 4 years of diagnosis is 50% and the prognosis is very grave for those who experience a recurrence. The purpose of the study is to compare the disease free survival (DFS) of ADXS11-001 to placebo administered following CCRT with curative intent in subjects with HRLACC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of ADXS11-001 in Subjects With High Risk Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of ADXS11 001 administered in the adjuvant setting after completion of cisplatin-based CCRT in subjects with locally advanced cervical cancer at higher risk for recurrence (HRLACC), or death. All eligible subjects will have received CCRT administered with curative intent according to institutional/national guidelines as well as meeting the minimum standards defined in the protocol. Subjects must initiate the Screening period within 10 weeks after the completion of CCRT. Baseline radiographic assessments and clinical laboratory assessments must be completed no longer than 28 days prior to and 3 days prior to the first study treatment infusion, respectively. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:2 to receive either placebo or ADXS11-001. Subjects will receive 1 infusion of study treatment administered every 3 weeks for 3 doses for the first 3 months. Thereafter, subjects will receive study treatment every 8 weeks for a total of 5 doses or until disease recurrence. Subjects will receive a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic or placebo starting 72 hours following the completion of study treatment administration. An interim analysis will be performed when there is at least one-half the number of DFS events required for full maturity of the study.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Uterine Cervical Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects must have a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required. Subjects must have received definitive therapy with curative intent, which consist of at least 4 weeks of treatment with cisplatin and a minimum of 40Gy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Have performance status of 0 or 1 on the GOG performance scale Demonstrate adequate organ function Has not achieved diseasefree status after completion of CCRT administered with curative intent. Has FIGO Stage IVB Has histologies other than squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix. Has implanted medical device(s) that pose a high risk for colonization and/or cannot be easily removed (e.g., prosthetic joints, artificial heart valves, pacemakers, orthopedic screw(s), metal plate(s), bone graft(s), or other exogenous implant(s)). Has a contraindication (sensitivity or allergy) to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. Has undergone a previous hysterectomy defined as removal of the entire uterus or will have a hysterectomy as part of their initial cervical cancer therapy. NOTE: Women who have had a partial/subtotal hysterectomy are eligible to participate in the study</criteria>
