	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the short-term effects of thoracic spine thrust manipulation on participants with low back pain. Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either the lower thoracic spinal manipulation and a standard set of exercises, or a sham manipulation and the same standard set of exercises. It is hypothesized that thoracic manipulation when combined with core strengthening exercises will have positive short term improvements in pain and function for patients with LBP as compared to a sham manipulation combined with core strengthening exercises.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thoracic Spine Manipulation for Individuals With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to use a randomized controlled trial design to investigate the effects of thoracic spinal manipulation in conjunction with core strengthening exercises when compared to a sham manipulation and core strengthening exercises on patients with low back pain. Core strengthening exercises have been shown to improve pain and functional status in patients with non-specific low back pain when compared to conventional exercise. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that exercise alone is not adequate for the management of low back pain. Spinal manipulation has demonstrated promising results for the management of low back pain, but it is unclear whether the targeted location of manipulation is important. It is hypothesized that thoracic manipulation when combined with core strengthening exercises will have positive short term improvements in pain and function for patients with LBP as compared to a sham manipulation combined with core strengthening exercises based on the theory of regional interdependence. The specific aims of the study are as follows: 1. To determine the effects of thoracic spine manipulation and core strengthening exercise on function in individuals with low back pain, specifically measured by changes in Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (MODQ). 2. To determine the participant's perception of improvement following thoracic spine manipulation and core exercises, measured by global rating of change (GROC), when compared to a sham manipulation. 3. To determine the effects of thoracic spine manipulation and core exercises on fear avoidance, measured by fear-avoidance belief questionnaire (FABQ), on individuals with low back pain. 4. To determine the effects of thoracic spine manipulation and core exercises on pain using numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). The ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of a manipulation targeted at the thoracic spine in conjunction with core exercises could provide clinicians a simple, effective treatment strategy for low back pain that not only has minimal injury risk, but has the potential to improve pain and function, ultimately decreasing the healthcare costs associated with low back pain. The effects of treatment on disability, fear-avoidance, and pain will be analyzed using a 2x2 repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANCOVA), with pre/post-test measures and time as the two factors and duration of symptoms serving as a covariate. An independent t test will be used to determine differences for the Global Rating of Change between groups at follow up, and the number needed to treat (NNT) will be calculated. Spinal manipulation has some potentially serious risks including, fracture, numbness, tingling, or injury to the spinal cord. However, these risks are very low in the thoracic spine where manipulation is targeted during this study. In a recent systematic review which evaluated the safety of thoracic spine manipulation, the authors found only seven cases of serious trauma which have resulted from thoracic spine manipulation. The majority of these cases were performed by a chiropractor and it is unsure whether participants had contraindications to manipulation. In order to mitigate these risks, participants will be thoroughly screened for contraindications to spinal manipulation. If an adverse event does occur, the participant will be referred to the appropriate provider and their participation in the study will be discontinued.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The precise inclusion criteria scores are not indicated in the inclusion criteria below to avoid inappropriate selfselection of participants. After enrollment and data collection are complete, the investigators will list the actual minimum scores allowable for inclusion, when the data can no longer be skewed. A certain minimum pain intensity score on an 11point numeric pain rating scale (ranging from 010 points) A certain minimum disability rain on the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire Individuals who have received a prescription for physical therapy for low back pain Contraindications to spinal manipulation such as osteoporosis, active cancer, previous spinal surgery, spinal fracture, acute rheumatic disease, active tuberculosis, pregnancy, active infections of the vertebra or intervertebral disc, any neurological evidence suggesting compromise of the nerve roots or spinal cord (changes in myotomal strength, deep tendon reflexes, or sensation), or cauda equina syndrome Insufficient English skills to complete questionnaires Are involved in litigation or a workman's compensation claim</criteria>
