	<brief_summary>This study aims at investigating the acute influence of artificially sweetened beverages consumption (as compared with sugar-sweetened beverages and water consumption) on brain responses to the viewing of food images, on physiological responses (gut-derived hormones and lipid metabolites) and on the food intake behavior.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Consuming Artificial Sweeteners and Sugar on Cerebral and Physiological Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is made on a randomized controlled crossover design including three conditions (water, sugar, artificial sweeteners). Measurements will be performed in fasting and fed conditions. The test-meal will comprise either an artificially or sugar-sweetened beverage or water (control). The spatio-temporal brain dynamics to the viewing of food pictures will be assessed by means of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and electrical neuroimaging analyses. Venous blood and urine will be collected. Blood pressure, cardiac frequency and bio-impedance measurements will be performed. Food intake behavior will be assessed by means of questionnaires and a free-choice buffet. Each tested condition (water, sugar, artificial sweeteners) will be preceded by a run-in period during which the participants' diet will be controlled (2-day isoenergetic diet).</detailed_description>
