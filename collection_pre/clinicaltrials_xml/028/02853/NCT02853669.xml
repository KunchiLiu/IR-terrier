	<brief_summary>Adductor canal block (ACB), Saphenous nerve block, which is a block of a purely sensory nerve which shares in nerve supply of knee joint has a hypothetical advantage of better pain management with less motor affection. Also, it has a clear anatomical landmark that will increase the success rate (femoral artery) (*).On the other hand, being a branch of the femoral nerve and far distal from the plexus, this can decrease the blocking effectiveness. Likewise, the great variation of the knee nerve supply. This prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial is comparing ultrasound guided adductor canal block (ACB) versus ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block (LPB) in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty aiming at decreasing post-operative pain, helping in early mobilization and better physiotherapy. This study hypothesizes that ACB, compared with LPB, will exhibit less motor, weakness, fewer opioids consumption with the same or better pain score.</brief_summary>
