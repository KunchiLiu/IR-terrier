	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine COPD prevalence among patients registered in the healthcare system of Moscow (under outpatient surveillance at polyclinic institutions of Moscow). To describe the clinical profile of COPD patient who is under outpatient surveillance at polyclinic institutions of Moscow (including demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, occupation), smoking status, disease duration, disease severity grade, distribution by disease phenotype, disease exacerbation rate in the setting of real-life clinical practice).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry of COPD Patients From Outpatient Polyclinic Healthcare Institutions of the Russian Federation in Moscow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The registry of COPD patients in fact represents two parts of a non-interventional multicenter descriptive study: one of these parts is a retrospective study including all COPD patients, and the other part is an observational prospective cohort study of COPD patients included into the registry and newly diagnosed under outpatient surveillance at the selected polyclinic institutions of Moscow with annual retrospective entry of data. Monitoring will be performed for 3 years with regular (yearly) entry of data concerning patients with diagnosed COPD; it will include all patients with registered diagnoses J40 - J44 according to ICD-10 with spirometry results confirming COPD diagnosis, who are at the study start under outpatient surveillance, and also newly registered patients diagnosed with COPD (ICD-10 J40 - J44, as confirmed by spirometry results) during the conduction of the registry program at the selected polyclinic institutions of Moscow (according to ICD: J40 - Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic, J41 - Simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis, J41.0 - Simple chronic bronchitis, J41.8 - Mixed simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis, J 42 - Unspecified chronic bronchitis, J 43 - Emphysema, J 44 - Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) based on regular (yearly) retrospective analysis of patient records with data entry into a consolidated database. The present observational multicenter descriptive study will be conducted in the setting of routine clinical practice of outpatient polyclinic institutions. There is no hypothesis to be tested in this study. The study will be conducted in outpatient polyclinic institutions of the primary medical care system of Moscow. Pulmonologists of the primary medical care system will be engaged as investigators. These are the physicians, whom the patients with tentative COPD diagnosis are referred to in the Russian Federation and who within the scope of their responsibilities have access to source medical records and who evaluate the quality of diagnosis and extent of treatment prescribed to COPD patients. The present study is observational therefore it does not require a treatment regimen or directions for patient management. The patients receive medical care in line with routine practice for treatment of this disease in the Russian Federation. Patient participation in the study should not in any way affect the principles and extent of treatment received by the patient according to routine clinical practice. Physicians-investigators will enter into the study the information (data) concerning COPD patients, both those already registered at the selected medical treatment and preventive care institution, and newly registered patients as they seek attention at the outpatient polyclinic institutions. Patient data will be entered into the registry de-identified. The patients will be identified by their screening number and initials. Then the Physician-investigator will evaluate patient compliance with inclusion criteria. The study will enrol patients meeting all the inclusion criteria and not having any of the exclusion criteria. Only the physician who enters patient data into the regional COPD registry possesses patient contact information, and henceforth only this physician will enter de-identified patient data according to study design. This physician does not influence the choice of examination extent, treatment strategy and medication. Primarily epidemiological methods will be used for presentation of the study results. Descriptive analysis approach will be applied for analysis of the study objectives. Descriptive statistics will be used for analysis of the study population, baseline and clinical data. Descriptive statistics will include frequency tables (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables; n, frequency and percentage for categorical variables). Percentages will be evaluated together with 95% confidence intervals (in appropriate cases).</detailed_description>
