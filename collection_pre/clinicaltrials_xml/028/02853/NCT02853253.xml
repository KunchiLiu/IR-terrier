	<brief_summary>SMOF is a large double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial aiming to compare the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks corrected age in premature infants &lt; 29 weeks and / or with birth weight &lt; 1000 g receiving either SMOFlipid® or Medialipide® 20%. This study will offer new information for optimizing the management of preterms requiring parenteral nutrition. The investigators hypothesis is that the composition of SMOFlipid may decrease lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in preterms, resulting in a lower incidence of BPD.</brief_summary>
