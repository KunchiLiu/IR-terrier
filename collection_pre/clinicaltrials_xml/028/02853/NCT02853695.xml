	<brief_title>Implementation of Hysteroscopy in Flanders and the Netherlands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysteroscopy is a minimally invasive method for diagnosis and treatment of intra-uterine abnormalities. Complication and failure rates are low because of the direct visualisation of the treated abnormality. Moreover, hysteroscopic procedures replaced 'blind' (curettage) and more invasive interventions (hysterectomy). The field of hysteroscopy has developed over the years. Changes occurred in hysteroscopic instruments and in the use of energy sources. An important development is the smaller diameter of the hysteroscopic system which makes it suitable for an outpatient setting. Not every gynaecologist, however, has the appropriate hysteroscopic skills or setting to carry out these procedures. The incorporation of hysteroscopic procedures into daily practice in Flanders is unclear. In the Netherlands 2 surveys were conducted in the past to question the treatment options for polypectomy in an outpatient setting on the one hand and the diffusion of hysteroscopy on the other hand. The investigators want to study the diffusion of hysteroscopy in Flanders and the Netherlands. Moreover the investigators want to provide an overview of the hysteroscopic procedures implemented, as well as the setting they are performed in. An electronic questionnaire (LimeService) will be sent to all gynaecologists in Flanders and the Netherlands. Participation is voluntary and anonymous. After informed consent all gynaecologists are asked to complete the first part of the questionnaire containing general information. The second part is specific for gynaecologists performing hysteroscopy themselves, and inquires about the procedures they carry out.</detailed_description>
