	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of gender on pharmacodynamic interaction of propofol and dexmedetomidine, exploring the effect of gender on propofol unconsciousness median effective concentration with different dose dexmedetomidine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Gender on Interaction of Propofol and Dexmedetomidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 cases male patients were randomly divided into four groups,and 60 female patients were also randomly divided into four groups.In each group, dexmedetomidine target plasma concentration are 0,0.4,0.6,0.8 ng/ml. Dexmedetomidine administered 15 min before target controlled infusion of propofol. The propofol infusion is started to provide a target effect-site concentration of 1.0 ug/ml, and increased by 0.2 ug/ml until loss of consciousness when the effect-site concentration and target concentration are equilibrium.</detailed_description>
