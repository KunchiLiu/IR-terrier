	<brief_summary>AV0328 is a novel vaccine candidate intended to raise antibodies to the glucosamine backbone of naturally occurring Poly N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG), a capsular polysaccharide expressed on the surface of a wide array of microbes. AV-101-16: A single and repeat dose, dose-escalation phase I/II study to evaluate the safety of intramuscularly administered AV0328. Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled at a single U.S. center, based on 4 subjects per dose group. The study will consist of 2 parts: Part 1 will be a single dose, dose escalation study; Part 2 will assess the effect of a second dose of AV0328.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AV0328 is a novel vaccine candidate intended to raise antibodies to the glucosamine backbone of naturally occurring Poly N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG), a capsular polysaccharide expressed on the surface of a wide array of microbes. AV-101-16: A single and repeat dose, dose-escalation phase I/II study to evaluate the safety of intramuscularly administered AV0328. Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled at a single U.S. center, based on 4 subjects per dose group. The study will consist of 2 parts: Part 1 will be a single dose, dose escalation study; Part 2 will assess the effect of a second dose of AV0328. Part 1 - Single Administration of AV0328: Following injection, subjects will be observed for 28 days to determine the safety and tolerability of a single administration of AV0328. Cohort 1 will receive 15 µg to be given as an IM injection on Day 1. Cohorts 2, 3 and 4 will receive 30, 75 and 150 µg, respectively. The first subject of each cohort must be observed for a minimum of 24 hours before the remaining subjects in that group can be treated. Dosage escalation will occur only after the final subject at each dose level has been observed for a minimum of 2 days and no dose limiting drug-related toxicity has occurred. Part 2 - Second Administration of AV0328: Following review of safety and tolerance for a minimum of 22 days of Part 1 by the Safety Review Committee (SRC), subjects from each dose level will return to receive an additional injection at the same dose level of AV0328 on Day 29. Additional safety and pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be collected through Week 52.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Healthy adult volunteer. 2. Age 1855 years, inclusive. 3. Normal hematological, hepatic, and renal function. 4. Subjects participating in the study are to use adequate birth control measures (abstinence, oral contraceptives, barrier method with spermicide or surgical sterilization) during study participation. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test on the days of dosing. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. 5. If subject is female and of childbearing potential, she has a negative serum pregnancy test during screening and baseline and must be willing to undergo urine pregnancy testing during the study. 6. Subject must sign written informed consent and be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements. 7. Subject must be accessible for repeat dosing and followup. 1. Major organ dysfunction. 2. Any significant preexisting condition preventing full compliance with the study. 3. Unstable chronic medical condition or disease requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease within 3 months before receipt of study vaccine. 4. Allergic to vaccine components of AV0328, including poly Nacetyl glucosamine (PNAG), tetanus toxoid (TT) or alum; any previous severe reaction to any TT vaccine including arthustype hypersensitivity reaction. 5. Vaccinations within one month prior to participation or 2 months after enrollment. 6. Women who are pregnant or lactating. 7. Abnormal skin or tattoo overlying the deltoid muscle in the immediate vicinity of the anticipated injection sites. 8. Donation of blood volume of 250 mL or greater or donation of plasma within 3 months prior to enrollment through conclusion of the study. 9. Bleeding condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that may contraindicate intramuscular (IM) injection or blood draw including subjects taking anticoagulant, antiplatelet and/or antithrombotic agents except for lowdose daily aspirin within 30 days before enrollment through completion Day 57. 10. Subjects currently on immunosuppressive or immunomodifying therapy or with a history of immunosuppressive or immunomodifying therapy (including systemic glucocorticoid therapy within 30 days of .AV0328 administration) . 11. Participation in other investigational or interventional studies within 30 days before the current study begins and/or during study participation. Participation in purely observational studies is acceptable. 12. Known active disease with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), or positive screening test for HIV, HBV and/or HCV. 13. A prior history of brachial neuritis, GuillanBarre syndrome or other serious neurologic illness. 14. Prior severe staphylococcal infection or bacteremia. 15. Any clinically significant abnormality in any screening or Baseline laboratory test or electrocardiogram (ECG). 16. Medical condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with the protocol or the subject's wellbeing or safety. In addition, any patient who has met all of the eligibility criteria and has been enrolled in the study who subsequently experiences an acute febrile illness, must be afebrile for at least two days before administration of the study drug.</criteria>
