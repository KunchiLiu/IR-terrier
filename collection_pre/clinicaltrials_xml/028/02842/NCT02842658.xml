	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supervised exercise-training program, initiated prior to chemotherapy induction (pre-conditioning) and continued throughout chemotherapy treatment, can preserve short- and long-term cardiovascular performance, skeletal muscle function, cognitive ability and quality of life better than current standard or care recommendations for exercise during chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a novel, high-intensity aerobic interval exercise preconditioning protocol to ameliorate anthracycline-mediated cardiac and skeletal muscle toxicity in women with breast cancer undergoing de novo chemotherapy. Research Design: Women with breast cancer scheduled to undergo de novo chemotherapy with anthracyclines will be enrolled. Qualified patients will be randomized to either 1) a high-intensity interval exercise group, or 2) an attention-control group. Supervised exercise training will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic Cardiac rehabilitation center in Arizona on cycle ergometers using Electrocardiogram (EKG) telemetry. Patients in the high-intensity interval exercise group will perform four, 4-min intervals at 85-90% peak heart rate (PHR), separated by 3 min at 50% PHR. Each training session will begin with a 10-minute warm-up at 50% of PHR and end with a 5-min cool down at 50% PHR. The attention-controls will receive counseling consistent with standard of care regarding physical activity during chemotherapy. Attention-control group will receive a weekly phone call to maintain physical activity during chemotherapy and compliance will be verified using physical activity diaries and pedometers. Treatment for each group will commence 1-week prior to chemotherapy induction. The first dose of chemotherapy will be given within 16-18 hours of the last bout of exercise. High-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) training will be continued throughout four, 2-week cycles of chemotherapy (total training time = 9 weeks, 3 days/week).</detailed_description>
