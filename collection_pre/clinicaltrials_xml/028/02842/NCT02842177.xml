	<brief_summary>The intrauterine devices are a safe, reliable, long-acting and reversible contraceptive method. It is also sound safe and cheap contraceptive methods available and is nearly maintenance free for up to 10 years. The fear and the pain associated with intrauterine devices insertion consider barriers to using this contraception method, this is because that the mucosal lining of female genital tract is highly sensitive to touch and pain. However; most of small procedures done in this sensitive area are performed without analgesia. The pain during intrauterine devices insertion is due to application of the tenaculum , traction of the cervical canal, passing the uterine sound, insertion of the intrauterine devices through the cervix, and irritation of the endometrial lining by the intrauterine devices . Previous studies have reported different lines to decrease pain during intrauterine device insertion starting by simple methods such as pre-insertion ibuprofen use, intracervical or intrauterine lidocaine and misoprostol up to paracervical blocks. Previous studies, in literature, have found that the most painful steps during intrauterine devices insertion were uterine sounding then intrauterine device insertion itself, followed by tenaculum placement. One recent study addressed pain effect using an atraumatic vulsellum and a single-tooth tenaculum on pain perception during intrauterine devices and found no difference in reported pain.</brief_summary>
