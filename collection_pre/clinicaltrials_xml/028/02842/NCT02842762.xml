	<brief_title>3D Echocardiographic Assessment of Epicardial Pacing After Cardiopulmonary Bypass.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgical patients sometimes require temporary pacing wires to optimize cardiac function during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and/or to treat hemodynamically significant brady-arrhythmias. The available patient series report that 8.6% to 23.9% of patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve surgery require temporary pacing at some time after CPB. The site of pacemaker wire placement seems to be a crucial determinant of cardiac output. In non-surgical patients isolated right ventricular (RV) pacing seems to induce electromechanical dyssynchrony of the RV and the left ventricle (LV). A normal ventricle in sinus rhythm displays a simultaneous contraction of all segments of the heart, so that regional minimal volume (i.e. maximal contraction) will occur at the same time. Isolated RV pacing seems to result in a left bundle branch type electrical activation sequence, with delayed contraction of some of the segments. The LV, but not the RV, seems to negatively affected by this state of dyssynchrony, resulting in decreased cardiac output. In surgical patients however, there is not such data available yet. Since isolated RV epicardial wire placement is still widely practiced in cardiac surgery, and in our own institution, we would like to study the effect of RV pacing on LV synchrony and LV output. Again from studies in non-surgical patients receiving resynchronization therapy, we know that real-time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is very useful to pick up subtle changes in LV synchrony and thereby guide synchronization of ventricular contraction. However, to date the usefulness of real-time 3D echocardiography to guide pacemaker therapy in cardiac surgery is unknown. In the present feasibility study in cardiac surgical patients, we want to investigate the acute effects of isolated RV pacing on LV synchrony, and LV output.</detailed_description>
