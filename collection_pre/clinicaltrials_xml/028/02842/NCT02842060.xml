	<brief_summary>This study uses an interactive design and development process to develop tailored messages that align YMSM's relationship experiences and desires with HIV prevention strategies. The study includes a tailored online prevention, intervention, as well as an attention control non--tailored HIV prevention (NTHP) comparison intervention. The pilot RCT will compare the intervention (N=120) to NTHP (N=60) to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, and gather preliminary behavioral data to inform a subsequent application. Follow-up assessments will be collected at thirty (30), sixty (60), and ninety (90) days post-intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of a Tailored HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A resurgence of new HIV cases among young men who have sex with men (YMSM; ages 18--24) has underscored the importance of developing culturally- and developmentally- informed HIV programs for YMSM. The investigators are developing and pilot testing a tailored, web- based intervention called myDEx that focuses on delivering HIV prevention messages based on single YMSM's relationship expectations and partner--seeking behaviors. To maximize intervention appeal and appropriateness, the investigators have convened a youth advisory board (YAB) to provide insight and feedback during the 3--stage intervention development process. Using an iterative design and development process, they have developed tailored messages that align YMSM's relationship experiences and desires with HIV prevention strategies. The investigators designed and developed the myDEx tailored online prevention intervention, as well as an attention- control non--tailored HIV/AIDS prevention (NTHP) comparison intervention. After developing both interventions, the investigators used usability testing procedures to collect preliminary data from 16 YMSM on the proposed intervention's design and acceptability. Recommended changes were added to the intervention prior to launching a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The pilot RCT will compare myDEx (N=120) to NTHP (N=60) to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, and gather preliminary behavioral data to inform a subsequent application. Assessments will be collected at 30, 60, and 90 days follow--up. Specific Aims include: 1. To develop a tailored (myDEx) and non-tailored (NTHP) HIV prevention intervention focused on addressing HIV risk behaviors among single YMSM; 2. To collect preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability, and intervention content of the myDEx (N=16) in preparation for a small pilot RCT; and, 3. To implement a small pilot RCT of the refined myDEx (N=120) as compared to the NTHP (N=60) intervention, in order to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability and gather preliminary efficacy results in reducing sexual risk behaviors.</detailed_description>
