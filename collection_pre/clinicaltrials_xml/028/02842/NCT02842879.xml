	<brief_summary>The aim was to conduct a non-blinded prospective randomized study at a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria: term pregnancy with a single fetus in cephalic presentation, Bishop score &lt; 6, gestational age &gt; 41 weeks or medical indication for induction of labor. Patients will be randomized to outpatient or inpatient cervix priming with Foley catheter. The primary outcome will be to compare the variation of Bishop score (difference between Bishop score before and after application of Foley catheter) between outpatient and inpatient groups. Secondary comparisons include: mode of delivery, Foley catheter application-to-delivery time, inpatient time, sequential use of prostaglandins, infection and maternal pain.</brief_summary>
