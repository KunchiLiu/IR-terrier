	<brief_summary>No studies have investigated the effects of a supine thoracic spine manipulation (TSM) on neurodynamic mobility, as compared to a sham intervention. This study aims to determine the immediate effects of TSM on the Upper Limb Provocation Test (ULPT) and Seated Slump Test (SST) compared to a sham intervention in asymptomatic subjects with neurodynamic limitations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Thoracic Spine Manipulation on Peripheral Neurodynamic Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A convenience sample will be utilized to obtain subjects. Subjects will be given a brief questionnaire to identify possible contraindications for spinal treatment techniques and exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups (spinal manual therapy or spinal range of motion which will serve as the name for the placebo group) and participate in neurodynamic testing procedures of the upper extremity (Upper Limb Provocation Testing) as well as lower extremity (Seated Slump Test). Subjects who are determined to be positive for one or more limbs will receive either a thoracic spine manipulation technique (spinal manual therapy) or a thoracic spine sham manipulation technique (spinal range of motion/placebo). After application of the technique, previously positive limbs will be retested. In attempt to determine validity and believability of the sham procedure and perception of its effect, subjects will be asked if they believe their upper/lower quarter mobility will change based on the group name and after the technique is applied. Subjects will also be asked if they believed they were in the treatment or placebo group.</detailed_description>
