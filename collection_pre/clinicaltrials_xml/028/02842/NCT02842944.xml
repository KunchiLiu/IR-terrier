	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare mechanical ventilation following advice from the Beacon Caresystem to that of routine care in patients from the state of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation until successful extubation. The Beacon Caresystem will be compared to routine care to investigate whether use of the system results in similar care and reduced time for weaning from mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patient is on invasive mechanical ventilation more 48 hours Age &gt; 18 years Patients are ventilated using Maquet ServoI, Draeger Infinity V500 or Draeger Evita XL mechanical ventilators in "pressure support", "volume controlled", or "pressure controlled" ventilation modes. Haemodynamically stable (mean blood pressure ≥ 65 mmHg) Patients or, in the case that the patient is unable, next of kin understand and accept oral and written information describing the study or patient consent retrospectively in case of emergency inclusion. The absence of an arterial catheter for blood sampling. Medical history of home mechanical ventilation Severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg) Head trauma or other conditions where intracranial pressure may be elevated and tight regulation of arterial CO2 level is paramount. Severe neurological patients (Glasgow coma score &lt;10, neurologic damage with limited prognosis, stroke hemiplegia). Known or suspected severe myopathy or neuropathy (including ICU neuromyopathy) Quadriplegia Severe heart failure Broncho alveolar fistula with more than 100ml leakage History of home mechanical ventilation Pregnancy.</criteria>
