	<brief_summary>Cervical myelopathy is common among aging population.One of the complication of cervical myelopathy is balance impairment.In this study, the patients with cervical myelopathy undergo biomechanical, imaging and functional assessment. The dynamic balance training is introduced to the patients with cervical decompression surgery.This study is expected to provide important empirical evidence to guide postoperative rehabilitation of myelopathy patients and improve patients' long term quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation and Rehabilitation System for Dynamic Balance Control in Cervical Myelopathy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taiwan is quickly becoming a nation of aging population with myelopathy reporting to be one of the most common spinal cord disorders associated with spinal degeneration. Given the high prevalence rate of the condition, current project aims to investigate the impact of myelopathy on motor control from a biomechanical perspective with the overall aim to develop a interactive balance perturbation rehabilitation program targeting individual patients and identified deficiency. The efficacy of the individual rehabilitation program will be assessed and determined utilizing a prospective longitudinal study design. A break down of the proposed three year project are as follows: Year 1: Myelopathy patients undergoing cervical decompression surgery as well as age-matched asymptomatic controls will be recruited and subjected to the following clinical evaluations: 3-dimensional biomechanical motion analysis, diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging, pain and disability questionnaires, motor performance assessment, spinal curvature as well as muscle strength assessment. Motor control and coordination during functional movements will be evaluated. Year 2: Continue to recruit potential participants and further develop the use of the interactive split-belt balance perturbation treadmill as modalities for gait and balance therapy. Year 3: Physical Therapy rehabilitation programs at 3 month post surgery, one group will participate in a specific and personalized interactive balance perturbation training program targeting balance and gait retraining, while the other group receive the routine Physical Therapy program. Both treatment groups will be assessed pre-operatively, at 3, 6 and 12 month post-operatively. Patients will be classified based on their severity and grade of the spinal cord compression before being compared for any difference in treatment responses. Year 4: Follow-up monitoring and documenting the number of falls experienced by patients at one year postoperatively as an outcome of effectiveness. Expected outcome and significance The findings from the current project will provide important empirical evidence to guide postoperative rehabilitation of myelopathy patients. Through detailed biomechanical motion analysis, it is anticipated that this project will provide an in-depth understanding of the influence of decompression surgery on motor control and spinal stability. The tailored and innovative rehabilitation program will also improve patients' long term quality of life.</detailed_description>
