	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 open label study of the dose and duration of an orally administered LSD1 inhibitor, IMG-7289, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Some participants may also receive all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin and VesanoidÂ®) in combination with IMG-7289. This study investigates the following: - The safety and tolerability of IMG-7289, with and without ATRA - The pharmacodynamic effect of different IMG-7289 doses and treatment durations, as well as IMG-7289 administered in combination with ATRA - The pharmacokinetics of IMG-2789, with and without ATRA</brief_summary>
