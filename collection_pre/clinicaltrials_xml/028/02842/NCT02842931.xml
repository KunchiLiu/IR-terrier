	<brief_summary>Purpose: to evaluate an efficacy of chemotherapy regimens R-DA-EPOCH-21 and R-mNHL-BFM-90 with and without autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (auto-SCT) in newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL with intermediate and high risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-Dose-adjusted (DA) - EPOCH-21 Versus R-modified Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-90 Program (mNHL-BFM-90) and Autologous Stem Cells Transplantation (Auto-SCT) in DLBCL With Poor Prognosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients initially are randomized into 4 arms: 1. st arm R-DA-EPOCH-21 2. nd arm R-mNHL-BFM-90 3. rd arm R-DA-EPOCH-21 + auto-SCT 4. th arm of R-mNHL-BFM-90 + auto-SCT Patients who achieved complete remission after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or R-mNHL-BFM-90 immunochemotherapy continue to be under observation (1st and 2nd arms) or continue treatment with Rituximab + BCNU+Etoposid+Ara-C+Melphalan (R-BEAM) followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th arms). Patients who achieved partial remission after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or R-mNHL-BFM-90 immunochemotherapy continue treatment with 2 cycles of Rituximab+Dexamethasone+Ara-C+Cisplatin (R-DHAP), continue to be under observation (1st and 2nd arms) or continue treatment with R-BEAM, followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th arms).</detailed_description>

Lifethreatening bleeding (gastrointestinal, intracranial), with exception of bleeding due to tumor infiltration of organs (stomach, intestines, uterus, etc.) and disseminated intravascular coagulation due to underlying disease complications after their successful conservative treatment. 14.
