	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II as a bone filler containing the patient's own (autologous) adipose (fat) tissue-derived cells in reconstructing bone in two clinical indications: 1. Bone augmentation (e.g. sinus augmentation) 2. Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Filling Bone Defects/Voids With Autologous BonoFill-II for Maxillofacial Bone Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint: The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible defect/void is safe under the following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no significant changes in complete blood count (CBC) and in general health. Secondary endpoint: The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible void is efficient under the following conditions: Following BonoFill-II implantation, the bone regeneration in the operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids were filled with a significant amount of bone tissue.</detailed_description>
