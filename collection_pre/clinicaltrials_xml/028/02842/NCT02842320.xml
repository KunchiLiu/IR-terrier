	<brief_summary>The tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (iTKs) is the first-line treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Its effectiveness in controlling the progression of the disease is such that it is possible today to consider stopping treatment in patients with deep molecular response (&gt; RM4.0). Only in about 50% of cases, patients relapse. It has been shown in these patients that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are persistant, quiescent and insensitive to iTKs. These cells are probably at the origin of relapse. It is therefore necessary to develop complementary therapies to cure the disease and consider discontinuation iTKs The development of anti-tumor immunotherapy approach using genetically modified T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and specifically targeting CML CSH + could address this issue. The membrane expression of the IL-1-RAP protein could be an interesting target.</brief_summary>
