	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if selected sequence training using the Balance Master, added to established physical therapy treatment programs, will increase gait velocity of ambulatory children receiving inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation in relation to their ability to cross an intersection within the confines of community traffic signal (&gt;120 cm/sec).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Independent Walking Speed and Crossing a City Street</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability to adequately perform functional tasks at a level that allows independent community living is key to measuring the success of any physical therapy program. The essential tasks needed to allow independent community living have been well documented in the elderly population. However, these tasks have not been delineated in the pediatric population. The investigators aim to determine if selected sequence training using the Balance Master, added to established physical therapy treatment programs, will increase gait velocity of ambulatory children receiving in-or outpatient rehabilitation in relation to their ability to cross an intersection within the confines of community traffic signal (&gt;120 cm/sec). One essential task that is necessary in the urban environment is to have the ability to cross a street within the time constraint of a traffic signal. Walking speed becomes increasingly important for those living in urban settings, as the ability to cross the street safely is fundamental for achieving independence. One of the major criticisms of clinic/lab-based measures of gait speed is that relative performance may not be representative of independence within the community. Participants aged 5 to 21 years, will be recruited from the patient population at Blythedale Children's Hospital for a six week trial. Children will be assigned to one of two random groups: one weekly Balance Master sequence training group (in addition to their regularly scheduled therapy sessions) and a group that continue regularly scheduled therapy sessions alone. Gait velocity will be measured by "Walk Across" Functional Assessment using Balance Master long force plate.</detailed_description>
