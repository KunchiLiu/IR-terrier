	<brief_summary>Current endodontic treatment are based essentially on the ouster of parenchyma in case of trauma or irreversible pulp inflammation. These situations typically affect immature teeth in subjects aged from 8 to 15 years. Consequently, loss of a functional pulp is leads to discontinuation of root development and apical closure. The challenge for the clinician in the management of such situations is then preserving a pulp vitality. But current practices consist in a filling of the endo-canal system with an inert or semi-inert material. In this case, no pulp vitality is present. New treatment methods are needed. The objective Pulp'R is the study the feasibility of preparing an autologous combined advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) for dental pulp regeneration in the patient with irreversible pulp inflammation or dental trauma.</brief_summary>
