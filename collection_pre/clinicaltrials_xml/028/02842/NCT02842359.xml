	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of irbesartan/atorvastatin fixed-dose combination comparing to each irbesartan and atorvastatin on flow mediated dilation change in type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension. Secondary Objective: To evaluate efficacy of blood pressure and hyperlipidemic factors of irbesartan/atorvastatin fixed-dose combination in type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and hypertension, with adequately controlled blood glucose levels in groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients aged ≥19 years to &lt;75 years. Patients without medication history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension within 3 months following registration, among type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure: ≥140mmHg, ≤159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure: ≥90 mmHg, ≤99mmHg), with adequately controlled hemoglobin levels. Patients who signed a written consent to data utilization. Diagnosis of diabetes: HemoglobinA1c ≥6.5% or; Fasting plasma glucose level above 8 hour ≥126 mg/dL or; Plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/l) 2 hours after a 75g glucose load or; Symptoms (such as polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss) and a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Exclusion criteria: Patients indicated as contraindication in the approved labeling of Rovelito. Pregnant/nursing women. Patients with difference in blood pressure systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥10mmHg in the arm selected during screening at Visit 1. Patients who were administered Angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or HMGCoA reductase inhibitors in 2 months. Patients who had taken antidiabetics in the past. Patients who have to or may take any drug suggested in the prohibited concomitant medications during the study period. Patients with tolerance or hypersensitivity to angiotensin II receptor blocker or HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, or an ingredient of this drug, or with history of multidrug allergy. Patients with genetic angioedema, or medical history of angioedema when treating with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist Patients who have suffered from fibromyalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or sudden arthralgia, or adverse events while taking statins in the past. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) &gt;5 times of the upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients diagnosed with secondary hypertension or suspected of secondary hypertension by the Investigator (coarctation of aorta, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, renal hypertension, pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome, etc.). Patients with poorly controlled hypothyroidism despite treatment Type 1 diabetic patients or poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients (HemoglobinA1c ≥7.5%) Patients with arrhythmia requiring separate treatment. Patients with the following past history: Severe cerebrovascular disease (cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, etc.), hypertensive encephalopathy, transient ischemic attack (TIA), which occurred in the recent 6 months. Severe heart disease (NYHA class IIIIV heart failure), clinically significant valvular disease of the heart, myocardial infarction and unstable angina in the recent 6 months. Angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. If patients have clinically significant renal or hepatic diseases , or significant hematologic test findings at screening (serum creatinine ≥ 2mg/dL, AST or ALT [aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase] ≥3 times of the ULN). Patients suspected of pancreatitis or active gall bladder disease by the Investigator. Surgical or internal disease likely to significantly change absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drug, which falls under one of the followings (but not limited to): Major gastrointestinal surgical history such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy or bowel resection, gastric bypass, gastrointestinal stapling, or gastrointestinal banding, medical history of active inflammatory bowel syndrome at present or in the past 12 months, current active gastritis, ulcer, gastrointestinal/rectal hemorrhage, or urinary tract obstruction that is deemed clinically significant by the Investigator. Patients with volume depletion, as clinically judged by the Investigator, using vital signs, skin turgor pressure, mucous membrane wettability, and laboratory values. All chronic inflammatory patients requiring chronic inflammatory treatment. Patients with past history of autoimmune disease, such as chronic rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc. Patients with past clinical history of alcohol or drug abuse. Patients with history of malignant tumors including leukemia and lymphoma in the past 5 years. Patients who have been administered another investigational product within 30 days prior to participation in this clinical study (from the time when they signed the informed consent form). Patients who may not be measured for flow mediated dilatation in Investigator's judgment for a congenital or secondary reason in the bilateral brachial artery. Patients who are deemed ineligible as subject in Investigator's judgment for other reasons. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
