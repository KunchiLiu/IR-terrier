	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multi-center trial conducted at 1 Guangzhou and 2 Beijing centers designed to determine the diagnostic performance of virtual hepatic venous pressure gradient (vHVPG) (investigational technology) by anatomic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for non-invasive assessment of the clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Direct hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement by means of catheterization of a hepatic vein with a balloon catheter is the gold-standard method to assess the presence of CSPH, which is defined as HVPG≥10 mmHg.</brief_summary>
