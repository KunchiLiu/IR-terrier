	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of immunogenicity and evaluate the safety of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to a single dose of Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 in adults 56 years of age and older in the US. Primary objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to those observed following the administration of a single dose of Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135. Secondary objective: - To compare the hSBA antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to those observed following the administration of Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 Observational objectives: - To describe antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured by hSBA at baseline (before vaccination) and 30 days after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135. - To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugated vaccine compared to that of the licensed Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 after a single administration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 on Day 0 (Visit 1). They will undergo immunogenicity assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 30 to 44 days post-vaccination and will also be evaluated for safety up to Day 180 post-vaccination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 56 years on the day of inclusion Informed consent form has been signed and dated Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to vaccination until at least 4 weeks after vaccination) Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine prior to Visit 2 except for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before or after study vaccine. This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine (i.e., mono or polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, Y, or W; or meningococcal B vaccine) Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, subjects with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or subjects travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease) Known systemic hypersensitivity to latex or any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Personal history of GuillainBarré syndrome Personal history of an Arthuslike reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccine within at least 10 years of the proposed study vaccination Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination, in the Investigator's opinion Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
