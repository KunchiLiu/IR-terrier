	<brief_summary>Cardio-metabolic diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Over the years, therefore, there have been considerable efforts to identify strategies for prevention and management of risk factors. The diet, with its pleiotropic effects, is one of the most effective approaches to reduce the cardio-metabolic risk. In this context, the dietary fibers have been extensively studied and the available evidence supports the beneficial effects of its consumption.
