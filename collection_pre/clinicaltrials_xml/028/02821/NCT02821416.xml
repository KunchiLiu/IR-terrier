	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of Benralizumab on Allergen-Induced Inflammation in Mild, Atopic Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the effect of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 3 doses on allergen-induced inflammation in subjects with mild atopic asthma challenged with an inhaled allergen. Approximately 38 non-smoking men and women (18 - 65 years of age) corticosteroid-free (oral and inhaled) mild, atopic asthmatics who have demonstrated a dual (early and late) asthmatic response to inhaled allergen challenge at screening will be recruited to complete the study.</detailed_description>
