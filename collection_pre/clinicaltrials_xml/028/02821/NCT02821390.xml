	<brief_title>Effect of Topical Nepafenac 0.1% on Pain Related to Intravitreal Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreal injection (IVI) is a preferred route of administration of drugs in the posterior segment of the eye. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGFs constitutes the mainstay for the treatment of various retinal diseases such as AMD, RVO, DME etc. The procedure of the IVI is, however, associated with a level of discomfort for the patient. Ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) constitute an established and effective treatment option for the management of inflammation and pain associated with cataract surgery and of pain associated with corneal refractive surgery, for inhibition of intraoperative miosis and for the treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. The primary goal of this study is to assess the analgesic effect of Nepafenac 0.1% Eye Drops a topical NSAID on pain related to intravitreal injections immediately after and up to six hours post-IVI. A number of patients scheduled to undergo IVIs will be divided in two groups. All patients must have already undergone at least one IVI. In patients receiving IVIs in both eyes only one eye will be included in the study. The patients of the first group will be randomized to receive Nepafenac 0.1% Eye Drops in the first appointment and then crossover to receive the placebo (Artificial Tears) in their next appointment for an IVI. The patients of the second will be randomized to receive the placebo (Artificial Tears) in the first appointment and then crossover to receive Nepafenac 0.1% Eye Drops in their next appointment for an IVI. All drugs will be administered prior to the injection by a member of the Department's personnel (a staff nurse). Patients will be required to complete the greek version of the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) comprising of the Visual Analogue Scale, the main component of the SF-MPQ and the Present Pain Intensity Scale immediately after the injection and 6 hours post-IVI.</detailed_description>
