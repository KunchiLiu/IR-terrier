	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability following single oral administration of ascending doses of odalasvir (ODV) in healthy Japanese participants (Panel 1) and to investigate the PK, safety and tolerability following single oral administration of ascending doses of AL-335 in healthy Japanese participants (Panel 2; Sequential Design).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Participant must be a Japanese participant who has resided outside Japan for no more than 5 years and whose parents and grandparents are Japanese as determined by participant's verbal report Participant must have a body mass index (BMI: weight in kilogram [kg] divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), extremes included and a body weight not less than 50.0 kilogram (kg) Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the Investigator Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted Female participant must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of assisted reproduction during the study and for a period of 60 days (Panel 1) or 30 days (Panel 2) after study drug administration or until the last followup visit, whichever occurs later Participant has a history of liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 80 milliliters per minute [mL/min]); significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic or metabolic disturbances Participant has any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (for example, compromise the wellbeing) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocolspecified assessments Participant with a past history of heart arrhythmias (for example, extra systolic beats or tachycardia at rest); risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as hypokalemia or family history of short/long QT syndrome or sudden unexplained death (including sudden infant death syndrome) in a firstdegree relative [for example, sibling, offspring, or biological parent]) Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to odalasvir (ODV) or AL335 or its excipients</criteria>
