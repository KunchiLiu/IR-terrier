	<brief_summary>Respiratory weaning failure worsens prognostic of patients following on-pump cardiac surgery. There are increasing evidences that pulmonary, diaphragmatic or cardiologic echographies are useful in order to improve this critical medical status. Based both on a previous study conducted in the critical care unit of Purpan and on literature we hypothesize that a combined thoracic echography score could be of interest. We make the hypothesis that the use of a score based on thoracic combined echography (ETC = cardiac, pulmonary and diaphragmatic) allows to predict the failure of respiratory weaning in cardiac surgery and allows to improve the characterization of the causes of this failure</brief_summary>
