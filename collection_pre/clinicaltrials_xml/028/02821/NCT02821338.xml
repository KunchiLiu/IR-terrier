	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine bioequivalence between two different formulations of lamotrigine extended release tablets (one reference product and one generic product) in a healthy adult population, following a single oral dose under fed conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Bioavailability Crossover Study of Two Formulations of Lamotrigine Extended Release Tablets in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, randomized, open-label, single dose, two treatment, four-period, two-sequence, fully replicated crossover design in the fed state. The study will include two treatments: - Treatment-A: One dose of Lamotrigine extended-release tablet (Test) administered in the morning after a 10-hour overnight fast and 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. - Treatment-B: One dose of Lamictal XR extended-release tablet (Reference) administered in the morning after a 10 hour overnight fast and 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. A total of 30 healthy subjects will be dosed to ensure that at least 24 subjects will complete the 4-period replicate design. For each treatment period, subjects will be confined from the day prior to dosing until approximately 48 hours post-dose. Subjects will return to the clinical site for the remaining blood samples. There will be a minimum 14-day washout between doses. Subject participation from the Screening Visit to the Follow-Up Visit will be approximately 71 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy male or female subjects ≥18 to ≤50 years of age 2. Subject is willing and able to provide informed consent 3. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 18.00 kg/m2 and below 30.00 kg/m2 at screening 4. Body weight greater than or equal to 49 kg at screening 5. Subject is a nonsmoker and has not used any nicotine containing products within 6 months prior to screening 6. Subjects who are considered generally healthy upon completion of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, screening laboratory results and screening ECG in the opinion of the Investigator 7. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with the visit schedule, laboratory tests, pharmacokinetic sampling schedule and other study procedures 8. Subjects who are willing and able to maintain their eligibility throughout the study. 9. A female study subject must meet one of the following criteria: If of childbearing potential agrees to use one of the accepted contraceptive regimens from at least 30 days prior to the first administration of the study medication, during the study, and for at least 30 days after the last dose of the study medication. An acceptable method of contraception includes one of the following: Abstinence from heterosexual intercourse Progestogencontaining hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, injectable/implant/insertable hormonal birth control products, transdermal patch) Intrauterine device (without hormones) Condom with spermicide If a female of nonchildbearing potential should be surgically sterile (i.e. has undergone complete hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or in a menopausal state (at least 1 year without menses), as confirmed by FSH levels (post menopausal must be confirmed by the subject having a serum follicle stimulating hormone greater than 40mIU/ml at screening). Females of nonchildbearing potential must present a proof of partial or total hysterectomy; if such proof is not available, the female will be considered to be of childbearing potential. 10. A male study subject must agree to use one of the accepted contraceptive regimens during the study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study medication; Abstinence from heterosexual intercourse Female partner with hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, injectable/implant/insertable hormonal birth control products, transdermal patch) Female partner with intrauterine device (with or without hormones) Female partner with condom with spermicide used by male study subject Female partner of nonchildbearing potential Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post vasectomy ejaculate 11. A male study subject must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study medication 1. Females who are pregnant or are breastfeeding 2. Females who are using any estrogencontaining hormonal contraceptives 3. History of known clinically significant drug allergies or reactions to lamotrigine, or any related products (including excipients of the formulations) as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to any drugs in the opinion of the Investigator 4. Clinically significant history or evidence of gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, hematologic, dermatologic, immunologic disease or any other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or distribution of drugs that in the opinion of the Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact validity of study results 5. Presence of observed abnormality (evidenced from physical examination, ECG, vital signs, or laboratory evaluation) that would be clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator 6. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks per week for females and 14 drinks per week for males within 6 months of screening 7. Has current or recent history (within the past year) of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence 8. Any clinically significant illness in the previous 30 days prior to screening 9. Use of any enzymemodifying drugs, including strong inhibitors of CYP enzymes (such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, quinidine, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, diltiazem, and HIV antivirals) and strong inducers of CYP enzymes (such as barbiturates, carbamazepine, glucocorticoids, phenytoin, rifampin, St John`s Wort) in the previous 30 days prior to screening 10. Known presence of rare hereditary problems of galactose and /or lactose intolerance or glucosegalactose malabsorption 11. Unusual dietary habits (e.g., vegan, Atkins), dietary restrictions, and/or food allergies. 12. Any planned surgery from the screening visit until the end of the study 13. Positive urine screen for alcohol, cotinine and/or drugs of abuse at screening and at each admission of each treatment period 14. Positive test results for HIV1/HIV2 Antibodies, Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C Antibody (HCVAb) 15. Albumin values less than 4 g/dL at screening 16. Triglyceride values greater than 200 mg/dL at screening 17. Treatment with any investigational drug 30 days prior to screening 18. Participation in other clinical studies within 30 days prior to screening 19. Blood donation (excluding plasma donation) of approximately 500 mL within 56 days prior to screening 20. Subject is unlikely to comply with the study protocol or, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not be a suitable candidate for participation in the trial</criteria>
