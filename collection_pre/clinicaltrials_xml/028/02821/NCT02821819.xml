	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective single-center study is to evaluate the laboratory outcome after random start ovarian stimulation in oocytes donors. The study will be performed in egg-donors but this type of treatment has the potential to be implemented in general infertility population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Random-start Ovarian Stimulation in Egg-donors (ROSE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study group will start ovarian stimulation randomly in different moments throughout the menstrual cycle. Randomization will take place on day 2-3 of the menstrual cycle, according to a list of random allocation of treatments and egg-donors will be assigned to random start ovarian stimulation: During follicular phase starting at day 5,7,9,11 or 13 of the menstrual cycle and during luteal phase starting at LH peak +3,+5,+7,+9 or +11. Egg-donors will receive urinary FSH 150-225 IU/d in antagonist protocol cetrorelix acetate 0,25 mg/d starting five days after ovarian stimulation + GnRH agonist triggering with triptorelin 0,2 mg for final follicular maturation. Foliculometry by transvaginal ultrasound and serum analysis (estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH) will be included for cycle monitoring.</detailed_description>
