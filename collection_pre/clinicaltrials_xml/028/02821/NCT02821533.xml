	<brief_summary>The aim of the current study is to study the safety and effectiveness of TACE using a high dose of cisplatin for treatment of HCC. It is hypothesized that the formulation is safe and it improves the therapeutic effect of conventional TACE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an intermediate and advanced stage when the tumors become unresectable, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has been widely accepted as a standard treatment for them in most international management protocols. The therapeutic effect of TACE in terms of objective tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%), indicating that there is actually much room for improvement in the treatment. Internationally, high doses and combination of chemotherapeutic agents are being routinely and widely used for TACE in major medical centers. Locally, a low dose of cisplatin (10mg) has been used as the chemotherapeutic agent for TACE in Hong Kong. There is evidence showing that the component of chemotherapeutic agent in TACE does play a significant role in the treatment effect of TACE. In an attempt to improve the treatment effect of TACE, the investigators propose a formulation of TACE using a high dose of cisplatin as chemotherapeutic agent.</detailed_description>
