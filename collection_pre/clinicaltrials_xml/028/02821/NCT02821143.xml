	<brief_title>The Impact of Telemedicine to Support Palliative Care Resident in Nursing Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to current statistics, approximately 12 % of all deaths in France occur in Nursing Home, with the number over 25% in USA. With the ageing of the population, this rate is expected to dramatically increase in the next years, to reach 40% in USA in 2020. Yet, there is some evidence that palliative care is often inadequate in Nursing Home: there is a difficulty to recognize residents who might benefit palliative care and their needs, an underassessment and under-treatment of pain and other end-of-life symptoms, and frequent burdensome treatments and hospitalizations. Several programs including palliative care consult service (with outside consultant), Nursing Home-based palliative care or Nursing Home-hospice partnerships, have succeeded in delivering high-quality palliative care in Nursing Home. But, to our knowledge, no studies examined the benefit of telemedicine for palliative care in nursing home. During a 6 month-inclusion period, residents with palliative care needs will be included in both arms. In the intervention group, Telemedicine consultations involving Nursing Home staff and the palliative and/or geriatric unit from the University Hospital, will be organized systematically at inclusion and during the follow-up if needed. In both groups, hospitalizations and emergency hospitalizations, quality of life of the resident, satisfaction of the nursing home staff and health costs will be recorded during 6 months.</detailed_description>
