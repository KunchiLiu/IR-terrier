	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: - Various tumor ablative procedures and techniques have been shown to result in immunogenic cell death and induction of a peripheral immune response. The term ablative therapies applies to trans-arterial catheter chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (CA). - The underlying hypothesis of this study is that the effect of immune checkpoint inhibition can be enhanced by TACE, CA and RFA in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract carcinomas (BTC). We have already demonstrated proof of principle as well as safety and feasibility of this approach with anti-CTLA4 therapy. - Based on the concept of PDL1-mediated adaptive resistance and the emerging role of PD1 therapy in HCC, we would like to evaluate the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab (with ablative therapies) in HCC and BTC. Objectives: - To preliminarily evaluate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) of combining tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with advanced HCC (either alone or with cryoablation, TACE or RFA) and in patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) (either alone or with cryoablation or RFA). ELIGIBILITY: - Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC or biliary tract carcinoma OR histopathological confirmation of carcinoma in the setting of clinical and radiological characteristics which, together with the pathology, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of HCC (or biliary tract carcinoma). - Childs-Pugh A/B7 cirrhosis only is allowed. If patient does not have cirrhosis, this limitation does not apply. - Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection, radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation. DESIGN: We will evaluate the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab (with ablative therapies) in cohorts A (HCC; N=40) and B (BTC; N=30). The first N=10 patients in both cohorts will receive tremelimumab and durvalumab only (i.e. No interventional radiologic procedures). - A: Advanced HCC, BCLC# Stage B/C - N= 1st 10 pts: No ablative procedure Cryoablation/RFA/TACE## - Tremelimumab 75mg flat dose q28 days for 4 doses; Durvalumab 1500mg flat dose q28 days until EOS### - 40 total: 10 trem+ dur alone; 10 trem+ dur + TACE; 10 trem + dur + RFA; 10 trem + dur + cryo - B: Intra/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma - N= 1st 10 pts: No ablative procedure; RFA/ cryoablation - Tremelimumab 75mg flat dose q28 days for 4 doses; Durvalumab 1500mg flat dose q28 days until EOS### - 30 total: 10 trem+ dur alone; 10 trem + dur + RFA; 10 trem - BCLC = Barcelona clinic liver cancer staging system - For BCLC stage B patients TACE may be repeated as per standard of care - EOS = End of study treatment or meeting any of the off-treatment or off study criteria.</brief_summary>

Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery. Toxicity should be less than or equal to grade 1 or returned to baseline. 9. Patients must not have other invasive malignancies within the past 5 years (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancers, noninvasive bladder cancer or localized prostate cancer for whom systemic therapy is not required). 10. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document. 11. Evidence of postmenopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female premenopausal patients. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following agespecific requirements apply: Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). Women greater than or equal to 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiationinduced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had chemotherapyinduced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. 12. Body weight &gt;30kg (for durvalumab + tremelimumab). EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patients who have had standard of care chemotherapy, large field radiotherapy, or major surgery must wait 2 weeks prior to entering the study. For recent experimental therapies a 28 day period of time must elapse before treatment. 2. Patients who have undergone prior liver transplantation are ineligible. 3. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. 4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia (excluding insignificant sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia) or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 5. History of chronic autoimmune disease (e.g., Addison s disease, multiple sclerosis, Graves disease, Hashimoto s thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, etc.) with symptomatic disease within the 3 years before randomization. Note: Active vitiligo or a history of vitiligo will not be a basis for exclusion. 6. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of Information and Consent and compliance with the requirements of the protocol. 7. Diverticulitis either active or history of within the past 2 years. Note that diverticulosis is permitted. 8. Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (colitis, Crohn s), irritable bowel disease, celiac disease, or other serious, chronic, gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea. Active or history of systemic lupus erythematosus or Wegener s granulomatosis. Currently receiving immunosuppressive doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive medications (inhaled and topical steroids are permitted) 9. History of sarcoidosis syndrome 10. Patients should not be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days of starting durvalumab or tremelimumab treatment. 11. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIVpositive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded from this study due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions between antiretroviral medications and tremelimumab. HIV positive patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that tremelimumab may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events. 12. History of hypersensitivity reaction to human or mouse antibody products. 13. Pregnancy and breast feeding are exclusion factors. The effects of tremelimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. Enrolled patients must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, the duration of study participation and 6 months after the end of the treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 14.
