	<brief_summary>Working Hypothesis: The blue-light blocking lens has no effect on the contrast sensitivity, accommodative response, color vision, and subjective grading of the quality of life and vision. Purpose: To determine and compare the visual performances after wearing the blue-light blocking lenses in participants with and without presbyopia. Methods: One hundred and sixty computer users (computer usage &gt;2 hours/day) with (n=120, aged &gt;40years) and without presbyopia (n=40, aged 18-35 years) will be recruited. Three pairs of ophthalmic lenses will be prescribed for the participants, in which one pair of them will be the blue-light blocking lenses (StressFree, Swisscoat, HK). The lenses will be used for intermediate vision (i.e., computer usage) in presbyopic group, and for distant vision in non-presbyopic group. The adaptation period for each pair of lenses will be 1 month. The pre- and post-treatment contrast sensitivity, accommodative response and color vision will be measured. The participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires about their quality of life and vision, and the performances of these ophthalmic lenses. Significance: The blue-light blocking lens reflects the short-wavelength lights and protects the retina from "blue-light hazards"; however, blue lights are essential for various visual function and circadian rhythms. This study will evaluate the impact of the blue-light blocking lenses on visual function and quality of life, and determine whether the blue-light blocking lenses are good choices for extra ocular protection.</brief_summary>
