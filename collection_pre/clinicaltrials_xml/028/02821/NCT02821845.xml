	<brief_summary>This project will characterize lower extremity eccentric muscle function among individuals who have undergone locomotor training after spinal cord injury and will evaluate the effect of downhill training at slow speeds - targeted to rehabilitation eccentric function of the hip.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training of Eccentric Hip Function After SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower extremity eccentric motor control is is critically important for locomotor function but is impaired after spinal cord injury (SCI). Even after treadmill training, preliminary evidence indicates that eccentric deficits persist among individuals with SCI. This proposal aims to characterize eccentric motor control of the muscles about the hip during locomotion and evaluate the efficacy of downhill gait training at slow speeds as an intervention to improve eccentric function of the hip joint during walking.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals with SCI: medically approved discharged from outpatient rehabilitation for 6 months incomplete SCI based on ASIA impairment score (AIS C or D) at neurologic level C1T10 ability to take some steps overground and on the treadmill 1890 years old. ability to speak English. Note: the quality of life measures have not been validated yet in nonEnglish speaking populations. evidence of lower motor neuron injury in the legs use of botox in the past 3 months preexisting or confounding neurologic conditions (i.e. brain injury, stroke, HIV) acute deep vein thrombosis skin wounds in regions where harness or hands provide support pregnancy. Note: Persons who are pregnant will not be enrolled as exercise tolerance is unknown in these women with SCI. cognitive conditions that preclude providing informed consent ventilatordependence as study results will be confounded by mobility limitations imposed by equipment persistent orthostatic hypotension (drop of BP &gt;30mmHg in treadmill and harness equipment) hospitalization for myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or congestive heart failure exacerbation within 3 months of enrollment in study participation in any other concurrent exercise programs. Note: Use of antispasticity and other medications (dose, frequency) will be monitored throughout training and used as a confounding variable in the analyses.</criteria>
