	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that combining anti-PD1 treatment with radiotherapy might result in improved clinical response rates and PFS compared to anti-PD1 treatment in monotherapy. The current phase II trial aims at exploring the suggested benefits of the combination and aims to improve local and distant tumour responses by exploiting the pro-immunogenic effects of radiotherapy in addition to anti-PD1 treatment.</brief_summary>
