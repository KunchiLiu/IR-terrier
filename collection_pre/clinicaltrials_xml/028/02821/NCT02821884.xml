	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown not only to improve motor function but also increase cortical excitability and neural plasticity. Several studies demonstrated that the combination of tDCS and different treatments are more effective than a single tDCS alone. However, the effects of combination tDCS and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on upper extremity motor recovery in patients with stroke have not yet been investigated. Taking into consideration the safety and feasibility of new medical technology, recruitment of healthy subjects as a pilot study. And then recruit the stroke patients to investigate the effects for the combination of tDCS and NMES on upper extremity motor recovery in stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combine Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation on Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is non-invasive electrical stimulation, and some studies have proved efficacy of the tDCS and NMES on healthy subjects and stroke patients. However, the effects of combination tDCS and NMES on upper extremity motor recovery and neural plasticity in healthy subjects and patients with stroke have not yet been investigated. Moreover in order to discover the tDCS combine NMES of the safety and feasibility and influences on neural plasticity and motor function, the cortical excitability and functional recovery measurements (clinical scales) are taken in the healthy subjects and stroke. The right-handed subjects will be received the combination of tDCS and NMES for 30 minutes. The changes in the hand function and cortical excitability were probed by recording movement performance scales in upper extremity and mapping of brain cortex before and after the intervention. The patients will be assigned into one of three groups (A, B,C) by block randomization. All participants will receive regular traditional rehabilitation. In addition, three groups will receive an additional 3 weeks, 5 times per week, 30 minutes once daily, total 15 session. Group A: both tDCS and NMES conduct simultaneously for 30 minutes. Group B: combination of tDCS and sham NMES Group C: combination of sham tDCS and sham NMES.</detailed_description>
