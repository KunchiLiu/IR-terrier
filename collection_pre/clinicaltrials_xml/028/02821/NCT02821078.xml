	<brief_summary>The objective of the project is to establish the 3D velocity mapping of the hepatic vasculature and its consistency. Specifically, the investigators will assess the consistency of the quantitative data by measuring hepatic blood Inflow (hepatic artery + portal vein) and outflow (inferior vena cava differential flow). According to the mass conservation physical property, blood inflow must equals blood outflow. The relative gap between the measured values will characterize the consistency of the acquisition.</brief_summary>
