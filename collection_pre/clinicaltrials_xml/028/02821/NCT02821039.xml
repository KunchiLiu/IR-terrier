	<brief_summary>The Turkish Thoracic Society Usual Interstitial Pneumonia Registry (TURK-UIP) is a collaborative project to coordinate a team of investigators from various regions of Turkey. The purpose of the Registry is to collect epidemiological data on patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other causes of UIP, and to obtain information about the natural course of the disease and the treatment response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Turkish Thoracic Society Usual Interstitial Pneumonia Registry Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TURK-UIP Registry is a web based application that will store information about patients. A HRCT pattern consistent with UIP will be confirmed by 3 radiologists. At the 3-month visits, the pulmonary function tests and the 6-minute walk test will be recorded. Patients will be prospectively followed for a 5-year period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Understand and sign the informed consent document. 2.
