	<brief_summary>Over the last decade, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFN) has emerged as a new method to provide respiratory support in children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. However, any randomized clinical trial (RCT) have demonstrated that earlier support with HFN is superior to standard care including low -flow nasal oxygen therapy to reduce the risk of acute respiratory failure requiring non invasive (or tracheal) ventilation and subsequently the need of PICU transfer.</brief_summary>
