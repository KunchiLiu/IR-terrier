	<brief_title>Chidamide With ICE Regimen for Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy of the combined regimen is evaluated primarily by objective remission rate, including complete remission, unverified complete remission and partial remission, also by duration of remission, progression free survival, and overall survival. Safety is accessed by: 1. The type, incidence, severity of incidents related to the use of the regimen. 2. Laboratory abnormalities, including the type, incidence, severity, relationship with the use of the regimen. 3. Incidence of level 3-4 incidents and laboratory abnormalities.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) verified by histopathology/ cytology, according to WHO 2008 classification criteria, including: adult T cell lymphoma or leukemia (human T cell leukemia virus 1 positive); angioimmunoblastic t cell lymphoma; ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma; ALK negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma; nonspecified peripheral T cell lymphoma; extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma; bowl disease related T cell lymphoma; hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma; subcutaneous panniculitislike T cell lymphoma; allergic mycosis fungoides. 2. There is at least 1 focus that could be evaluated both by histopathology and cytology (˃1.5cm) according to Cheson criteria. 3. The patients should have had at least 1 course of systemic treatment (including chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation etc), but did not achieve remission or had relapse after remission. 4. Age1875 years, male or female; 5. General condition should be ECOG 01. 6. Blood routine test: absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet ≥80 × 109/L, Hb ≥ 90g/L; 7. Expected survival ≥ 3 months; 8. No radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy or hemopoietic stem cell transplantation received within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 9. Willing to sign the written consent. 1. Women during pregnancy or lactation, or fertile women unwilling to take contraceptive measures. 2. QTc elongation with clinical significance ( male˃ 450ms, female˃ 470ms), ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac conducting blockage, myocardial infarction within 1 year, congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary heart disease that requires treatment. 3. Patients who have received organ transplantation. 4. Patients received symptomatic treatment for bone marrow toxicity within 7 days prior to enrollment. 5. Patients with active hemorrhage. 6. Patients with or with history of thrombosis, embolism, cerebral hemorrhage, or cerebral infarction. 7. Patients with active infection, or with continuous fever within 14 days prior to enrollment. 8. Had major organ surgery within 6 weeks prior to enrollment. 9. Impaired liver function ( Total bilirubin ˃ 1.5 times of normal maximum, ALT/AST˃ 2.5 times of normal maximum, for patients with infiltrative liver disease ALT/AST ˃ 5 times of normal maximum), impaired renal function (serum creatinin˃ 1.5 times of normal maximum). 10. Patients with mental disorders or those do not have the ability to consent. 11. Patients with drug abuse, long term alcoholism that may impact the results of the trial. 12. Nonappropriate patients for the trial according to the judgment of the investigators.</criteria>
