	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: To characterize the appearance of the far peripheral retina of normal eyes using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA). DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: This study enrolled normal eyes with best corrected visual acuity ≥ 20/20, refractive error &lt; 3.00D, and without visible retinal pathologic changes under a slit lamp-based condensing lens. The far peripheral retina was detected by UWFA. Ciliary body thickness (CBT) at 3 mm (CBT1) and 2 mm (CBT2) posterior to the scleral spur was measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE: To characterize the appearance of the far peripheral retina of normal eyes using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA). DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: This study enrolled normal eyes with best corrected visual acuity ≥ 20/20, refractive error &lt; 3.00D, and without visible retinal pathologic changes under a slit lamp-based condensing lens. Demographic and clinical data such as age, sex, and reasons for undergoing FA were collected. The far peripheral retina was detected by UWFA. The fundal fields obtained using the Heidelberg ultra-widefield lens in a single shot and in montage images were compared with those acquired using the Heidelberg conventional 55° lens. The signs at the peripheral retina detected by UWFA were described and grouped. Ciliary body thickness (CBT) at 3 mm (CBT1) and 2 mm (CBT2) posterior to the scleral spur was measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy.</detailed_description>
