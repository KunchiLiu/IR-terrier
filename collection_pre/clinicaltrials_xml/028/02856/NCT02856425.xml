	<brief_summary>Both anti-angiogenesis and anti PD1 immunotherapy have shown beneficial efficacy in solid tumors and in particular in NSCLC. Therefore it is of interest to investigate whether the combination of these two approaches is tolerable. Moreover, comprehensive pre-clinical and clinical rationale sustain the hypothesis that anti-VEGF could synergize with immunotherapy for the benefit of the patients.</brief_summary>

Failure of at least one prior line of chemotherapy 6. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or any other baseline prerequisite for the assessment of the principal judgment criteria. 7. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment. Both sexually active females and males (and their female partners) patients must agree to use two methods of effective contraception, one of them being a barrier method, or to abstain from sexual activity during the study and for at least 4 months after last study drug administration. 8. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study 9. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen or beneficiary or the same 1. Prior treatment with nintedanib 2. Known hypersensitivity to trial drugs or their excipients, peanut or soya or to contrast media 3. Prior treatment with pembrolizumab or any other anti PD1 or antiPDL1 agents 4. Concurrent steroid medication (except topical or aerosol steroids). Any steroid medication should have been stopped for more than 7 days prior beginning of therapy. 5. History of autoimmune/immune mediated inflammatory disease, including but not limited to colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, nephritis, hyperthyroidism, systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, GuillainBarré syndrome, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis excepted stable hypothyroidism or stable Type 1 diabetes mellitus. 6. Chemo, hormono, radio (except for brain and extremities) or immunotherapy or therapy with monoclonal antibodies or small tyrosine kinase inhibitors within the past 4 weeks or 5 halflife times (whatever the shortest) prior to treatment with the trial drugs. 7. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before registration 8. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to steroids azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor [antiTNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to registration 9. Radiotherapy to the target lesion (unless a progression after radiotherapy has been documented) 10. Persistence of clinically relevant treatmentrelated toxicity from previous chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or radiotherapy 11. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Clinically asymptomatic brain metastases are allowed (treatment with steroids prior initiation of the trial is not allowed). Patients with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas, even asymptomatic, are not allowed. 12. Radiographic evidence of cavitary or necrotic tumors or tumors with local invasion of major blood vessels 13. History of clinically significant hemoptysis within the past 3 months (more than one teaspoon of fresh blood per day) 14. Treatment with other investigational drugs or treatment in another clinical trial within the past 4 weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with the trial 15. Therapeutic anticoagulation with drugs requiring INR monitoring (except lowdose heparin and/or heparin flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous devise) or antiplatelet therapy (except for lowdose therapy with acetylsalicylic acid &lt; 325mg per day) 16. Major injuries and/or surgery within the past 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment with incomplete wound healing and/or planned surgery during the ontreatment study period 17. History of clinically significant hemorrhagic or thromboembolic event in the past 6 months 18. Known inherited predisposition to bleeding or thrombosis 19. History of significant cardiovascular diseases ( i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, history of infarction within the past 12 months prior to start of study treatment, congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II, serious cardiac arrhythmia, pericardial effusion) 20. Ongoing uncontrolled autoimmune thyroiditis. Ancient thyroiditis currently stable with substitutive therapy should not be excluded from the trial. 21. Other malignancies within the past 5 years other than basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix 22. Active serious infections in particular if requiring systemic antibiotic or antimicrobial therapy 23. Active or chronic hepatitis C and/or B infection. Patients with past/resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of antihepatitis B core antibody, IgG antiHBs +) are eligible. HBV DNA should be obtained in these patients prior to Day 1. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is negative for HCV RNA. 24. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive; 25. Gastrointestinal disorders or abnormalities that would interfere with absorption of the study drug 26. Serious illness or concomitant nononcological disease such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or active ulcers (gastrointestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study. 27.
