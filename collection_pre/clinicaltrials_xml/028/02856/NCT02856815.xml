	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of "Immuncell-LC" in the Patients Undergone TACE for Intermediate Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ILC-IIT-05 is randomized, open-label, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial. To confirm clinical efficacy and safety between 'Immuncell-LC group' and 'non-treatment group', primary outcome, recurrence free survival(RFS) will be evaluated. For secondary outcome, overall survival(OS), changes of Alpha Feto Protein(AFP), correlation of between myeloid-derived suppressor cell change and prognosis, adverse event, ECOG-PS and hematological examination will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
