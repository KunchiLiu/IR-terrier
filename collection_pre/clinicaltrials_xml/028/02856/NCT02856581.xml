	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well smoking cessation intervention works in reducing surgical complications in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer who smoke cigarettes. This study will use two smoking cessation interventions: Varenicline (a drug that reduces the craving and withdrawal symptoms that occur with abstinence from nicotine) with behavioral interventions (consisting of a brief clinician-delivered intervention and tobacco quitline [tobacco cessation service available through a toll-free telephone number] follow-up) with placebo (a pill with no active medication) along with the same behavioral interventions. It is not yet known whether smoking cessation intervention prior to surgery is effective in reducing surgical complications for these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Prior to Surgery to Reduce Surgical Complications in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Lung Cancer Who Smoke Cigarettes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluating varenicline vs. placebo for reduction in post-surgical complications through 24 weeks after surgery in lung cancer patients who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking. A parallel group design will be utilized for this two-arm study: varenicline vs. placebo. Both arms will also include a brief no smoking message from the surgical team and the NCI Quitline. Patients will be stratified into two groups based on the type of resection planned: minimally invasive (could include lobectomy and robotic surgery) and other. The primary and secondary objectives are provided below. Primary Objective: To determine if varenicline plus a behavioral intervention consisting of a brief clinician-delivered intervention and tobacco quitline follow-up, decreases postsurgical complications through 24 weeks after surgery when compared to placebo plus the behavioral intervention in lung cancer patients who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking. Secondary Objectives: 1. To compare changes from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient quality of life (LASA-12) domains between the intervention (varenicline) and control group (placebo). 2. To compare changes from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient quality of life related domains for the PHQ-9 and SEQ12 between the intervention and control groups. 3. To compare the proportion of patients 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery who endorse ("Was It Worth It") each treatment (intervention vs. control groups). 4. To compare post-operative care (as measured by length of hospital and high dependency unit stay) between the intervention and control groups. 5. To compare treatment adherence between the intervention and control groups. 6. To compare rates of smoking abstinence between the intervention and control groups as a covariate of the primary outcome only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Eligible patients will have a new diagnosis of lung cancer and have sought a surgical consult relating to this diagnosis. 2. Surgery must be scheduled no sooner than 10 days after randomization and no more than twelve weeks after randomization. 3. Have smoked daily or nearly every day in the previous 6 months up to the date of surgical consult AND have smoked at least one puff in the previous 7 days. 4. Motivated to stop smoking, as indicated by a score of 6 or above on the Contemplation Ladder as defined in the protocol. 5. Within the 30 days before registration, no use of: 1) any pharmacologic treatment for smoking cessation, including buproprion or nicotine replacement therapy; 2) any nicotine delivery system (i.e., ecigarettes and vape products); or 3) be enrolled in any formal behavioral treatment program for tobacco dependence as determined by patient report. 6. No allergies to and not currently using varenicline. 7. No suicidal thoughts as indicated by a positive (1+) response to question 9 on the PHQ9. 8. No active untreated clinically significant psychiatric condition (psychosis, bipolar disorder, or depression). 9. Negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) done ≤7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). 10. No unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or coronary angioplasty within the past 3 months or an untreated cardiac dysrhythmia. 11. No history of seizures. 12. No unstable neurologic, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, lymphatic, or metabolic disease. 13. Not currently on renal dialysis or has a history of significant renal impairment. 14. No recent history (≤ 90 days) of substance abuse (outside of tobacco) defined by NIAAA as: If male, drinking &gt;14 alcoholic beverages per week for past 1 month. If female, drinking &gt;7 alcoholic beverages per week for past 1 month. Use of cocaine, heroin, club drugs (i.e., MDMA/"ecstasy"), methamphetamine, or hallucinogens (e.g., LSD) at any time during the past 1 month. Use of marijuana on a weekly basis for the past 1 month. 15. Patients must be able to complete study questionnaires in English. 16. ≥18 years of age 17. No other household member or relative participating in the study. 18. No known history of any condition or factor judged by the investigator to preclude participation in the study or which might hinder study adherence. 19. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min Creatinine clearance (CrCl) will be calculated using the CockroftGault equation as follows: CrCI (ml/min) = (140age) x actual wt (in kg) / 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)</criteria>
