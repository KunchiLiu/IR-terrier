	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this multisite, multicountry Zika in Infants and Pregnancy (ZIP) study is to assess the strength of the association between Zika virus infection (ZIKV) during pregnancy and adverse maternal/fetal outcomes and the risk of vertical transmission. The study will prospectively enroll a cohort of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and follow them through their pregnancy to identify for clinical evidence of acute ZIKV, while controlling for potential confounders. Outcomes in the women, the developing fetus, and infants will be assessed. All protocol-specified data will be recorded and entered in a central data management system for the purposes of analysis of composite data from the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this multisite, multicountry Zika in Infants and Pregnancy (ZIP) study is to assess the strength of the association between Zika virus infection (ZIKV) during pregnancy and adverse maternal/fetal outcomes and the risk of vertical transmission. The study will prospectively enroll a cohort of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and follow them through their pregnancy to identify for clinical evidence of acute ZIKV, while controlling for potential confounders. Outcomes in the women, the developing fetus, and infants will be assessed. All protocol-specified data will be recorded and entered in a central data management system for the purposes of analysis of composite data from the study. The study will recruit 10,000 pregnant women in their first trimester from ZIKV-endemic regions and follow them longitudinally to study the impact of incident ZIKV during pregnancy on maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes. Researchers will identify cases of incident ZIKV among pregnant women by monitoring for symptoms of Zika-like illness and performing serial laboratory sampling for diagnosis of seroconversion and viral shedding. After delivery, infants born with evidence of ZIKV or born to mothers diagnosed with incident virus infection will be followed in a prospective longitudinal cohort for at least 1 year. In addition, a control group of infants born to mothers without evidence of ZIKV during pregnancy will be followed.</detailed_description>
