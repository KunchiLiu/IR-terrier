	<brief_summary>This pilot study examines concurrent and predictive relationships between eye tracking and clinical outcomes during a 16-week behavioral intervention (PRT) for children with ASD. Eye tracking will be comprised of both laboratory-based measures (using a commercial eye-tracking system) as well as home-based measures (using tablet-based eye tracking systems). The major goals of this study are both to improve our understanding of the potential role of eye tracking in clinical trials and to advance technologies that may further improve the sensitivity, robustness, accessibility, and ultimate utility of eye tracking methodologies.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Individuals ages 47 years diagnosed previously with ASD and meet criteria for ASD when characterized by our research team, English is a language spoken in the family, and Fullscale IQ&gt;50. Participants must also complete laboratory and homebased eye tracking sessions, with success determined by the Principal Investigator. Individuals will be excluded from participation based on the presence of 1. a physical or neurological disorder (e.g., cerebral palsy) which is likely to impact development and learning, as intervention procedures for these individuals may need to be modified beyond the standard approach to address more complex developmental needs, 2. hearing loss or other severe sensory impairment, 3. history of significant head trauma or serious brain or psychiatric illness, 4. parents/caregivers who do not speak fluent English, 5. parents/caregivers who have previous training in PRT 6. individuals who must be excluded from eye tracking. These families will be offered the treatment clinically (i.e., feebased), and they will be given referrals to outside agencies offering the treatment as well.</criteria>
