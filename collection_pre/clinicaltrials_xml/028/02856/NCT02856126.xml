	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HAIC Versus TACE for Advanced HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our previous prospective study also revealed that TACE confers a survival benefit to patients with HCC and portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT). Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for HCC with PVTT. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control study to find out it.</detailed_description>
