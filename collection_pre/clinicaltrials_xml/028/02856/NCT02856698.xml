	<brief_summary>Acute pulmonary edema (APE) is a common condition in the emergency room, associated with considerable mortality. The use of intravenous morphine in the treatment of APE remains controversial and Benzodiazepines have been suggested as an alternative for morphine to relieving dyspnoea and anxiety in the patients with APE. The MIdazolan versus MOrphine in APE trial (MIMO) is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of morphine in patients with APE.</brief_summary>
