	<brief_summary>The phase II APPLE trial gives the opportunity to prospectively validate liquid biopsies as a new standard for testing tumor progression compared with conventional radiological procedure in EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC patients. Moreover based on the sequential T790M test during treatment the investigators will assess the predictive value of liquid biopsies. APPLE trial will examine the best strategy for delivering osimertinib (upfront versus sequential treatment after 1st generation EGFR TKI) in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. Finally, the trial will also explore the mechanisms of acquired resistance to Osimertinib based on the results of an optional biopsy upon progression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective To evaluate the best strategy for delivering Osimertinib (AZD9291) in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation. The objective is assessed by Progression Free Survival rate at 18 months (PFS-18). Secondary objectives - To evaluate PFS on Osimertinib measured from randomization by RECIST criteria 1.1 [Ref 33]. - To evaluate PFS measured from switching to Osimertinib by RECIST criteria 1.1 [Ref 33]. - To determine the proportion of patients receiving Osimertinib based on the determination of cfDNA T790M mutation positive. - To evaluate time to symptomatic brain metastases in patients with presence of brain metastases at study entry. - To evaluate PFS-2 (defined as the sum of the PFS to Gefitinib and the PFS to Osimertinib treatment). - To evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Osimertinib. - To evaluate the Treatment duration. - To evaluate Time to progression (TTP) on Osimertinib (measured from switching to osimertinib). - To evaluate Overall Survival (OS). - To evaluate time to brain progression (TTBP). - Safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: Pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung carrying common EGFR activating mutations associated with EGFRTKI sensitivity (Del19 or L858R); performed locally; no other EGFR mutations will be allowed.

Baseline tumour assessment scans are done within 14 days before randomization; WHO Performance Status 02, with no clinically significant deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks; Adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and liver function within 21 days from randomization and defined as follows: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L; Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L; Haemoglobin ≥90 g/L; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or ≤5xULN in the presence of liver metastases; Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5xULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or ≤5xULN in the presence of liver metastases; Total bilirubin ≤1.5xULN if no liver metastases or ≤3xULN in the presence of documented Gilbert's Syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) or liver metastases; Creatinine ≤1.5xULN concurrent with creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation); No significant comorbidity that according to the investigator would hamper the participation on the trial; Female patients should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breastfeeding, until 12 months after the last dose, and must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to first dose of study drug (within 72 hours); or female patients must have an evidence of nonchildbearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening: Postmenopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments. Women under 50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution. Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateraloophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception, i.e., condoms o Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study should they wish to father children, and not to donate sperm until 6 months after discontinuation of study treatment." (as per Investigator Brochure, IB) Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial. Exclusion: Treatment with any of the following: Prior treatment with any systemic anticancer therapy for locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC including chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or any investigational drug; Prior treatment with an EGFRTKI; Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug; Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug. Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use at least 1 week prior to receiving the first dose of study drug) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; Other anticancer therapies and alternative medications such as homeopathic treatment, etc; Treatment with an investigational drug within five halflives of the compound or any of its related material, if known; Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; spinal cord compression; Any unresolved toxicities from prior systemic therapy (e.g., adjuvant chemotherapy) greater than CTCAE grade 2 at the time of starting study drug; Patients will not be eligible if they have evidence of active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or localized cervical cancer or localised and presumed cured prostatic cancer) within 2 years of first dose of study drug and are not receiving specific treatment for these malignancies at baseline assessment; Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardise compliance with the protocol; or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Active infection will include any patients receiving intravenous treatment for infection; active hepatitis B infection will, at a minimum, include all patients who are Hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HbsAg positive) based on serology assessment.
