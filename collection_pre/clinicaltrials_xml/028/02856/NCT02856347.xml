	<brief_summary>The aim of the trial is to study a radiating diagnosis agent used in post surgery when the biological assessment highlighted a residual disease. This is an inter-regional multicentric, prospective study evaluating the benefit of PET F-DOPA imaging in involved node detection compared to standard imaging assessment in patient with medullary thyroid cancer. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact and performance of a new PET / CT (computerized tomography ) tracer targeting dopamine receptor in patient with residual ganglionar biological disease after initial surgery of medullary thyroid cancer compared to standard imaging. Obtained data will be compared to the "gold standard" based on : - nodes cytology when they could be punctured - histology when a new surgery will be recommended - surveillance when the 2 first cases will be not applicable (imaging monitoring, evolution of thyrocalcitonin)</brief_summary>
