	<brief_summary>The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of footwear stiffness on a large cohort of high school football players during a football season. The investigators expect that functional athlete groups will be developed, based on subject specific assessments (biomechanical, morphological, performance, comfort), and lead to important translational findings that may impact footwear modification and recommendation to a population of American football players. Two standard cleats will be randomized and provided during a season of high school football. Ratings of comfort, performance, and injury will be collected throughout the season.</brief_summary>
