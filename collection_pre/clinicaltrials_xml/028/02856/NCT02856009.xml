	<brief_summary>Stroke in elderly subjects has a more severe clinical presentation (in terms of frequency of aphasia, hemiplegia or consciousness disorders), and a worse functional and vital prognosis. Patients older than 75 years also show excess mortality. One of the hypotheses to explain this situation is the high level of frailty in this population. Many tools to measure the concept of frailty have been developed. One important dimension of these tools is the nutritional status. Indeed, protein-energy malnutrition in the elderly, though a frequent situation, is also a complex phenomenon. The aim of this study is therefore to analyse the impact of protein-energy malnutrition, as a marker of frailty, on the early prognosis (at 28 days) in the aftermath of stroke in subjects older than 75 years hospitalized in Dijon CHU.</brief_summary>
