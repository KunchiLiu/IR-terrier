	<brief_summary>High-dose remifentanil infused intraoperative ironically results in postoperative hyperalgesia. Ultra-low dose nalxone is demonstrated to prevent these opioid-induced hyperalgesia in animal model. In this clinical trial in patients undergoing general anesthesia with remifentanil, we evaluate the effects of ultra-low-dose naloxone on remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ultra-low-dose Naloxone on Remifentanil-induced Postoperative Hyperalgesia - A Randomized Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enrolled adult patients undergoing thyroidectomy under general anesthesia with desflurane and remifentanil. Remifentanil was administered via target-controlled infusion and anesthetic depth was maintained keeping the BIS between 40 and 60. Patients were randomized into one of three groups depending on intraoperative doses of remifentanil and naloxone: effect-site concentrations of remifentanil 1 ng/ml (control group), 4 ng/ml (remifentanil group), and 4 ng/ml combined with infusion rate 0.8 ng/kg/min of naloxone (remifentanil and naloxone group). Postoperative mechanical pain thresholds, pain intensity, and analgesic consumption were examined during 48 h of postoperative period. The primary outcome was mechanical pain threshold measured on the peri-incisional area 24 h after surgery.</detailed_description>
