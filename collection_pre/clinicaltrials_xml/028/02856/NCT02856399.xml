	<brief_summary>The methadone is an useful opioid for the cancer pain treatment, mostly used in second or last line during the opioid rotation. The Methadone had an anti-MNDA effect, and clinicians agree that the methadone could have an effect in neuropathic cancer pain. During a previous study the investigators find that the pain was still improving after the week 2, but they had only a small number of patients still included at this stage and they cannot conclude. The investigators decide to follow up systematically all the patients undergoing a methadone treatment for cancer pain, at day 28, to study the hypothesis about the long-term pain improvement.</brief_summary>
