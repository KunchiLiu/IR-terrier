	<brief_summary>The current management of ischemic stroke is based on different strategies that may be combined: intravenous thrombolysis in a stroke ICU, intravenous thrombolysis in a telemedicine procedure, endovascular thrombectomy. Given this now rich therapeutic arsenal, it seems necessary to evaluate practices in local care in the field and the impact of these on the prognosis of ischemic stroke victims. The aim of this observational study is to compare these different care practices without interfering with the choice of strategy. A blood sample will also be taken at different times to study the value of growth differentiation factors (GDF) 8, 11 and 15, and Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor as prognostic biomarkers</brief_summary>
