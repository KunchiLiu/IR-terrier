	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES OF THE TRIAL Primary objective Evaluation of efficacy in terms of progression-free survival at 9 months of the combination of intensified methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin with or without panitumumab as first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma in patients without Harvey nor Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutations. Secondary objectives - To assess toxicity - To assess response rate - To assess overall survival - To assess time to progression - To study the correlation between response rate, time to progression, overall survival and biological parameters</brief_summary>
