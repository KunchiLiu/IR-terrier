	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with a high mortality. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is impaired in patients with IPF. Little is known about the properties of recently developed HRQL questionnaires and about the longitudinal changes in HRQL, including factors with an impact on HRQL. Comorbidities have an impact on patients with IPF, but reports differ in incidence and prevalence. The impact of comorbidities on HRQL and disease progression has only been studied sparsely. Also, the association between biomarkers and disease progression need to be examined further.</brief_summary>
