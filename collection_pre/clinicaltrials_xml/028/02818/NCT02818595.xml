	<brief_summary>Many cognitive functions in humans are based on asymmetrical brain networks. For example, in most adults, the language is essentially processed by the left hemisphere, while other auditory functions, such as voice recognition, tend to be processed by the right hemisphere. Many studies, especially those conducted by Ghislaine Dehaene's team, have demonstrated the presence of anatomical and functional asymmetries by the first months of life. What are the causes of these asymmetries? How do they develop? Are they necessary for functioning or effective learning? This study, conducted in collaboration with the Compi√®gne applied mathematics team (Abdelatif El Badia) and the INSERM team (Ghislaine Dehaene), is designed to determine the stage of development at which hemispheric dominance for voice recognition is first observed and to identify the brain structure involved in preterm neonates whose sound environment is usually very different from that of the foetus. The impact of this environment on the infant's brain development and early learning will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
