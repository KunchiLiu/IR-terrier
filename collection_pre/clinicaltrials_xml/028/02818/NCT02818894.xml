	<brief_summary>Spinal anesthesia is commonly used in patients undergoing total hip replacements. The purpose of this study is to compare lidocaine to bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in patients having a total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective of this study is to compare the two spinal anesthesia treatments in regards to transient neurological symptoms (TNS).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will have their patient records examined prospectively and complete up to four telephone questionnaires after randomization to lidocaine or bupivacaine spinal anesthesia to see how they are feeling after their total hip arthroplasty (THA). Transient neurological symptoms, urinary retention, timing of full mobilization, incidence of hypotension, and length of hospital stay will be recorded for both methods of spinal anesthesia for comparison.</detailed_description>
