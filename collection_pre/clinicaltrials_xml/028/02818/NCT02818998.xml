	<criteria>The subject's history of aflibercept treatment meets all of the following: 1. Treatment in the study eye was initiated with five monthly (1 week /+2 weeks) doses of 2 mg aflibercept and improvements of visual and anatomic outcomes were observed and documented. 2. Following the above initiation phase, the intervals between treatments were between 6 weeks and 12 weeks (one exception will be allowed). 3. The interval between the last two prestudy injections was ≥ 8 weeks, and visual and anatomic outcomes have been stable over this interval. 4. The subject received the last IVT (intravitreal) injection of aflibercept in the study eye 8 weeks (±10 days) before the first planned treatment /randomization in this study. 5. Total prior treatment duration with aflibercept (i.e. from first aflibercept treatment ever to enrollment into this study) was 1 year or longer. To be met at initiation of prestudy aflibercept treatment: Type1 or 2 diabetes mellitus Diagnosis of DME (diabetic macular edema) secondary to diabetes mellitus involving the center of the macula (defined as the area of the center subfield of OCT) in the study eye Decrease in vision determined to be primarily the result of DME in the study eye BCVA in the study eye of ETDRS letter score 73 to 24 (corresponding to a Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/40 to 20/320) At initiation of prestudy aflibercept treatment: Previous treatment with antiangiogenic drugs in study eye (e.g. pegaptanib sodium, bevacizumab, ranibizumab or aflibercept) within the last 12 weeks before initiation of aflibercept prestudy treatment At all of the following time points: i) Initiation of prestudy aflibercept treatment ii) Screening for this study iii) Baseline for this study History of vitreoretinal surgery and/or including scleral buckling in the study eye Prior treatment of the study eye with Long acting steroids, either periocular or intraocular, in the preceding 120 days or Iluvien intravitreal implant at any time Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), current iris neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, or tractional retinal detachment in the study eye Cataract surgery within 90 days before aflibercept treatment in the study eye Preretinal fibrosis involving the macula of the study eye Structural damage to the center of the macula in the study eye that was likely to preclude improvement in BCVA following the resolution of macular edema including atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, subretinal fibrosis or scar, significant macular ischemia or organized hard exudates Concurrent disease in the study eye, other than DME, that could compromise VA (visual acuity), require medical or surgical intervention during the study period, or could confound interpretation of the results (including advanced glaucoma, retinal vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, macular hole, or choroidal neovascularization of any cause) Administration of systemic anti angiogenic agents within 180 days before aflibercept treatment Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by hemoglobin (Hb)A1c &gt; 12.0% Uncontrolled blood pressure (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg while subject is sitting confirmed in two separate measurements) At all of the following time points: i) Screening for this study ii) Baseline for this study Any ocular or periocular infection in the preceding 4 weeks in either eye Filtration surgery for glaucoma in the past or likely to be needed in the future on the study eye Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure [IOP] &gt; 25 mmHg despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication) in the study eye History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, might affect interpretation of the results of the study, or renders the subject at high risk for treatment complications Significant media opacities, including cataract, in the study eye that interferes with visual acuity, fundus photography or OCT (optical coherence tomography) imaging.</criteria>
