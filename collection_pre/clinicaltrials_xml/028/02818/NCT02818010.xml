	<brief_summary>PHYSALYS is an observational multicenter study. It's an analytical study comparing 2 groups: patients exposed to physical activity and unexposed. The main objective of the study is to compare the evolution of glomerular filtration rate at inclusion and 12 months later between patients practicing physical activity and patients not practicing. If necessary, the renal disease-related complications, which are not influenced by physical activity: (type of kidney disease, age and tobacco), would be taken into account. TIRCEL patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at stages 3, 4 or 5 can be included in the study. Their serum creatinine data, 12 months prior to inclusion, is collected retrospectively. Patients are followed in the trial during 12 months. To evaluate physical activity, patients respond to Global Physical Activity Questionnaire 2 (GPAQ2) at inclusion and 12 months later. During this 12 months period, the same biological data are collected prospectively.</brief_summary>
