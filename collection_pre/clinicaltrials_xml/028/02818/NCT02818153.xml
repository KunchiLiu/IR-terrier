	<brief_summary>Allergic rhinitis is a common condition that affects adults as well as children and adolescents, often with impaired quality of life. Patients often report a poor level of satisfaction with the effectiveness of their treatment and are always looking for more drug combinations to improve their symptom. Several tools exist for assessing control of allergic rhinitis, but none has been validated in adolescents or in children. A study conducted in 2008, resulted in the validation of a self-administered control test of allergic rhinitsis (ARCT) in patients from 12 years of age. However, this study included only 67 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old and lacked power. In this new study,the investigators propose, following exactly the same procedure as the pilot study of 2008, to confirme the validation of unmodified Adult questionnaire in adolescents 12 to 17 years inclusive.</brief_summary>
