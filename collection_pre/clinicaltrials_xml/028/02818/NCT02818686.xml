	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TD-1473 in subjects with moderately-to-severely active UC over 28 days. This exploratory study will also serve as a signal seeking endeavor to demonstrate biologic effect associated with TD-1473 through biomarker analysis and clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessments.</brief_summary>
