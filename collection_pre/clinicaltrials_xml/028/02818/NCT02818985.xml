	<brief_title>Analgesia in Knee Arthroscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intra-articular analgesia is useful in reducing patients' postoperative disability. It anticipates and prevents the onset of pain, and helps avoid the need for additional drugs. Usually it is possible to reach good analgesia in the immediate postoperative period by the administration of analgesic drugs. Recently, intra-articular administration of different anaesthetic substances with a local action (e.g. bupivacaine) has been introduced in clinical practice. The aim of the administration of these substances should not be the reduction of postoperative pain, but its prevention.</detailed_description>
