	<brief_summary>Gingival recession (GR) is frequently associated with deterioration in dental esthetics and dental hypersensitivity. Outcomes from recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that when the root is covered and the gain in the width of keratinized tissue (KT) is expected, the use of subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs) associated with coronally advanced flaps (CAF) appears to be more predictable, and may be considered the gold standard procedure. However, the SCTGs may increase patients' morbidity (e.g., pain). This occurs because of the need for a donor surgical area, which may increase the risk of surgical complications like bleeding, as well as increases post-operative discomfort and the period of the surgical procedure. Another biomaterial, a new collagen matrix (CM) has been used as a substitute for the SCTG. The use of CM was associated with a significant reduction in post-operative morbidity, less post-operative pain and discomfort in the patient, and more esthetic satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patients will be included in the study if they fulfill the following inclusion criteria: 1. a clinical diagnosis of multiplerecession type defects at maxillary canines and premolars with at least one GR â‰¥ 3mm in depth; 2. areas of Miller's Class I or II GR; 3. teeth without root abrasions or caries. The exclusion criteria used will be as follows: patients allergic to collagen a history of smoking (within the previous 6 months) pregnancy or lactation a history of destructive periodontal disease or the formation of recurrent abscesses root caries at the site of recession previous surgical root coverage procedures systemic healing disorders (for example, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], diabetes mellitus or risk factors evaluated by a medical doctor) periodontal disease, or poor plaque control (full mouth plaque index &gt; 20%). The exclusion criteria for teeth will be: 1. noncarious cervical lesions (erosion, abfraction etc.) 2. any type of previous cervical restoration 3. extrusion 4. giroversion 5. mobility 6. a prominent root surface.</criteria>
