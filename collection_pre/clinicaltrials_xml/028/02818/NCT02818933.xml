	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the quality of self-report data obtained using the Automated Self Administered 24-Hour Recall (ASA24-Kids-2014) relative to an interviewer administered 24-hour recall in a sample of adolescents ages 12-17 years, to determine their method preference, and to assess issues related to each method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet Intake Estimation of Tweens and Teens: The DIETT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self-reported dietary intake currently provides the best approach to quantify foods and nutrients for many nutrition research studies. The interviewer administered 24-hour diet recall is generally considered the best available method; however, it is limited by a high degree of participant burden and cost. A web-based, automated, self-administered 24-hour recall (ASA24-Kids-2014) was recently designed by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to mimic the interviewer administered 24-hour recall approach to collecting high quality dietary intake data in children and adolescents while minimizing time and cost. Although the ASA24-Kids-2014 is a potentially useful and cost-effective tool for collecting dietary data for research studies in children and adolescents, it has not been validated for use in pediatric populations. A total of 30 adolescents will be recruited to achieve the study aims. For Aim 1, 10 participants will complete one diet recall using ASA24-Kids-2014 and one interviewer administered 24-hour recall. Their feedback on both methods and preference will be assessed. For Aim 2, 20 participants will be randomly assigned to complete six (one per week) web-based or interviewer administered 24-hour recalls. Data from Aim 2 will be analyzed to determine whether the reporting quality decays over time for each method. In addition, feedback from participants in both aims will be collected on specific factors related to the recall methods such as ease of use, technical challenges, flexibility, duration, and database completeness. Results obtained from this pilot study could provide critical information to design a larger method comparison study to rigorously assess the performance of the ASA24-Kids web-based diet recall.</detailed_description>
