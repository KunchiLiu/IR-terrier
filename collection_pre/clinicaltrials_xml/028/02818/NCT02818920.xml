	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional, phase 2 clinical trial is studying two doses of pembrolizumab administered prior to surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) and 4 doses administered after surgery (adjuvant therapy) for stage IB, II or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy that may enhance the ability of the immune system to fight off cancer. The study will investigate the effects of pembrolizumab on the immune system and how certain immune cells, called TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), respond to pembrolizumab. Previous studies suggest that pembrolizumab could alter the immune cells in a way that the the immune cells identify cancer cells. Pembrolizumab has been approved for the treatment of advanced lung cancer, but is investigational in this setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presumed mechanism of action for pembrolizumab is the removal of T lymphocyte inhibition by masking the PD-1 receptor. Our hypothesis is that the masking of the PD-1 receptor by pembrolizumab results in the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes with specificities against tumor associated antigens (TILs). In untreated lung cancer tumors, we would expect few tumors to have TIL cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens. Based on the response rate to pembrolizumab in advanced lung cancer, we hypothesize that at least 20% of lung cancers would have TIL cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens after pembrolizumab therapy. Studying neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy is an attractive strategy for studying the immunologic changes caused by PD-1 (programmed death receptor 1) checkpoint masking. Most of the immunologic activity associated with pembrolizumab occurs in the tumor and surrounding microenvironment. Evaluation of post-pembrolizumab tumor will be important to understanding factors associated with pembrolizumab activity, immune tolerance, and discovery of other targets for immune therapy. Pembrolizumab has known benefit in non-small cell lung cancer. The addition of pembrolizumab for two doses prior to surgery and four doses after surgery has the potential to confer clinical benefit. Large randomized phase 3 trials are now testing whether PD-1 checkpoint antibodies improve survival as adjuvant therapy after resection of early stage lung cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC. Clinical stage IB (&gt;4cm per CT), Stage IIA/IIB, or Stage IIIA (N02) amenable to surgical resection. Primary tumor &gt; 4 cm (for all stages entered) to make it likely that excess tumor will be available after resection. Patient must be deemed a surgical candidate. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix C). No prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic/targeted therapy for current diagnosis of lung cancer. Adequate Organ Function Age ≥18 years. Nonpregnant. Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized or postmenopausal [a woman who is &gt; 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year]) must test negative for pregnancy within 48 hours prior to any initial study procedure based on a serum pregnancy test. No active invasive malignancy in the past 2 years other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. Cancers that are insitu are not considered invasive. Signed written informed consent including HIPAA according to institutional guidelines. Patients must agree to research blood sampling to participate in study. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Postop predicted FEV1 and DLCO &gt; 40% predicted (or per institutional standard). Treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis). Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients. Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy. Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. Active infection requiring antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral agents, that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies). Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. GuillainBarre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis). Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Has a known additional invasive malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Has had major surgery (other than definitive lung cancer surgery) within two weeks of study or other serious concomitant disorders that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study. Has received any nononcology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to 30 days before or after any dose of pembrolizumab). Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Has history of myocardial infarction having occurred less than 6 months before inclusion, any known uncontrolled arrhythmia, symptomatic angina pectoris, active ischemia, or cardiac failure not controlled by medications. Patients with CAD recently treated with surgery and/or stent, if stable without symptomatic angina pectoris, active ischemia are eligible. Has a history of interstitial lung disease Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness.</criteria>
