	<brief_title>Repurposing Dexmedetomidine as an Orally/Sublingually Administered Sleep Therapeutic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep is a basic human function that occupies approximately one-third of our lives. Much of what is known about the benefits of sleep in humans has been obtained from studies of patients with insomnia, the most common sleep disorder with a reported prevalence of 10 to 15%. Unfortunately, insomnia is an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and death. More so, sleep disturbances lead to neurocognitive deficits such as delirium and psychosis. However, the principal medications (i.e. benzodiazepines, zolpidem) currently used to treat insomnia are associated with side effects such as daytime sedation, delirium, anterograde memory disturbance, and complex sleep-related behaviors. We recently found that a nighttime intravenous bolus administration of dexmedetomidine was associated with normal sleep architecture comprising of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (N1, N2, N3) sleep, with improved next-day psychomotor vigilance performance compared to zolpidem. Presently, dexmedetomidine is only available in an intravenous formulation. The goal of this project is to develop dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, into an oral and sublingual sleep therapeutic with a neurocognitive sparing profile. Sleep is crucial for maintaining normal health and well-being. Insomnia, which is a disorder of sleep onset or maintenance, is prevalent in approximately 10-15% of the population. Insomnia is largely treated with medications that similar to anesthetics, target gamma-amino-butyric acid A (GABAA) receptors throughout the brain to globally inhibit activity and cause sedation. Sedation with GABA receptor modulating anesthetics and insomnia medications are associated with beta (13-25 Hz) oscillations a relatively fast oscillatory dynamic that is not associated with natural sleep. Rather, this oscillatory dynamic, which results from interneuron antisynchrony, is associated with amnesic drug effects. Our objective in this investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of biomimetic sleep in reducing the incidence and severity of delirium in extubated CSICU patients.</detailed_description>
