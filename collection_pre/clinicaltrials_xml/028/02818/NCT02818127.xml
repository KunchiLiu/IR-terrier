	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate and describe the total coronary circulation time (TCCT) by using TIMI frame count method in patients performed coronary angiography. TCCT is described as an angiographic index which is the sum of the frame count of coronary artery and venous system. This study also evaluates the relationship between the diseases in arterial system such as coronary artery ectasia, coronary slow flow, coronary artery disease and coronary venous pathologies.</brief_summary>
