	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this study is to test for perturbations in intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) , cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and serum and cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers associated with delirium in high risk population having elective hip arthroplasty at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All prospective patients will be given a copy of the informed consent which explains the details and responsibilities of the study. Each patient will have a preoperative baseline CAM, DRS and a mBDRS to document preoperative cognitive function and possible criteria for exclusion. 1. The Delirium Rating Scale-98 (DRS), is a validated 16 item clinician rated scale with 13 severity items and 3 diagnostic items. Instructions, the questions, and the score sheet are included as supplement material. 2. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) test is a clinician evaluation and algorithm for the binary determination of presence or absence of delirium. It can be performed simultaneously with the DRS test. 3. The modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (mBDRS) is a series of questions given to either the patient or close care giver to rate presence of and severity of dementia, while distinguishing dementia from other psychiatric diseases like delirium and schizophrenia. The worksheet is included as supplemental material. The resulting score ranges from 0 to 17 and distinguished from mild, moderate and severe forms of dementia. A non-invasive frontal EEG patch will be placed prior to or at the start of anesthesia. Anesthetic depth will be measured using the SEDline® by Masimo. Continuous raw EEG, spectral edge, compressed spectral analysis and percentage suppressed will be recorded from the SEDline® monitor. The investigators will be drawing blood from patients who agree to participate in the study. Preoperative blood sampling will be done while the investigators place the intravenous line, or if present, from an arterial line. If a spinal anesthetic is being used, 5 mL of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be collected at the time of dural puncture prior to the administration of the neuraxial blockade. Members of the research team will administer CAM and DRS testing on post-operative days 1 and 2.</detailed_description>
