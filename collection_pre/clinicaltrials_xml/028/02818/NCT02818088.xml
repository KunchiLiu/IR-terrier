	<brief_summary>This unique study will allow us to observe the neural correlates associated with working memory in an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) paradigm. We believe that developing working memory in participants suffering with OCD will reduce the severity of their symptomology. This will allow a greater understanding into the functioning of these participants which in turn presents with treatment possibilities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is currently unclear whether cognitive training using a working memory task, is effective in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms and neuropsychological deficits in patients with OCD. Two groups (OCD and control) will be recruited. Both groups will undergo an intervention consisting of 8 weeks of cognitive training. Working memory, neuropsychological functioning and OCD symptomatology will be assessed pre and post-treatment, in both groups. Furthermore neuroimaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be conducted at baseline as well as at the end of the 8 week period in both groups. The scan will serve to show any structural or functional changes in the frontostriatal area involved with working memory. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to date to examine whether cognitive training improves symptoms in OCD.</detailed_description>
