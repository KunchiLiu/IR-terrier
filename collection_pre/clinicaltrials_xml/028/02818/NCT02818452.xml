	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the effect on glycemic responses of adding various doses of OatWell28XF to Quaker Instant Oatmeal in order to: 1) describe the dose-response curve and 2) If possible, identify the minimum level of OatWell28XF which, when added to a serving of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, would result in a glycemic response at least 20% less than that elicited by a β-glucan-free cereal.</brief_summary>
