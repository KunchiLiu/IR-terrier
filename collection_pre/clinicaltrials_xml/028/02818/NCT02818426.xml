	<brief_summary>UCPVAx is a therapeutic vaccine based on the telomerase-derived UCP designed to induce strong TH1 CD4 T cell responses in cancer patients. Three doses of UCPVax (0,25 mg, 0,5 mg and 1 mg) will be tested in this phase I/II study by using Continuous Reassessment Method (CRML) dose escalation design model. The phase I is a dose escalation study designed to evaluate safety of use of UCPVax and to estimate its Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). The phase II is a dose deescalation designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of UCPVax according to the dose level.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>UCPVax study is a prospective multicenter phase I/II study: 54 patients with metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled in 5 centers in France. A translational research program will be performed to better define the eligibility criteria and predictive biomarkers needed for randomized phase II and Phase III trials.</detailed_description>
