	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome is sensitive to steroid in 90% of children. However, most patients relapse and become steroid-dependant, with a long lasting relapsing course. The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of a 6-months levamisole course, given early after first remission, on maintaining a relapse-free course at 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency of Levamisole for Maintaining Remission After the First Flare of Steroid Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction (INS) is likely a primal immune disorder. Initial treatment relies on steroid therapy. NS is sensitive to steroid in more than 90% of cases, with an excellent renal prognosis. Nevertheless, 80% of patients with steroid sensitive NS do relapse, 60% within the first year. 2/3 of them will experience steroid dependency, with a long lasting relapsing course. These patients require further immunosuppressive drugs as steroid sparing agents, such as mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors or rituximab. Morbidity is high and related both to the duration of the disease, sometimes until adulthood, and to treatments side effects. Levamisole is an immunomodulator that has been used for more than thirty years in the treatment of steroid-dependent or frequently relapsing NS. Its major advantages are its immunomodulatory action and lower and reversible toxicity. Exact physiopathology of both INS and levamisole action remain unknown. Nevertheless, we make the hypothesis that very early treatment with levamisole may enhance its efficiency and modify the disease's course. This is the first trial to assess the efficiency of levamisole in increasing duration of remission after the first manifestation of INS. Design : - A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial. - 38 centers participate to the recruitment : 3 Pediatric Nephrology units and 35 General Pediatric units. - 20 centers participate to the randomized phase. Sample size : 156 patients, 78 in each group Treatment groups : 1. Levamisole Hydrochloride Dosage : 5, 10, 25 et 50mg. Dosage form : oral tablets Posology : 2.5 mg/kg on alternate days maximum 150mg. Treatment duration : 6 months 2. placebo : matching verum Assessment : Study visits at inclusion, M1 (randomisation), M3, M6, M9, M12. Supplementary visit if relapse occurs. Statistical procedure Analysis of efficiency will be performed on intention to treat population. Analysis of tolerance will be performed on randomized patients who have received at least one dose of treatment. No intermediary analysis is planned.</detailed_description>
