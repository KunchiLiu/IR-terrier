	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate feasibility, safety and effectiveness of the first generation transfemoral JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System (formerly named JenaValve TAVI Plus System- Transfemoral) in an elderly patient population with severe aortic stenosis who are at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First in Man Study of the JenaValve TAVI Plus System Transfemoral</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center trial conducted at 2 centers in Germany enrolling up to 12 subjects. Each patient will be followed for 2 years. The last patient's follow-up will end in February 2016. It is planned that the study will end in June 2016. Study endpoints are defined in accordance with the "Standardized endpoint definitions for transcatheter aortic valve implantation clinical trials: a consensus report from the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2)". These endpoint definitions combine the expertise of surgeons, interventionalists, medical cardiologists, clinical trial and other specialists and allow for comparison of different trials concerning effectiveness and safety in TAVI.</detailed_description>
