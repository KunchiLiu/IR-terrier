	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an extensive vasculopathy and high cardiovascular mortality as well as an accumulation of uremic toxins. Among the latest, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) interact with RAGE. Investigators aimed to analyze the role of RAGE in the calcification process of hemodialyzed patients, in a correlative and prospective study. Vascular calcifications will be assessed by Xray and tomodentimetry while accumulation of AGEs will be measured in the serum and in the skin (non invasive). Additionally factors influencing RAGE activation such as genetic polymorphism and level of soluble forms of RAGE will be measured and analyzed.</brief_summary>
