	<brief_summary>The investigators recently identified promiscuous HLA-DR-derived epitopes from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) called universal cancer peptides (UCP), to study tumor-specific CD4+ T cell responses. The investigators found high frequency of naturally occuring UCP-specific TH1 cells in long term survival of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) previously treated by 5 fluoro-uracil -oxaliplatin (Folfox) +/- bevacizumab regiment (Godet et al. OncoImmunology 2012 and unpublished data). Epitopes-CRC02 is a French prospective multicenter study which will evaluate the post chemotherapy and post surgery modulation of host tumor-specific CD4 TH1 cell responses in metastatic colorectal cancer patients and their correlation with progression-free survival.</brief_summary>
