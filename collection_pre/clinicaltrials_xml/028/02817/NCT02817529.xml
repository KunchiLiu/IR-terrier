	<brief_summary>Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy is a device aiding airway clearance and secretion mobilization, also prevent the small airway from collapsing. The purpose of this research is to compare two PEP devices (Pulmonica, RC-Cornet) in stable COPD patients. Patients' compliance, satisfaction, 3 months and 6 months lung function test and life quality will be compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Positive Expiratory Pressure Devices in Stable COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy is a type of airway clearance therapy in which the patient exhales through a resistance, which helps to shift the pressure points that aid mobilization of sputum and prevent the lung from collapsing. PEP therapy helps patients reduce the need for ventilatory support, improve hyperinflation and dyspnea. Although PEP devices are used, only a few studies have compared their beneficial effects and preference among COPD patients. Objective: The purpose of this research is to compare two PEP devices (Pulmonica, RC-Cornet) in stable COPD patients. . Methods: A baseline assessment of the patient will be taken at the beginning, three months and the end of six months, including patients' ability to clear secretions via Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS), patients' self-reported quality of life via St. George's Respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores, pt's satisfaction with each device, and cardio-pulmonary function via pulmonary function test and six minute walk test in three and six months. Subsequently, patients will be randomly assigned a PEP device (Pulmonica, RC-Cornet) and given instructions on how to properly use the device including frequency of PEP therapy. Each patient will receive a monthly follow-up call in order to determine adherence and satisfaction with PEP therapy, also BCSS, SGRQ and CAT scores.</detailed_description>
