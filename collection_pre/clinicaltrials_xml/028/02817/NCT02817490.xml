	<brief_summary>The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (SED) comprises a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous, inherited connective tissue diseases. The hypermobility type is the most frequent. It is characterized by a generalized joint hypermobility and a hyperextension skin. Chronic pain syndrome is often present. Its psychological impact can be significant (anxiety, depression, impact on the quality of life of the patients). The disease also requires changes and a permanent adaptability (coping). It can lead to feelings of isolation and misunderstanding. The French association of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes and the rehabilitation center of the 'Croix-Rouge Fran√ßaise des Massues' propose a patient education program for the patients with a hypermobility type SED (the PrEduSED program). This education program is open to patients and their caregivers located in France. The research hypothesis is that the PrEduSED program improves their coping and reduces patient anxiety at 6 months (these are the two clinical criteria on which the PrEduSED could have the most impact, given the results of the first sessions).</brief_summary>
