	<brief_title>The Effect of Functional Electrical Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Quadriceps weakness is common following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The inadequate quadriceps strength contributes to altered gait patterns following ACL reconstruction. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to reduce quadriceps atrophy post-ACL reconstruction. However, the effect of functional electrical stimulation (FES), a modulation of NMES which enables quadriceps stimulation synchronized with gait, has not been tested. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of FES to improve the gait pattern of patients post ACL reconstruction. Methods: Fifty six Individuals post-ACL reconstruction will be randomly placed into FES or NMES treatment group. All patients will receive a standard exercise program three sessions weekly. In addition, each group will receive a different electrical stimulation treatment: Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) or Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Outcome measures will include spatiotemporal gait measures (e.g., gait speed, single limb support, and asymmetry index), as well as isometric quadriceps strength. Measures will be taken a week before the surgery, a week after it, and one month from the beginning of rehabilitation. Strength and gait pattern will be measured. Isometric Quadriceps strength will measured using the Biodex isokinetic system, and gait analysis will be carried out through the spatio-temporal Optogait system.</detailed_description>
