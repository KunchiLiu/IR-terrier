	<brief_title>NEWS and Rapid Lactate Testing for Early Identification of High Risk Patients in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. Early identification and early intervention are two main elements in improving patient care. Objectives: 1. To validate the NEWS and rapid lactate testing for early identification of high risk [triage Category 3 (urgent)] patients in the Emergency Department. 2. To compare qSOFA and SIRS criteria in patients in the Emergency Department. Study design: This is a prospective, cohort study. Patients aged 18 or above presenting to the ED triaged as Category 3 (urgent) will be recruited. The required data for calculating NEWS will be collected at triage and triage lactate level will be measured by point-of-care analyzer. Outcomes: The primary outcome is referral for intensive care unit (ICU) admission during the patient's ED stay. The secondary outcomes are length of stay in hospital (LOS), hospital admission, admission to ICU, length of ICU-free admission (defined as days alive outside the ICU from admission to day 30) 30-day mortality and time to processes-of-care.</detailed_description>
