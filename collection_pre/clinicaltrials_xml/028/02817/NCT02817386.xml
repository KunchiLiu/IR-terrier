	<brief_title>Study of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly People After Orthopedic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative delirium is one of the most common postoperative complications in elderly patients.It has been shown that postoperative delirium has independent adverse effects on short and long-term mortality and morbidity, including poor functional recovery, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, deterioration in quality of life, and increased costs. However, at the present time, postoperative delirium is a clinical phenomenon, and its neuropathogenesis remains unknown. This gap in knowledge has become a barrier that limits further studies, including the development of potential interventions for postoperative delirium.</detailed_description>
