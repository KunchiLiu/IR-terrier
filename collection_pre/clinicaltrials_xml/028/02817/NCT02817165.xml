	<brief_summary>In North America, one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in previously healthy children is for the treatment of infections with antibiotics. This study will determine if, in previously healthy children hospitalized and prescribed intravenous (IV) antibiotics, the co-administration of a probiotic milk product containing good bacteria, is safe and effective for reducing AAD, as compared to a placebo (identical appearing milk product). This will be a two-center, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The results of this study will help inform clinicians and families on the use of probiotics in the prevention of AAD, a common side effect of antibiotic use among hospitalized children.</brief_summary>
