	<brief_summary>Purpose: This study outlines the benefits of the proximal tibia angle (PTA) in evaluation of the pre-operative individual condylar twist angle (CTA) in total knee arthroplasty. Methods: Condylar twist angle and proximal tibia angle were obtained from 33 female healthy participants using computed tomography (CT). The CTA, angle between clinical transepicondylar axis and posterior condylar line were measured. The PTA is the angle formed between the mechanical axis of the tibia and tibia plateau line. The correlation between the CTA and the PTA was analyzed statistically with the linear regression.</brief_summary>
