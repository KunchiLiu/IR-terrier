	<brief_title>Low-level Laser Therapy in the Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis in Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to investigate the local effect of adjunct low-level laser therapy (LLLT) for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic periodontitis in type 2 diabetic patients. Twenty poorly-controlled type 2 diabetic patients with moderate to severe generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. Two periodontal pockets with Probing Depth (PD) and Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) ≥ 5mm received ultrasonic periodontal debridement (UPD) only (control group) or UPD with LLLT (test group). Clinical measures, such as PD, CAL, Gingival Recession (GR), Bleeding on Probing (BoP), and Plaque Index (PI), were collected and compared at baseline, 30, 90, and 180 days. The adjunct application of LLLT to UPD had no additional benefits for PD reduction and CAL gain, meaning that both investigated therapies were efficient for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in type 2 diabetics. Nevertheless, additional LLLT application showed better results for GR then UPD only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>age ≥ 35; diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for ≥ 5 years; diabetes treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin supplementation and diet; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from 6.5% to 11%; at least 15 teeth (excluding third molars and teeth indicated for extraction); and moderate to severe generalized chronic periodontitis. The exclusion criteria were: medical conditions that required prophylactic antimicrobial coverage; periodontal mechanical therapy in the previous 6 months; antimicrobial therapies in the previous 6 months; antiinflammatory therapies in the previous 6 months; systemic conditions other than diabetes that could affect the progression of chronic periodontitis; current use of medication that could interfere with periodontal response to treatment; pregnancy or lactation; and smoking.</criteria>
