	<brief_summary>Introduction: Ketamine has been well studied for its efficacy as an analgesic agent. However, intranasal (IN) administration of ketamine has only recently been studied in the emergency setting. Objective: To elucidate the efficacy and adverse effects of a sub-dissociative dose of IN Ketamine compared to IV and IM morphine. Methods: A single-center, randomized, prospective, parallel clinical trial of efficacy and safety of IN ketamine compared to IV and IM morphine for analgesia in the emergency department (ED). A convenience sample of 90 patients aged 18-70 experiencing moderate-severe acute traumatic pain (≥80mm on 100mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) were randomized to receive either 1.0mg/kg IN ketamine, 0.1mg/kg IV MO or 0.15mg/kg IM MO. Pain relief and adverse effects were recorded for 1 hour post-administration. Primary Outcomes: The primary outcome was efficacy of IN ketamine compared to IV and IM MO, measured by "time-to-onset" (defined as a ≥15mm pain decrease on VAS), as well as time to and degree of maximal pain reduction.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients aged 1870 years, with mild to moderate blunt trauma (sustained in road, workplace and home accidents) causing moderate to severe pain (≥ 80mm score on a 100mm Visual Analog Scale=VAS) were eligible for participation in the study. Inclusion criteria also included a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15, body weight of 50110 kg, systolic blood pressure of 90160 mmHg, heart rate &lt;100 bpm. Patients were also required to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 1 or 2, deny head injury, and deny regular use or use of opiates. Any analgesia received within the prior 3 hours, allergic sensitivity to morphine or ketamine, a large meal ingested within the previous hour, pregnancy, deviated nasal septum or trauma to the nose, and a history of a psychiatric condition. Despite evidence that ketamine does not exacerbate intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head trauma, patients with head injury complaining of loss of consciousness, dizziness, vomiting, or nausea were excluded as well.</criteria>
