	<brief_summary>Study is to assess and confirm the adequate immunogenicity and safety profile of the Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-Hep B-IPV-PRP-T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine administered in HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HIV-exposed uninfected) and in HIV-exposed infected infants (HIV-exposed infected). Primary Objectives: - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the 3-dose primary series in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants. - To describe the persistence of all antibodies before receipt of the booster vaccination in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants. - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the booster dose in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants. Secondary Objectives - To describe the safety profile after each and all doses of the study vaccine administered as a 3-dose infant primary series in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants. - To describe the safety profile of the study vaccine administered as a booster in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T Combined Vaccine as a Primary Series and a 2nd Year of Life Booster in HIV-Exposed Infected and Uninfected</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male and female infants born from HIV infected mothers will be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV infection, infected and uninfected infants will be invited at approximately 6 weeks of age to enroll in the trial. They will be enrolled in 2 groups and will receive primary vaccinations with Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age and a booster dose at approximately 15 to 18 months of age will receive a booster dose of the Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(Screening Criteria) At least 18 years of age at the time of the subject's PCR blood sample draw Documented proof of HIV infection in the mother Born to an adult mother and aged 35 to 49 days (between 5 and 7 weeks of age) on the day of inclusion Group A subjects must be HIV infected, as documented through the results of a PCR test, and following an antiretroviral therapy according to the national recommendations; and Group B subjects must be HIV exposed uninfected infants, as documented through the results of a PCR test. Born with a birth weight ≥ 2.5 kg Informed consent form signed by the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and by one independent witness if the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) is illiterate Subject and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational product in the 4 weeks preceding the trial inclusion (receipt of study vaccine) or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Group A subjects diagnosed with a chronic condition, except HIV infection, or any experience of blood or bloodderived products received or experience of thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder; and Group B subjects diagnosed with chronic illness or any experience of blood or bloodderived products received or experience of thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder. Previous vaccination against the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis (oral polio vaccine [OPV] given at birth does not constitute an exclusion criteria), hepatitis B (a birth dose of Hep B vaccine does not constitute an exclusion criteria) diseases or Hib infection with the trial vaccine or another vaccine. Previous vaccination with Bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG) is not considered an exclusion criterion History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (confirmed either clinically, serologically or microbiologically) History of seizures or history of uncontrolled neurologic disorder or uncontrolled epilepsy until treatment for the condition has been established, the condition has stabilized and the benefit clearly outweighs the risk Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Febrile (axillary temperature ≥ 37.4°C) or acute illness on the day of inclusion (temporary contraindication).</criteria>
