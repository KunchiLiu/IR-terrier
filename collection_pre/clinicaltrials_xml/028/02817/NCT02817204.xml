	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of aerobic exercise training on microcirculation rarefaction in Chinese young male primary hypertensive patients stage 1. Hypertension is one of the most common world-wide chronic diseases, and it is showing a growing younger trend, which with mild blood pressure elevated would not be diagnose in time until blood pressure raises up or symptoms show up (Mild blood pressure indicates blood pressures ranging from 140 to 159 mmHg systolic and/or 90 to 99 mmHg diastolic). However, cumulative evidences prove that microvascular rarefaction exist in hypertensive patients with even primary hypertension stage 1. Exercise prescription is gathering great importance in preventive health. Aerobic exercise, especially, has the potential to diminish blood pressure values, and aerobic exercise can promote angiogenesis in coronary heart disease. Notch signaling plays an important role in vascular formation and maintenance. However, there is no prospective, randomized, controlled, clinic trial to investigate the effect of exercise on microcirculation rarefaction in hypertension. In summary, investigators propose a hypothesis that aerobic exercise might not only have a blood pressure lowing effect but also improve microcirculation rarefaction in Chinese male adults with primary mild hypertension. For that, subjects will be enrolled for one pre-intervention cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and then randomized in aerobic exercise intervention group and control group (only health education), the intervention will be carried out by Cycle Ergometer, the protocol consists of 3 sessions a day: 3 minutes Warm up, 45 minutes Resistance Exercise at 75% of HRmax; 10 minutes Recovery. Thus 58 minutes a day and 5 days a week (about 2000kcal) and 12 weeks in total. Prior and after all intervention sessions (12 weeks), nail fold capillary microscopy and retinal capillary Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) angiography will be assessed, as well as 24h blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, forearm blood flow and reactive hyperemia by venous occlusion plethysmography (FMD), PWV, central arterial pressure, RHI with Endopat, also the quantification of endothelial progenistor cells(EPCs) separated from peripheral blood.</brief_summary>
