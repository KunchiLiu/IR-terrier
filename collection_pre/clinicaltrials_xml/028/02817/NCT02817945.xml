	<brief_summary>This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluate the efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD in lung cancer patients. A single dose of 111-185 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Integrin αvβ3 and SSTR2 Targeting PET Imaging in Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of somatostatin receptors may be greatly up-regulated in the cells of a variety of tumor including carcinoids, gastrinomas, paragangliomas, small-cell lung cancer and insulinomas. Octreotide is an eight amino acid cyclic peptide that preserves a four amino acid motif (Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr) that is critical for the biological activity of somatostatin (SSTR). On the other hand, the RGD moiety binds with integrin αvβ3, also plays an important role in the regulation of tumor growth, angiogenesis, local invasiveness, and metastatic potential in human lung cancer. To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide TATE-RGD was synthesized from TATE and RGD through a glutamate linker and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD PET/CT in lung cancer patients.</detailed_description>
