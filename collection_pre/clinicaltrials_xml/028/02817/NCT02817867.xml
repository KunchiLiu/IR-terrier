	<brief_summary>Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is a cerebrovascular disease with high incidence and morbidity in the Brazilian population, and is considered a major cause of disability in adults. Brain damage caused by stroke generates a maladaptive pattern of neural activity and modulation between the cerebral hemispheres, unbalancing in the inter-hemispheric inhibition. This condition affects patient's functional recovery. The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation Association (rTMS) in the cortex motor contralesional, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in the motor cortex ipsilesional and the association between these two types of brain stimulations on the upper limb recovery after stroke.</brief_summary>
