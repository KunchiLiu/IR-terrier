	<brief_summary>The first aim of the study will be to identify the most common ReP pattern and compare its coincidence with that described by Travell and Simons. Second, the study aim will be to verify whether there are any significant differences by sex and types of technique used in regard to the ReP pattern of TrP 2 of the infraspinatus muscle, an area described as more sensitive.Finally, the third aim of the study will be to determine whether deep dry needling will evoke the LTR and ReP more easily than manual palpation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be recruited from a university's employee and student population by advertising at the university. Patients with shoulder complaints (described as pain felt in the shoulder or upper arm) will be randomly assigned to either an manual palpation or deep dry needling group. Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups, a deep dry needling group and manual palpation group. Visual analogue scale (VAS), referred pain (ReP) pattern and features of referred pain of the infraspinatus muscle will be all assessed post-technique.</detailed_description>
