	<brief_summary>This study examines how online self-guided programs can improve mood and anxiety symptoms. These programs use exercises from Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, which is an evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study is to learn who will do best with the online format. Our aim is to learn for whom online self-guided interventions are most efficacious. This knowledge is important because it will help inform clinicians and patients about who might benefit from this type of intervention versus who would need the assistance of a therapist. More specifically, we hope to figure out who would benefit from solely an online intervention and who would benefit from an online intervention in addition to other treatment.</brief_summary>
