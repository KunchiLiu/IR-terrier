	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery is emerging as an essential treatment option for the management of obesity and its associated comorbidities. Many patients present for surgery have pre-existing low blood vitamin levels, thus all bariatric surgical procedures compromise nutrition to varying extents, and may present potential threat of micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore, long term nutritional monitoring and follow-ups are vital components of all bariatric surgical patients. However, there are no current standard practices in United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the biochemical monitoring and replacement of essential micronutrients in patients undergoing bariatric surgery particularly the most performed Sleeve Gastrectomy. Medical practice guidelines recommend nutritional care however, the dose and route of administration supplementation after surgery based on randomized controlled trials is not yet established. Till tow no scientific study has been performed on monitoring vitamins and minerals levels following bariatric surgery among UAE population. Therefore, present study is aimed to determine the dose and route of administration of vitamins and minerals in improving the micronutrient deficiencies post-operatively. Two standard different dosage forms (oral /parenteral) of vitamins and minerals will be given to the patients who had undergone sleeve gastrectomy at Tawam Hospital. The dosages of the supplementations are within the international recommendations and patients will be followed up closely for a period of one year. The effect of nutritional deficiencies on micronutrient level and quality of life (QOL) will be assessed. This will help the medical practitioners to prove the optimal possible nutrition for patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in Tawam Hospital where patients come for their routine bariatric surgery. A written informed consent will be taken from all the patients willing to participate in the study. Patients would be informed about the objectives / goals of the study.</detailed_description>
