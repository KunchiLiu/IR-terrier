	<brief_title>A Reduction in Time With Electronic Monitoring In Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background For the clinical benefit of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) time is the most crucial factor. Reducing the time between stroke onset and treatment is therefore a major goal in acute stroke care. The delay from first moment the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatch office is alarmed and initiation of treatment (IVT and/or IAT), i.e. 'total system delay' (TSD), depends greatly on logistics and collaboration between various caregivers in this trajectory. A promising method to improve workflow and thereby aiming to reduce TSD is to provide real-time visual feedback to caregivers. Methods The A Reduction in Time with Electronic Monitoring In Stroke (ARTEMIS) trial is a multiregional, multicenter, prospective randomized open end-point trial to investigate the intervention of real-time visual feedback to caregivers reduces TSD to IVT/IAT. The intervention compromises real-time visual feedback to caregivers on actual treatment delay for each individual patient. Randomization for the intervention will be done through alternating calendar periods (i.e. with or without real-time visual feedback). Study procedures Patients will receive a unique wristband emitting a low-voltage Bluetooth signal (activated after being opened by EMS personnel at the time of ambulance dispatch), which will be automatically picked up by handhelds in the ambulance and by pre-mounted in-hospital tablets en route to treatment with IVT and/or IAT. In calendar weeks with the intervention, the handhelds and tablets will provide caregivers with real-time visual feedback on actual treatment time delays for the patient they are transferring. Furthermore, a colour coded feedback (green or red) will provide an easy-view visualization on whether or not pre-set median time delays between locations are exceeded. TSD to IVT/IAT starts at the moment the dispatch office issues an ambulance for a patient that is potentially eligible for IVT/IAT. TSD ends at the moment IVT/IAT is given. For TSD to IVT this will be the moment the bolus of intravenous alteplase is administered, and for TSD to IAT the puncture of the groin and the moment reperfusion is established. These endpoints will be registered using a real-life push button on the CT-ward/neuro-care unit or in the catheterization room, respectively. After treatment, during the first 24-48 hours of admission to the hospital, informed consent will be asked from the patient or legal representative for the collection of anonymous clinical data from the Electronic Patient Recording (EPR) and to assess clinical outcome with the modified Rankin Score (mRS) after three months by an observer blinded to treatment allocation. Statistical Analysis For the primary analysis and all secondary analyses involving endpoints with time intervals, the difference in time delays between calendar weeks with and without intervention will be calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The investigators will perform subgroup analysis for IAT patients with- or without prior IVT. Subsequently the investigators will use linear regression analysis to adjust for EMS region and for location of treatment as this is expected to affect TSD to IVT/IAT. In additional regression analysis the investigators will assess if there is an effect of time on TSD and whether such an effect is group dependent. The total number of times the ambulance drives to a patient for suspected acute stroke will be used to calculate the proportion of patients with a discharge diagnosis of stroke and the total number of IVT/IAT treated patients will be used to calculate IVT/IAT rates during treatment or control weeks. Exploratory analysis will be performed to relate TSD to clinical outcome in each group. Sample size estimates Sample size calculation is based on the hypothesis of an at least 20-minute reduction of TSD to IAT and an at least 10 minute reduction of TSD to IVT. The investigators think these reductions are feasible based on data from "MR CLEAN" (n=500) in which the standard deviation of TSD to IAT was 40 minutes, and of TSD for IVT standard deviation was 35 minutes.3 Moreover, experience the investigators have with reducing in-hospital delays for IVT and experience from a recent Dutch study that managed to reduce TSD for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with 40 minutes (180 to 140 minutes) with real-time visual feedback (manuscript in preparation) support the view that these goals are realistic. Also, during a run-in phase the investigators will collect additional data on treatment delays to adjust the sample size calculation if appropriate. For now the investigators will use (unpublished) data from the "MR CLEAN" trial. In the "MR CLEAN" trial (n=500), the mean TSD to IAT in 233 patients was 256 minutes (SD: 40 minutes). To detect a 20-minute difference with a p-value of 0.05, and a power of 0.8 the investigators will need 63 patients in each arm. To increase power, the investigators will aim at including 75 patients with IAT in each arm. For the co-primary outcome, the TSD to IVT, in the "MR CLEAN" trial the mean TSD for IVT was 90 minutes (SD: 35 minutes). To detect a 10-minute difference with a p-value of 0.05, and a power of 0.8 the investigators will need 193 IVT treated patients in each arm. In clinical practice approximately 9% patients for whom the dispatch office sends out an ambulance will end up being treated with IVT. Of these patients approximately 30% will be eligible for IAT and included for our primary endpoint. Therefore the investigators expect that for the inclusion of 150 IAT patients ending up being treated with IAT a wristband will have to be unpacked by ambulance personnel approximately 5000 times. Of these, approximately 500 patients will end up being treated with IVT; subsequently, from this population around 150 patients will be treated with IAT.</detailed_description>
