	<brief_title>The Risk Factors of Symptomatic Gallbladder Stone: Age-Sex Matched Case-control Study Performed in Single Institute</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators performed the epidemiologic study to uncover the reason of relatively higher incidence of Gallbladder cancer in small isolated island, Jeju island, one of small province among 11 self governing area in South Korea. Tow studies, including descriptive epidemiology and analytic epidemiology using case-control study, some risk factors were obtained regarding Gallbladder cancer development in this area. Old age, female, and gallstone were potential risk factors and alcohol consumption was preventive factors. So authors decided to evaluate the relationship between alcohol and gallbladder stone in order to how much portion of causal relationship they have with gallbladder cancer. So this study was designed to investigate the relationship between gallbladder stone and alcohol consumption then performed clinical based case-control study with age-sex matching to each subjects.</detailed_description>
