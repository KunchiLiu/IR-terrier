	<brief_summary>To quantify the severity of psoriasis in a consistent and clinically meaningful way is important in order to decide the therapeutic orientation to take for the patient. PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scoring is recognised as gold standard for psoriasis assessment. The bodystudio ATBM (Automatic Total Body Mapping) is a high-tech system performing standardized photos from head to feet and from all angles, which allows to map the entire skin covering all the human body in a few minutes.The primary objective of this study would be to evaluate the ability of the bodystudio ATBM to calculate the PASI score of patients with psoriasis human body in a few minutes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition resulting in a significant impact on patients' quality of life. To quantify the severity of psoriasis in a consistent and clinically meaningful way is important in order to decide the therapeutic orientation to take for the patient. PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scoring is recognised as gold standard for psoriasis assessment. However the measure of the PASI score is very complex. Given this complexity, the PASI is influenced by inter and intra-rater variation. In addition the PASI assessment process is time consuming. The bodystudio ATBM (Automatic Total Body Mapping) is a high-tech system performing standardized photos from head to feet and from all angles, which allows to map the entire skin covering all the human body in a few minutes. The mapping of the entire body is automatically done by the use of a digital camera performing 20 pictures of the patient with 8 successive positions. The system is coupled to a software of automatic analysis of these pictures for the measure of the PASI score. The primary objective of this study would be to evaluate the ability of the bodystudio ATBM to calculate the PASI score of patients with psoriasis</detailed_description>
