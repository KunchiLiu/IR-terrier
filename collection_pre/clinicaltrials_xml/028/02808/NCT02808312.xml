	<criteria>Key Cohort 1: Individuals with mildly impaired and normal hepatic function. Individuals with mild hepatic impairment must have a score of 56 on the CPT Classification at Screening without evidence of worsening clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment within 2 months prior or within the screening period. Cohort 2: Individuals with moderately impaired and normal hepatic function. Individuals with moderate hepatic impairment must have a score of 79 on the CPT Classification at Screening without evidence of worsening clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment within 2 months prior or within the screening period. Cohort 3: Individuals with severely impaired and normal hepatic function. Individuals with severe hepatic impairment must have a score of 1015 on the CPT Classification at Screening without evidence of worsening clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment within 2 months prior or within the screening period.
