	<brief_summary>Pharmacokinetic model to predict interaction between tacrolimus and mycophenolate was developed through clinical trial with healthy volunteer. The purpose of this study is to confirm predictability of developed pharmacokinetic model in kidney transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Population Pharmacokinetic Model Derived From Healthy Volunteer in Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants take their immunosuppressant as usual. One day, blood is drawn at predose and 1, 2, 3, 4-hour postdose to compare observed concentration with model-predicted concentration of tacrolimus and mycophenolate.</detailed_description>
