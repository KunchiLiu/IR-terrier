	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare three strategies for finding TB cases in a rural Sub-Saharan African setting: 1) Screening all attendees of primary care clinics for TB; 2) Conducting household contact investigations of newly diagnosed TB cases; 3) Providing incentives to newly diagnosed TB cases and their contacts to promote contact screening for TB. For each intervention, investigators will measure comparative effectiveness in terms of cases identified as well as the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of implementation.</brief_summary>
