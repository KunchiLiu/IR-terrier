	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to to compare the long-term effects of foam rolling in comparison to static stretching and a control group on hamstring flexibility. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the foam rolling and static stretching group will demonstrate increased flexibility to the control group, but will a difference will not be observed between the foam rolling and static stretching groups.</brief_summary>
