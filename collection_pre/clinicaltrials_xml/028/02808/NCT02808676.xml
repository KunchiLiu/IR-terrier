	<detailed_description>Exercises, specifically resistance and aerobic training, have been demonstrated to improve cognitive outcomes, along with improved physical capacity and mobility. Both aerobic and resistance training trials of different duration have revealed positive results, with the most consistent findings being observed after combined interventions of 6 months to one year. Although the training benefits of progressive resistance training (PRT) have been well documented, PRT has been studied far less extensively in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Exercise training has proven to be beneficial for cognition even in vulnarable populations like in frail older adults, and those with mobility issues. The exact mechanism supporting the benefits of exercise for cognition in humans needs to be further explored, as numerous studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that aerobic exercise may have neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects. The rationale of combining aerobic and PRT as multimodal exercise intervention is supported by research that has revealed potential beneficial effects. In addition, multimodal exercise interventions have shown positive effects on muscle/lean mass, cognition and brain structure, functionality, and brain volume. Similarly cognitive training, i.e. computer based cognitive process training, has also shown positive results in improving cognition, mobility, and postural control. Several recent systematic reviews on the topic support the benefits of cognitive training. In line with exercise training, recent research on cognitive training has also supported important improvements in brain plasticity post-intervention. Finally, Vitamin D3 deficiency in older adults has been linked to cognitive dysfunction, dementia, and mobility decline. Besides its very well-known effects on muscle and bone physiology, several studies have shown a potential beneficial role of Vitamin D3 on cognitive function. Robustly designed trials, with longitudinal follow-up, have been recommended in older adults with MCI to investigate the comparative benefits of isolated Vitamin D3 supplementation, and combined with physical and cognitive training. To date, the effect of adding cognitive training and/or Vitamin D3 to a multimodal progressive exercise training for improving global cognition, executive function, memory, and gait in MCI has not been assessed.</detailed_description>
