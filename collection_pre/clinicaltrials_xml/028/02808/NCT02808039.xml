	<brief_title>Is There a Transient Rebound Effect of Platelet Reactivity Following Cessation of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Ticagrelor - a Single Center Prospective Observational Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the study will be composed of a cohort of patients , who completed 12 months of DAPT with Ticagrelor (standard recommended dose for ACS - 90 mg BID), did not experience any clinical or adverse event during this time period and are about to discontinue Ticagrelor. We intend to measure the platelet reactivity for each patient on 4 time points - prior to cessation of Ticagrelor (i.e. while still on DAPT) and 1,4 and 12 weeks post discontinuation of therapy. There will not be a control group.</detailed_description>
