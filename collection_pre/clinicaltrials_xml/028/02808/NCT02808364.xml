	<brief_summary>The treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma is limited. Immune cell based therapy for glioblastoma has shown some efficacy. This study is designed to perform a personalized clinical trial by first analyzing the expression of tumor associated antigens in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and then immunizing the patients with personalized cellular vaccines including autologous tumor cells, antigen pulsed DCs and allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Safety and efficacy will be observed in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Cellular Vaccine for Recurrent Glioblastoma (PERCELLVAC2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I/II study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular vaccines for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Recurrent GBM patients will undergo tumor resection. The tumors will be analyzed for the expression of a panel of glioma-associated antigens and immune-related genes. The tumor cells will be irradiated and used as vaccines. Patients will undergo leukapheresis to collect mononuclear cells for DC generation. Based on the expression profiles of tumor-associated antigens, in vitro transcribed mRNA will be generated to pulse autologous DCs or allogeneic PBMCs. Patients will be conditioned with immune adjuvants before and during immunization. Patients will receive a total of twelve vaccines consisting of autologous tumor cells, DCs or PBMCs. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The primary objective is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines. The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of the vaccines using iRANO criteria, progression-free survival and overall survival. In addition, the antitumor specific T cell responses will be measured.</detailed_description>
