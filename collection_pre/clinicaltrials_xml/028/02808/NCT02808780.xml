	<brief_title>An Observational Prospective Long-term Exposure Registry of Adult Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational prospective long-term exposure registry of adult participants with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Two cohorts, a Simponi-exposed cohort and a comparator cohort treated with thiopurines, will be enrolled in study. Approximately 6,000 participants are planned for enrollment, with 3,000 participants in the Simponi-exposed cohort and 3,000 participants in the comparator cohort. Participants will receive treatments in a routine clinical setting as prescribed by their physician. After enrollment, during the 10-year follow-up period, a participant may stop his or her ulcerative colitis treatment regimen and switch to a new treatment regimen. Lymphoma incidence will be primarily assessed by a questionnaire that will be sent to the investigator to obtain complete medical information about each case. An expert panel of medical specialists with extensive experience in lymphoma will be convened to validate cases of lymphoma. Besides assessing the incidence of lymphoma, long-term safety will be evaluated by capturing other adverse events of interest and serious adverse events.</detailed_description>
