	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluated the effect of initial periodontal treatment on clinical findings and receptor activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients with osteoporosis under bisphosphonate therapy within 12 months' follow-up. Clinical recordings and GCF were obtained from postmenopausal women; with chronic periodontitis and osteoporosis (Group A, n=13), with chronic periodontitis and no osteoporosis (Group B, n=12), without chronic periodontitis and osteoporosis (Group C, n=12), systemically and periodontally healthy controls (Group D, n=10) at the baseline. Recordings were repeated at the 1st, 6th and 12th months in Group A, B and C. RANKL and OPG values were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study groups were selected from postmenopausal patients those referred to Department of Endocrinology, School of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed by dual energy-X-ray absorptiometry from L1-L4 site of lumbar vertebra and/or femur (g/cm2). Osteoporosis was defined as T scores less than -2.5 at L1-L4, femur neck or total femur. Women with T scores less than -2.5 (groups A and C) were started on bisphosphonate treatment after their initial periodontal examination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women with T scores less than 2.5 (groups A and C) The periodontitis patients were selected based on the radiographical evidence of bone loss, presence of four or more sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), ≥5 mm pocket depth (PD) and ≥6 mm clinical attachment loss (CAL). The clinically healthy control groups were selected on the basis of no radiographic bone loss or CAL and PD≤3 mm. Any known systemic disease rather than osteoporosis Smoking Antibiotic therapy within the last 3 months Periodontal treatment within the last 6 months.</criteria>
