	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patient between 18 and 85 years old Patient currently on hemodialysis and planned creation of an upper extremity AV fistula with suitable anatomy Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior to surgery (Day 0) Other hematological and biochemical parameters within a range consistent with ESRD and acceptable for the administration of general anesthesia prior to day 1 Adequate liver function, defined as serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; GGT, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2x upper limit of normal or INR ≤ 1.5 prior to day 1 or INR ≤ 2 (2.5 certain conditions) if on anticoagulant therapy. Ability to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, competence to give written informed consent, and ability to comply with entire study procedures Life expectancy of at least 24 months Exclusion Criteria History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (NYHA Functional Class III or IV), myocardial infarction within 6 months of entry, ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring continuing treatment, or unstable angina Significant uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg) History or evidence of severe peripheral vascular disease in the upper limbs or known or suspected central vein obstruction on the side of planned fistula creation Stroke within six (6) months of study entry Treatment with vitamin Kantagonists or direct thrombin inhibitors with an INR ≥ 2 Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 6 months Immunodeficiency including AIDS / HIV or Active autoimmune disease Documented hypercoagulable state or history of 2 or more DVTs or other spontaneous intravascular thrombotic events Bleeding diathesis or Gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding, or wound dehiscence A prothrombin time or a partial thromboplastin time more than 1.2 times the upper limit of normal, or absolute platelet counts below the lower limit of normal; an absolute neutrophil count below 1,500/mm3 Active local or systemic infection (WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3) or anemia with a hematocrit less than 30% Previous autogenous fistula in the operative limb unless the AVF can be placed more proximally than previous failed fistula or more than 1 failed AVF in the operative limb Known serious allergy to aspirin or penicillin Pregnancy or breast feeding Treatment with any investigational drug/ device within 60 days prior to study entry or Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AMSCs and the AVF Employees of the sponsor or patients who are employees or relatives of the investigator</criteria>
