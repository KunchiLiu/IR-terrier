	<brief_title>Phase ll Study of Pirfenidone in Patients With RAILD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of pirfenidone for the treatment of RA associated interstitial lung disease. Approximately 270 subjects will be randomized to receive Pirfenidone 2403 mg per day or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome of this study is to assess the efficacy of pirfenidone 2403 mg/day versus placebo in patients with RA associated interstitial lung disease, as defined by progression free survival over the 52 weeks of treatment. Patients will receive blinded study treatment from the time of randomization until the Week 52 Visit. Eligible patients aged 18 to 85 years must meet 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA (Aletaha, Neogi et al. 2010) as well as RA-associated ILD, as determined by imaging and, when available, lung biopsy. Patients will be required to have a % predicted FVC ≥40 and ≤80 and % predicted DLCO ≥30 and ≤80 at screening. The dose of study treatment will be titrated over 14 days. Patients will receive a telephone assessment at Week 1 and visit the clinic at Weeks 2, 4, 13, 16, 26, 39, and 52. Patients should complete a compliance diary between visits. If patients discontinue study treatment for any reason before the end of the study, they should continue with all scheduled study procedures through Week 52. If subjects are unable to complete the study visits as scheduled, all efforts should be made to complete an early termination visit. The primary outcome variable of this study will be progression free survival, defined as progression free from decline in FVC of 10% or greater during the 52 week study period.</detailed_description>
