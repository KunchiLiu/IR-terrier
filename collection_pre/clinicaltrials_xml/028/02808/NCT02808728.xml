	<brief_summary>Does the use of periarticular Exparel in total knee arthroplasty prove to more effectively manage post operative pain control than another local analgesic, Ropivacaine, when both are used as part of a multimodal pain management approach? The investigators hypothesize that Exparel, a bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension, will improve total knee arthroplasty postoperative pain with significant improvement of early function outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators use a double blind, controlled, randomized study to examine the effectiveness of periarticular Exparel in total knee arthroplasty postoperative pain control as well as effect on early mobilization and length of hospital stay when compared to another local analgesic (Ropivacaine) when both are used as part of a multimodal pain management approach.</detailed_description>
