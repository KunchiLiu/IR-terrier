	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether neuroimaging-based markers of maladaptive self-focused processing are better predictors of treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy than behavioral markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Correlates of Self-Focused Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First, the investigators propose to identify the neural correlates of self-focused processing. The investigators will assess baseline resting state connectivity within the default network, as well as regional brain activation using a well-validated event-related fMRI task that manipulates self-focused processing in patients with body dysmorphic and socially anxious symptoms, compared to healthy controls. This clinical sample was selected because such patients display heightened self-focused attention, and sampling individuals across these symptom dimensions will ensure greater variability on this dimension of maladaptive self-focused processing. Second, the investigators will examine the neural correlates of self-focused processing as a predictor of treatment response. Neuroimaging data will be acquired from patients with body dysmorphic and socially anxious symptoms during two scan sessions, before and after 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy, and compared with healthy controls scanned twice at a 12 week interval. Finally, the investigators will compare the prediction of treatment response between neural measures and behavioral measures of self-focused processing. The investigators will assess the behavioral correlates of self-focused processing using a self-reference effect paradigm, and assess their relation to treatment response. If the investigators hypotheses are borne out, the investigators will have new targets for treatment, a method to identify promising candidates for treatment, and sensitive surrogate markers of treatment response.</detailed_description>
