	<brief_summary>The number of cardiac angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) has increased steadily in recent years. This has resulted in the increasing incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Major risk factors for CIN include older age, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease(CKD), the concurrent use of nephrotoxic drugs, hemodynamic instability, etc. Importantly, DM appears to act as a risk multiplier, meaning that in a patient with CKD it amplifies the risk of CIAKI. The aim of this multicenter prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate whether berberine treatment during and after the perioperative period would reduce the risk of CIN in a high-risk population of patients with both DM and CKD undergoing coronary angiography or noncoronary angiography, and the influence of such potential benefit on short-term outcome.</brief_summary>
