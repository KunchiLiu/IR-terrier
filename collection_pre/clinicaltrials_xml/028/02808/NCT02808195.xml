	<brief_summary>The aims of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinect-based upper limb motor rehabilitation system (ULMTS) program on motor performance and functional outcomes. The specific aims of this study project will be: To compare the effectiveness of intervention groups using Kinect-based ULMTS with constraint-induced therapy on motor improvement in children with hemiplegic CP. The investigators hypothesize that motor improvement in using Kinect-based ULMTS will be comparable to constraint-induced therapy.</brief_summary>
