	<brief_summary>Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, kidney failure and stroke. Disparities in HTN prevalence, treatment and control in the US have persisted for decades. The prevalence of HTN is 44% among Blacks, which is among the highest rates in the world. Those in ethnic/racial, rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged and other medically underserved populations are known to have the worst blood pressure (BP) control. Awareness of, treatment for, and control of HTN is not optimal, and varies according to race, whereby BP is controlled in ~53% of non-Latino Whites, 42% of non-Latino Blacks and only 34% of Latinos. Fundamental underlying differences in the pathophysiology contribute to HTN among different race groups. The United States (US) 2014 HTN recommendations outline race-based pharmacotherapy care for HTN. However, these recommendations use race-based population assumptions for Whites and Blacks only, do not include Latino ethnicity and have no accompanying guidelines or tools for successful implementation, particularly in rural primary care practices where disparate populations are common. Moreover, these recommendations only apply to initial therapy and lack guidance on subsequent regimen selection. The Optimizing Precision of HTN Care to Maximize BP Control Pilot (OPTI-BP Pilot), will directly address a long known and growing health disparity concern in the US which includes higher rates of death from CHD and stroke among Blacks and the poorest rates of HTN control among Latinos. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, the overarching goal of OPTI-BP Pilot is to test, using a pragmatic trial design, a personalized, algorithmic-based HTN management approach focused on age, race, biomarker (plasma renin activity) and treatment factors. The investigators hypothesize that implementation of a precision-based approach to the care of HTN in the community will improve BP reduction and ultimately reduce risk for CHD, stroke and death among those most affected by HTN.OPTI-BP Pilot is significant because it will utilize an innovative, systematic, precision-focused HTN management approach in an underserved, diverse population where BP control is currently suboptimal and lays the infrastructure groundwork for broad implementation across all areas of the US to minimize HTN related disparities and improve HTN outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OPTImizing Precision of Hypertension Care to Maximize Blood Pressure Control Pilot (OPTI-BP Pilot)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to develop pilot data to support a more precise way to treat high blood pressure based on an individual person's specific characteristics. Information from a blood test called plasma renin activity will be entered into an on-line app that may more precisely determine which medication should be used to treat high blood pressure than random selection. Renin is a substance in the body that is known to affect your blood pressure. By measuring plasma renin activity, and using that to select a blood pressure lowering medication it may help to more precisely select medications based on how an individual will respond.</detailed_description>
