	<brief_summary>Ablation of atrial fibrillation is an established method for treatment of subjects with atrial fibrillation with goal of restoration of sinus rhythm. Among different methods, wide area circular ablation (WACA) is shown to provide the same results with fewer complications. This project will compare WACA with extra-wide area circular ablation (E-WACA) in subjects who are considered for ablation of atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
