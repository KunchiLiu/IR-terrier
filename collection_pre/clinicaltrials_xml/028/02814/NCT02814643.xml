	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Potential Effect of Benralizumab on the Humoral Immune Response to the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in Adolescent and Young Adult Patients With Severe Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to investigate the potential effect of benralizumab on the antibody response to the seasonal influenza virus vaccine in patients 12-21 years of age with asthma. Benralizumab will be given subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 weeks, at which time benralizumab levels will reach steady state. Patients will then receive 1 dose of intramuscular (IM) seasonal influenza virus vaccine at Week 8 and samples drawn at Week 8 and Week 12 to measure the antibody response to the influenza virus</detailed_description>
