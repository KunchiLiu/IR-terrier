	<brief_title>Predictive Values of Serum Adiponectin Levels in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adiponectin (APN) is an abundant protein hormone derived from adipose tissue. It has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, and vascular protective. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) comprises about 5% of all strokes with high mortality and permanent disability rates. Although many patients survive from the initial hemorrhage or rebleeding, they suffered from long-term delayed neurological deficits (DNDs), including stroke, delayed cerebral ischemia, cognitive and neuropsychological abnormalities that seriously impact overall function and quality of life. Ruptured cerebral aneurysms are the most common cause of SAH. There is growing evidence supporting APN act as a predictive factor for SAH. The observational study will focus on the predictive value of serum adiponectin levels in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).</detailed_description>
