	<brief_summary>Action slowing has been demonstrated in many diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) are two neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia, particularly the medial globus pallidus, and the clinical expression of these two diseases is characterized by a combination of motor and cognitive disorders, but with two opposing patterns of dysfunction. Action slowing has been demonstrated in both of these diseases and has been extensively studied in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a perceptive-cognitive origin. Far fewer studies have been conducted in Huntington's disease. However, all of these studies were performed with different methodologies in small cohorts and the value of the proposed study is to use a validated and standardized computerized mental chronometry paradigm, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of action slowing in these two diseases and to more clearly define a disease-specific profile.</brief_summary>
