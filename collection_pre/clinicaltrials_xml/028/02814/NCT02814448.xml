	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test two innovative devices, the CryoPen® and thermocoagulator, against gas-based cryotherapy to determine whether the novel devices produce equivalent or improved destruction of cervical tissue compared to gas-based cryotherapy. Tissue destruction with single freeze versus double freeze treatments with the CryoPen and gas-based cryotherapy will also be compared.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of the study are to test the hypothesis that the CryoPen® and thermocoagulator provide a non-inferior depth of cervical tissue necrosis compared with traditional CO2-based cryotherapy and to test single versus double freeze applications. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine if the CryoPen® or thermocoagulator achieves a depth of necrosis of 3.5 mm, the accepted depth required for eradicating 95% of cervical precancer, and to observe the relationship between depth of necrosis and variations in cervical anatomy.</detailed_description>
