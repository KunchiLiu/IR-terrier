	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the contribution of multimodal high-resolution EEG-NIRS electrical and local haemodynamic analysis (HR-EEG, HR-NIRS) to spatial localization of epileptogenic foci in order to perform multimodal mapping and localization of interictal spikes (by HR-EEG source reconstruction) with the clinical prospects of guiding the SEEG electrode implantation strategy prior to surgery in children with drug-refractory partial epilepsy.</brief_summary>
