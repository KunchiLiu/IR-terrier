	<brief_summary>The investigator put forward the hypothesis that liver fat mass in patients with pituitary gland failure is greater than that in a control population. Failure of the anterior pituitary and more particularly impaired production of growth hormone (GH) could be the principal mechanism responsible for increased liver fat mass in these patients.</brief_summary>
