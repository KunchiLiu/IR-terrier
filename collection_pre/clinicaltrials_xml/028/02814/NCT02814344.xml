	<brief_summary>The original aspect of the methodology proposed for this study concerns the use of as many as 16 electrodes to study the propagation and coordination (or synchronization) of uterine contraction. Over the last two years, the Compi√®gne University of Technology and the University of Reykjavik (Iceland) teams have developed the tools required to obtain good quality signals during electrohysterography and have worked on filtering and mapping of uterine electrical activity derived from these signals.</brief_summary>
