	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Baker's yeast extractions , probiotic antioxidant, in scavenging the oxidative stress status mediated damage on sperm motility,progressive motility and vitality as well as comparing this potency to that of Vitamin E in infertile men.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The practical part of the study took place from August 2015 to May 2016. The Study population was made up of infertile males attending Hawaa fertility center, banha city, Qaliubiya, Egypt. 40 study samples were collected from patients who indicated willingness to participate in the study and have had 3 to 7 days of sexual abstinence, using the masturbation method and ejaculated in wide mouthed plastic container as described by World Health Organization (WHO). Samples were allowed to liquefy for 20 minutes and were examined for volume, viscosity, spermatozoa count by Neubauer haemocytometer , oxidative stress level measurement by Oxisperm, percentage of progressive motility and non-progressive motility and sperm vitality. The Semen specimens were divided into ten equal fractions. First fraction was control, 0.1ml of liquefied semen mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10 medium and incubated at 37o C for 30 minutes., 2nd, 3rd, 4th fractions (Vit. E 1,2,3), 0.1ml liquefied semen was mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10 medium supplemented with (1, 2, 5 mg/ml) Vitamin E respectively and 5th, 6th, 7th parts fractions (Yeast extraction ( YE) 1,2,3), 0.1ml liquefied semen was mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10 medium supplemented with (10, 20, 50 mg/ml) Yeast extraction and incubated at 37o C for 30 minutes. Vitamin C was obtained from (Sigma, Germany), 8th, 9th, 10th fractions (Vit. C. 1,2,3), 0.1ml liquefied semen was mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10 medium supplemented with (0.02, 0.04, 0.06 mg/ml) Vitamin C respectively and incubated at 37o C for 30 minutes. After semen specimen treated in all fractions, they were examined and assessed for microscopical changes, total motility, progressive motility, vitality, level of oxidative stress (OS) were detected in all fractions 30 minutes later after addition of the antioxidants.</detailed_description>
