	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score (MSFC) is one of the gold standard for multiple sclerosis (MS) patient clinical evaluation. However, its practical implementation is not always optimal as it can prove to be very time consuming. Moreover, it often constrains the range of tests used and is not a particularly good marker for patient real life disability status. A mobile application called Digital Self-Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (DAM) was developed in order to replicate each of MSFC tests available in order to assess MS progression in the patient environment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MSFC Versus DAM. A Smartphone Application for Multiple Sclerosis Self-assessment.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are selected during a consultation at the Neurology department of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (France). Each patient is given access to DAM on their own or a provided iPhone. During the enrolment visit, patients have to complete a MSFC and DAM evaluation (V0). Through a push-notification on their phone, patients are reminded to perform two DAM evaluations at home at days 30 (V1) and 60 (V2). At day 90 (V3), they have to come back to hospital for a second MSFC and DAM evaluation</detailed_description>
