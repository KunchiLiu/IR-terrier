	<brief_summary>Carbohydrate ingestion, in particular fructose, has been shown in a handful of previous studies to elicit a thermic effect and increase core body temperature after ingestion. Carbohydrate foods and supplements are commonly consumed prior to endurance running competition, including situations where an athlete's ability to dissipate body heat is compromised. Thus, there is some potential for pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion to have a deleterious effect on body heat regulation in hot and humid environments. Thus, this projects aims to study the effects of pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion on core body temperature, perceived thermal stress, and perceived exertion during high-intensity running.</brief_summary>
