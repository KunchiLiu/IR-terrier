	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab when given in combination with radium-223 dichloride in participants with metastatic CRPC who have progressed after treatment with an androgen pathway inhibitor. An adaptive design is planned to first investigate the tolerability with concurrent administration (both treatments to begin in Cycle 1). However, if the combination is not tolerated, additional cohorts may be enrolled to evaluate the tolerability of radium-223 dichloride (to begin in Cycle 1) with delayed atezolizumab (to begin in Cycle 2 and/or 3).</brief_summary>
