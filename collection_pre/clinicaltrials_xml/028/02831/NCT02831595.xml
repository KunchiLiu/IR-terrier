	<brief_summary>Modern knee implants combine several types of metal and therefore potentially expose patients to different metal ions. Titanium niobium nitride coating (TiNbN) acts like a physical barrier against the corrosion process and the metallic ions release towards the surrounding biologic environment, thus, making TiNbN-coated prostheses possible to be safety implanted in metal sensitized patients. The aim of the study is to verify that the postoperative plasma metal concentrations at 1 year are not different than preoperative values.</brief_summary>
