	<brief_title>Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation and Gene Therapy Before Nivolumab for Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of in situ gene therapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) used as a window of opportunity treatment before nivolumab in patients with metastatic squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In situ gene therapy will consist of adenovirus-mediated expression of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (ADV/HSV-tk) plus Valacyclovir therapy. Male or female patients aged ≥18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic squamous or non-squamous NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy or on or after immune checkpoint therapy are eligible to participate in the study. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations are eligible only if they have had disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations. ADV/HSV-tk (5 x 1011 viral particles) in a 2-mL total volume will be injected intratumorally on day 0 of the study. Valacyclovir will be orally administered at a dose of 2 g three times daily for 14 days. Valacyclovir treatment will be administered 24 hours after the gene vector injection from day 1 to day 15 of the study. SBRT of 30 gray (Gy; 6 Gy X 5 fractions) will be administered over 2 weeks from day 2 to day 16 of the study. Nivolumab (240 mg) will be administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks starting on day 17 of the study and continuing until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint will be the objective response rate (ORR) of ADV/HSV-tk + Valacyclovir therapy in combination with SBRT used as a window of opportunity treatment before nivolumab in patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous NSCLC. Both RECIST 1.1 and modified immune-related response criteria (irRC; derived from RECIST 1.1) will be used to assess treatment response. Secondary endpoints will include a) duration of response (DoR); b) overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates; c) safety and toxicity (toxicity will be defined as any treatment-related death or any ≥ grade 3 toxicity excluding alopecia and constitutional symptoms as assessed by the NCI CTCAE v4.03); and d) immune-mediated antitumor activity (assessed by RECIST 1.1 and modified irRC) of ADV/HSV-tk plus Valacyclovir therapy in combination with SBRT used as a window of opportunity treatment before nivolumab.</detailed_description>

WOCBP and men must practice an effective method of birth control Signed informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from patients after they have been fully informed of the nature and potential risks of the study by the investigator (or his/her designee) with the aid of written information. Willing to provide biopsies as required by the study. Prior treatment with gene therapy. Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, RT, or immunotherapy or any investigational drug within 3 weeks of study treatment start.
