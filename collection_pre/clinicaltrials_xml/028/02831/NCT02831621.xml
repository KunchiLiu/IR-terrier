	<brief_summary>Excess ectopic fat deposition is associated with development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This study investigates how lifestyle interventions can have an effect on different sites of ectopic fat deposition and cardiovascular or metabolic factors. Moreover, the clinical and economic value of exercise to supplement a hypocaloric diet is investigated. Endocrinologists of the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium, will be recruiting women during consultations. Also, recruitment posters will be used in the University Hospital of Antwerp and the University of Antwerp. Potential participants meeting all a priori set inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized by minimization method to a hypocaloric diet group (usual care) or a group of hypocaloric diet combined with physical fitness training. Both groups will undergo an intake procedure in which personal goals are set and barriers to changes in behavior will be discussed. Ectopic fat deposition will be measured by imaging techniques after three and six months of intervention. A post-intervention follow-up period of six months is planned. Based on the known relationship between ectopic fat and cardiovascular outcomes, the short term study results will then be extrapolated to an estimation of the reduction of cardiovascular events. The following clinical outcomes will be presented: change in ectopic fat in the abdomen (visceral fat), the liver (intra hepatic lipids), skeletal muscle (intra myocellular lipids), heart (epicardial fat) after a dietary or combined (diet+physical activity) intervention. The impact of supervised exercise in addition to diet will be expressed in projected healthcare costs and quality adjusted life years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants should be willing to undergo a weight loss intervention and body weight must be stable during the past six months. There will be no upper eligibility criterion for body mass index (BMI) but BMI should be at least 27 kg/mÂ². Individuals who have a clinical history of type 2 diabetes, prediabetes (with use of medication), or hypothyroidism will be excluded. when postmenopausal; Premenopausal state will be verified by hormonal data (folliclestimulation hormone (FSH) &lt; 25 mU/ml and estradiol &gt; 20 pg/ml). Subjects will not be allowed when pregnancy is planned within 12 months when physical activity is not possible due to problems of the musculoskeletal system when changes in medication (e.g. beta blockers) are advised by an endocrinologist. when smoking when drinking more than two alcoholic consumptions/day or binge drinking (selfreported) when taking medication that influences body weight or metabolism (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) Since all participants will undergo medical imaging, exclusion criteria related to MRI and CT scans are also applicable.</criteria>
