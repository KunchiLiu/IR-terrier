	<brief_summary>The rationale for present trial conception and design moves forward from the assumption that a subcutaneous, pre-pectoral reconstruction by means of soft tissue replacement devices is feasible, safe and giving rewarding results when compared to the standard retro-pectoral technique. Ahead of that, the trial aims to test if there is a difference in the outcomes between a biological and a synthetic material when placed as a support under the mastectomy skin flaps, both in terms of immediate complications and of long-term results.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase III randomized clinical trial will be investigating the Two-stage, using Tissue Expander (TE) pre-pectoral reconstructions. The trial will comprise two arms: PRE-PECTORAL technique with a biological Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT GRAFTING VS PRE-PECTORAL technique with a synthetic Titanium Coated Polypropylene Mesh (TCPM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT GRAFTING</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria will entail cases of conservative mastectomies (skinsparing mastectomy SSM, nipplesparing mastectomy NSM and skinreducing mastectomy SRM), both prophylactic and therapeutic. Included patients baseline characteristics will be: age 1880 years old BMI between 18.5 and 35. Former smokers (up until 3 weeks before surgery) hypertension at oral medications diabetes previous breast surgery previous breast and chest wall radiation therapy will be allowed. T4 and metastatic breast cancers obese patients (BMI over 35) currently smoking patients (within 3 weeks before surgery) refusal to sign the consent severe comorbidities requiring a chronic therapy (renal failure, heart failure, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, hepatic diseases, and metabolic diseases).</criteria>
