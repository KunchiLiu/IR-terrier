	<brief_title>Nuts and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States, Americans have yet to widely adopt evidence-based dietary modifications necessary to reduce CVD risk factors. Encouraging evidence from the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial indicates that adding olive oil and nuts to the diets of older adults in Spain substantially impacted CVD risk factors and events. A large trial testing EVOO and nuts in a U.S. population is needed to determine if supplementing with EVOO and nuts can reduce risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in adults living in the U.S. Prior to launching a large trial, it is important to assess whether adults 55 and older would be interested in participating in a supplementation trial such as PREDIMED. Additionally, it is important to assess if they are willing to consume the nuts and EVOO and attend study related-data collection visits.</detailed_description>
