	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effect of water-based and land-based exercise training, and usual care (no exercise training) in patient with coronary artery disease, on exercise capacity, vascular function, arrhythmogenic potential and cardiac autonomic function, and markers of neurohormonal activity, activated hemostasis and inflammation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Swimming and other water-based physical activities represent an effective form of aerobic-dynamic exercise. However, existing guidelines mainly advise caution when recommending water-based activities to patients with coronary artery disease. To date, safety and efficacy of short-term water-based exercise in patients with coronary artery diseases have only scarcely been addressed. Cardiovascular rehabilitation is an integral part of management after a myocardial infarction or coronary procedure. Most rehabilitation programs are exercise-based, since the beneficial effects of physical activity undisputed, and corroborated by a large body of evidence. Most rehabilitation programs are exercise-based, since the beneficial effects of physical activity undisputed, and corroborated by a large body of evidence. Research has mainly been focused on the impact assessment of the standard forms of physical training, they studied various forms of physical exercise, mainly land-based. No previous study has reported on the effect of exercise in water as an integral element of standard cardiac rehabilitation in coronary patients on exercise capacity, vascular function, arrhythmogenic potential and cardiac autonomic function, and markers of neurohormonal activity, activated hemostasis and inflammation.</detailed_description>
