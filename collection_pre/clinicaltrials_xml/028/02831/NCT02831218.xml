	<criteria>Men or women at least 18 years of age Typical chest pain or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia suitable for elective percutaneous coronary intervention Native coronary artery lesions with lesion length ≤ 50mm and reference vessel diameter of 2.3 3.75mm by QCA(quantitative coronary angiography) assessment The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site. Angiographic exclusion criteria: any of the followings 1. Small vessel: mean reference size &lt; 2.3 mm by QCA(quantitative coronary angiography) 2. True bifurcation lesion with a large side branch (reference vessel diameter &gt; 2.3mm) requiring a complex twostent approach 3. Left main lesions 4. Ostial lesions within 3mm of the origin: right coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, or left circumflex artery 5. Impaired delivery of the Absorb BVS is expected: Extreme angulation (≥90°) proximal to or within the target lesion. Excessive tortuosity (≥two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target lesion. Moderate or heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion. 6. Instent restenotic lesions STelevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (with 12 24 hour after symptoms onset) Prior percutaneous coronary intervention within the target vessel during the last 12 months. Prior percutaneous coronary intervention within the nontarget vessel or any peripheral intervention is acceptable if performed anytime &gt;30 days before the index procedure, or between 24 hours and 30 days before the index procedure if successful and uncomplicated. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% Hypersensitivity or contraindication to device material and its degradants (everolimus, poly (Llactide), poly (DLlactide), lactide, lactic acid) and cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers that cannot be adequately premedicated. Persistent thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/µl) Any history of hemorrhagic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke within the past 6 months A known intolerance to a study drug (aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor) Patients requiring longterm oral anticoagulants or cilostazol Any surgery requiring general anesthesia or discontinuation of aspirin and/or an ADP antagonist is planned within 12 months after the procedure. A diagnosis of cancer (other than superficial squamous or basal cell skin cancer) in the past 3 years or current treatment for the active cancer. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the screening visit, physical examination, laboratory tests, or electrocardiogram which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would preclude safe completion of the study. Hepatic disease or biliary tract obstruction, or significant hepatic enzyme elevation (ALT or AST &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal). Life expectancy &lt; 5 years for any noncardiac or cardiac causes Unwillingness or inability to comply with the procedures described in this protocol. Patient's pregnant or breastfeeding or childbearing potential.</criteria>
