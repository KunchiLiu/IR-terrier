	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single-group, multi-centre trial to confirm the safety and efficacy of loxoprofen sodium/methocarbamol ( IP-TN) when administered orally for 2 weeks to patients with low back pain, scapulohumeral periarthritis, or cervico-omo-brachial syndrome associated with muscle strain. More than 90 patients will be screened to enroll approximately 80 patients in the trial. After giving written informed consent, patients will be enrolled in the trial. Patients who are considered eligible for the trial by the Investigator after consent and complete the trial procedures and assessments at Visit 1 will receive the trial medication and enter the open-label treatment period of 2 weeks. Patients who complete the open-label treatment period will enter the follow-up period of 1 week and complete the trial after confirmation at the last visit (or phone interview).</brief_summary>
