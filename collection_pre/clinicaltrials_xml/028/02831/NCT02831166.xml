	<brief_summary>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention represents the gold standard for the treatment of ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction. However, periprocedural bleedings are associated with an increased risk of mortality, re-infarction, and stroke. Although the prognostic value of access site related bleeding complications is still debated, transradial approach is associated with better short-term outcomes and reduced hospital stay as compared to transfemoral approach. The investigators aimed to compare transradial approach with transfemoral approach with systematic achievement of hemostasis by the implantation of a vascular closure device in a national multicentre randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
