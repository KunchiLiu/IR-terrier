	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate a possible effect of iron status on temporary build-up of non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) in healthy volunteers upon iron supplementation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Iron Status on Occurrence of Non-transferrin-bound Iron (NTBI) in Serum in Response to an Oral Iron Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Visit 1, blood samples will be collected to assess iron status. For Visit 2, after an overnight fast, iron supplement will be provided to participant before breakfast. Blood samples will be collected right before and 2 h after iron supplement consumption for NTBI analysis. NTBI concentration before and after iron supplement consumption will be compared. Dependence of NTBI formation on markers of iron status (serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin and hemoglobin) will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
