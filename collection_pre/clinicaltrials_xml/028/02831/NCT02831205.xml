	<criteria>Age 18 and more Diffuse long native coronary artery stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate) with lesion length of more than 40 mm requiring at least 2 overlapped stents with a referencevessel diameter of 2.5 to 3.75 mm on visual assessment Patients with silent ischemia, stable or unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction including NSTEMI or STEMI The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical followup, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to device material and its ingredients (everolimus, poly(Llactide), poly(DLlactide), lactide, lactic acid) and cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic, and fluoro polymers that cannot be adequately premedicated Subject has known allergic reaction, hypersensitivity, or contraindication to aspirin; to clopidogrel and prasugrel and ticagrelor; or to heparin and therefore cannot be adequately treated with study medication An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of antiplatelet drugs within 12 m after the procedure STEMI requiring primary percutaneous coronary intervention Cardiogenic shock Restenotic lesions Left main Extreme angulation (≥90°) or excessive tortuosity (≥two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target lesion Heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion Compromised left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF &lt;30%) At the time of screening, the subject has a malignancy that is not in remission Terminal illness with life expectancy &lt;1 year Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period Patient's pregnant or breastfeeding or childbearing potential</criteria>
