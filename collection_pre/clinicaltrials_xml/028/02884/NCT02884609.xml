	<brief_title>Tolerance and Efficiency of Paracetamol Subcutaneous Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subcutaneous administration is the most commonly used way for palliative care and geriatric service. A lot of drugs are recommended with subcutaneous administration, but their use is performed out of the Marketing Authorization, and fewer data exist about this practice in literature. Paracetamol is a grade 1 analgesic not currently recommended for subcutaneous injection, because of the lack of validated references. However this kind of administration is usually performed for Paracetamol in the French palliative care services related with its advantages for patients, as analgesic or antipyretic. The assumption of the study is that the use of paracetamol subcutaneously is possible with a good tolerance for hospitalized patients in palliative care service.</detailed_description>
