	<brief_summary>Only 24 cases of Campylobacter bone and joint infection (BJI) have been reported worldwide between 1955 and 2008. Between 2010 and 2012, 7 cases were observed in two University hospitals in France. This increasing number of cases raises several issues. Are they the consequences of better detections and reporting, or are they reflecting any epidemiologic changes? For answering these questions, we performed a 10 year (2002-2012) retrospective multicenter (6 centers) study on BJI (native and implanted joints) due to Campylobacter species.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Study of Bone Infection Due to Campylobacter Spp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: By browsing the microbiological database of 6 BJI French reference centers, we collected all cases due to Campylobacter species between 2002 and 2012, including first and relapse cases. Clinical, microbiological and treatment features were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: 14 episodes of BJI due to Campylobacter spp were identified in 10 patients. Mean age was 76.8 y.o. (63-96). Sex ratio M/F was 1.5. Nine patient had hip (n=6), knee (n=2), and shoulder (n=2) implants. Immunosuppression was observed in 6 patients (3 cancers, 1 cirrhosis, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 corticosteroid treatment). During the 10 primary cases: all patients had fever and 2 presented digestive symptoms. Campylobacter spp were isolated on per operative samples in 5 patients. One of them presented positive blood culture. 5 patients had joint punctures: all of them were positives. Campylobacter species were C. fetus (n=7), C. coli (n=2) and C. spp (1). Strains were resistant to nalidixic acid (=10), ciprofloxacin (n=4), erythromycin (n=3) or cefotaxime (n=2). Only one C. fetus was susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Surgical treatment was performed in 8 patients (2 two-stage procedure, 6 irrigation). The mean duration of adapted antibiotherapy was 77 days (26-237). 3 out of 4 relapse cases were due to C. fetus. All were resistant to more than one antibiotic classes.</detailed_description>
