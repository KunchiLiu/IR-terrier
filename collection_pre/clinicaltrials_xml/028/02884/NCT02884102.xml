	<brief_summary>Here we propose an "integrative sequencing approach" utilizing a 1500 gene exome comparative analysis between multiple myeloma or related plasma cell malignancies and normal cells coupled to capture transcriptome sequencing to provide a nearly comprehensive landscape of the genetic alterations for the purpose of identifying informative and/or actionable mutations in patients with multiple myeloma and plasma cell malignancies. The approach will enable the detection of point mutations, insertions/deletions, gene fusions and rearrangements, amplifications/deletions, and outlier expressed genes among other classes of alterations.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have a diagnosis of multiple myeloma or related malignancy 2. Patients are undergoing standard of care bone marrow aspirates 3. Patients (male or female) from any race or ethnicity must be at least 18 years of age at the time of registration. 4. Procedurespecific signed informed consent form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedures. 1. It is the enrolling study physician's discretion to decide if a patient is not fit enough to undergo a bone marrow aspirate. 2. Patients who are incarcerated are not eligible to participate. 3. Women who are pregnant 4. Patients who have had another malignancy within the last five (5) years (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma, or in situ cancer of the cervix) where there is a possibility to contaminate the bone marrow aspirate.</criteria>
