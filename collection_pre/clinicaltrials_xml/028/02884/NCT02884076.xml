	<brief_title>Validation of Sodergren Score for Haemorrhoids in Malaysia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participating, consented subjects will be scored with the Sodergren score prior to receiving a standardized ambulatory treatment regime. The questionnaire will be self-administered by the subjects. Subjects whom are not able to self-administer the questionnaire will be assisted by the investigator or research assistant. The nature and severity of the subject's haemorrhoidal symptoms are considered as the pre-treatment baseline. A follow up period of 12 months will be carried out post treatment for failure or success of treatment. The data collected will be compared to pre-treatment scores and analyzed statistically.</detailed_description>
