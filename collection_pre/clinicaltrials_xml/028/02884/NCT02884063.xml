	<brief_summary>In the way for developing and optimizing protocol to be used as non- invasive methodology used as routine testing for PGS. This protocol is to be adapted to replace the using of life embryo cells for genetic testing and aneuploidy study as well as for any type of genetic testing including single gene disorder or HLA typing or study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Compare 100 embryos studied using NGS for chromosomal aneuploidies, and compare the results came from free media DNA with this results.</detailed_description>
