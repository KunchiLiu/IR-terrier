	<brief_title>A Study of PEP02 in Combination With 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin (LV) in Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the initial starting dose of PEP02 is 60 mg/m2, and was escalated by increments of 20 mg/m2 between dose levels. 5-FU and LV was given as 24-hour infusion via an implanted central venous catheter, with dose fixed at 2000 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2, respectively. PEP02 was administered on Day 1; 5-FU/LV was started after the end of PEP02 infusion on Day 1 and also on Day 8. Treatment repeated every 3 weeks and it was regarded as one cycle of treatment.</detailed_description>
