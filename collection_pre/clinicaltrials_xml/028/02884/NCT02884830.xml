	<brief_summary>Static hyperinflation is frequent in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , resulting in increased end expiratory lung volume and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi) at the end of a normal expiration. Static hyperinflation worsens the work of breathing is increases patient's dyspnea. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to improve static hyperinflation and to decrease the work of breathing. Sleep is deteriorated in COPD patients, and causal factors includes static hyperinflation. The purpose of our study is to assess the effect of nocturnal CPAP on sleep quality and functional respiratory parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nocturnal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an airflow obstruction, inducing a flow limitation. As a consequence, we observe in these patients an increased end expiratory lung volume and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi) at the end of a normal expiration. Patients are breathing at higher pulmonary volumes: this is the concept of static hyperinflation. This worsens the breathing pattern because in this situation, the work of breathing is increased such that dyspnea increases. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to improve static hyperinflation and to decrease the work of breathing. Sleep is deteriorated in COPD patients, and causal factors includes static hyperinflation, cough, depression. Moreover, normal physiological changes occuring during sleep in COPD patients are leading to deterioration of gaseous exchanges. The purpose of our study is to assess the effect of nocturnal CPAP on sleep quality and functional respiratory parameters.</detailed_description>
