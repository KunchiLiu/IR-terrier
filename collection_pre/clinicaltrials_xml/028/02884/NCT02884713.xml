	<brief_title>Levofloxacin-Doxycycline for Helicobacter Pylori Eradication in Saudi Arabia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective, open-label, single arm study was conducted. Patients were recruited from a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia from June 2013 to April 2014. A total of 55 patients had previously received standard triple therapy and/or sequential therapy in the period from 2011 to 2014 and failed to eradicate the infection. The rescue treatment was given for ten days consisting of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, and esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Urea-breath-test (UBT) was done at a minimum of 6 weeks after completion of the treatment to confirm the H. pylori eradication. Compliance and tolerability of the regimen were also assessed.</detailed_description>
