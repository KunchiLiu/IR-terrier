	<criteria>Subjects must have a diagnosis of ADHD as defined by DSM5 criteria with confirmation using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINIKID). Subjects must demonstrate mildtomoderate impairment of ADHD symptoms and function per the following at screening (V1) and/or baseline (V2): ADHDRSIV score at or above the 90th percentile normalized for sex and age in total score and ≥24 at Baseline; CGIS score ≥4; Subject body weight must be ≥20 kg. Subject must be considered clinically appropriate for treatment with amphetamine and HLD100, including prior treatment experience with an amphetamine product, and ability to swallow treatment capsules. History of, or current, medical condition or laboratory result which, in the opinion of the investigator, unfavorably alters the riskbenefit of study participation, may jeopardize subject safety, or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the study and studyrelated procedures. Serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other cardiac problems that may place the subject at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug. History of seizure disorder (except febrile seizures prior to age 5 and with last occurrence at least 1 year prior to study participation), Tourette's disorder, or intellectual disability of minor severity or greater (DSM5 criteria). History of psychosis, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or suicide attempt. Current depression, anxiety, conduct/behavior disorder, substance use disorder, or other psychiatric condition which, in the investigator's opinion, may jeopardize subject safety or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the study and studyrelated procedures.
