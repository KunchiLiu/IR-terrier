	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether dopamine synthesis capacity by using [18 fluorine(F)]-DOPA PET for patients with schizophrenia in the maintenance phase can predict treatment discontinuation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Antipsychotic Discontinuation in Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two groups: the healthy control group (n=12) and the patient group (n=26). The patient group recruits subjects diagnosed with first episode psychosis which occurred within 2 years and having been treated with antipsychotics for 1 year. Participants will complete clinical scales and undergo PET scans. Subjects in the patient group will receive a reduced intake of antipsychotics by 25% after each week of the four-week period in which they will also undergo PET imaging at the baseline, 7 week, and 8 week marks to detect the correlation between the capacity of presynaptic dopamine and relapse in the patients discontinuing treatment.</detailed_description>
