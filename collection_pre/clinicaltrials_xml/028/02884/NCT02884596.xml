	<brief_title>Success of Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block in Women Taking Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in one mandibular molar were assigned to either SSRI users or SSRI non-users groups. SSRIs users were 35 women who take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment from a psychiatric clinic to the clinic of the endodontic department of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. SSRIs non-users were also 35 women who did not take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment to the same dental clinic. The protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the university (no. 394867). Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. The level of anxiety of the patients was determined by using the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. The patients registered their baseline pain severity using a Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (HP-VAS). Two standard IANBs (1.8-mL cartridges) of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Darupakhsh, Tehran, Iran) were administered to each patient. Fifteen minutes after injection, the teeth were isolated with a rubber dam, and access cavity preparation was initiated. The same operator instructed the patients to rate any pain experienced during the preparation of access cavity or the placement of initial file. If the patient felt pain, the treatment was immediately suspended, and the patient recorded the pain intensity by using the HP-VAS. No or mild pain (HP-VAS score â‰¤ 54) was defined as success.</detailed_description>
