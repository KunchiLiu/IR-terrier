	<brief_summary>The study compares the intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction (iLTS-D) with the Ambu®AuraGain™ in blind and fibreoptic endotracheal intubation. The current randomized study is designed to assess the success rate of blind and fibreoptic endotracheal intubation using i-LTS-D, in comparison with the Air-Q, i-gel® and Ambu®AuraGain™ in an airway simulator. The investigators hypothesize that the iLTS-D and the Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway will similarly perform during spontaneous ventilation despite differences in their structural design.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The New Intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable (iLTS-D) (VBM Medizintechnik, Sulz, Germany) is a new updated version of the Laryngeal Tube-Suction Disposable (LTS-D). It has a ventilator channel with a 13.5mm internal diameter, which enables the passage of an Endotracheal Tube (ETT) either blindly or with fibreoptic guidance. Similarly to the LTS-D, the iLTS-D also has a separate channel for gastric tubes placement up to a size of 18 Fr. The current randomized study was designed to assess the success rate of blind and fibreoptic endotracheal intubation using iLTS-D, in comparison with the Ambu® AuraGain™ in adult patients under general anesthesia.</detailed_description>
