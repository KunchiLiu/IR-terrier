	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of LCZ696 compared to valsartan on cognitive function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Cognitive function will be assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests with an evaluation of longitudinal change of cognitive domains including memory, executive function, and attention.</brief_summary>
