	<brief_title>Management of Bleeding and Coagulopathy in Trauma and Compliance to European Trauma Guidelines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe trauma is responsible for more than 5 millions of deaths annually worldwide. Haemorrhagic shock secondary to uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of preventable death in this population, making bleeding and coagulopathy treatment a key element of the early phase of trauma management. European trauma guidelines have been developed to help clinicians in severe trauma management and improve bleeding and coagulopathy treatment in this population. Investigating who these guidelines are followed in routine is crucial to identify opportunities to improve early management of bleeding severe trauma patients.</detailed_description>
