	<brief_summary>Childhood obesity certainly increases susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) are closely related to various diseases and have been suggested as valuable biomarkers. Here, we sought to identify potential miRNAs to discriminate obese children at risk for diabetes in future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circulating microRNAs for Discriminating Obese Preschoolers at Risk of Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to screen the circulating miRNAs in association with progression from children obesity to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood. Serum samples were evaluated in a 3 step procedure: 1) discovery study, in which samples from obese children and healthy controls were pooled for miRNA sequecing experiment; 2) cross-sectional validation study, in which miRNAs of interest were validated in all individuals (obese children, overweight children and normal controls); 3) longitudinal validation study, in which the candidate miRNAs were estimated in newly diagnosed diabetes patients and normal glucose tolerance controls (NGT). The final determined miRNAs were further confirmed though primary function studies.</detailed_description>
