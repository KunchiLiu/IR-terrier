	<brief_title>Gait Pattern Analysis and Feasibility of Gait Training With a Walking Assist Robot in Stroke Patients and Elderly Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, two treatment groups Number of Subjects : 54 subjects (n=27 per group) Group 1 : gait rehabilitation with hip assist robot / 10 sessions (5sessions - treadmill gait training / 5sessions - overground gait training), 30min per session Group 2 : gait rehabilitation without hip assist robot / 10 sessions (5sessions - treadmill gait training / 5sessions - overground gait training), 30min per session Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and foot pressure distribution measured by F-Scan Mobile system (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA). Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function improvement evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA), Korean version Modified Bathel index (K-MBI), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), Fugl-Meyer assessment for lower extremity (FMA), Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES), Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion (ROM).</detailed_description>
