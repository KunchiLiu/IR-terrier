	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to reveal neurobiological bases of the motor control of conscious perception, thanks to new techniques of functional cerebral imaging (MRI), and potentials deteriorations connected to neuropsychiatric disorders like conversion disorder. The Hospital University Center of Grenoble will provide patients from Neurology department, characterized with non psychogenic epileptic seizures and abnormal psychogenic movements, from conversive origin. Subjects will be scanned by Magnetic Resonance Imaging during a motor paradigm inducing a perceptive conflict between two informations : proprioceptive information coming from the action (drawing) and visual information (draw's mark) that appears on the screen when there is movement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>New results will be provided about brain mechanisms involved in motor control perception among healthy patients and patients suffering from functional neurologic symptoms.</detailed_description>
