	<brief_title>Influence of Vaginal Lactoferrin on Amniotic Fluid Cytokines to Avoid Pregnancy Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 women undergoing genetic amniocentesis will be enrolled at the Obstetric Unit, University of Ferrara. The selected patients will be randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of vaginal Lactoferrin to obtain 3 groups: A, 20 untreated patients; B and C (20 patients each one) respectively treated 4 and 12 h before amniocentesis. Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors concentrations will be quantified by a magnetic bead Luminex multiplex immunoassays panel technology. Amniotic fluid samples will be obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and the sample not required for clinical purposes will be centrifuged to remove particulate material and the supernatants will be aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C until assay.</detailed_description>
