	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop radiation plans that will help preserve lung function in healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. We believe that 4DCT scans can be useful in designing radiation treatment plans that help us avoid healthy normal functioning lung tissue close to lung tumors. Currently 4DCT scans are used to help us determine exactly where the tumor is and how it moves when you breathe. In this study we will also use the 4DCT scans to try to identify high functioning normal lung tissue.</brief_summary>
