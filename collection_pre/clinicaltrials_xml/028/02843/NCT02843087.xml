	<brief_title>Pediatric Obesity and the Infant Microbiome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Normal weight (NW; pre-pregnant BMI &lt;25.0 kg/m2), obese (Ob; pre-pregnant BMI &gt;30.0 kg/m2), gestational diabetes (GDM), Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and Type 1 diabetes mothers during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy that will be followed -along with their respective offspring- through the first 12 months of life will be recruited from the University of Florida (UF) Health Shands Hospital. Stool, saliva blood,vaginal swab, placenta, urine, body composition and clinical variables will be collected from mother and infant at delivery, 2-weeks, 2-months, and 1-year at the UF Clinical Research Center. The study team will recruit equal samples of pregnant mothers in each the following groups (n=50 in each group): 1) NW vaginal deliveries; 2) NW C-section deliveries; 3) Ob vaginal deliveries 4) Ob C-section deliveries; 5) GDM vaginal deliveries; 6) GDM C-section deliveries; 7) T2D vaginal deliveries; 8) T2D C-section deliveries; 9) T1D vaginal deliveries; 10) T1D C-section deliveries. Infant body composition is the primary outcome and will be monitored via anthropometry. Stool, saliva and vaginal swab samples collected from participants may be used for animal studies whereby germ-free mice are inoculated with stool samples to evaluate a causal role of the microbiome in clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e. pediatric obesity).</detailed_description>
