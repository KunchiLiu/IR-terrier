	<brief_summary>A comparative prospective study to evaluate different imaging modalities (pet-ct and pet-mr) prior to surgery in parathyroid tumor patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Localization of Parathyroid Adenoma by Fluorocholine PET/MRI (Positron Emission Tomography -MRI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Hyperthyroidism and surgery indication will be recruited and directed to imagine exams. in addition to the conservative 99mTc-MIBI (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) and US, patients will also undergo 18FCH (¹⁸F-choline) PET/MRI for detecting adenomas and their location. imaging experts will decode the imaging exams. sensitivity and specificity of the exams will be examined.</detailed_description>
