	<brief_title>LEADERS FREE II: BioFreedom™ Pivotal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study all patients will receive the BioFreedom™ Drug Coated Stent and one month of Dual Anti Platelet Therapy</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Hemorrhage</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Any indication for percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement (PCIS) in patients deemed at high risk for bleeding and candidates for 1 month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This includes candidates with stable angina, silent ischemia, acute coronary syndrome (STEMI and nonSTEMI), nonnative lesions and instent restenosis. Patients must provide written informed consent. Reasons of unsuitability for &gt; 1 month dual antiplatelet treatment must include one or more of the following: 1. Adjunctive oral anticoagulation treatment planned to continue after PCI 2. Age ≥ 75 years old 3. Baseline Hgb &lt;11 g/dl (or anemia requiring transfusion during the 4 weeks prior to the index procedure) 4. Any prior intracerebral bleed 5. Any stroke in the last 12 months 6. Hospital admission for bleeding during the prior 12 months 7. Non skin cancer diagnosed or treated &lt; 3 years, with a perceived increased risk for bleeding 8. Planned daily Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) (other than aspirin) or steroids for &gt;30 days after PCI 9. Planned surgery that would require interruption of DAPT (within next 6 months) 10. Renal failure defined as: Creatinine clearance &lt;40 ml/min 11. Thrombocytopenia (PLT &lt;100,000/mm3) 12. Severe chronic liver disease defined as: patients who have developed any of the following: variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or jaundice 13. Expected noncompliance to prolonged DAPT for other medical reasons 1. Pregnant and breastfeeding women 2. Patients expected not to comply with 1 month DAPT 3. Patients requiring a planned staged PCI procedure more than one week after the index procedure 4. Procedure planned to require nonstudy stents, or standalone plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) or standalone atherectomy 5. Active bleeding at the time of inclusion 6. Reference vessel diameter &lt;2.25 &gt;4.0mm 7. Cardiogenic shock 8. Compliance with longterm single antiplatelet therapy unlikely 9. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel (or prasugrel, or ticagrelor if applicable), stainless steel, zinc, Biolimus A9™ or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated 10. PCI during the previous 12 months for a lesion other than the target lesion of the index procedure 11. Participation in another clinical trial (12 months after index procedure) 12. Patients with a life expectancy of &lt; 12 months 13. Patients under judicial protection, tutorship or curatorship (for France only)</criteria>
