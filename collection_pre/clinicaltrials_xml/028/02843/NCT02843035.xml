	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: Part 1: - Evaluate central nervous system (CNS) biomarkers in adult Gaucher disease (GD) type 3 (GD3) patients that distinguish GD3 from Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). - Screen adult GD3 patients who qualify for treatment with GZ/SAR402671 in Part 2. Part 2: - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of GZ/SAR402671 in adult GD3 patients. - Evaluate the change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) central nervous system (CNS) biomarkers from adult GD3 patients receiving GZ/SAR402671. Secondary Objectives: - Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of GZ/SAR402671 in adult GD3 patients. - Explore the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 in infiltrative lung disease (IDL) in adult GD3 patients. - Explore the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 in systemic disease in adult GD3 patients. - Explore the efficacy of GZ/SAR402671 in neurological function and on exploratory CSF biomarkers in adult GD3 patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Provide written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures being performed. Has a clinical diagnosis of GD1 or GD3 and documented deficiency of acid betaglucosidase activity. Hemoglobin level of ≥11.0 g/dL for females and ≥12.0 g/dL for males. Platelet count ≥100 000/mm^3. Spleen volume &lt;10 multiples of normal (MN). Liver volume &lt;1.5 MN. No bone crisis and free of symptomatic bone disease such as bone pain attributable to osteonecrosis and/or pathological fractures within the last year. Received treatment with ERT for at least 3 years. For at least 6 months prior to enrollment, received Cerezyme at a stable monthly dose and must continue at the same monthly dose during the study. Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG]) at baseline. If the patient has a history of seizures, except for myoclonic seizures, they are well controlled under appropriate medication not identified as a strong or moderate inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A. Adult GD1 cohort only: GD1 patient is ≥18 and ≤40 years of age. Adult GD3 cohort only: GD3 patient is ≥18 years of age. Willing to abstain from consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or grapefruit products for 72 hours prior to administration of the first dose of GZ/SAR402671 and for the duration of the 52week treatment period. Oculomotor apraxia characterized by a horizontal saccade abnormality. Cerezyme treatment every 2 weeks (minimum dose 30 U/kg every 2 weeks). Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to practice true abstinence in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or use 2 acceptable effective methods of contraception. Exclusion criteria: Substrate reduction therapy or chaperone therapy for GD within 6 months prior to enrollment. Partial splenectomy within 3 years prior to enrollment, or total splenectomy. The patient is blood transfusiondependent. Prior esophageal varices or liver infarction or current liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or total bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal, unless the patient has a diagnosis of Gilbert Syndrome. Clinically significant congenital cardiac defect, coronary artery disease, valve disease or left sided heart failure; clinically significant arrhythmias or conduction defect. Has any clinically significant disease, other than GD, including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, metabolic (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), or psychiatric disease, other medical conditions, or serious intercurrent illnesses that may preclude participation. Received an investigational product within 30 days prior to enrollment. Has a history of cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma. Has myoclonic seizures. Pregnant or lactating. Has WHO grade 2 or higher cortical or posterior subcapsular cataract. Requires use of invasive ventilatory support or requires use of noninvasive ventilator support while awake for longer than 12 hours daily. Unable to receive treatment with Cerezyme due to a known hypersensitivity or is unwilling to receive Cerezyme treatment every 2 weeks. Currently receiving potentially cataractogenic medications. Has received strong or moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A within 30 days or 5 halflives from screening, whichever is longer, prior to enrolment in Part 2. This also includes the consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or grapefruit containing products within 72 hours of starting GZ/SAR402671 administration Scheduled for inpatient hospitalization including elective surgery, during the study. Has had a major organ transplant (eg, bone marrow or liver). The patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to the requirements of the study. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
