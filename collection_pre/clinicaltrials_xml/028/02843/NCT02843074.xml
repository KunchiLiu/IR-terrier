	<brief_title>Elotuzumab, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (ERd) in the Induction, Consolidation and Maintenance Treatment of Transplant-Eligible, Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (ERd) as induction therapy and the ability of the combination to facilitate the start of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in transplant-eligible patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. In addition to induction, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ERd as consolidation and maintenance therapy in these patients will be observed. Eligible patients will undergo four 28-day cycles of an induction regimen of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Following completion of 4 cycles of induction therapy, all patients will undergo standard mobilization, collection of stem cells, and then ASCT using a melphalan conditioning regimen as per institutional guidelines. Toxicity evaluation will be interrupted during the stem cell procedure and will resume with the onset of consolidation. Adverse events will be collected, however, from the end of induction up to mobilization. Consolidation therapy will begin 70 to 120 days following ASCT and will consist of four 28-day cycles of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. All patients that do not experience progressive disease will begin maintenance therapy of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. The duration of maintenance will be 24 months.</detailed_description>

All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program and must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of that program. Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as required in the Revlimid REMS® program. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential and female patients of childbearing potential are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during their participation in the study and for 28 days following last dose of study drugs. Male patients must also refrain from donating semen or sperm during their participation in the study. Willingness and ability to comply with study and followup procedures.
