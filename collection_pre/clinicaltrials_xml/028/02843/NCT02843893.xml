	<brief_summary>Sedation-analgesia is an important therapy for patients in resuscitation. It requires a surveillance, in order to avoid excessive or insufficient dosages of sedative or nonmorphinics, sources of side effects. Yet, means of surveillance are limited in resuscitation care : variations of blood pressure and heart rate are not very sensitive criterias. Clinical scales to measure the sedation and analgesia level were proposed for patients in resuscitation, including the Richmond (RASS) sedation scale and the behavioural pain scale (BPS). The study of pupillary dilatation's reflex (RDP) due to a nociceptive stimulation is a tool proposed for the monitoring of the analgesia peroperative for patients under general anaesthetic. Yet, there isn't any study that measured the analgesia threshold by pupillometry for patients in resuscitation receiving a sedation-analgesia. The main goal of this study is to measure the minimum intensity of a painful stimulation (tetanus), leading to a 10% raise of RDP in a cohort of patients in resuscitation care receiving sedation-analgesia continuously.</brief_summary>
