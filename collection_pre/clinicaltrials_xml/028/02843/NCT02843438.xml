	<brief_summary>Toxoplasmosis affects one to two newborn each 10000 births. Among them, 1 to 2 % develop learning disabilities or die, and 4 to 27 % develop a chorioretinitis sometimes leading to an amblyopia responsible for visual impairment. Toxoplasmosis uveitis affects too adults immunocompetent and immunodepressed who have had an acquired toxoplasmosis. Clinical diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is more complicated in presence of posterior neuro-retinitis, inflammation of the papilla, uveitis without chorioretinitis, fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, scleritis, diffuse necrotizing or multifocal retinitis. In this situation biological markers diagnostic and prognostic of toxoplasmosis uveitis are useful. Highly kept molecules (during evolution) like stress proteins (Hsp) are are found in the host and the pathogen and there can trigger a crossed immune response. Stress proteins haven't been explored yet, in the context of toxoplasmosis uveitis on humans. The hypothesis is that Hsp70 and antibodies anti-Hsp70 are diagnostic and prognostic markers of ocular toxoplasmosis. The goal is to evaluate diagnosis value of biological markers (Hsp70 and antibodies IgG anti-Hsp70) in toxoplasmosis uveitis.</brief_summary>
