	<brief_title>Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Oxygenation and Lung Mechanics in Morbidly Obese Patients Undergoing Bariatric Operations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients of interest are morbid obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery. Dexmeditomidine will be infused intraoperatively after induction of anesthesia. lung mechanics (dead space and compliance) as well as oxygenation (PF ratio) will be monitored intraoperatively and postoperatively</detailed_description>
