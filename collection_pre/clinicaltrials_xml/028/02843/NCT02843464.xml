	<brief_summary>Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are in critical condition especially without emergency reperfusion therapy. For example, heart failure, heart rupture, malignant arrhythmia are in high level. It was reported remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may play an effective endogenous cardiac protection. This study will investigate whether long-term RIPC can improve the short-term and long-term (1 year) prognosis of AMI patients without emergency reperfusion therapy. 220 AMI patients without emergency reperfusion therapy were randomly divided into 2 groups: long-term RIPC group (once RIPC/day for a year) or control group (routine treatment). Cardiac troponin (TNI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adenosine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), echocardiography and magnetic resonance（MR）were detected in hospital, 1 month and 1 year after discharge. Patients will be followed up by telephone at the end of one year. The major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) include cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization and stroke.</brief_summary>
