	<brief_summary>The goal is to identify neuro-physiological signatures at several levels of mental workload during the realisation of tasks, performed by all the subjects. In parallel, there will be a methodological work consisting to develop the classification algorithms, predictives of these levels of mental workload in real time, in purpose to implement a passive brain-machine interface in the best interest of operators that accomplish complex tasks. Mesures of electro-physiological activity will be recorded in order to approve states of charge in addition to behavioral performances.</brief_summary>
