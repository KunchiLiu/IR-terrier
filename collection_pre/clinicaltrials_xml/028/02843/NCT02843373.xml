	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of this research program is to elucidate causal and directional neural network- level abnormalities in depression, and how they are modulated by an individually-tailored, circuit-directed intervention. By using concurrent TMS and EEG, the investigators can overcome a major limitation of EEG - the inability to demonstrate causality. Here, we plan to recruit patients with medication-resistant depression undergoing rTMS treatment. At multiple time points, we will perform TMS-EEG to investigate the excitability and connectivity profiles of brain networks and how they are modulated during treatment. This study aims to provide objective brain network measures that can predict and track clinical response to TMS treatment. Findings from this study will be utilized to develop a novel, personalized treatment protocol based on individual brain networks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Goals of the study are as follows: - To evaluate the ability to predict and track brain network changes during TMS treatment for medication-resistant depression. - To develop quantitative tools that measure the connectivity and excitability of the brain using resting and single pulse TMS-EEG. - To determine the feasibility of recording EEG biomarkers in the clinic without disrupting clinical care.</detailed_description>
