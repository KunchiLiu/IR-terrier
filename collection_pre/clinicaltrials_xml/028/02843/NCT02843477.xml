	<brief_summary>It is still challenging to assess intravascular volume status in spontaneously breathing patients. Recently, the measurement of corrected flow time in carotid artery was introduced as quite useful, simple and noninvasive for the evaluation of circulating blood volume change. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether corrected carotid artery flow time as determined by ultrasonography can be a predictor of fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients before induction of general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
