	<brief_summary>Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are naturally-occurring isotopes that are found in exhaled breath. Investigators have proved that the 13CO2/12CO2 breath delta value (BDV) changes in subjects who were in negative energy balance then fed a positive energy balance meal. Measuring one liter of exhaled breath daily may be a more convenient way to measure negative or positive energy balance in patients receiving intravenous nutrition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Exhaled Air to Determine Changes in Nutritional Status of Patients on Intravenous Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, pilot study to determine if there is change in the 12C/13C BDV between days 0-7 in patients who receive parenteral nutrition. Investigators will recruit subjects from inpatient units at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics whose primary team consult the Nutrition Support Team to institute parenteral nutrition for clinical reasons. Subjects with clinical indications for parenteral nutrition are moderately to severely malnourished due to little to no nutrition by other means (oral nutrition or nutrition per tube) for a period of time (0-10 days based on state of nourishment prior to admission). Investigators will record baseline nutritional status from the medical record notes (dietitian, Nutrition Support Team, etc.), as well as medication, demographic information and medical history. Investigators will take a baseline exhaled CO2 measurement and then a daily measurement at approximately the same time daily (+/- an hour). The daily exhaled 12C/13C breath delta value will be matched with the subjects' daily caloric intake from parenteral nutrition (and oral nutrition and nutrition per tube, if applicable). The breath delta value, the caloric intake, plus the subjects' degree of malnourishment will be parameters with which to build further research. Investigators hypothesize that the breath delta value will increase from baseline and then stabilize after the patient reaches goal energy needs as defined by the Nutrition Support Team.</detailed_description>
