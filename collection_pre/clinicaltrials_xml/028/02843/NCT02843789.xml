	<brief_title>Evolution of Adipokines and Body Composition in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Receiving Tocilizumab Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with cardiovascular morbidity. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor is an effective new biotherapy for the treatment of RA. This treatment is associated with increased LDL and HDL-cholesterol lipid parameters. Adipokines are adipose tissue-specific secreted molecules, which have many functions such as regulation of appetite, blood glucose or immune response. Among the adipokines, adiponectin exerts beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Patients with RA also exhibit body composition changes, including an increase in abdominal visceral fat. The impact of tocilizumab therapy in RA patients on adipokines and body composition is not known. This project aims to explore the evolution of circulating adiponectin and other adipokines during tocilizumab therapy in RA. Body composition and its variations under tocilizumab therapy will also be analyzed.</detailed_description>
