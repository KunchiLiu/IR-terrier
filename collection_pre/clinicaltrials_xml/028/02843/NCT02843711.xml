	<brief_summary>LUNG-EST is a retrospective study including 152 patients who benefit from lung surgery during the years 2012 to 2013 at Hospices civils de Lyon and with a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinomas. For all patients, clinical data and histopathological data are available. The objective of this study is to characterize these lung adenocarcinomas by the LungCarta Panel using the mass spectrometry array Sequenom. This panel could identify 214 DNA mutations and/or frameshift insert/deletion among 26 oncogenes. Once included in the study, the adenocarcinomas are also included in a Tissue MicroArray (TMA) in order to perform immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical staining with innovative antibodies are correlated with clinical, histopathological and molecular data. Our hypothesis is that this TMA could constitute a good tool to screen interesting protein's expression.</brief_summary>
