	<brief_summary>Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease including an X-linked mutation and characterized by an alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) deficiency. It causes globotriaosylceramide (GB3) accumulation within blood vessels, tissues and organs. This accumulation leads to multisystemic deficiency, such as progressive kidney insufficiency. Due to its low prevalence and non-specific symptoms, FD is under-diagnosed. Its estimated incidence is ranged from 1/40,000 to 1/120,000 live births. A review of the international literature suggests a higher prevalence among dialysis patients. Its diagnosis could lead to an enzyme replacement therapy, in order to avoid the occurrence or aggravation of other organs irreversible lesions, and to enhance the familial screening. We aim to conduct a multicentric cross-sectional prevalence study in 5 areas (Rh√¥ne-Alpes-Auvergne, Ile de France, Aquitaine, Picardie and department of Gard), involving biologic collection and genetic diagnosis test. Our objective is to measure the prevalence of FD among dialysis patients. Eligible patients will be included after signing the informed consent. In the five participating areas, all of the dialysis centers will be asked for involvement. Nominative data of the French renal epidemiology and information network (REIN) registry will enable first patients screening for eligibility among prevalent dialysis patients. If needed (insufficient or absent data in the REIN registry), data will be completed with medical files. A blood drop will be collected during a hemodialysis session (or the monthly test for peritoneal dialysis treated patients) and deposited on an anonymized blotting paper. For the diagnosis of FD, men will have a measure of the alpha-galactosidase activity, whereas screening in women will be established on the association of alpha-galactosidase activity and lyso-GB3 analysis. If results are compatible with FD, genetic mutation will be search in order to confirm the diagnosis for women, and, for all, to offer familial testing. Results will be transmitted to the nephrologist within the next 2 to 9 weeks. Patients diagnosed with FD will be managed in accordance with the guidelines of the French National Authority for Health (F.N.A.H.).</brief_summary>
