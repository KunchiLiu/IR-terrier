	<brief_title>Initial Feasibility Study to Treat Pancreatic Cancer With a Planar LDR Source</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Feasibility study to determine the safety and efficacy of a new brachytherapy device that provides unidirectional radiation which utilizes active components (Palladium-103) of standard devices in a novel configuration.This pilot study may benefit pancreatic cancer patients by reducing the radiation dose to adjacent critical structures, while giving a therapeutic dose to diseased tissue, such as at a surgical margin. The appropriate dose and local control rate will be recorded the primary endpoint in order to provide an efficacy assessment.</detailed_description>
