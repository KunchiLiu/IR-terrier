	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Web-based Nursing Intervention in the Reduction of Postpartum Depression and Parenting Stress.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whether receiving standardized messages (text or email) from a postpartum nurse four times/week for 6 months after delivery will decrease symptoms of postpartum depression and parenting stress. Enrolled women will be randomized to one of three groups. The first group will receive the usual care, which is a phone call from a nurse within the first few weeks postpartum. The second group will receive four standardized messages each week, the content of which will include infant care, maternal self-care and inspirational material. The third group will receive the same four standardized messages each week, and in addition, two of these weekly messages will offer the option to respond with a request for a nurse to call them. Baseline data will be collected during the postpartum hospitalization, and follow-up will occur by email at 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postpartum.</detailed_description>
