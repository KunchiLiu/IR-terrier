	<brief_summary>Seventy subjects with shoulder impingement syndrome associated with scapular dyskinesis will be recruited and randomized into two groups of treatment. The group "a" will receive a strenghtening protocol with progressive overload during 20 sessions and group "b" will receive the same protocol with minimal load, without change during the 20 sessions. The primary outcomes measures will be pain, function, quality of life, global impression of recovery. The change will be measure from baseline at 10 weeks (after 20 sessions), 3 and 6 months (follow-up). The secundary outcomes will be disability, quality of life measure by other instruments, shoulder muscle strength and scapular 3d kinematic variables. For these data, change will be measure from baseline at 10 weeks (after 20 sessions).</brief_summary>
