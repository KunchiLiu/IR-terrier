	<brief_summary>Acute myeloid leukemia(AML) patients with favorable and intermediate cytogenetics at diagnosis are generally excluded from first-line allo-SCT. However, these patients may eventually relapse in some of cases. The purpose of this study is to establish risk stratification based on cytogenetics and minimal-residual-disease(MRD) analysis to determine whether a MRD-directed therapy for low and intermediate AML patients has positive results in terms of overall survival.</brief_summary>
