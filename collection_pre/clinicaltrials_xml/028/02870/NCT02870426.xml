	<brief_summary>To obtain olfactory bulbs from brain stem dead patients who undergo organ donation. Aims: 1. Optimisation of olfactory bulb collection and olfactory ensheathing cell culture and storage. 2. Study of the effects of patient diagnosis, age, cause of death and co-morbidities on cell survival and regenerative function. 3. In future studies, the olfactory ensheathing cells may be injected into patients with spinal cord injuries.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition. To date there is no treatment to improve outcome. There is a limited regenerative capacity of the central nervous system, such that damaged neurons and severed axons are not replaced. A substantial body of evidence suggests that olfactory ensheathing cells obtained from olfactory bulbs facilitate neuronal regeneration in rodents and humans with spinal cord injury. Investigators will study heterologous olfactory ensheathing cells as a treatment for spinal cord injury. Investigators propose collecting human olfactory ensheathing cells from brain stem dead organ donors. In PHASE 1, the olfactory ensheathing cells will be cultured and their properties will be investigated to optimise collection and storage conditions. In PHASE 2, olfactory ensheathing cells will be transplanted into patients with spinal cord injury.</detailed_description>
