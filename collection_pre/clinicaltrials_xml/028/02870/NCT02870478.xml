	<brief_title>The Effects of Low Concentration Atropine on Pupil Size and Accommodation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myopia has become an epidemic in developed countries, particularly in Asian countries and in the United States. Myopia, or near-sightedness, is a result of uncontrolled axial elongation of the eye. Besides needing optical correction in order to see clearly, myopia can result in many sight-threatening complications, such as retinal thinning, retinal holes and tears, retinal detachment, and vascular proliferation. Atropine drops have been used in clinical practice for over 100 years at varying concentrations and different dosing regimens. The proposed small study seeks to establish evidence-based treatment (dosing) guidelines for the use of low dose atropine for myopia control. The specific objectives of this study are: 1. To assess the effects of 0.01% atropine and 0.05% atropine on pupil dilation and accommodation as a measure of active drug levels in the eye when dosed twice per week compared to daily 2. To assess the subjective effects of 0.01% atropine and 0.05% atropine on the subjects' vision Participants will be asked to attend one screening session and a total of 8 test sessions. Following the screening exam (information will be collected on the screening form), the subject will be randomly assigned to one of four atropine treatment groups, where they will treat their non-dominant eye with: 1. 0.01% daily dosing for one week 2. 0.01% twice per week dosing for one week 3. 0.05% daily dosing for one week 4. 0.05% twice per week dosing for one week Once assigned to a treatment group, each subject will have two medication bottles to use, labeled A and B. The subjects will use bottle A to administer a drop on Monday and Thursday. Bottle B will be used to administer a drop every other day of the week to their non-dominant eye only. For subjects in treatment groups 1 and 3, the medication in each bottle will be identical. For subjects in treatment groups 2 and 4, the medication will be in bottle A and bottle B will be sterile saline. The investigator will review with each subject how to instill the medication properly when they are at home by themselves. Test sessions (expected to be no more than 30 mins in length) will be held twice per week during the testing period and scheduled at the subject's convenience. Session measurements will include best-corrected visual acuity, subjective amplitude of accommodation, objective amplitude of accommodation, and pupil size, as described previously (see screening section 7b). An anterior segment slit lamp biomicroscopy exam will also be performed to ensure good ocular health. The subject will also be asked to fill out a brief symptom questionnaire (attached) while they are present for the test session. Information will be recorded on the data collection sheet for this portion of the testing. Once the subject has completed the two week period (total of four sessions) for that treatment group, the subject will be released from testing for a "wash out period" of 1-2 weeks. At the first day of the wash out period, measurements of pupil size and accommodation will be taken prior to the instillation of a single dose of 0.01% or 0.05% atropine, and then at 1min, 5 min, 30 min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, and 8hr post-instillation. The subject will undergo a total of 2 full-day test sessions either after the two 0.01% testing periods or the 0.05% testing periods, but not both.</detailed_description>
