	<brief_summary>Chemoembolization is a recognized treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - classical chemoembolization consists in injecting an emulsion of an anticancer agent in Lipiodol® via the hepatic artery - doxorubicin, an anthracycline, is the most frequently used drug in lipiodol chemoembolization (LCE) - however, less than half of HCC respond favourably to classical lipiodol chemoembolization (LCE) with doxorubicin/Lipiodol® In this trial, we propose to introduce in clinical practice a strategy based on idarubicin to achieve a more effective antitumor effect for the following reasons, recently pointed out by our team: - idarubicin is an anthracycline that penetrates tumour cells more quickly and is more cytotoxic than doxorubicin on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines - idarubicin is injected in a solution of embolization microspheres of a diameter of (300-500µm), which all the progressive and controlled release of the anticancer drug, whereas the doxorubicin/Lipiodol® emulsion is unstable</brief_summary>
