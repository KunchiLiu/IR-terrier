	<brief_summary>The primary study goal is to improve the quality of care transitions for patients with new episodes of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Primary Outcomes: To measure differences in the quality of care transition, as measured by the Care Transition Measure (CTM)-15 in the investigators target population of patients with incident VTE randomized to either a multicomponent, anticoagulation medical home intervention or usual care. Secondary Major Outcomes: To measure the difference in recurrent VTE, major hemorrhage, all-cause re-admissions, and mortality between the investigators intervention and comparison groups at 30 and 90 days in the investigators target population. Secondary Other Outcomes: To measure patient knowledge, health-related quality of life, and time in the therapeutic range (TTR) for patients on warfarin in the investigators target population.</brief_summary>
