	<brief_title>Long-term Safety of Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human) in Japanese Subjects With Alpha1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (GTI1401-OLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety of weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP in adult subjects with AATD in Japan who have completed Study GTI1401. Study GTI1401 is being conducted to evaluate the safety and PK of Alpha-1 MP in subjects with AATD in Japan. In the current study, GTI1401-OLE, subjects will be administered 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP by weekly IV infusion for approximately 1 year (can be renewed annually with the consent of the subjects unless the sponsor informs of discontinuation of this OLE trial) to assess the long-term safety of Alpha-1 MP in subjects with AATD. This study will be conducted at up to 5 centers in Japan. At the Week 9 Visit of Study GTI1401, after giving consent, on the same day, subjects will be assessed for eligibility at Screening/Extention (Ext) Week 1 Visit for this extension study, Study GTI1401-OLE. If eligible, subjects will be administered weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP for approximately 1 year or longer. The Week 9 Visit of GTI1401 will be the End of Study Visit for the subjects who are enrolled in Study GTI1401-OLE. Subjects in Study GTI1401-OLE will have the option to remain in Study GTI1401-OLE and continue to receive weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP for another year or longer. If subjects plan to conclude their participation in the study (GTI1401-OLE) early (before Ext. Week 52), they will be asked to complete the End of Study Follow-Up Assessments, which will be scheduled 4 weeks after the last infusion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who complete participation in Study GTI1401 (i.e., have completed the study through the Week 9 Visit). Subjects who will and are able to provide written informed consent. Subjects with newly diagnosed severe concomitant disease including, but not limited to, congestive heart failure and liver cirrhosis. Subjects with newly diagnosed malignant tumor (including malignant melanoma; however, other forms of skin cancer are allowed). Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding or, if of childbearing potential, unwilling to practice a highly effective method of contraception (oral, injectable or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine device [IUD] or intrauterine system [IUS], condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, male sterilization, or abstinence) throughout the study or male subjects who have a partner who is of childbearing potential and is unwilling to practice a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study. Subjects with clinical signs and symptoms of active HAV, HBV, HCV, or HIV viral infection at the Week 9 Visit of Study GTI1401 and viral infection is further confirmed by testing. Subjects with current evidence of smoking or has a positive urine cotinine test at the Week 9 Visit in Study GTI1401 that is due to smoking. Subjects who currently participate in a study of another investigational product (other than Alpha1 MP). Subjects who have difficulty in adhering to the protocol or its procedures, in the opinion of the investigator. Subjects who have medical conditions that may confound the results of this clinical trial or may endanger these subjects during their participation in this clinical trial in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
