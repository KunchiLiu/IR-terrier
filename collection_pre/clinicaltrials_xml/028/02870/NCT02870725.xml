	<brief_summary>Having co-occurring depression and chronic headaches is challenging and can greatly impact one's professional, personal, family, and social life. People living with chronic headaches are often at a greater risk of having comorbid psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety), reduced quality of life, and impaired functioning because of under-diagnosis, misdiagnosis or under-treatment of both chronic conditions. This study is a pilot clinical trial that will compare the effectiveness of a brief cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) depression intervention to a care as usual (control) group. The aim of the study is to determine how well the CBT intervention will reduce the frequency, severity and level of disability of both the headaches and depression symptoms.</brief_summary>
