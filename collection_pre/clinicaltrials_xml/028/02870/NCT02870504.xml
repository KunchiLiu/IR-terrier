	<brief_summary>Glaucoma is the second cause of blindness worldwide. Laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPI) is a simple and effective treatment for angle closure glaucoma. LPI can widen or reopen an existing angle close or angle adhesion in order to reduce the risk of attack of the angle closure glaucoma. However, there are very little research on the laser site, laser wavelengths, laser energy and laser spot intervals. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum laser site of LPI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is the second cause of blindness worldwide. Laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPI) is a simple and effective treatment for angle closure glaucoma. LPI can widen or reopen an existing angle close or angle adhesion in order to reduce the risk of attack of the angle closure glaucoma. However, there are very little research on the laser site, laser wavelengths, laser energy and laser spot intervals. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum laser site of LPI. Before and 7days, 1 month, 3 months after LPI, the structure of anterior chamber, including angle anterior chamber depth(ACD), angle of anterior chamber (AA), anterior chamber angle opening distance 750(AOD750) are measured with ultrasound biomicroscopy. Before and 7days, 1 month, 3 months after LPI, the outflow resistance of aqueous humor are evaluated with C value. Before and 1hour, 1days, 3day, 7days, 1 month, 3 months after LPI, intraocular pressure are measured with Goldmann tonometry. Before and 3 months after LPI, retinal nerve layer thickness and the optic disc cup disc ratio are measure with optical coherence tomography.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with primary angle closure suspect (PACS), primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). PACS is diagnosed in eyes with an occludable angle but no other abnormality. PAC is diagnosed in eyes with an occludable angle, normal optic discs and visual fields and any of the following: raised IOP (&gt;19 mm Hg), PAS, pigment smearing in the superior angle, or sequelae of acute angle closure (iris whirling or glaucomatous fleck). PACG is diagnosed in eyes with an occludable angle and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy is defined as a cup: disc ratio (CDR) of &gt;0.7 or &gt;0.2 CDR asymmetry. An occludable angle is defined as one in which three quarters of the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork is not visible on viewing with a Goldmann two mirror lens in the primary position of gaze without indentation. Patients with previous ocular surgery, and those with secondary angle closure, such as lens intumescence or subluxation, iris neovascularisation and a history of uveitis. Patients who have systemic contraindications to medical therapy (including renal impairment, sulfur allergy, asthma and heart failure), preexisting corneal opacities obstructing laser access to more than one quadrant of the peripheral iris and singleeyed patients are also excluded.</criteria>
