	<brief_summary>This 2-part study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oral treatment, BCX7353, in preventing angioedema attacks in subjects with hereditary angioedema (HAE). In Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive oral BCX7353 or placebo for 4 weeks. Assuming successful completion of Part 1, additional subjects will be randomized in Part 2 to one of 2 lower doses of BCX7353 or placebo. The study will compare the number of acute attacks in each treatment group, as well as a number of other clinical and pharmacologic outcomes, and the safety and tolerability of each dose of BCX7353 compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
