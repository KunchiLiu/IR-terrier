	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to estimate the change in severity of Sleep Breathing Disorders (SBD) in patients with or without reverse remodeling, in de-novo or upgrade implants, after 6 month follow-up. The main secondary objective is to assess the prevalence, type and evolution of the SBD, co-morbidities and major adverse cardiac events in each subgroup of HF patients (based on the etiology), up to 12 months follow-up period. Predictors of the clinical outcomes will be investigated.</detailed_description>
