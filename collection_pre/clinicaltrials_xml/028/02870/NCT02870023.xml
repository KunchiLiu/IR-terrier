	<brief_summary>Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by decreased strength and motor control, and compromised gait function. Reduced walking speed, balance, and fatigue are the cardinal symptoms. In rehabilitation, strength and balance training are commonly used. There is increasing scientific support of strength training for improving walking function. The evidence for balance training remains flawed. It is known that neurological damage in MS leads to increased cognitive processing in the planning of movements, which predisposes fatigue. Since fatigue is also associated with impaired balance, it can be hypothesized that motoric/balance training with an emphasis on cognitive load can affect gait and fatigue. Purpose: The aim of the study is to determine whether there is a differentiated effect between strength and balance training measured by motor function, strength, balance, and fatigue.</brief_summary>
