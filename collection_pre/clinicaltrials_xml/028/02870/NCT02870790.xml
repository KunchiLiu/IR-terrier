	<brief_summary>A new NSW Ministry of Health HIV Strategy released on 1 December 2015 aims for the virtual elimination of HIV transmission in NSW by 2020. Critical to the new strategy's success is the population-based, targeted roll-out of HIV PrEP. PrEP involves taking one pill daily of co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/ emtricitabine (FTC). This large-scale study aims for the rapid roll-out of TDF/FTC to individuals at high risk of HIV, who will comprise mostly gay and bisexual men (GBM) but will also include small numbers of heterosexuals, injecting drug users, and transgender men and women. The drug will be used according to existing NSW Ministry of Health Guidelines. By rapidly rolling out this new intervention over a 12 month period, and following participants for two years on treatments, a reduction of about 50% in new HIV diagnoses in NSW is expected. The study aims to assess the incidence of HIV among PrEP study participants and measure the population-level impact of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on HIV diagnoses among GBM in NSW over a two-year period. It will also evaluate the rate of PrEP uptake among high risk GBM in NSW, assess the incidence of STI (gonorrhoea, chlamydia and infectious syphilis) among people prescribed PrEP and measure the effect of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on the overall number of notifications of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and infectious syphilis in NSW, describe patterns of PrEP use and medication adherence, and monitor behavioural risk practices among PrEP users. The main population group will be 3700 gay men at high risk of HIV infection. All procedures of this study are guided by the NSW Guidelines on PrEP. Protocol Co-Chairs Professor David Cooper, Professor Andrew Grulich. Protocol Coordinating Investigator: Dr. Iryna Zablotska.</brief_summary>
