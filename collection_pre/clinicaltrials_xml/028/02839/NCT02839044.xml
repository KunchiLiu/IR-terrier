	<brief_summary>Arterial calcification is an independent predictor of coronary events associated with a 3-4 fold increased risk of cardiovascular events. Currently, no effective intervention exists to reduce arterial calcification. However, recent studies showed that vitamin K may reduce ongoing calcium deposition in the arteries, and thereby inhibit arterial calcification. The primary objective is to determine if MK-7 supplementation leads to stabilization or attenuation of ongoing calcium deposition in the femoral artery as quantified by 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging in patients with type 2 diabetes and arterial disease.</brief_summary>
