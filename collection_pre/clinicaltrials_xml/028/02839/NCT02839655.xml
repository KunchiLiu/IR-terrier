	<brief_summary>The robot-assisted surgery for benign and malignant thyroid tumors was widely developed in Asia and begins to spread in Western countries. The main advantage of the technique is to avoid a scar in the neck by placing it either in the axilla or at the hairline behind the ear to improve esthetic consequences and body image. It is not surgery minimally invasive but rather a way of remote access surgery. Data from the literature including cohort studies and meta-analyzes attest the security of the procedure in comparison with classic thyroid surgery (which remains the "gold standard"). However there is few data on the effectiveness of the technique in terms of the completeness of the surgery, according to the routine standard criteria used in endocrinology and endocrine cancer, and no French medico-economic study has been performed.</brief_summary>
