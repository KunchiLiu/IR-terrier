	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study evaluates the safety, immunogenicity and lot-to lot consistency of 3 lots of aH5N1c vaccine for pandemic avian influenza, in approximately 2394 healthy adults ≥18 years of age receiving the vaccine and 798 healthy adults receiving placebo. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either aH5N1c vaccine or saline placebo. Enrollment will be stratified by age: 18 to &lt;65 years of age and ≥65 years of age, to allow adequate safety assessment of the entire age spectrum.</brief_summary>
