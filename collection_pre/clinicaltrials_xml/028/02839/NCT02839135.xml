	<brief_title>A Comparative Bioavailability and Adhesion Performance Study, Comparing a New Scopolamine Transdermal Delivery System Formulation to the Currently Established Reference Transdermal Delivery System in Healthy Adult Participants.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, single-center, cross-over, comparative bioavailability and adhesion study, comparing single administrations of a new scopolamine transdermal delivery system formulation to the current established reference transdermal delivery system in healthy adult participants. The study will consist of an ambulant screening day within 21 days prior to the first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration at study Day 1 and two treatment periods. Each treatment period will consist of 4.5 days (108 hours) of in-house confinement.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must understand and provide written informed consent before any assessment is performed, understand the study procedures, and be willing and able to complete the required assessments. Male or female participants of any ethnic origin, and aged from 18 to 55 years (inclusive). Body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2. Normal vital signs as follows: Oral body temperature between 35.0 and 37.5 ºC (95 and 99.5 °F) inclusive; Supine systolic blood pressure between 90 and 140 mmHg inclusive; Supine diastolic blood pressure between 55 and 90 mmHg inclusive;Pulse rate between 50 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) inclusive. In general good physical health including the presence of healthy and non irritated skin at test site behind the participant's ears, as judged by the investigator and determined by medical/surgical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) (12lead), and clinical laboratory (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis). Ability to communicate and comply with all study requirements. Willingness and ability to complete the study. Presence of tattoo, hair (including shaved hair) or scarring on the test site behind the participant's left or right ear. Surgical procedures or use of topical pharmacologic treatments directly over the test site(s) within 90 days before enrollment. Use of other belladonna alkaloids, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline and imipramine), amantadine, quinidine within 2 weeks prior to the first scheduled study drug administration. Participation in a previous clinical study with another investigational product within the last 90 days or use of other investigational drugs within 90 days or 10 halflives before enrollment, whichever is longer. History of or known hypersensitivity or photosensitivity to any of the study drugs, excipients or to drugs of similar chemical classes. Diagnosis of angleclosure (narrow angle) glaucoma. History or current evidence of pyloric obstruction, intestinal obstructions or urinary bladder neck obstruction (e.g. due to benign prostate hyperplasia) and History of seizures or psychosis. Diagnosis of long QT syndrome or QTc &gt; 450 millisecond (msec) for males and &gt; 470 msec for females at screening. History of malignancy or neoplastic disease of any organ system (except for localized basal cell skin carcinoma), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years prior to screening, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. Pregnant, nursing (lactating) women. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant unless they are: women whose career, lifestyle or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner, at the judgment of the investigator; women who have been surgically sterilized or whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means; using a highly effective method of birth control (i.e. one that results in a less than 1% per year failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices (IUDs). Double barrier and periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) are not acceptable means of contraception; A woman who is postmenopausal must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening but will not need to comply with an acceptable method of contraception. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they had 12 months of natural (sp ntaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with known or reported serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks before. In the case of oophorectomy alone, women are considered postmenopausal only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. Any surgical or medical condition which may significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug substance. History of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). History of orthostatic hypotension, fainting or blackouts. Clinically relevant chronic or acute infectious illnesses or febrile infections within two weeks prior to start of the study. History within the last five years or current evidence of pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematological, endocrinological, metabolic, autoimmune, neurological, psychiatric or other diseases at screening unless deemed medically insignificant or clinically insignificant as assessed by the Investigator. Clinically significant laboratory findings at screening such as anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11.5 g/dL for women and &lt;13.5 g/dL for men), serum potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L or &gt;5.0 mmol/L, or serum sodium &lt;132 mmol/L or &gt;150 mmol/L. Use of any medication within 2 weeks before first scheduled study drug administration or within less than 10 times the elimination halflife of the respective drug (whichever is longer), or is anticipated to require any concomitant medication during that period or at any time throughout the study. Any history of asthma, urticaria, or other significant allergic diathesis. Participants with uncomplicated seasonal allergic rhinitis can be accepted if expected allergy season is clearly outside enrolment/ treatment period. Participant has a history of illicit drug abuse or investigator has evidence of current drug abuse with drug classes that include but are not limited to barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, cannabis or any other illicit drugs (verified by urine drug screen or other reliable evidence). Smokers or evidence for current alcohol abuse or reports a regular average alcohol consumption exceeding 18 g (women) or 35 g (men) of pure alcohol per day, i.e. 1 drink/day for women or or 35 g (men) of pure alcohol per day, i.e. 1 drink/day for women or 2 drinks/day for men (1 drink = 5 oz of wine or 12 oz of beer or 1.5 oz of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening. Positive results in any of the virology tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Antibodies (HIVAb), Antibodies Hepatitis C Virus (HCVAb), Surface antigen of Hepatitis B (HBsAg) and HBcAb (Immunoglobulin G [IgG] +Immunoglobulin M [IgM]).
