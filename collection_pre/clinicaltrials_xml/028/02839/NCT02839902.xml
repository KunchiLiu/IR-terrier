	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of 8-week treatment with omega-3-acid ethyl esters on the lipid and lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients receiving a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor by use of HPLC in comparison with the control group of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study of the Effects of Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters on the Lipid and Lipoprotein Profile in the Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was designed to explore the effects of omega-3-acid ethyl esters on the lipid and lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients receiving a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor in comparison with the control group of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters in an unblinded manner by use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using highly-sensitive gel filtration columns, which is a technique for analyzing lipoprotein. Study participants who gave consent and were assessed as eligible in the eligibility assessment will be stratified by the factors of "fasting triacylglycerol (TG; &lt;300 mg/dL or 300 mg/dL≤) and age (&lt;65 years or 65 years≤) at the start of the screening period" and allocated to either the group treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters or the group not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters (1:1 ratio).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participants diagnosed as hyperlipidemia. 2. Participants constantly receiving a HMGCoA reductase inhibitor at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks at the time of informed consent. 3. Participants with fasting TG of 150≤ to &lt;400 mg/dL measured at the time of informed consent at Visit 1 (Week 4). 4. Participants who, in the opinion of the principal investigator or the investigator, are capable of understanding the content of the clinical study and complying with the study protocol requirements. 5. Participants who can provide written informed consent prior to the conduction of the clinical study procedures. 6. Participants aged ≥20 years at the time of informed consent at Visit 1 (Week 4). 1. Participants who had clinically significant hemorrhagic disorders (e.g., hemophilia, capillary fragility, gastrointestinal ulcer, urinary tract hemorrhage, hemoptysis, and vitreous hemorrhage) within 24 weeks prior to informed consent, or those who concurrently have the above disorders. 2. Participants who had thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism) within 24 weeks prior to informed consent, those who concurrently have the above disorders, or those who are orally receiving a therapeutic drug for thyroid disorder. 3. Participants in whom the type of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors was changed within 12 weeks prior to informed consent. 4. Participants who received an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) preparation or an EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) preparation (including supplements) within 12 weeks prior to informed consent. 5. Participants who started antidyslipidemic agents within 4 weeks prior to informed consent. 6. Participants with severe hepatic impairment (e.g., ChildPugh classification C) 7. Participants who were previously diagnosed as lipoprotein lipase deficiency or apoprotein CII deficiency. 8. Participants who are concurrently having Cushing's syndrome, uremia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or serum dysproteinemia. 9. Diabetic participants who are currently receiving thiazolidine or insulin. 10. Participants who are concurrently having hypertension of grade IIINote 1). Note 1: Participants with systolic blood pressure of ≥180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥110 mm Hg regardless of treatment with antihypertensive drugs. 11. Participants who are habitual drinkers drinking an average of over 100 mL per day (expressed in terms of quantity of alcohol), or participants with or with a history of drug abuse or addiction. 12. Pregnant, lactating or postmenopausal women. 13. Participants with a history of hypersensitivity or allergy for omega3acid ethyl esters. 14. Participants participating in other clinical studies 15. Participants assessed ineligible in the study by the principal investigator or the investigator</criteria>
