	<brief_summary>Publications of the use of bowel cleansers in usual clinical practice are lacking. Patient adherence to investigational products increases in the context of clinical trials. By the same token, efficacy of interventions may be overestimated in clinical trials. For this reason, an observational study to collect data on the effectiveness of several colonic preparations when these are used under usual clinical practice is proposed.</brief_summary>
