	<brief_summary>According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), the temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome (TMD) is characterized as a subset of orofacial pain, whose signs and symptoms include pain or discomfort in the temporomandibular joints. Pain is considered one of the most common and limiting clinical manifestations. One of the most used resources to treat muscle pain is the low-level laser therapy (LLLT), However, the mechanisms responsible for the effects observed in clinical trials remain poorly elucidated, as well as therapy with light emitting diode therapy (LEDT) which, has some advantages, among them the larger area radiation point and low cost. However, its effects remain elusive in intraoral application in temporal muscle, lateral and medial pterygoid muscle. Assuming that there is need to investigate therapeutic resources that combine not only different wavelengths as well as different light sources (LED and LLLT), this study aims to evaluate the effect of phototherapy with a combination of different light sources on pain, joint mobility, equity and quality of jaw movements after treatment in patients with TMD. It will be made a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trial. Individuals participate with myogenic temporomandibular disorder, being allocated into 2 groups randomly and stratified by the method of sealed envelopes. The results will be evaluated using: RDC/TMD, digital caliper, visual analog scale, and kinematics. The protocols will be used in a 6 sessions and will be evaluated in four different moments. The analyses of the data will be performed by adopting a significance level of 5%.</brief_summary>
