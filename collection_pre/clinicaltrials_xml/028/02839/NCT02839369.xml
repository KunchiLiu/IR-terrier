	<brief_summary>The goal of the present study was to look at the effect of changing walking parameters on the dynamic walking characteristics among children post severe traumatic brain injury, children with cerebral palsy and typically developed controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Walking Dynamic Among Children With Brain Damge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>leisure time physical activity by the Godin and Shephard (G&amp;S) questionnaire. Balance tests - the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and functional reach test (FRT). Maximal isometric strength was assessed by using a hand held dynamometer; walking dynamics were recorded by an electronic mat, and the 6 minute walk test, energy expenditure index (EEI) and perceived exertion by the OMNI scale.</detailed_description>
