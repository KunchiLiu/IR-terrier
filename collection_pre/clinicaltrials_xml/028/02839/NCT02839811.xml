	<brief_summary>The COBIOPHAD project targets the development of a highly sensitive, selective, and multiplexed diagnostic device to provide a quick and inexpensive in vitro test to address the most prevalent drug hypersensitivity to betalactams antibiotics, (BLCs). During a retrospective study, BLC structures involved in drug hypersensitivity will be identified from sera of allergic patients (versus controls) and coupled on the device. A prospective study will be performed for the recruitment of samples corresponding to patients with known IgE hypersensitivity to BLCs based on results from allergy tests and clinical history. Controls will include: non-allergic individuals with known tolerance to betalactams. The samples will be used for the validation of the COBIOPHAD device in real settings.</brief_summary>
