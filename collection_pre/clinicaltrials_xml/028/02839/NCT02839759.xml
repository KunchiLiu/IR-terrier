	<detailed_description>HTM will develop the "TELLYHealth (tm) system" that will provide education on hearing aid use and maintenance, a troubleshotting guide, and a patient diary. The content will include interactive lessons on real-world communications strategies to help all patients derive maximum value from their hearing aids. HTM will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to quantify the benefits of TELLYHealth to patients and audiologists including: reductions in hearing handicap, improved knowledge of hearing aid handling, use and communications strategies; and improved audiologist aftercare. The investigators will recruit 80 subjects (half in each group) and each subject will participate in the study for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
