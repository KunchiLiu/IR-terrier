	<brief_summary>The investigators have identified a support group on social media with ~1500 members (children and adults), the majority of whom have T1DM and follow a carbohydrate-restricted diet. Many participants report exceptionally low HbA1C and insulin requirements. If these anecdotal reports are reflective of a large group of people with type 1 diabetes, a clinical trial would be warranted. The investigators propose to survey the above-mentioned group and their professional diabetes care providers to characterize glycemic control and explore associated dietary and diabetes care factors.</brief_summary>
