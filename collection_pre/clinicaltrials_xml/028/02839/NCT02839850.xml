	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to examine the change from pre-operative baseline to two year postoperative functional performance improvement for the ATTUNE primary, cementless TKA RP system as measured with the KOOS questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score). This will be carried out for two configurations: cruciate retaining rotating platform (ATTUNE Cementless CR RP) and posterior stabilized rotating platform (ATTUNE Cementless PS RP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>14022 ATTUNE Cementless RP Clinical Performance Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: - Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in post-operative outcomes using additional patient reported measures at 2 years: PKIP (overall and sub-scores), KOOS (overall and sub-scores), AKS and EQ-5D-3L. - Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in pain and satisfaction over time as measured using a modified VAS Pain Score (discrete numbers rather than a continual scale) at 2yr. - Evaluate type and frequency of Adverse Events - Evaluate survivorship of the ATTUNE Primary Cementless TKA system for the CR RP and PS RP configurations using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 2yr and 5yrs. - Evaluate primary, cementless ATTUNE TKA fixation through zonal radiographic analysis of the bone-implant interface at 6wk, 6mo, 1yr, and 2yr after surgery. - Evaluate any changes in anatomic tibiofemoral, femoral component and tibial component alignment at 2 years compared to the first postoperative radiographs.</detailed_description>
