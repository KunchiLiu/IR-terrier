	<criteria>1. Patient is diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for which an ablation procedure was deemed most appropriate therapy. 2. Reported incidence of at least two (2) documented episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) during the six months preceding trial entry (at least one episode should be documented by rhythm strip or ECG). 3. Failure of at least one antiarrhythmic medication (AAD) for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [class I or III, or AV nodal blocking agents such as beta blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB)] as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, or intolerable side effects due to AAD. 4. Left atrial size &lt;50 mm in largest dimension as measured and image documented by preoperative imaging (CT, MRI and/or TTE) 5. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≥ 40% (obtained within 12 months prior to the procedure). 6. Anticoagulation therapy: patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy where appropriate according to 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation. 7. Patient is at least 18 and ≤80 years of age. 8. Patient is able and willing to give informed consent. 1. Patient had any previous left atrial ablation. 2. History of any valvular cardiac surgical procedure, atrial septal defect closure device; or left atrial appendage closure device. 3. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure within the last 3 months. 4. Awaiting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery within the next 12 months. 5. Atrial clot/thrombus on imaging such as on a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) performed within 48 hours of the procedure if deemed appropriate by the investigator. 6. History of a documented thromboembolic event within the past one (1) year. 7. Diagnosed atrial myxoma. 8. Patient has defibrillator implant. 9. Patient has known cryoglobulinemia. 10. Patient has any contraindication for oral anticoagulation. 11. Anaphylactic allergy to contrast media. 12. Significant pulmonary disease, (e.g. restrictive pulmonary disease, constrictive or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or any other disease or malfunction of the lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms. 13. Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude enrollment in this study. 14. Acute illness or active systemic infection or sepsis. 15. Unstable angina. 16. Myocardial infarction within the previous three months. 17. History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities. 18. Uncontrolled heart failure or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure. 19. An intracardiac thrombus, tumor, or other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation. 20. Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access 21. Patient has renal dysfunction with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2. 22. Structural heart disease of clinical significance including congenital heart disease where either the underlying abnormality or its correction prohibits or increases the risk of ablation. 23. Atrial fibrillation (AF) secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or reversible or noncardiac cause (e.g. surgery, pericarditis). 24. Any history of a cerebrovascular disease, including stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack. 25. Previous continuous AF episode lasting &gt;7 days. 26. Continued need for Amiodarone therapy post procedure. 27. Women who are pregnant (by history of menstrual period or pregnancy test if the history is considered unreliable). 28. Any anatomical abnormality of the patient's esophagus which might interfere with esophageal warming balloon insertion, positioning or inflation. 29. Enrollment in an investigational study evaluating another device or drug. 30. Life expectancy less than 12 months.</criteria>
