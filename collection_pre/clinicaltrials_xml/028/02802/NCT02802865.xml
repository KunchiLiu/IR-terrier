	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the addition of clomid to letrozole for the treatment of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Half of the participants will receive letrozole and clomid in combination, while the other half will receive letrozole alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Letrozole and Clomid in Women With Infertility and PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Letrozole and Clomid are both used for ovulation induction, but they have different mechanisms of action. Letrozole has been shown to be superior to clomid in achieving live birth rates in women with infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the combination of these medications has not been studied. This is a pilot study to evaluate if the combination treatment has improved efficacy as measured by ovulation rate. This is a randomized controlled trial of letrozole versus letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) for one menstrual cycle. Women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive letrozole 2.5 mg or combination of letrozole 2.5 mg and clomiphene 50 mg for 5 days on days 3-7 of menstrual cycle. The women and their partners will be instructed to have regular intercourse with the intent to conceive during the cycle. Patients will have an transvaginal ultrasound mid cycle and to evaluate number of follicles (&gt;15 mm), follicle size, endometrial thickness and pattern. Patients will have mid- luteal phase progesterone level drawn to evaluate ovulation. Side effect profile will also be monitored.</detailed_description>
