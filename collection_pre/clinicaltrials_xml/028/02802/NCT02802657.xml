	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different regimens of Conbercept (Treat-and-Extend Regimen vs. PRN) in patients with wet AMD. This study is to provide long-term safety data in the treatment of patients with wet AMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Efficacy and Safety of "Treat-and-Extend" Regimen Versus PRN of Conbercept in AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion Criteria： Age ≥ 50 y/o, nAMD patients（including PCV） Best-corrected visual acuity（BCVA） Exclusion Criteria： Previous anti-VEGF treatment within 3 months History of intraocular surgery within 3 months or arrangement of intraocular surgery in the next 6 months from baseline Active or recent intraocular inflammation in the study eye Primary Endpoint： Improvement in BCVA compared to baseline Other： Central Macular Thickness after Treatment，Numbers of Injections</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informedconsent before any evaluation Visual impairment due to active CNV,including predominantly classic CNV,minimally classic CNV,occult CNV with no classic component and PCV. 50 years old and older Chinese For study eye: BCVA between 20/30 and 20/320 on electronic visual acuity texting at the time point of both screening and baseline. Have Stroke and myocardial infarction within 3 months before screening Any active periocular and ocular infection and inflammation (including blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, intraocular inflammation) while screening and baseline. Uncontrolled glaucoma (under treatment [IOP] ≥ 30 mm Hg or depend on researchers) while screening and baseline Neovascularization of iris and neovascular glaucoma while screening and baseline Any causes led to choroidal neovascularization except Wet AMD (including ICNV,central serous chorioretinopathy,ocular histoplazmoza and pathologic myopia) while screening and baseline With structure injury (including vitreous macular traction,epiretinal membrane involving in central fovea,subretinal fibroplasia,laser scar and central fovea atrophy) within 0.5 optic disc diameter to the central of macula while screening and baseline, which may harm the improvement of vision by treatment according to researchers Any systemic antiVEGF medication(as Avastin) use within 3 months before screening Any medication systemic use toxic to lens, retina and optic nerve,including iron amine, chloroquine/chloroquine (Plaquenil ®), tamoxifen, phenothiazine and ethambutol For study eye：Used to accept following treatments for wet AMD within 3 months or accept following treatments more than three times before baseline: a)Antiangiogenesis drugs(pegaptanib （Macugen®），ranibizumab ,bevacizumab（Avastin®),VEGFTrap，KH902；b）Anecortave acetate corticosteroids；c）Protein kinase C inhibitors，squalamine，siRNA; d)PDT （Visudyne®）treatment,external beam radiotherapy, local laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, submacular surgery and transpupillary thermotherapy Any intraocular surgery(including YAG laser) within 3 months before baseline or predicated within 6 months after baseline Intraocular or periocular treatment of corticosteroids within 3 months before baseline For follow eye:Any antiangiogenesis treatment(including antiVEGF,like Lucentis,Avastin® and KH902 ) within 3 months before baseline</criteria>
