	<brief_title>Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Chinese Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of localized Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma with respective to toxicity and tumor control. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens based on the tumor location to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 3 months after the completion of CIRT. Primary endpoint is toxicity, second endpoint is progression-free survival, overall survival and tumor response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or clinical diagnosis of HCC according to American association for the study of liver diseases （AASLD）guidelines or clinical diagnosis criteria based on Alpha Fetoprotein （AFP), and radiological images proposed by Liver Cancer Society, Chinese AntiCancer Association; 2. no clinically distant metastasis; 3. Child Push score A,technically unresectable, or medically inoperable; maximal tumor size is less than 12 cm; 4. age ≥ 18 and &lt;80 years of age; 5. Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 70; 6. No previous invasive cancer (within 5 years before the HCC diagnosis)except for skin nonmelanoma cancer or non muscle invasive bladder cancer; Ability to understand character and individual consequences of the clinical trial; 7. Willing to sign the written informed consent; Informed consent must be signed before the enrollment in the trial; 1. Distant metastasis (M1); 2. maximal tumor size is more than 12 cm; 3. tumor invading adjacent gastrointestine (T4); 4. Child push score B or C; 5. Previous hepatic radiotherapy; 6. Severe systemic disorders; 7. Previous malignancy (within 5 years) except for skin nonmelanoma cancer or 3year disease free interval from previous malignancy like in situ cervix cancer or non muscle invasive bladder cancer; 8. Non conformity of the radiotherapy dose distribution when compared to the dose constraints; 9. Psychiatric disorders or any other condition that can make unreliable the informed consent;</criteria>
