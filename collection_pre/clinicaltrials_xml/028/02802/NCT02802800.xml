	<brief_summary>Field hockey players, recruited from clubs in Jamaica, will be randomized to either a water training or land training groups. Persons will be exposed to 6 weeks of plyometric training with two sessions per week. Pre and post test measures will be done for lower limb power, flexibility and agility. Distance covered, pace, heart rates and exertion during a match will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Land Based and Water Based Plyometric Training Effects on the Physical Fitness of Field Hockey Players in Jamaica</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plyometric training has been used in a variety of sports to improve power. There is minimal research however regarding its use among hockey players and even less research exploring water based training. International field hockey competitions are played on wet turf and it is felt that water training may be beneficial to these players. The study will explore whether water based plyometrics will prove to have additional benefits compared to land based plyometrics for the Jamaican hockey athletes. The members of the Jamaica hockey clubs will be recruited to participate in this study. Recruitment will be done by the principal investigator Dr. Roopchand-Martin. A total of 34 persons will be recruited and they will be randomly allocated to aquatic or land based training. All training programmes will be conducted at the section of physical therapy and training will be done two times per week for 6 weeks. Baseline assessments will be done independent evaluators for lower limb power using the Standing Broad Jump and Vertical Jump Test, anaerobic power using the Running Anaerobic Sprint test, agility using the Illinois agility and T tests, flexibility using the Sit and Reach Test and performance during game play on wet artificial turf in relation to time-motion analysis for total distance covered, and total time, average and maximum pace, average and maximum heart rate, time in heart zones 1-5, and changes in rate of perceived exertion.</detailed_description>
