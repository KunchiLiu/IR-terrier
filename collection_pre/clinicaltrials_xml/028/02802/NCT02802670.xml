	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized study to determine the excretion kinetics and mass balance of GDC-0810, and to determine metabolites present in blood, feces, and urine in healthy participants following a single 300-milligram (mg) oral dose of GDC-0810 containing approximately 100 microcuries of [14C] labeled GDC-0810 using conventional absorption, metabolism, and excretion (AME) methodology. The entire duration of the study is up to approximately 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
