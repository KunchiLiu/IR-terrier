	<brief_summary>The drug effects will be studied after a single dose of 50 milligram (mg) albiglutide and a single dose of 10 microgram exenatide, to gain insight into the central mechanisms of nausea associated with Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. This study will explore the potential differences at the expected time of maximum concentration (Cmax) between a long-acting (albiglutide) and short-acting (exenatide) GLP-1R agonist in brain activation of healthy volunteers assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a phase IV, 2-part, 2-period crossover (session), single dose, randomized, single blind (blinded to both the subject and the imaging evaluators analysing the MRI data), placebo- and active-controlled study in adult healthy volunteers who are susceptible to motion sickness. Part A and Part B are the same in design, both consisting of a screening stage, a dosing/assessment stage, and a follow-up visit. Data from Part A will inform progression, methods, and analysis plan for Part B. Each sequence includes three scanning visits: albiglutide plus scan, exenatide plus scan and an off-therapy -natural history scan with a 6-9 week washout period between the dosing scans. A total of 24 to 28 subjects will be randomized in the study (Part A and Part B). The cross over design is divided into 2 sessions and schedule is as follow, on Day 1 (either Session 1 (S1) or Session 2 (S2) per, if randomized) subject will under go an off-therapy MRI scan, on Day 5 subject will receive a single dose of 50 mg albiglutide or albiglutide placebo, and Day 8 subject will receive a single dose of 10 microgram exenatide or saline placebo followed by a post-dose MRI scan. At each session subject will receive only one active drug (albiglutide or exenatide).</brief_summary>
