	<brief_title>A Trial of SB-061 in Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis may include periodic intra-articular injections of corticosteroids or viscosupplements such as hyaluronic acid. SB-061 is anticipated to relieve osteoarthritis pain by reinforcing the cartilage matrix and providing a lubricating coating of the cartilage. Subjects will receive 2 intra-articular injections of either SB-061 or placebo and be followed for 3 months to evaluate pain amelioration. Subjects and Investigators are blinded to treatment allocation.</detailed_description>
