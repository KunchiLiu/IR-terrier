	<brief_summary>The study investigated the 24-hour efficacy and ocular surface health with preservative-free tafluprost and a combined preservative-free regimen (tafluprost and dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination) in open-angle glaucoma patients insufficiently controlled on latanoprost monotherapy and showing signs, or symptoms of ocular surface disease with preservative-containing latanoprost monotherapy. This trial randomized open-angle glaucoma patients insufficiently controlled (IOP &gt; 20 mm Hg) on branded, or generic latanoprost monotherapy who required further IOP reduction and who demonstrated clinical signs, or symptoms of ocular surface disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Openangle glaucoma patients (primary openangle glaucoma, exfoliative, or pigmentary glaucoma) insufficiently controlled on branded, or generic latanoprost monotherapy (IOP &gt; 20 mm Hg as determined by 2 separate IOP measurements at 10:00 ± 1 hour) Patients with signs, or symptoms of ocular surface disease. Only those openangle glaucoma subjects who, according to the opinion of the principal investigator, require further IOP reduction. Patients must have demonstrated at least 20% IOP reduction at 10:00 (± 1 hour) and who are treated with branded, or generic latanoprost monotherapy for at least 3 months. Only subjects with openangle glaucoma that have exhibited (prior to latanoprost therapy) untreated, sitting IOP evaluated with Goldmann tonometry between 2539 mm Hg at 10:00 (± 1 hour). Age between 2185 years Mild to moderate glaucomatous disc damage and visual field loss (less than 12 dB mean deviation visual field loss attributed to glaucoma Those with 0.8 or better vertical cuptodisc ratio and visual acuity greater than 0.1 in the study eye. Open anterior chamber angles. Those who have to demonstrate a reliable visual field (at least two visual fields with less than 20% fixation losses, false positives, or negatives) Patients who understand study instructions, are willing to attend all followup appointments and will comply with study medication usage. Exclusion criteria Patients with a history of less than 10% IOP decrease on any IOPlowering medication. Those with evidence of concurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, or uveitis in either eye. Subjects with a history of inadequate adherence; intolerance, or contraindication to either prostaglandins, βblockers, dorzolamide, or benzalconium chloride (BAK) Patients with severe ocular surface disease, previous intraocular conventional or laser surgery in the study eye (within 6 months prior to enrolment); previous history of ocular trauma; use of corticosteroids (within 3 months before the enrolment) and use of contact lenses. Those that on baseline examination show clinical evidence of inflammation, signs of ocular infection (except blepharitis), signs of any corneal abnormality that will affect subsequent IOP measurements Subjects that show unwillingness to participate in the trial. Females of childbearing potential or lactating mothers.</criteria>
