	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a minimal intervention on risk perception of physical inactivity in patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) and patients at risk for CHD. Therefore half of the patients (intervention group) get a personal feedback on their individual level of physical activity measured by pedometers and self-report questionnaires plus information about the risk factor 'physical inactivity' for heart diseases. Following the hypotheses the feedback should increase the patients risk perception of physical inactivity and furthermore increase physical activity.</brief_summary>
