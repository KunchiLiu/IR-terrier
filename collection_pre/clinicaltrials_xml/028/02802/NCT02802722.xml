	<brief_summary>Previous research has shown that people who have been hospitalised for pneumonia are more likely to die of conditions such as heart attacks, stroke and cancer in the weeks to months after their illness. This risk is linked to raised levels of inflammation. Laboratory research shows that vitamin D can help to clear inflammation. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in the United Kingdom. The investigators are conducting this study to find out if taking vitamin D can hasten long-term recovery from pneumonia by reducing inflammation.</brief_summary>
