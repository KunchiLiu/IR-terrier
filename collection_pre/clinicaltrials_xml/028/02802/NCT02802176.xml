	<brief_title>Comparing Intra-vaginal Culture of Embryos to In-vitro Culture of Embryos With Minimal Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase IV, single center randomized controlled trial evaluating intra-vaginal culture using INVOcell versus traditional IVF using oral stimulation or minimal gonadotropin stimulation protocols. The pilot aims to includes 40 women who will be randomized to either the intra-vaginal culture group (N=20) using INVOcell or to the traditional IVF group (N=20). Primary aim is implantation rate, which is defined by number gestational sacs seen on early pregnancy ultrasound divided by number of embryos transferred. Secondary aims are: - Embryo quality, which is measured by the Gardner grading system. - Fertilization rate, which is defined by the total number of fertilized oocytes divided by total number of mature oocytes retrieved. This comparison will take place on day-3, as that is when the IVC embryos will be assessed. - Clinical pregnancy rate, which is defined by the number of fetal poles with heartbeat seen on ultrasound divided by the number of embryos transferred. - Live birth rate, which is defined by the number of living babies delivered divided by the number of transfers</detailed_description>
