	<detailed_description>Introduction: The advent of endosseous implant restoration has driven an increasing need for alveolar bone preservation and/or augmentation strategies. Urist's experiments (1960's) suggested the possibility of extracellular matrix proteins influence on bone induction (BIP). Later research has expanded this concept into a whole library of biologics. Investigations have explored the physical scaffold effects of a wide variety of bone graft materials with each graft material offering a more or less attractive surface for bone deposition. The seeding of these scaffolds with biologically active material seeks to enhance this "osteoconductive" effect further by influencing the temporal or sequential steps which result in the desired end product-new bone. The final desired construct in the graft compartment seems to involve: active cells, a "conductive" physical scaffold and a secondary scaffold consisting of a mixture of extracellular, structural or bioactive components. Alveolar socket grafts are a common example of these preservation techniques. They are an accepted procedure to maximize the retention of alveolar bone post extraction of the tooth. The basic technique involves a conservative approach to tooth removal (minimal traumatic extraction) with maximum retention of the bone socket walls. This is followed by curettage of fibrous /infected soft tissue and irrigation with normal saline or water. The socket is then filled with a variety of calcified graft material which acts as a passive scaffold for clot retention and subsequent bone regeneration. (Left ungrafted: 25% decrease in width of bone during the first year after tooth loss and an overall 4 mm decrease in height may occur in the maxillary arch and a fourfold greater loss may be observed in the mandible. Reference Book - Contemporary Implant dentistry 3rd edition, 2008; Author: Misch). Adding a secondary soft tissue scaffold (e.g. endothelial seeding) to influence the quality and rate of activity is a recent variation aimed at promoting further induction of the healing process and this might be stimulated by addition of known bioactive agents. The current pilot research project explores the addition of a known Bioactive Agent: Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) into the completed "socket graft" to test its impact on healing responses. Histomorphometric and qualitative assessments will be utilized on microscopic slide material derived from cores trephined as the initial step in the osteotomy preparation for placement of endosseous dental implants. Null Hypothesis: There is no difference on healing response in sockets using A Bioactive Agent into the completed socket graft versus placebo. M&amp;M: Design: Split mouth RCT (Randomized controlled trial) Patient evaluation and selection: Inclusion criteria: Patients will be selected from the pool of periodontal patients at BUSDM (Boston University School of Dental Medicine) who have been treatment planned for two extractions which will be at least one tooth apart in either arch (maxilla or mandible) followed by delayed 3-4 months dental implant placement. Subjects will be in age group 20-80 years of age. Exclusion Criteria: Patients with known systemic disorders affecting bone Example - Osteoporosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Hyperthyroidism, Arthritis, smokers and pregnant women will be excluded. Procedures: Standard clinical evaluation including but not limited to pre-operative radiographs and periodontal charting will be required. After acceptance of entry into the study a separate informed consent will be acquired along with indexed radiographs and photographs of the test and the control sites. The side to be assigned as a test or control will be decided by opening a sealed envelope with the side of the active listed. Envelopes will be prepared in advance and numbered sequentially. After the graft procedures, indexed radiographs and photos will be taken immediately after extraction/graft placement, at time of core acquisition/implant placement, and at time of implant abutment (usually 3-4 months post placement). Patient will be followed clinically for 1 year to monitor post op sequelae if any. Graft Procedure: At time of extraction the site will be asked to rinse with 0.12% Chlorhexidine, and anesthetized with 2% lidocaine and 1/100,000 epinephrine. Extraction will be done as usual standard of care to preserve socket walls. Sites requiring socket wall repair at time of extraction will be excluded from study. Sockets will be measured at all 4 line angles for depth with the same periodontal probe, Buccal-Lingual dimension will be measured prior to graft placement. Graft material (mineralized cortical/cancellous Bone Powder 250-1000µ) will be used for both sites. Volume of graft used will be recorded. Both sites will be filled slightly below marginal bone level (1mm). Test site will be injected with Bioactive Agent. At 3 levels apical 1/3rd, middle 1/3rd and coronal 1/3rd. Control site will be injected with saline (or vehicle) at same levels. Occlusal orifice will be closed with Collagen plug adjusted for depth to meet free gingival margins and then sutured with 4-0 Polyglactin (Vicryl) Post op care: Sites will be checked and photographed at 1 week, 2 weeks (sutures removed) and clinical photos taken to monitor clinical signs of inflammation and healing. A 3-month post op radiograph appointment will be made at the 2-week visit. Ct scan may be taken if prescribed by treatment plan/ prior to implant placement. Implant/core acquisition at time of Implant placement: Clinical photographs will be taken. (Post graft radiograph already done at 3 months) Site will be opened with standard full thickness flap entry. After soft tissue reflection photo will be taken and implant site marked with a standardized round bur to ½ depth of bur (~ 0.5-1.0 mm). Sites requiring a 4, 5, or 6mm implant will have trephined core as first step in osteotomy (3.3mm OD-2-8mmID) Trephine will be centered over site mark and osteotomy and prepared to prescribed depth. The trephine core will be photographed with periodontal probe included for reference of length, apical end marked with India ink and then placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and labeled with patient name, date, record # and length of core. Details of implant placement will be recorded with size of implant and insertion torque in record. Post-implant care: Standard of care post op sequence will be followed, once adequate healing period has elapsed healing cap that was screwed onto the implant is removed and replaced with appropriately shaped abutment. The entire procedure will be photographed and the usual post abutment radiograph will be taken at that time. Outcomes: The following outcomes will be measured: Clinical Observation: Loss of particles at one week (measure depth at center of the socket orifice with periodontal probe) Closure of socket orifice (pre and post measurement with periodontal probe) Microscopic measures will be made on H&amp;E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) and TRAP (Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) 6-u section along vertical axis of core on contiguous fields at 100X Quantitative: - Measures of Total Mineralized compartment - Total Bone (TB) - Measures of residual graft material/ area (GP) - New bone formation(NB) = TB - GP - Measures of vascular content - Arteriole, Venule, Area, Size, Number - Osteoclast count - TRAP stain Qualitative: -Measures of other marrow components (Cells and relative fiber/ fat content, liner cell characteristics.) Laboratory Preparation: Cores will be delivered to processing technician with name, location and date of acquisition, pre -processing measure of length and crestal/apical orientation. Identity of core will be masked with a process number by the technician to allow blind evaluation. The coded list will be stored until required. Cores will be decalcified in EDTA (Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid), and then prepared for staining H&amp;E and Trap. Histomorphometric analysis: Paraffin blocks will be cut parallel to long axis of core at 6 microns in serial sections. The first 500 microns of the core (about ¼ core diameter) will be removed to achieve a section width of 2-2.5mm. This allows slightly more than 1 field diameter at 100X with a light microscope. The next quarter of the core will be cut in 3 ribbons of 21 sections and the 1rst, 10th, 20th sections of each ribbon were mounted on a slide for H&amp;E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) staining. A parallel series of three slides using 2nd, 11th, and 21st sections of each ribbon will be mounted for TRAP stain (tartrate resistant acid-phosphatase). Three ribbons with three sections per ribbon yielded 8-9 sections per specimen for evaluation with a maximum distance between sections of 60 u and total ~360 u width of sample. The remainder of the block will be saved. The number coded slides will be submitted to the evaluator for measures of bone (total bone area (TB), graft particle area (GP) and for number, area, and type of blood vessel (Arteriole vs Venular). Qualitative evaluation will be made of marrow content (Fat vs Fibrous) and status of liner cell population (heavy brick like or thin and stretched) osteoclast counts will be done by hand count on TRAP stained slides by moving to step at 100 X and then evaluating right and left sides of field at 200X Measures of bone area/field (New bone = Total bone - graft particle size), vascular content (Vascular content will be measured for type, area, diameter per field) and osteoclasts will be made at contiguous steps of 1.5-2mm along vertical axis of core from crestal end to apical end. (This should result in 3-4 steps for each core along vertical) Measurements will be made at 100X with Image Pro Plus version 4.51 or similar for bone and vascular measures and at 200x for osteoclasts. Statistical Analysis of Measures After analysis of these preliminary measures the code list will be accessed for patient ID and the pairs will be identified for analysis in respective groups. Summary descriptive statistics and tables will be used for comparison and display of data. Paired t tests will evaluate means of test versus control sides for continuous data and chi-square for categorical data.</detailed_description>
