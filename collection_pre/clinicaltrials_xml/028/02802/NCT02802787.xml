	<brief_title>Implementation and Evaluation of an Activity Program to Improve Quality of Life Outcomes in Women Diagnosed With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study will focus on developing and implementing two one-week activity camps in the summer of 2016 for women diagnosed with cancer. One camp will be held in West Philadelphia and another in Camden, New Jersey, both of which have been identified as underserved areas for health access. The focus of this programming is to allow women to engage in activities they may not be engaged in since the diagnosis of cancer and to provide them with opportunities to socially interact and communicate with individuals who may have encountered the same difficulties as them. Quality of life, pain and fatigue information will be collected before, during and after implementation of the activity program. The main objective is to demonstrate improved life satisfaction, decreased pain and decreased fatigue (with evidenced gathered at three consecutive periods and geographical locations through Quality of Life, Pain and Fatigue surveys). The intended sample size is 57 women.</detailed_description>
