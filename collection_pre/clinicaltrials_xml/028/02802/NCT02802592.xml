	<brief_title>EPOgen and Restrictive Transfusions in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery (EPORT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator proposes a study investigating the use of restrictive transfusion triggers and administration of single preoperative high dose shot of epoetin alfa (rhEPO) in a young (age &lt; 65 years of age) population undergoing cardiac surgery. The investigator believes that participants can tolerate a lower Hemoglobin (Hgb). Therefore, the control group will benefit from a restrictive transfusion trigger and experimental group will benefit from EPO providing a synergistic stimulus for erythropoiesis. This proposed study has potential to reduce overall transfusion utilization in cardiac surgery and improve standard of care.</detailed_description>
