	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to induce a peptide-specific immune response in chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) patients by multi-peptide vaccination with a patient-individualized peptide cocktail and, dependent on minimal residual disease (MRD) status, the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient-individualized Peptide Vaccination in Combination With Lenalidomide After First Line Therapy of CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Duration and Schedule: The duration of the trial for each subject is expected to be 24 months. The duration for each individual patient includes 6 months first-line therapy according to treating physicians choice with HLA ligandome analyses of chronic lymphatic leukaemia cells and selection of patient-individual multi-peptide vaccine being performed in parallel, 12 months study treatment and 6 months follow-up time. The overall duration of the trial is expected to be approximately 4 years including preparatory phase. Recruitment of subjects will start in 06/2016. The end of study is determined as the date of the last visit of the last patient (Last Subject Out (LSO) 01/2020). General Criteria for Subject Selection: For the screening procedures of this study, physically fit subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of a chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) according to the International Workshop on chronic lymphatic leukaemia (IWCLL) guidelines requiring treatment are eligible. First line treatment will be performed according to treating physicians choice. The trial population will consist of both genders. Gender distribution in the trial is supposed to reflect the distribution in the real patient's population (approximately 60% male and 40% female patients), i.e. there will be no prior defined quantitative ratio between females and males. To assure that the included patients have the ability to mount an immune response, immune response to an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)/ Cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide mix will be assessed in the screening phase. 60ml blood will be taken at the prescreening study visit. Peripheral mononuclear cells will be isolated and analysed in a 12 day IFNy ELiSPOT for memory T cell response to an EBV/CMV peptide mix. Only patients showing a positive immune response will be included in the study. For the study treatment, physically fit subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL according to the IWCLL guidelines, which were treated with a first line therapy according to physicians choice. Subjects must have achieved at least a partial remission (IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL) due to treatment with first line therapy. Study Design: Interventional, open·label, multi-center phase II trial with use of a patient·individualized multipeptide vaccine and imiquimod as adjuvant with or without the immunomodulator lenalidomide based on MRD levels in individual patients. Blinding: No blinding will be performed to avoid unnecessary complications of intradermal injections with sodium acid solution. Method against bias in patient selection: The patient selection will be documented. Reasons for refusal will be assessed.Method against bias in treatment manualized treatment protocol, monitoring and treatment reports. Method against bias in data analysis: Monitoring, analysis by intention to treat; independent statistician. Chronic lymphatic leukaemia-peptide vaccine (CLL-VAC) drug product (DP): Each patient enrolled in the individualized VAC-L-CLL trial will receive a CLL·VAC DP specifically tailored to the individual HLA ligandome of Cll cells. The DPs are composed of peptides that are first manufactured as drug substances. A process named CLL-VAC_v1 enables the selection of drug substances to compose the unique, patient-individual CLL·VAC DPs. CLL·VAC DPs will be composed based on a peptide warehouse consisting of 40 individual peptides (drug substances; 35 HLA class I peptides (5 A*01, 5 A*02, 5 A*03, 5 A*24, 5 B*07, 5 B*08, 5 B*44) and 5 HLA class II peptides. 25 HLA class I peptides and all 5 HLA class II peptides are shown to be immunogenic and therefore available for vaccine cocktail composition (5 A*01, 5 A*02, 5 A*03, 5 B*08). For each patient, 5 HLA class I peptides are selected from the warehouse based on patient individual HLA ligandome analysis of CLL cells and are subsequently formulated into the personalized drug; the 5 HLA class II peptides will be included in each 'peptide vaccine cocktail. All warehouse peptides are manufactured by BCN PEPTIDES, S.A, Eis Vinyets-Els Fogars 11,08777 Sant Quinti de Mediona (Barcelona), Spain, or by Wirkstoffpeptidlabor, University of Tubingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076 Tubingen, Germany. Both production sites hold certificates for the production of good manufacture practice (GMP) grade synthetic peptides. All peptides are synthetic peptides, which will be manufactured by well·established solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) procedures using Fmoc chemistry.</detailed_description>
