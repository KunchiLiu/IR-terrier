	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Minocin® (minocycline) for injection in healthy adult subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Minocin® (Minocycline) for Injection in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to collect safety, tolerability, and PK data on ascending dose regimens of Minocin® (minocycline) for Injection. The safety, tolerability, and PK data will support the compound as a potential clinical candidate in Europe and allow recommendations of dose levels to be used in future Phase 2/3 studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A signed informed consent form, the ability to understand the study conduct and tasks that are required for study participation, and a willingness to cooperate with all tasks, tests, and examinations as required by the protocol, whether in the research unit or after discharge, for the duration of the study; 2. Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive; 3. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 45 kg/m2; 4. Subject is in good health based on medical history and physical examination findings and has no clinically meaningful safety laboratory abnormalities (Haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) or 12lead ECG results, as assessed by the Principal Investigator (PI); 5. Vital signs (BP, pulse and temperature) measured at screening/baseline must be within the following ranges: SBP ≥90 to ≤150 mm Hg, DBP ≥45 to ≤90 mm Hg; Heart Rate ≥ 45 to ≤90 bpm (taken after resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes); 6. Expectation that intravenous access will be sufficient to allow for ease of study drug infusion, and for all protocol required blood sampling to take place; 7. Subject commits to remaining admitted in the research unit for the course of the study; 8. Female subject is surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or if of childbearing potential, agrees to abstinence or to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, barrier methods, etc.) or male partner sterilization alone, between randomization and for 7 days after the completion of the study. 1. Subjects that have known active hepatitis B or C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or has known immune deficiency disease at screening; 2. Blood or plasma donation within past 2 months; 3. Surgery within 48 hours prior to randomization or surgery planned during the study period; 4. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who have a positive pregnancy test result at the Screening Visit; 5. Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth control during the entire study period (i.e., condom with spermicide, where locally available); 6. Presence of known raised intracranial pressure; 7. Use of isotretinoin; 8. History of significant hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to tetracycline antibiotics; 9. Receipt of any investigational medication or investigational device during the last 30 days prior to randomization; 10. Treatment with any prescription or OTC drugs, within 2 weeks or five halflives, whichever is longer, or herbal nutritional supplements within 2 weeks of screening, with the exception of acetaminophen/paracetamol for minor headache. Subjects will not be allowed to receive medications for the duration of the study (except the abovementioned acetaminophen/paracetamol). Birth control or other hormone replacement is also permitted as long as it has been taken at a stable dose for at least three months before the Screening Visit and remains stable for the duration of the study; 11. A corrected QT (Fridericia) (QTcF) &gt;480 msec.</criteria>
