	<brief_title>Safety And Efficacy Of Topical Platelet Rich Plasma And Thrombin Coagulum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rationale In normal wound healing, platelets activate macrophages to produce endogenous platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and other growth factors which are responsible for would healing. In chronic wounds, macrophage activation is suppressed which leads to an inappropriate growth factor response causing failure of positive autocrine feedback loop which normally controls the healing process. The regular application of exogenous PRP and Thrombin, to chronic wounds, restores the autocrine feedback loop of tissue repair which appears to accelerate the normal cascade of tissue repair Objectives - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRP/Thrombin mixture in treating chronic venous ulcers - To evaluate efficacy of PRP/Thrombin mixture in treating chronic venous ulcers</detailed_description>
