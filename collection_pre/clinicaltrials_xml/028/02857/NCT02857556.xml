	<brief_summary>The principal objective of this study is to qualify markers of oxidative stress in inflammatory cells (monocytes) in patients with stage 3 kidney failure (diabetic or not), and patients with end-stage kidney failure (diabetic or not), who require dialysis. The evaluation of these markers will be done by the activation and localization of proteins implicated in vascular tone and oxidative stress in monocytes, correlated with the distribution of cholesterol sphingomyelin within planar rafts and caveolae. The aim is to describe their evolution under treatment, which could lead to interventional studies.</brief_summary>
