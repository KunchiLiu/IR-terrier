	<detailed_description>There is a high prevalence of physical inactivity (AF) in the world and in Brazil. Offering programs of physical activity becomes a convenient option to increase the physical activity level of the population and promote aging process more active and healthy over the life. There is need for greater depth in relation to the operation of programs to promote physical activity and the effects of these programs on different biopsychosocial aspects, especially those offered in primary care settings. This research aims to evaluate a walking program geared to adults and seniors on the following aspects: 1. Characteristics and operation of the intervention, 2. effects of behavior change to physical activity, and 3. biopsychosocial effects of physical activity. It is a quasi experimental and controlled study, with: 1) intervention group (n = 71), 2) and control group (n = 71). The intervention will last for six months, with a subsequent follow-up period of six months after the intervention. The program will offer supervised exercise twice a week, lasting an hour. The classes will consist of recreational activities, walking and educational strategies of behavior change for physical activity. Variables will be evaluated for attendance, barriers to physical activity, waiver reasons, physical activity level, sociodemographic, socioeconomic and biopsychosocial aspects. Most females, aged over 40 years, low levels of education, income and varied biopsychosocial characteristics are expected. After the intervention, it is expected that the program present characteristics of low adhesion and retention, especially because of the barrier "lack of time". Still, the promotion of supervised walking increase levels of physical activity beyond the time provided by the program and it will improve the biopsychosocial conditions of the participants.</detailed_description>
