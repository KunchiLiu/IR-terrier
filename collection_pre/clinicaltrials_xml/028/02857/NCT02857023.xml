	<brief_summary>Disease-related neurocognitive deficits are common in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD). These deficits can significantly disrupt otherwise normal trajectories toward academic and vocational achievement and negatively impact psychosocial outcomes. Despite widespread recognition of neurocognitive deficits, there are no treatments shown to maintain or recover functioning once a child with SCD endures neuronal damage. Cognitive training (CT) has been a standard intervention used to stabilize and recover functioning in individuals with accidental or disease-related brain injury. Recent advances in technology have led to the development of computerized CT programs. This study seeks to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using computerized CT with pediatric patients with SCD. Children and adolescents with SCD between the ages of 7 and 16 years old (n = 80) will be recruited to complete a randomized (intervention or waitlist-control) home-based computerized CT program (Cogmed). Feasibility will be assessed by examining participation, retention, and program completion rates, as well as feedback from a feasibility and acceptability questionnaire and a brief qualitative interview. Participants will also complete assessments of attention, working memory, and academic fluency at baseline and immediately following the intervention. A final assessment will be conducted 6 months after the conclusion of the intervention to evaluate the stability of treatment effects.</brief_summary>
