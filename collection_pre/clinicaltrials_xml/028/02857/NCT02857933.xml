	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal frequency and intensity of physical therapy for children with cerebral palsy aged 6 to 24 months of age. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: daily, intermediate, or weekly physical therapy. Short and long term effects will be evaluated to determine the best 'dose' of rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy, including frequency (number of sessions per week and the number of weeks), intensity (how hard the patient works), and time (how many total hours) of rehabilitation treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daily and Weekly Rehabilitation Delivery for Young Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determining optimal frequency of treatment for young children with cerebral palsy (CP) has implications for shaping the future of pediatric rehabilitation. There are wide variations in the number of hours per week of treatment in current outpatient rehabilitation programs for children with CP, suggesting clinical uncertainty. Usual weekly therapy at 1 - 2 hours per week for 6 months or longer is the most commonly implemented frequency of dose for children with CP 6 - 24 months of age. However, this decision about frequency is often made based on clinical reasoning and scheduling, not on principles of rehabilitation, child development, or evidence from strongly designed randomized controlled trials. The proposed study will fill this gap by directly comparing the effects of 3 frequency levels of therapy - concentrated daily, intermediate, and usual weekly in children with CP 6 - 24 months of age at the initiation of treatment and following these patients for 2 years. In this prospective longitudinal study, children with Cerebral Palsy (n=75), 6 - 24 months of age, will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: daily, intermediate, or weekly physical therapy. The treatment phase of this study design is 5 months for a total of 40 hours of one-on-one therapy for both groups. Level 1 daily therapy is 2 hours of therapy per day for 20 straight weekdays. Level 2 intermediate therapy is 2 hours of therapy per day 3 days per week for 6.6 weeks. Level 3 usual weekly therapy is 2 hours of therapy one day per week for 20 weeks. Researchers will directly compare the effects of 3 these frequency levels of therapy at the initiation of treatment and following these patients for 2 years. Results will provide quantitative evidence of frequency-response, which is critical for informing clinical decision-making, health policy, and guidelines for reimbursement.</detailed_description>
