BMI within the range of 1930 kg/m2 (inclusive). Deemed able to read and understand English in order to communicate with research staff and complete protocol required questionnaires and forms. Has a laboratory value at the Screening Visit that is outside the normal range, unless it is judged by the Investigator as not clinically significant after appropriate evaluation. One repeat of initial laboratory testing is allowed. AST, ALT and ALP tests in excess of 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Any gastrointestinal condition that could affect drug absorption. History of any clinically significant condition involving the bladder or urinary tract, including frequent urinary tract infections (e.g. &gt; 2 per year), or current symptoms of bladder irritation such as frequent or urgent need to urinate or burning with urination. History (within the last six months) of or current clinically significant psychiatric disorder including anxiety, psychosis or depression.

History of hypersensitivity to ketamine or any of the excipients of Wafermineâ„¢. Intake of any prescribed or OverTheCounter (OTC)/nonprescribed drugs, vitamins, supplements or herbal medicines, within 2 weeks of administration of investigational product (or longer if the medication has a halflife long enough to potentially expose the healthy participant to any significant systemic exposure). Exception: Hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives in female participants is allowed. Use of drugs with enzymeinducing properties, such as rifampicin and St John's Wort, within 3 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is greater, prior to treatment period 1 and throughout the study, or any drug known to be a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 within 5 halflives of treatment period 1 and throughout the study. Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational agent within 30 days of screening. Positive serology for hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Clinically significant, as determined by the Investigator, abnormal ECG (12lead) or vital signs at the screening visit or predose on any treatment day.
