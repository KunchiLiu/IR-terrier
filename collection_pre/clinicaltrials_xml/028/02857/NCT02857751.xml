	<brief_title>Evaluation of Outcomes Following Surf Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study would evaluate whether an existing surf therapy program that is part of the Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Wellness Program at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), significantly reduces both psychological symptoms (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety, negative affect, lack of positive affect) and physical symptoms (e.g., pain, sleep) among active-duty service members. Psychological and physical symptoms will be assessed before beginning the surf program and at program completion. In addition, brief assessments of mood and symptoms will be completed before and after each individual surf therapy session.</detailed_description>
