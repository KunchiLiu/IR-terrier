	<brief_title>Postoperative Supplemental Oxygen in Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of high concentration supplemental postoperative oxygen therapy on short-term and long-term results of liver transplantation, particularly with respect to infections and biliary complications. A total of 296 patients immediately after liver transplantation will be randomly assigned to receive either 80% (high concentration) or 28% (controls) fraction of inspired oxygen for 6 hours after surgery with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients will be blinded to the type of received intervention. Randomization will be stratified by the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification. Both groups will be compared to short- and long-term outcome measures.</detailed_description>
