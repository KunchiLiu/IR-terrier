	<brief_summary>Comparison of changes in diastolic pulmonary artery pressure as measured by CardioMEMS™ to impedance parameters as measured by ImpediMed's BIS technology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioimpedance Spectroscopy Compared to CardioMEMS™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single-arm, observational, non-randomized clinical study that will enroll patients with heart failure who have had a CardioMEMS™ device implanted to monitor their diastolic pulmonary artery pressure. The study will recruit and enroll ten participants from the Scripps Clinic. Participants will be monitored 3 times a week for a period of 4 weeks. At each monitoring visit, the patient's diastolic pulmonary artery pressure will be measured by CardioMEMS™ and the ImpediMed's BIS technology. Participant's vital signs and weight will also be taken at each monitoring visit.</detailed_description>
