	<brief_title>Epidural Dexamethasone for Labor Analgesia: the Effects on Ropivacaine Consumption and Labour Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is hypothesized that reducing the consumption of local anesthetics during labor epidural analgesia could lower their side effects (rate of motor block, nausea and emesis during labor, maternal hypotension, maternal fever) and improve the duration of the second part of the labor, and the new-born adaptation to child-birth and during the first 24 hours. The use of instruments for assisted vaginal delivery and the needs to perform emergency cesarean could also be impacted. The efficacy of the dexamethasone will be assessed by the hourly Ropivacaine consumption (milligrams/hour) measured from randomization time to the end of epidural analgesia.</detailed_description>
