	<brief_summary>Child maltreatment, particularly neglect, disproportionally affects low-income children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and has serious short and long-term consequences. Currently, few replicable, evidence-based preventive services exist for such families, particularly within the context of the patient-centered medical home. Child Abuse Prevention Problem Solving (CAPPS), a targeted problem solving intervention that addresses key risk and protective factors for child neglect, has the potential to improve key parenting skills and overall wellbeing, ultimately improving outcomes for high-risk children. This study is a multi-center randomized controlled efficacy trial of CAPPS to determine the impact on child neglect, adherence to recommended medical care, and family stressors and strengths.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Child maltreatment, particularly neglect, disproportionally affects low-income CSHCN and has serious short and long-term consequences. Currently, few replicable, evidence-based preventive services exist for such families, particularly within the context of the patient-centered medical home. CAPPS, a targeted problem solving intervention that addresses key risk and protective factors for child neglect, has the potential to improve key parenting skills and overall wellbeing, ultimately improving outcomes for high-risk children. This is a multi-center randomized controlled efficacy trial of Child Abuse Prevention Problem Solving (CAPPS), a targeted intervention designed to address specific stressors faced by low-income parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and to enhance family strengths previously been shown to reduce the risk of maltreatment. The study will enroll 250 parents of CSHCN who receive primary care in a network of urban patient-centered medical homes. The specific research aims are to 1: Decrease referrals to child protective services for neglect and increase adherence to recommended medical care; and 2: Decrease perceived social isolation, difficulty navigating complex services, and caregiver burden and enhance family strengths, including parental resilience, social connections, access to support in times of need, and knowledge of parenting and child development.</detailed_description>
