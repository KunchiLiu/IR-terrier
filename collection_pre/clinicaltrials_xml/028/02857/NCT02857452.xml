	<brief_summary>The evaluation of lupus patients must include several approaches, in particular disease activity and quality of life. The Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) is a validated self-questionnaire to evaluate disease activity. It has the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use in large cohorts and has been used in several studies. It has never been validated in French. The Lupus Quality Of Life (LupusQoL) is a self-questionnaire to evaluate quality of life and is specific to systemic lupus erythematous; it was developed from interviews with patients. This tool, validated in a British population, has never been validated in French.</brief_summary>
