	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, controlled and observational study. Participants underwent a 3-hour exposure to hypoxic conditions simulating an altitude of 4,000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) in a hypobaric pressure chamber. Clinical parameters, as well as blood and stool samples and biopsies from the sigmoid colon (by sigmoidoscopy) are collected at subsequent time points. The investigators goal is to evaluate if a 3-hour stay at high altitude (4, 000 m) can alter disease activity and can modulate a pro inflammatory reaction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the potential influence of hypoxia on the course of IBD on a biomolecular level, and to test the effects of hypoxia under standardized conditions, the investigators initiated a prospective and controlled investigation in healthy controls and IBD patients in stable remission. the investigators primary aim is to show that a 3-hour stay at high altitude can alter disease activity of IBD. Ten healthy volunteers, 11 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 9 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients underwent a 3-hour exposure to hypoxic conditions simulating an altitude of 4,000 m.a.s.l. in a hypobaric low-pressure chamber situated at the Swiss Aeromedical Center, Dubendorf, Switzerland. Stool samples for the analysis of calprotectin and microbiotal composition, biopsy samples from the rectosigmoid region, and blood samples were repetitively collected and analysed in conjunction with detailed records of clinical symptoms over a subsequent interval of 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
