	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK1358820 in Japanese patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) with urinary incontinence, whose symptoms have not been adequately managed with medications for urinary incontinence due to NDO. This study consists of a screening phase up to 28 days followed by a double-blind Treatment phase 1 of 12 to 48 weeks wherein subjects will receive a single treatment of either GSK1358820 200 Units (U) injection or placebo injection. After the first treatment, subjects who meet the re-treatment criteria between 12 to 36 weeks can enter an open-label Treatment phase 2 to receive a second treatment with GSK1358820 200 U. Subjects will be permitted to receive re-treatment up to 2 times, and there should be a gap of minimum of 12 weeks since the previous treatment. The duration of overall treatment phases is 48 weeks. The total duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including screening.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged &gt;=20 years at the time of signing the informed consent Subject has urinary incontinence as a result of neurogenic detrusor overactivity for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening as a result of spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, determined by documented subject history. In addition: 1. Spinal cord injury subjects must have a stable neurological injury level at T1 or below (cervical injuries are excluded) occurring &gt;=6 months prior to screening. 2. Multiple sclerosis subjects must be clinically stable in the investigator's opinion, for &gt;=3 months prior to screening and have an Expanded Disability Status Scale score &lt;=6.5 Subject has NDO for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening, determined by documented subject history. The presence of an involuntary detrusor contractions (IDC) must also be demonstrated during the urodynamic assessment during the screening period or Day 1 (prior to randomization). Subject has not been adequately managed with one or more medications (i.e., anticholinergics or beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist) for treatment of urinary incontinence due to NDO . Not adequately managed is defined as: An inadequate response after at least a 4week period of medication(s) for urinary incontinence due to NDO on an optimized dose(s), i.e., subject is still incontinent despite medication(s) for urinary incontinence due to NDO, or Limiting side effects (i.e., condition that subject reduced dosage or discontinued the medication due to side effect) after at least a 2week period of medication(s) for urinary incontinence due to NDO on an optimized dose(s) Subject has &gt;=6 episodes of urinary incontinence, with no more than one urgency incontinencefree day in the 3day subject bladder diary completed during the screening phase Subject currently uses or is willing to use clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) to empty the bladder (indwelling catheter is not permitted). Subjects currently on CIC should be willing to maintain a CIC schedule of at least 3 times per day throughout the study. Caregiver may perform CIC. Body weight &gt;=40 kilogram (kg) at screening Males or females： 1. Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until the study exit: Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. Male condom plus partner use of one of following the contraceptive options:Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; or oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception 2. Female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine or serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: • Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy, Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. • Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until the study exit. This list of highly effective methods (approved in Japan) is provided below, and it does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis: Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Subject has given signed informed consent, including compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol (e.g., complete bladder diaries and questionnaires, is able to collect volume voided per micturition measurements over a 24hour period, and attend all study visits in the opinion of the investigator(or subinvestigator). Subject has a history or evidence of any diseases, functional abnormalities or bladder surgery, other than NDO, that may have affected bladder function including but not limited to: 1. Bladder stones (including bladder stone surgery) within 6 months prior to screening or confirmed occurrence of bladder stones at the screening phase 2. Surgery (including minimally invasive surgery) within 1 year of screening for stress incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse 3. Current use of an electrostimulation/neuromodulation device for treatment of urinary incontinence. Note: Use of any implantable device is prohibited within 4 weeks prior to initiation of Screening phase and throughout the study period. Use of any external device is discontinued at least 7 days prior to the start of the screening phase 4. Current use of a baclofen pump 5. History of interstitial cystitis, in the opinion of the investigator (or subinvestigator) 6. Past or current evidence of hematuria due to urological/renal pathology or uninvestigated hematuria. Subjects with investigated hematuria may enter the study if urological/renal pathology has been ruled out to the satisfaction by the investigator (or subinvestigator) 7. Past or current history of bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy, positive result of urine cytology or uninvestigated suspicious urine cytology results at the Screening phase. Suspicious urine cytology abnormalities require that bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy has been ruled out to the satisfaction of the investigator according to local site practice. 8. An active genital infection, other than genital warts, either concurrently or within 4 weeks prior to Screening 9. Male with previous or current diagnosis of prostate cancer or a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of &gt;10 nanogram (ng)/milliliter (mL) at Screening. Subjects with a PSA level of &gt;= 4 ng/mL but &lt;= 10 ng/mL must have prostate cancer ruled out to the satisfaction of the investigator (or subinvestigator) according to local site practice. 10. Evidence of urethral and/or bladder outlet obstruction, in the opinion of the investigator (or subinvestigator) Subject has a serum creatinine level &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2×ULN; and bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%) at screening Subject has current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). Notes: 1. Stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis 2. Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (example, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody [HCVAb] test result within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if subject otherwise meets entry criteria QTc &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block from the result of ECG at screening. Notes: 1. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machineread or manually overread 2. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial Subject has hemophilia or other clotting factor deficiencies or disorders that cause bleeding diathesis Subject changes or initiates or discontinues anticholinergic, beta3 adrenergic receptor agonist or any other medications or therapies to treat urinary incontinence due to NDO, within 6 days prior to the start of the screening phase Subject has been treated with any intravesical pharmacologic agent (e.g., capsaicin, resiniferatoxin) for urinary incontinence due to NDO within 12 months prior to initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0) Subject has previous or current use of botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype for the treatment of any urological condition Subject has previous use within 12 weeks prior to initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0) or current use of botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype for any nonurological condition or beauty care Subject has been immunized for botulinum toxin of any serotype Subject cannot withhold any antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or medications with anticoagulative effects for 3 days prior to initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0).
