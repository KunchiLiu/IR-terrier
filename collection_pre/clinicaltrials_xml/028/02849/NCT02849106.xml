	<brief_title>Predictive Response to Chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) by ex Vivo Culture 3D Technique in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CULTURE 3D study is a prospective, open labelled, multicenter trial. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility of ex vivo culture 3D (chemogram) on biopsies in order to estimate the predictive value of this technique for treatment response in patients treated by two different chemotherapies (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) for colorectal cancer. Patients will have biopsies in a metastasis or in the primitive tumor before treatment. The sample will be used for a 3D ex vivo cells culture. A chemogram will be made based on cells proliferation data (Ki67) and apoptosis (M30). Results from this chemogram will not interfere with the treatment combination choice. The treatment response will be evaluated by the RECIST assessment and will be then compared to the chemogram.</detailed_description>
