	<brief_summary>Breast augmentation surgery can cause important postoperative pain, especially when bilateral subpectoral implants are used. The investigators hypothesized that a technique of regional analgesia, the pectoral nerve block type I (or "PECS I block") would reduce pain within the first twenty-four hours and, in turn, morphine consumption and associated side effects. This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study which compares intra and postoperative analgesia with or without PECS I block in breast surgery.</brief_summary>
