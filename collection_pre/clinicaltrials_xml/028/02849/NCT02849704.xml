	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the malabsorption blood test (MBT), stool coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and stool bomb calorimetry (BC) methods as potential screening or diagnostic tests for reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI). A further objective is to determine the test responses before and after pancreatic enzyme medication administration (Creon36™) in the patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fat Malabsorption in Chronic Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced exocrine pancreatic function or pancreatic insufficiency (RPF/PI) contributes to poor clinical outcome in a number of diseases and conditions. The incidence, mechanism and substantial adverse clinical outcomes of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) are well known in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the life sustaining role of pancreatic enzyme medication in CF care is well established. Much less is known about the incidence and impact of RPF/PI in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Reliable non-invasive screening or diagnostic tests with acceptable patient burden are not available for RPF/PI. This is a cohort study of subjects with CP who will be evaluated before and after pancreatic enzyme medication (Creon36™) administration. A cohort of healthy subjects will serve as a comparison group and will be evaluated only once. Subjects with CP will receive Creon36™, a pancreatic enzyme medication, and fat and energy absorption will be evaluated using three methods: MBT, CFA, and BC before and after administration of Creon36™. Many patients with CP are at risk for RPF/PI yet they rarely undergo diagnostic testing. Pancreatic enzyme medication will likely improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in some of those with RPF/PI. A cohort of healthy volunteers will be evaluated with the three methods to provide essential comparison data to optimize the understanding and interpretation of the findings from the three methods and the RPF/PI cohort with CP. There will be no intervention for the healthy cohort.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (CP): Chronic pancreatitis diagnosis by gastroenterologist. Participants with CP will be characterized based on the TIGARO (toxic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent, obstructive) etiology system, on pancreatic morphology (Cambridge criteria) when available, and on physiological state (exocrine and endocrine function) as recommended by the recent American Pancreatic Association Practice Guidelines4. Age 3070 years old Evidence of atrisk for malabsorption including: 1) history of use of and response to pancreatic enzyme medication; 2) history of unintentional weight loss; 3) history of increased stools per week or fatty stools; and/or 4) other clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of fat malabsorption In usual state of health for past two weeks including no change in medications Able to consume a moderate fat diet for stool evaluations Able to participate in the study for about four weeks with two study visits Inclusion Criteria (Healthy Volunteers): Age 3070 years old No known chronic disease that would affect dietary intake or fat absorption In usual state of health for past two weeks, with stable medications, diet and weight BMI from 1829 Able to consume a moderate fat diet for stool evaluations Able to participate in the study for about one week with one study visit Exclusion Criteria (CP): Evidence of normal fat absorption in medical record Medications that alter fat absorption (i.e. orlistat, other weight loss medications, ursodeoxycholic acid) Allergy to pork products History of intestinal blockage or fibrosing colonopathy History of gout, kidney disease, or high blood uric acid (hyperuricemia) Pregnancy or breast feeding Exclusion Criteria (Healthy Volunteers): Evidence of fat malabsorption Medications that alter fat absorption (i.e. orlistat, other weight loss medications, ursodeoxycholic acid) Pregnancy or breast feeding</criteria>
