	<brief_summary>Body composition analysis and especially body fat distribution in regions of interest (android and in particular intra-abdominal region) provides some information on the risk of cardiovascular disease. There is little data available on the body composition analysis in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (diseases with higher risk of cardiovascular disease), in particular data on fat distribution in regions of interest regarding the risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipokines, secreted by the adipose tissue, have pro or anti-inflammatory and metabolic properties that are interesting to explore in pathologies with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease like psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Adipokines have been investigated in psoriasis but fat tissue and in particular its distribution (android/visceral or intra-abdominal) has not been studied in parallel. Moreover, relation between adipokines and psoriasis area or severity has been studied but the relation between adipokines and cardiovascular risk factors has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate relations between the body fat distribution, adipokines rates and the risk of cardiovascular disease of these patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris or psoriasis pustulosa confirmed by a dermatologist or a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (CASPAR criteria) confirmed by a rheumatologist Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years old Control group: patients matching with sex, age ± 5 years, BMI (4 groups), coming to the same hospital for a consultation. (BMI groups : BMI &lt; 18,5 kg/m²; 18,5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24,99 kg/m²; 25≤ BMI ≤ 29,99 kg/m²; BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) Control group patients for psoriatic arthritis will be included during a rheumatologist consultation. They may have a noninflammatory common discovertebral pathology (lumbago, lumbosciatic, spinal stenosis, neck pain, cervical arthritis and cervicobrachial neuralgia). Control group patients for psoriasis will be included during a dermatologist consultation. They may have a noninflammatory skin disease (acne, acne rosacea, idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon, basal cell carcinoma, acanthosis nigricans). In case of recruitment difficulties, healthy volunteers can be included. Postmenopausal women (for at least 24 months), surgically sterilized, or for women of childbearing age, efficacy use of contraceptive methods (contraceptive pills, injections or patches, intrauterine device, doublebarrier contraception), Signature of informed consent form French social security Affiliation Pregnant woman Corticosteroid therapy &gt;10 mg of prednisone or equivalent /day Patients taking biological therapy (antiTNFalpha therapy: infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab ; antiInterleukin12/Interleukin23: ustekinumab). Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity Presence of any condition hampering compliance with the study protocol, at the discretion of the investigator No french social security affiliation</criteria>
