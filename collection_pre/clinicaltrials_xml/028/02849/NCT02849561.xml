	<brief_summary>With the repercussion of 55 cases eachyear for 100 000 inhabitants in France, cardio respiratory arrest is a public health issue. The goal of this study is to evaluate the pupillary light reflex measured by the dimension of the pupil (diameter) as a prognosis factor neurological evolution in post cardiac arrest. By participating to this study, the patient get the same tratments and exams than in a usual managing cares. In addition of these events, the pupillary light reflex is studied as soon as the patient is accepted in the department, and then on the second day. Currently, the evaluation of the neurological becoming rely on a multimodal clinical and paraclinical approach. The study of the pupillary light reflex measured by the diameter of the pupil could be a prognosis factor of neurological evolution for patients in post cardiac arrest, so a reliable and available prognosis marker in patient care. The goal of this study is to evaluate the pupillary light reflex (RPM), measured by the diameter of the pupil as a prognosis factor of neurological evaluation of admitted patients after a cardiac arrest. Principal criteria of judgement is the percentage of the pupillary light reflex variation measured with NeurolightÂ®, compared between two groups.</brief_summary>
