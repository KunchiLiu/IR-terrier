	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the induction of sensory-motor cortex plasticity after motor cortex stimulation in healthy subjects, using laser-evoked nociceptive cortical potentials, and in chronic neuropathic pain patients using functional MRI. As a secondary goal, the project will analyse possible correlations between the magnitude of cortical plasticity and that of the pain-relieving effect. In healthy subjects, cortical plasticity is evaluated by the comparison of somatosensory cortical maps before and after two isolated sessions of 20 Hz and theta-burst rTMS, in a cross-over randomized study. Two sessions of 5 consecutive days of rTMS are proposed to the patients with a minimum of 4 weeks between the two sessions, defined by 20 Hz and theta-burst stimulation in a cross-over randomized order. Cortical plasticity of the motor cortex is evaluated via functional MRI (motor activation) performed before the first rTMS session and the last day of each session of rTMS.</brief_summary>
