	<brief_title>Future of the Older Patients After Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diverse studies published on the future of the elderly hospitalized in resuscitation place the limit very low, between 65 and 80 years. The feeling of a very bad forecast at these extreme ages pulls nevertheless a filter in the admission in ICU which has this day no scientific justification. The knowledge of the evolution after the hospitalization of these older patients can help to make certain decisions concerning as well the admission of these patients in ICU as the realization of invasive treatments. After informal interrogation of numerous intensivists, it seems to take shape a bar around 85 years beyond which the forecast would be worse without more proof what consolidated the choice of this limit. The reserved scores were already used in similar studies (simplified ALD). Primary purpose : - Describe the survival and the evolution of the quality of life after a stay in resuscitation for very old patients. - The quality of life will be studied through a score of autonomy: the simplified ALD score. The population will be described in general then by age bracket (more or less of 90 years old), according to the length of stay in ICU, the heavy treatments (artificial ventilation, renal replacement therapy) practiced, the initial gravity (score IGS 2). The impact of possible decisions of Limitation or Stop of Therapeutic Activates will also be taken into account.</detailed_description>
