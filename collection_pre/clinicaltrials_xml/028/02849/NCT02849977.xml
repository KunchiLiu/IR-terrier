	<brief_summary>The purpose of this screening study is to identify people who have a rare genetic cause of obesity - specifically three genetic variants (a change in the DNA structure) of the POMC, PCSK1 and LepR genes that are currently known to result in obesity. This screening study will not include any investigational drugs. You will be asked to provide a DNA sample and answer some questions about your medical history and hunger.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Able to provide voluntary, written informed consent with comprehension of all aspects of the protocol, prior to any study procedures. If participant is a child age 2 to 17 years, or an adult with intellectual disabilities, the Parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and be able to understand and sign the written informed consent. Assent will be provided by a child who cannot consent for himself or herself according to the requirements of each institution. Severe EOMO, preferably with past history evidence suggestive of onset prior to age 6 years at the time of identification. For children between ages 2 through 17 years, severe obesity is defined as weight &gt; 40% above (i.e., &gt; 1.4 x) the 95th percentile weight for any age range (using a provided reference table of values by year from ages 2 to 18). Subjects can be included with BMI &lt; 40 kg/m2 or &lt; 1.4x the 95th percentile, if in the investigators estimation the proband demonstrates a Z score difference &gt; 1 between proband and any other siblings. And/or the proband demonstrates a BMI difference &gt; 10 kg/m2 between proband and parents. For adults age &gt; 18 years, severe obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m2. Evidence of hunger/hyperphagia at screening. Participants ≥8 years of age will complete the PatientReported Hunger Questionnaire (Appendix 1). For participants who are ≤12 years of age will have a Parent or Caregiver complete the Parent/Guardian Observation Questionnaire (Appendix 2). Therefore, participants between ages 812 years of age will have both Direct Patient reported and Parent/Guardian Observer questionnaires completed. Sufficient venous access and ability to tolerate venipuncture. If unable to tolerate venipuncture, sample is to be collected via buccal swab. Optional phenotypic screening features present (when diagnosed/available) which will be given priority for DNA collection when screening and recruiting subjects, include: For all 3 potential genetic causes: Presence of normal weight sibling(s), defined as weight ≤ 50%tile (or +1 SD) weight for age range if age 2 to 18 years, or BMI &lt;30 kg/m2 if adult, and history of hypoglycemia after birth and in infancy. POMC: Red hair, Fitzpatrick type 1 skin, central adrenal insufficiency, on current adrenal hormone replacement. PCSK1: Diarrhea, malabsorption as infants; insulin resistance. (These patients may not report/recall hyperphagia or early onset of weight gain in infancy or early childhood due to their initial diarrhea presentation and other GI symptoms). LepR: Hypogonadism, central hypothyroidism, short stature, on testosterone or estrogen replacement if adult. Prior craniopharyngioma or other hypothalamic brain region surgery.</criteria>
