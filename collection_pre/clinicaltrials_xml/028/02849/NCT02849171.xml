	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study. The purpose of this study is to test if an imaging tracer, not approved by the FDA, called 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) is useful for evaluating this type of cancer. This tracer is used to perform PET scans. The researchers want to see if the 18F-FCH PET scan, using the study tracer 18F-FCH, can improve upon the usual scans at diagnosing or monitoring this type of cancer. In patients with high-grade gliomas, changes on standard MRI of the brain may reflect true tumor growth or inflammatory changes in response to treatment, called pseudo-progression. It is important to distinguish true tumor growth from inflammation since inflammation indicates the tumor is responding to treatment. With standard MRI, it is difficult to determine if changes following treatment are due to tumor growth or inflammation early on. Researchers hope to learn if the investigational tracer, 18F-FCH, will be able to distinguish true tumor growth from inflammation more accurately than standard MRI or 18F-FDG PET scans.</brief_summary>
