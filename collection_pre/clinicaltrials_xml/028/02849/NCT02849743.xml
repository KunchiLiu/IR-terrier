	<brief_summary>This research study will test if oxytocin, delivered by nasal spray, will promote weight loss in children and adolescents with Hypothalamic Obesity as compared to a placebo. The study is divided into two parts. During the first part, subjects will receive either oxytocin or placebo. In the second part, subjects will "cross-over" to receive the other treatment - either oxytocin or placebo. During study visits participants will do blood tests, physical exams, metabolic testing, a MRI scan, and some surveys and questionnaires.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Proficient in English. 2. Males or females age 10 to 21 years, inclusive. 3. Weight ≥ 51 kg. 4. Girls must have a negative urine/serum pregnancy test and postmenarchal girls must use an acceptable method of contraception, including abstinence, a barrier method (diaphragm or condom), DepoProvera, or an oral contraceptive, for the duration of the study. 5. Hypothalamic obesity, defined for the purposes of this protocol as: previously diagnosed with a brain tumor* currently obese (BMI &gt;95%ile for age/sex for &lt; 18 years, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 for 18 21 years) has at least one other endocrinopathy, indicating hypothalamic damage rate of annualized weight gain during any 6 month period (given variability in clinical course) preceding or after diagnosis and treatment greater than 2 standard deviations above population reference ranges for age and sex. 6. At least 6 months since completion of therapy with stable disease/lack of recurrence. 7. Stable for at least 2 months on any pituitary replacement (e.g., glucocorticoid, thyroid hormone, estrogen/progestin or testosterone, desmopressin, growth hormone). 8. Stable for at least 2 months on any appetitemodulating medications (e.g., stimulants). 9. Be able to ambulate independently. 10. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and child assent. 1. Diabetes insipidus without intact thirst mechanism (i.e., history that participant is not thirsty when hypernatremic and/or continues to be thirsty when hyponatremic, by participant/family and/or practitioner report and medical records) and/or "brittle" diabetes insipidus, defined as requiring &gt;1 admission in the past year and/or any admission within the previous 3 months. Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin or insulin secretagogue. Laboratory values: HgbA1c ≥8% 2. Cardiovascular condition, as defined as any of the following: i) abnormal blood pressure, defined as &lt;3%ile or &gt;97%ile for age, sex and height; ii) history of cardiac dysrhythmia or dysrhythmia detected on screening EKG; iii) history of heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy. 3. History of liver disease, with screening laboratory studies: Laboratory values: ALT/SGPT &gt; 3.0X upper limit of normal or AST/SGOT &gt; 3.0X upper limit of normal 4. History of chronic kidney disease, with screening laboratory studies: Laboratory values: eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2, as defined by the Schwartz formula 5. Clinically significant anemia, with screening laboratory studies: Laboratory values: Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL 6. Seizure in the past 12 months. 7. History of gastrectomy, gastric bypass, small or large bowel resection. 8. History of active substance abuse. 9. Current psychotic disorder and/or suicidality. 10. Supraphysiologic (&gt;15 mg/m2/day) prescribed doses of hydrocortisone equivalent. 11. Anticipated clinical plan to initiate or modify pituitary hormone replacement and/or appetitemodulating drugs during the course of the study. 12. Any investigational drug use within 30 days prior to enrollment. 13. Pregnant or lactating females. 14. Individuals with a known sensitivity to either oxytocin or the components of its formulation. 15. Inability to take an intranasal medication (e.g., recent injury). 16. Parents/guardians or subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be noncompliant with study schedules or procedures.</criteria>
