	<brief_summary>The time-frame and the follow-up elements after embolization of brain aneurysm are not standardized. Therefore, few reliable follow-up data are available for these patients. This study aims at collecting standardized long term data for these patients, in order to assess the occurence of aneurysm recanalization and particularly those requiring another intervention on the aneurysm.</brief_summary>
