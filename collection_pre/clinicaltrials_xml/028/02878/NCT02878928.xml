	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluating Effects of Pharmacogenetic-guided vs Standard-of-Care Treatment on Depression and/or Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial number of patients taking anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications suffer from either a lack of benefit from drug therapy or severe side effects. Clinical features often fail to predict the drug response and tolerability of a patient to a prescription medication. Genetics can help guide therapeutic decisions for patients exhibiting neuropsychiatric disorders and potentially improve patient outcomes by maximizing drug efficacy and minimizing the risk of adverse events. Genetics and drug interactions can alter both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a multitude of drug compounds and in turn influence both the safety and efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens. This study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of pharmacogenetic (PGx)-directed treatment. Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection using the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel can enhance patient response and tolerability by facilitating the selection of the most appropriate medication at the most effective dose in the shortest possible time. In this prospective, multi-center, randomized, subject and outcome evaluator blind, parallel-group study patients presenting to the clinical site with evidence of depression and/or anxiety as determined by a qualified clinician will be invited to participate. Study participants will be randomized to one of two groups with respect to the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel result: group with testing results revealed to the medical provider prior to treatment selection (Experimental Group) or group without testing results prior to treatment selection (Control Group). Participant outcomes will be measured at baseline and throughout the 3-month duration of the study.</detailed_description>
