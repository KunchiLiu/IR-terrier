	<brief_summary>Management of nephrolithiasis has been revolutionized by the advent of shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). PCNL is a minimally invasive endoscopic technique and is used for the fragmentation and removal of stones of size more than 20 to 30 mm, staghorn stones or multiple stones resistant to ESWL. Anaesthesia for PCNL is a challenge because of the disease, surgical procedure, positioning, hypothermia,and the possibility of fluid absorption, dilutional anaemia and blood loss. General anaesthesia is the gold standard for this surgery.The advent of new drugs has refined the technique of general anaesthesia. However there are several issues related to prone position still to be addressed like accidental extubation and difficult reintubation, nerve injuries and post operative respiratory complications. Combined spinal epidural(CSE) and only epidural anaesthesia (EA) is a well established technique of anaesthesia for upper abdomen and lower thoracic surgeries. It use has also been reported in PCNL surgeries.Segmental epidural can selectively blocks pain fibres from the surgical site. This not only allows to limit the dose of the local anaesthetics, but also limit motor and sympathetic blockade. Selective sympathetic block is associated with respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal and metabolic benefits. This formed the basis of our current study. In the present study the investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy of segmental epidural for PCNL and compared it with standard technique i.e. GA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate efficacy the investigators compared intraoperative haemodynamics, surgical clearance of stones, post operative pain, surgeon's and Patient's satisfaction scores and postoperative complications and side effects in 60 ASA I and II patients undergoing PCNL surgery who received either General anesthesia or Segmental epidural Anesthesia.</detailed_description>
