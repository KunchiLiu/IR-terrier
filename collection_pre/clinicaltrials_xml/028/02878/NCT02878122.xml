	<brief_summary>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a poor prognosis. EOC management requires debulking surgery and chemotherapy based on taxol and carboplatine. Initial response is often good, but most often a recurrence occurred in the first 18 months. Early recurrence signs chemoresistance and palliative treatment. The study of predictive clinical or biological factors is required to adapt therapeutic and develop new treatments.</brief_summary>
