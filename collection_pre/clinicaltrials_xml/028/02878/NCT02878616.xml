	<criteria>1. Adult men or women 1870 years of age suffering from endstage renal disease and who are on chronic dialysis therapy. 2. Candidates for kidney transplantation who are presensitized and will be undergoing desensitization therapy. 3. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. 4. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. 5. Recipients who are ABO compatible with donor allograft. 6. Patients awaiting kidney allograft from a living or deceased donor. For patients awaiting transplant from a living donor, kidney transplantation must only occur after 28 days postLFG316 infusion. 7. History of vaccination with meningococcus and pneumococcus between 2 weeks and 36 months prior to dosing. Documentation is required. If patients have not been vaccinated, they must be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. The choice of vaccine(s) should take into account the serotypes prevalent in the geographic areas in which study patients will be enrolled. 1. Patients requiring or undergoing peritoneal dialysis. 2. Patients with a known contraindication to treatment with blood products. 3. Patients with a known prothrombotic disorder and/or history of thrombosis or hypercoagulable state, excluding hemodialysis venous access clotting. 4. Patients who have positive PCR results for hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, and/or history of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test result. 5. Patients at risk for tuberculosis (TB) 6. Patients with any severe, progressive or uncontrolled acute or chronic medical condition not related to endstage renal disease (such as uncontrolled infectious disease or sepsis), clinical laboratory abnormalities at screening or baseline that in the investigator's opinion would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study, or known active presence of malignancies. 7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. 8. Women of childbearing potential, unless highly effective methods of contraception are used during dosing and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316, or sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking investigational drug and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
