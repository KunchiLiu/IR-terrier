	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antidrug antibody (ADA) response for MEDI8897 in healthy preterm infants who are between 29 and 35 weeks gestational age and entering their first RSV season.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of MEDI8897 for the Prevention of Medically Attended RSV LRTI in Healthy Preterm Infants.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pivotal Phase 2b study will determine if MEDI8897 will be efficacious in reducing medically attended RSV-confirmed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in healthy preterm infants entering their first RSV season. The population to be enrolled is healthy preterm infants born between 29 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days gestational age (GA) who would not receive RSV prophylaxis. A total of 1500 infants will be randomized 2:1 to receive either MEDI8897 or placebo. Subjects will be followed for 360 days after dosing. Enrollment is planned at approximately 197 sites across the USA, Canada, Europe, and the Southern Hemisphere.</detailed_description>
