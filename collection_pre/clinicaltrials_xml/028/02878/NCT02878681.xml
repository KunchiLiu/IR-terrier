	<brief_title>24 Week Study to Compare Systemic VEGF-levels of Ranibizumab and Aflibercept in DME.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of monthly intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 2.0 mg aflibercept on systemic VEGF levels in patients with visual impairment due to DME over a 24 week period. In addition, the study will also assess the effect on systemic VEGF-A levels when patients are switched from aflibercept to ranibizumab.</detailed_description>
