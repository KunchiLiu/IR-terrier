	<brief_summary>Kidney failure is a major public health problem. REIN registry shows that 33% of patients treated in renal replacement therapy for ESRD start dialysis in emergency. Unscheduled care is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, with less access to off dialysis center and kidney transplant. In addition, the emergency management has an impact on the organization of health structures. The High Authority of Health in 2012 issued a "care pathway Guide" aimed "to report in this process of the multidisciplinary nature of the management and coordination of principles and procedures for the Chronic Renal failure and cooperation between professionals involved. " A function of coordinator of the Chronic Renal Disease was set up in service since May 2013. Investigators propose to carry out a study to value its impact on the start of the dialysis in emergency and hypothesize that this feature innovative in France improves the patient pathway and thus reduce support emergency frequency of ESRD. The objective of this study is to show the improvement of the quality of care for terminally chronic renal failure patients. This is to evaluate an experiment aimed to facilitate a complex care path. If this experiment is successful, it could form part of "advanced practice".</brief_summary>
