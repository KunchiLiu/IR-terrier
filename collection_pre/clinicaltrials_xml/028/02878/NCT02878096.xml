	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study are: - To determine the absolute bioavailability of SK-1404 - To assess the mass balance recovery after a single oral (PO) dose of carbon-14 (14C)-SK-1404 - To provide plasma, urine and faecal samples for metabolite profiling and structural identification The secondary objectives of the study are: - To determine the routes and rates of elimination of [14C]-SK-1404 - To identify the chemical structure of each metabolite with an exposure (AUC) of more than 10% of circulating total radioactivity - To explore the intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetics (PK) of [14C]-SK-1404 - To further explore the PO PK of SK-1404 - To provide additional safety and tolerability information for SK-1404</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioavailability of [14C]-SK-1404 ADME &amp; IV Microtracer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-centre, 2-part, open-label, non-randomised, sequential, single dose study in healthy male subjects. It is planned to enrol a single cohort of 6 healthy male subjects who will participate in Parts 1 and Part 2 of the study. In Part 1, each subject will receive a single PO dose of SK-1404 followed by an IV microtracer dose of [14C]-SK-1404. In Part 2, each subject will receive a single PO dose of [14C]-SK-1404.</detailed_description>
