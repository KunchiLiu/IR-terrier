	<brief_summary>The investigators will consecutively recruit 5000 patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) from 50 hospitals across China and follow them up for one year, describe treatment patterns during hospitalization and the follow-ups, examine patients recovery trajectory after HF, and identify targets for care quality improvement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>China PEACE 5p-HF Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consecutively enroll patients with HF as the primary reason for hospitalization in 50 hospitals scattered all over China. Participants will be interviewed at baseline (i.e., during the index hospitalization for HF), and at 1, 6, and 12 months following hospital discharge. During the follow‐up period, participants will be instructed to return to the hospital for interviews by site investigators. Telephone follow-ups will be conducted only when in‐person interviews are not feasible. At baseline, participants will be interviewed to collect detailed information about on demographics, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical characteristics, treatments, in-hospital outcomes, general and disease-specific quality of life, function and mental status; during the follow-ups, the investigators will collect information about clinical outcomes events, long-term treatments, function, quality of life, symptoms, and medical care during the recovery period. The investigators will collect blood and urine samples during index hospitalization and the follow-ups. This study will examine a series of factors that may affect patients' recovery after HF. Practical guidelines, quality evaluative system, and risk model will be established based on the findings, to improve patient outcomes in the future.</detailed_description>
