	<brief_title>Effect of Targeted Blood Pressures in Participants With Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators will learn about the effect of targeted blood pressure management (TPM) on participants healing from acute spinal cord injury. The investigators want to learn: The effect of two types of TPM on long term motor and sensory outcomes. The effect of two types of TPM on long-term pain and functional independence outcomes. How safe TPM is for participants.</detailed_description>
