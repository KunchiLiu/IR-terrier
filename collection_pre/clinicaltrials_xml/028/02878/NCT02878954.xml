	<brief_summary>This research project aims to investigate the gender-based difference in patients with peripheral artery disease. To attend this, this study has two specific objectives: Objective 1: To identify gender-specific barriers towards exercise and physical activity in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Objective 2: To evaluate gender-specific differences in functional capacity and cardiovascular function and regulation in patients with PAD at rest, during and following a single session of maximal exercise.</brief_summary>
