	<brief_summary>The ORI (Reserve Oxygen Index) is an index measured through sensors SpO2 (oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry - Radical-7 MASIMO) that evaluates noninvasively PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen). It represents the high PaO2 with values to 0 for a PaO2 &lt;100 and up to 1 when the PaO2 rises above 200 mmHg. Monitoring by the ORI, with setting an alarm for low values (â‰¥0,01) could help alert nurses when to decrease the FiO2 (inspired oxygen fraction). This could reduce the FiO2 and avoid hyperoxia (i.e. daily PaO 2&gt; 80 mmHg or 100). In the literature, hyperoxia can be associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, with increased risk of atelectasis, or with excess mortality. And the use of high FiO2 led to a "over-consumption" of oxygen and therefore to additional costs. The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the use of ORI can help to decrease length of moderate hypoxemia (PaO2&gt;100mmHg) during mechanical ventilation and oxygenotherapy, in comparison with monitoring the SpO2 only.</brief_summary>
