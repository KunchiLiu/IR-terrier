	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to obtain and compare bilateral elbow joint synovial fluid from patients with unilateral intraarticular elbow fracture and a contralateral healthy appearing elbow joint. The synovial fluid samples will undergo several forms of analysis for metabolites and proteins. Matched-pair statistical analysis will be performed to determine the metabolites and proteins that may play the greatest role in development of joint contracture.</brief_summary>
