	<brief_summary>Immunity and inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, immune intervention, as a new therapeutic strategy, is worthy of exploration. Here, investigators tested the inflammation modulator, vinpocetine, for its effect on the outcomes of stroke. For this multi-center study, investigators recruited 60 patients with anterior cerebral circulation occlusion and onset of stroke that had exceeded 4.5 hours but lasted less than 48 hours. These patients, after randomly division into two groups, received either standard management alone (controls) or standard management plus vinpocetine (30 mg per day intravenously for 14 consecutive days, Gedeon Richter Plc., Hungary).</brief_summary>

That is, all patients we recruited were beyond the 4.5 hours of symptom onset and, therefore, past the accepted timewindow for thrombolytic therapy hemorrhagic stroke and severe hemorrhage in other organs other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) diabetes mellitus tumor or hematological systemic diseases any infection before acute ischemic stroke concomitant use of antineoplastic or immune modulating therapies contraindication to MRI</criteria>
