	<brief_summary>Bleeding is the most significant cause of maternal death worldwide with more than half of those occurring within the first day of delivery. About 10.5% (some estimate as high at 12-17%) of live births world-wide, or about 14 million births, are complicated by postpartum hemorrhage; a woman dies every 4 minutes from postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine atony and placenta accreta are the two leading causes of postpartum hysterectomies with up to 64% of Cesarean hysterectomies done for abnormally adherent placentation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uterine Cavity and Blood Flow After Intraoperative Hemorrhage Due to Placenta Previa/Accreta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No previous studies performed for evaluation of the effect of those procedures on the uterine cavity or uterine blood flow. Most of the studies in the literature evaluated the menstrual and fertility outcome after conservative measures for intraoperative hemorrhage due to placenta previa/accreta were retrospective and depend on the resumption of menses and pregnancy rate</detailed_description>
