	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of electronic cigarettes-nicotine and electronic cigarette-nicotine free on endothelial function as compared to traditional cigarettes. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 fashion. The groups will be: 1. Continue with tobacco cigarettes 2. Switch to electronic cigarettes containing nicotine plus flavor 3. Switch to electronic cigarettes containing flavor alone Treatment period will be 28 days</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Electronic cigarettes (EC) are gaining popularity as an alternative to Traditional Cigarettes (TC). Despite not containing all the harmful substances seen in TC, EC are known to contain impurities that may have a detrimental impact on human health. The effects of ECs compared with TC on vascular function, inflammation and oxidative stress are unknown. It is increasingly recognised that nicotine itself has significant atherothrombotic effects. Therefore, clinicians are unable to confidently recommend ECs as a less risky alternative to TC. Hypothesis: Endothelial function will be improved on EC compared to TC when measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD). Potential benefit: This study will provide further information on the potential use these devices and the risks and/or benefits associated with them, specifically in relation to vascular health.</detailed_description>
