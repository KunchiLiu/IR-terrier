	<brief_summary>Using ultrasound to guide vascular catheterism in children is highly recommended for central venous access. It has been proven that central venous line is inserted faster, with fewer attempts and complications. Its interest in central arterial line insertion is less obvious. It seems to have benefits in adults, both for radial and femoral arterial insertion. But there is no study assessing the interest of ultrasound guided arterial puncture in children,.</brief_summary>
