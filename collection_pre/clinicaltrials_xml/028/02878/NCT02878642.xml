	<brief_summary>The main assumption is that the dolutegravir can get virologic suppression to suboptimal adherence levels (between 80 and 95%, and after treatment interruptions) where other molecules are not capable, due to their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pardonnance). While the investigators goal is not to compare molecules (study with one arm) in terms of forgiveness, the results of this cohort in terms of forgiveness could be compared to other cohorts available.</brief_summary>
