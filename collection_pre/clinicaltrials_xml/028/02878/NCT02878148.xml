	<brief_summary>Prospective single centre study aiming at validating a conditional imaging strategy for diagnosis of suspected kidney stone. Consecutive Emergency department patients referred to the medical imaging department for exploration of a suspected acute uncomplicated renal colic will undergo the following interventions : systematic plain abdominal Xray, systematic ultrasonography and systematic unenhanced CT (with a reduced dose scan), in addition to clinical examination and assessment of body mass index and the Sex, Timing, Origin, Nausea, Erythrocytes (STONE) clinical prediction score for symptomatic stone. Patients will be followed up at 1 month to record the need for urologic intervention and its type. The performances of different conditional imaging strategy for the diagnosis of suspected renal colic will be assessed retrospectively. The conditional strategies tested will be based on the patient's stone score and BMI and targeted use of combined plain X-ray and ultrasonography and/or unenhanced CT. The reference diagnosis for renal colic will be made according to the finding of a ureteral stone or indirect signs of urolithiasis at unenhanced CT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plain abdominal Xray, Ultrasonography and unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed at the time of admission to the imaging department, within 2 days from ED visit and within a 1 hour delay from each other. Ultrasonography will be interpretated in combination to plain abdominal Xray, and independently from unenhanced CT, by two experienced radiologists blinded to the results of each other.</detailed_description>
