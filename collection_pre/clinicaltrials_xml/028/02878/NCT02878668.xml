	<brief_summary>Post operative complication after hepatopancreatobiliary surgery is high as 30-50%ï¼Œwhich is the main reason for patient admitted to ICU. Several biomarkers have been shown to be useful in the early diagnosis of sepsis and systemic bacterial infection. The purpose of this study is to assess the predictive value of biomarkers for early complication after hepatopancreatobiliary surgery and assess the effectiveness of anti-infectious therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Value of Infectious Biomarkers for Prediction of Complication After Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative complication after major abdominal surgery, such as pancreatic surgery and hilar cholangiocarcinoma surgery, is higher, up to 30 to 50%.It is the mainly reason for the patient to admit to ICU. Among this, the most common and difficult to handle complication is mainly anastomotic fistula, abdominal effusion and subsequent secondary infection. Delayed diagnosis can cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ failure ( MODS), and even death. From a surgical point of view, it leads to surgical failure and often need the second surgery. However, the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative infection is also facing two problems: it is difficult to confirm the diagnosis and make treatment decision. Hence, there is a strong need of an additional tool to early diagnose post operative complication. Serum procalcitonin (PCT), is a 116 amino-acids protein produced by C-cells of the thyroid gland. PCT baseline levels are low (&lt;0.05 ng/ml), but increase significantly in patients with severe bacterial infections. Therefore, PCT levels are used to monitor the course and prognosis of systemic bacterial infections and to tailor the therapeutic interventions more efficiently. Furthermore, PCT could serve as an early predictive marker for the clinical course of septic complications after abdominal surgery. The aim of this study is to demonstrate if PCT is a more sensible, specific and reliable biomarker of post operative complication than other biomarkers The investigators conducted a observational, prospective study. All patients undergoing electively hepatopancreatobiliary surgery in seven centres are recruited. In all cases white blood count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT levels are measured in 1st, 3rd and 5th postoperative day (POD). Informed consent was obtained in all patients.The study is approved by the hospital's Ethical Committee.</detailed_description>
