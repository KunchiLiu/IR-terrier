	<brief_title>HCR vs. CABG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, it is not clear how the outcomes of hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) compare with other treatments. The purpose of the study is to find out if HCR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure outcomes are similar. HCR is a combination of surgery and catheter procedures to open up clogged heart arteries. CABG is a surgical procedure to open up clogged heart arteries. This study will collect information about the medical care participants receive during their planned procedure. No new testing or procedures will be done. Participants will have only the tests or procedures already planned by their doctor. The investigators will look at how well participants do after the procedure by assessing the outcomes of interest 30 days after surgery and, potentially, one year after surgery (funding dependent).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able to give informed consent Have multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) involving the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery Have a clinical indication for revascularization Are a candidate for either HCR or CABG or both Anatomy suitable for HCR shall include 1. Multivessel CAD involving the LAD and/or 2. LAD disease and involvement of a major diagonal artery, both of which require revascularization Prior cardiac operations Severe left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 30% Patients with chest radiation Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 Severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) Acute ischemia requiring emergent traditional coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)</criteria>
