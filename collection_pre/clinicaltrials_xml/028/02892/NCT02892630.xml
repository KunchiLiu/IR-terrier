	<brief_summary>The pregnancy may activate flares of certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The influence of pregnancy on the evolution of ITP was never studied while this pathology affects firstly women old enough to procreate. Also, the influence of ITP on pregnancy (risk of obstetric complications) and on newborns (risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia) is rather unknown and never studied in a prospective study. The realization of a prospective study to answer these questions is necessary to allow us to inform better the patients affected by ITP and to define better in this context the strategy of supervision of the mother, the foetus and the newborn. The highlighting of risk factors of ITP flare or obstetric or neonatal complications will indeed allow the implementation of prevention measures. The conclusions of this study will allow us to adapt national guidelines for ITP during pregnancy.</brief_summary>
