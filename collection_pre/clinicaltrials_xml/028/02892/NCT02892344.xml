	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of QMF149 150/80 microgram o.d. delivered via Concept1 compared to MF 200 microgram o.d., delivered via Twisthaler® in terms of lung function and symptom control in poorly (ie inadequately) controlled asthma patients. This study will assess contribution of LABA as an add-on therapy to low dose ICS monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of QMF149 (150/80 µg) Compared With MF Twisthaler® (200 µg) in Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 150/80 microgram o.d. (in the evening) delivered via Concept1 compared with MF 200 microgram o.d. (in the evening) delivered via Twisthaler® in terms of trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment in adults and adolescents. The key secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 150/80 microgram to MF 200 microgram o.d. in terms of ACQ-7 after 12 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with a documented diagnosis of asthma for a period of at least 3 months prior to Screening Visit Patients who have used low dose ICS , with or without controller (ie, LABA, Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist ) at stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Screening Visit Adult patients who are symptomatic at screening despite treatment with existing therapy. Patients with ACQ7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visit 101 and at Visit 102 (inadequately controlled). Adolescent patients : If taking only ICS (without LABA) and are symptomatic at screening despite treatment with low doses of ICS. These patients must have ACQ7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visit 101 and at Visit 102 . If taking ICS (low dose)/ LABA, and have ACQ7 score ≥1 and &lt;1.5 at Visit 101: they must have ACQ7 score≥1.5 at Visit 102 ( prior to randomization). Prebronchodilator FEV1≥ 60 % and &lt; 90 % of the predicted normal value for the patient after withholding bronchodilators at both Visits 101 and 102 Patients who demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of 12% and ≥ 200 mL within 30 minutes after administration of 400 microgram salbutamol/360 microgram albuterol (or equivalent dose) at Visit 101. Patients who have smoked or inhaled tobacco products (including electronic cigarettes) within the 6 month period prior to Visit 1, or who have a smoking history of greater than or equal to 10 pack year. Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization (&gt; 24 hours) or emergency room visit (≤ 24 hours) as follows: For adults: within 6 weeks of Screening Visit. If patients experience an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or emergency room visit between Visit 1 and Visit 102 they may be rescreened 6 weeks after recovery from the exacerbation For adolescents: Exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, hospitalization (&gt; 24 hours) or emergency room visit (≤24 hours) within 6 months, prior to visit 1. Patients who ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation Patients with a clinical condition (eg. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) which may be worsened by ICS administration (according to investigator's medical judgment ) Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening within 4 weeks prior to Screening Visit or between Visit 1and Visit 102. Patients may be rescreened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening. Patients with any chronic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract (eg. chronic sinusitis) which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the study. Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not limited to) COPD, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis. Patients with Type I diabetes or uncontrolled Type II diabetes. Patients with narcolepsy and/or insomnia. Patients on Maintenance Immunotherapy (desensitization) for allergies or less than 3 months prior to Visit 101 or patients on Maintenance Immunotherapy for more than 3 months prior to Visit 101 but expected to change throughout the course of the study. Patients with diagnosed rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption or with known intolerance to lactose or milk products.</criteria>
