	<brief_summary>The dissemination of individual tumor cells is a common phenomenon in solid cancers. Detection of tumor cells in peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTC) in nonmetastatic situation is of high prognostic significance. The objective of our study was to detect circulating tumor cells in two different method in patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
