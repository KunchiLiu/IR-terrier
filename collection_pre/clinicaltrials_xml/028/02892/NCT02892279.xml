	<brief_summary>The adverse effects of air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory health have been demonstrated in an extensive series of epidemiological, observational and experimental studies. In the current project the investigators aim to determine whether an acute exposure to diesel exhaust causes impacts on sympathetic nervous system activation in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sympathetic Nerve Activation Evoked by Diesel Exhaust Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brief as well as chronic exposures to air pollution have been linked with increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that the strongest associations between air pollution exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects are found for combustion-derived particulate matter, especially in the fine and ultrafine ranges such as is found in diesel engine emissions. Despite a greater understanding of the cardiovascular effects of air pollution, the underlying mechanism through which exposure to fine particulate air pollution alters vascular function has yet to be determined. Microneurography is a method that records nerve impulse traffic in human peripheral nerves, allowing for the assessment of sympathetic nervous activity. The current study will employed microneurography techniques to evaluate autonomic function in association with inhaled air pollution exposure in healthy human volunteers.</detailed_description>
