	<brief_summary>A new NMT module from Mindray (Mindray Co. Shenzhen, People's Republic of China.) claims to measure 3 directional accelerography. The aim of the study is to compare the neuromuscular block of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (twice the 95% effective dose, ED95) monitored by the NMT to that monitored by the Relaxometer mechanomyograph, and to clinically evaluate the new system for its diagnostic accuracy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mechanomyography (MMG) is regarded as the standard method for precise quantification of neuromuscular block. The conventional MMG measures the exact force of muscle contraction in response to electric stimulation of the ulnar nerve. MMG quantifies the neuromuscular function by measurement of the force displacement. However the equipment is rather bulky, takes time to set up, requires a rigid support of the arm in an often-crowded operating room. This limits its clinical use in the daily anesthesia practice. On the other hand several stand-alone or modules integrated in anesthesia machines, neuromuscular monitoring devices such as the TOF-Guard (Organon, Oss, The Netherlands), TOF-Watch (Organon, Oss, The Netherlands), ParaGraph (Vital Signs, Totowa NJ, USA), or the AS/5 M-NMT (GE, Helsinki, Finland) based on the acceleration of a piezo-electrode or quantification of the bending of a piezo-wafer are currently available. Versatility and mobility comes at the expense of accuracy as these monitors were shown not to accurately correlate to mechanomyography as they are based on physiologically different phenomenon than the force displacement of the MMG, and compared to MMG it is well documented that the methods could not be used interchangeably. This is because these monitors are based on physiologically different phenomena than the force displacement of the MMG. Thus the techniques currently available have several pitfalls; MMG devices are not commercially available, whereas the methods that are available seem to be less reliable than MMG. A new NMT module from (Shenzhen, People's Republic of China.) claims to measure 3 directional accelerography. The aim of the study is to compare the neuromuscular block of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (twice the 95% effective dose, ED95) monitored by the NMT to that monitored by the Relaxometer mechanomyograph, and to clinically evaluate the new system for its diagnostic accuracy.</detailed_description>
