	<brief_summary>This study is designed to explore lung function effects of two doses of indacaterol acetate, 75 μg and 150 μg, in pediatric asthma patients 6-11 years old, and to compare the systemic exposure to indacaterol in plasma with historical data in adults, to identify an appropriate dose to Phase III evaluation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female children ≥ 6 years and &lt; 12 years with confirmed diagnosis of asthma for at least 1 year prior to study enrollment. Written informed consent by parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and depending upon their age and local requirements a consent or assent for the patient. Patients receiving daily treatment with a stable low dose Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS) (with or without additional controller), or patients receiving daily treatment with a stable middose ICS (monotherapy or together with LTRA) for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening, and able to tolerate fluticasone propionate 100 μg b.i.d. inhaler starting at Visit 1 (or soon after). Patients with a prebronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 50% and ≤ 90% of the predicted normal value for the patient at the start and end of Runin (Visits 101 and 199). Patients who demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of 12% within 30 minutes after administration of 400 μg salbutamol/360 μg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at Visit 101. All patients must perform a reversibility test at Visit 101. Patients taking a middose ICS (per GINA guidelines) in combination with LABA or any patient taking highdose ICS. Evidence of unstable disease within 4 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1). Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids (SCS) or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or more than 3 separate exacerbations in the 12 months preceding Visit 1. Suspected or documented bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of Screening (Visit 1). Prior intubation for asthma.</criteria>
