	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at the efficacy (the effect on tumor) and the safety (the effect on body) of the study drugs when given as a combination in patients with metastatic recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative inflammatory breast cancer. This is a phase II study of 2 drugs used in combination: nivolumab and ipilimumab. The combination of these drugs is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are not approved by the FDA for patients with metastatic recurrent HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer, hence the treatment is considered experimental or investigational.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV HER2 Negative Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) in patients with newly recurrent HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to RECIST criteria v1.1, in patients with recurrent IBC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab. II. To assess overall survival in patients with recurrent HER2 negative IBC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab. III. To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with recurrent IBC according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.03. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the predictive value of baseline iSCORE and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1) expression using archival tissue samples as well as any standard of care tissue obtained during study treatment. II. To assess the predictive value of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) and immune signature by exosome analysis using blood samples at baseline. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W) and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks (Q6W) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV breast carcinoma with a previous clinical diagnosis of IBC based on the presence of inflammatory changes in the involved breast, such as diffuse erythema and edema (peau d'orange), with or without an underlying palpable mass involving the majority of the skin of the breast; pathological evidence of dermal lymphatic invasion should be noted but is not required for diagnosis Patients must have local or metastatic recurrence of IBC after prior surgery Patients must have a metastatic tumor negative for HER2; the lack of HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), is defined as 0 or 1+ where as hyperexpression is defined as 3+; if equivocal IHC, 2+, the tumor must be nongene amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed upon the primary tumor or metastatic lesion (ratio &lt; 2 and HER2 copy number &lt; 4) Patients may have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with RECIST criteria v. 1.1 OR nonmeasurable tumors; NOTE: Nonmeasurable tumors are small lesions (longest diameter &lt; 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with &gt;= 10 to &lt; 15 mm short axis); bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are considered as nonmeasurable Patients must be in consideration for 1st line systemic therapy for recurrent IBC; NOTE: Patients must not have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, but adjuvant treatment after surgery is acceptable Patients must have confirmed availability of archival or freshly biopsied tumor tissue meeting protocoldefined specifications prior to study enrollment Patients must exhibit an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 01; ECOG performance status 2 and 3 will be allowed only if decline in performance status is thought to be directly secondary to breast cancer disease burden by treating physician Patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function within 14 days prior to registration, as defined below: Leukocytes &gt;= 2,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL, regardless of transfusion or growth factor support Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcl, regardless of transfusion or growth factor support Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except patients with Gilbert syndrome or liver metastasis who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 x ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (or =&lt; 5 times ULN in case of liver metastasis) Serum creatinine of &lt; 3.0 x ULN (upper limit of normal) Patients with history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible if CNS disease has been stable for at least 6 weeks prior to study registration in the opinion of the investigator and do not require corticosteroids (of any dose) for symptomatic management; NOTE: Patients are not required to have CNS imaging prior to study entry Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 72 hours of registration NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for &gt; 12 months) FOCBP and men who are sexually active with FOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment and the designated posttreatment period Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to registration on study Patients must not have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study registration Patients who already received chemotherapy for recurrent metastatic IBC are not eligible Patients who have not recovered to =&lt;
