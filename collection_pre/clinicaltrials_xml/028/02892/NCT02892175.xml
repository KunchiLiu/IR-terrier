	<brief_summary>The Leonetti law of 22 April 2005 on the rights of patients at end of life provides the opportunity for "all adults" to write advance directives in case she would one day be "unable to express their will." If this right is enshrined in the hospitalized patient's charter, brought to the attention of any patient entering a hospital, the fact remains that only 2.5% of the deceased have written advance directives (study National Institute of demographic studies published in 2012). Moreover, according Régis Aubry, a researcher at the observatory on the end of life, the conditions of the end of life are insufficiently discussed with patients and their families and can lead to difficult situations conflicting view. Now, thinking about advance directives should allow an exchange on the conditions of the end of life desired by patients. Sicard report of December 2012 concluded that such legislation is known neither patients nor doctors. This is the first obstacle to its use, even if major psychological barriers exist both in patients that their doctors. It is in this context that Valls government asked MM. Claeys and Leonetti to propose a new bill on the subject. The bill provides that advance directives will no longer be valid for 3 years, but until changed or until the patient's death, and they can be invoked against doctors except emergency or illegality. In addition, to complete the bill, the Ministry of Health commissioned the National Health Authority (HAS) writing a form of advance directives, as well as a doctor's information guide and patient on the subject. The working group is chaired by Professor Sicard. Among the recommendations made to physicians (and by extension health professionals), the investigators accept that talk of advance directives as often as possible and as early as possible, even in the absence of commitment in the short or medium term prognosis .</brief_summary>
