	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic concordance between multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the early postoperative assessment of patients after cochlear implantation. Study Design: Prospective, randomized, single-center, interventional, pilot study on the diagnostic performance of a medical device. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Patients aged over 18 years requiring a CT scan after cochlear implant surgery. Interventions: Nine patients were implanted with electrode arrays from three different manufacturers, including one bilateral. High-resolution MSCT and CBCT were then performed, and 2 experienced radiologists blinded to the imaging modality evaluated the randomized images, twice.</brief_summary>
