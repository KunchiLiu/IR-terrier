	<brief_title>Music Listening for Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract surgery is the most frequent surgical procedure performed in Europe, usually done under topical anaesthesia. Restlessness and hypertension are the most frequent medical complications during surgery, potentially leading to surgical complications. Since the surgery is ambulatory and requires the patient's cooperation, heavy intravenous sedation should be avoided. However, this procedure is stressful, with patients experiencing high anxiety due to being awake and aware of the procedure on their eye and equipment. Music therapy may be considered as a non-pharmacologic and non-invasive mean to reduce anxiety and therefore intra-operative hypertension. To assess the effect of music therapy on anxiety and hypertension during cataract surgery procedures under topical anaesthesia, investigators intend to perform a randomized controlled trial. Depending on the results of the study, music therapy may subsequently be replacing the usual premedication before surgery.</detailed_description>
