	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to evaluate and describe the surgical and overall outcomes of subjects who undergo pancreatectomy and hepatic resection/ablation for pancreatic cancer with low-volume hepatic metastases, as part of routine care. Subjects will be followed to determine operative risks and 90-day morbidity and mortality. In addition, survival outcomes will be compared to historical controls who did not undergo surgery. Secondary outcomes will include mortality and morbidity; operative time; blood loss and transfusion requirements; and oncologic outcomes such as: margin status, lymph node harvest, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Analysis of subject and tumor characteristics will help the investigator identify subjects who would benefit from this aggressive multimodal approach.</brief_summary>
