	<brief_summary>Aim of the study is to evaluate the role of chemoreceptor activity and ventilation perfusion mismatch on the genesis of exercise induced hyperventilation in Pulmonary hypertension patients. So the investigators tested the chemoreceptor response at rest, both with hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli, and the ventilatory response during exercise analyzing its two components, alveolar and dead space ventilation.</brief_summary>
