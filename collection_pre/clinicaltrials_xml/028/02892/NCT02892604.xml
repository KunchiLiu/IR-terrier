	<brief_summary>A new version of the DiAs artificial pancreas (AP) system has been developed in view of wide scale outpatient trials. Denominated as inControl , it includes improved user interface and communication modules while closed-loop algorithms remain similar. During this pilot study, the investigators will evaluate this new version of AP for a two-week period during which the patients will use it for closed-loop insulin delivery 24/7 The main goal is train the clinical team with the new system and collect patient opinions on system acceptance from questionnaires. If this trial is conclusive, a randomized 6-month multicentre study including 240 patients will be initiated. A total of 5 patients will be included in this training study over a 4-week period.</brief_summary>
