	<brief_title>Effect of Umbilical Cord Milking on Iron Related Health Outcomes for Cesarean-Delivered Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, several professional organizations have recommended delayed cord clamping to improve placental transfusion for newborns born vaginally based on a series of randomized controlled studies. However, no similar recommendations are available for cesarean-delivered infants. Investigators found that cesarean-delivered infants were more vulnerable to iron deficiency and anemia compared with those born vaginally, suggesting that it is urgently needed to find a similar anemia prevention strategy for infants born by cesarean sections. In this study, investigators aim to test whether umbilical cord milking (UCM), a potentially promising strategy for cesarean delivery, can improve iron related health outcomes for cesarean-delivered infants. A total of 450 term pregnant women who are planning to give births by cesarean sections will be enrolled from two hospitals in Hunan province and randomly assigned to either UCM group or control group. Infants will be followed up at 1, 6, 12, 18 months for the evaluation of the impact of UCM on iron deficiency, anemia, as well as growth and the developmental status of language and mental/behavioral outcomes.</detailed_description>
