	<brief_summary>The purpose is to determine intrinsic properties of various immunohistochemical markers (FVIIIra, CD15, CD30, tryptase, TNFα, IL-1β, TGFα et TGFβ1) for diagnosis of vital wound, alone and in association (evaluation of sensibility with surgery wounds and evaluation of specificity with post-mortem wounds). Secondary purposes are to measure the minimum time to obtain a positive labeling in vital wounds, and to evaluate inter-observer reproducibility of vitality diagnosis with different markers. Expression of microRNA miR 9, miR 21 et miR 198 will be also studied.</brief_summary>
