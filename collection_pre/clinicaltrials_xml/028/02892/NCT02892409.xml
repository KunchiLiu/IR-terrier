	<brief_title>TAK-438 Bismuth Drug Interaction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1, double-blind, parallel group study in subjects with Helicobacter pylori (HP positive) who are, additionally, cytochrome P-450 (CYP)2C19 extensive metabolizers (EM) to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a quadruple therapy with bismuth, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and TAK-438 versus quadruple therapy with bismuth, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and lansoprazole. The study will enroll 30 participants. The treatment phase consists of quadruple therapy twice daily (BID) with tripotassium bismuth dicitrate (600 mg), clarithromycin (500 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg), and TAK-438 (20 mg) (Group B) or quadruple therapy BID with tripotassium bismuth dicitrate (600 mg), clarithromycin (500 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg),and lansoprazole (30 mg) (Group A) from Days 1 to 14. Subjects will be discharged on Day 15 after final PK blood samples are collected and all procedures performed. This single-center will be conducted in Korea. Participants will remain confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Day 15 and will followed up through call on Day 17 and return on Day 42 for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
