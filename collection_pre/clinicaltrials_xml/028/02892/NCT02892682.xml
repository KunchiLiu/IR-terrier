	<brief_summary>Previous studies reported infraclinical modifications of the homeostasis in chronic urticaria, recurrent idiopathic angioedema and hereditary angioedema. This study aim to compare groups with isolated wheals, isolated angioedema, combination of both and hereditary angioedema in terms of coagulation pathways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of the Coagulation Pathways in Recurrent Angioedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies reported infraclinical modifications of the homeostasis in chronic urticaria, recurrent idiopathic angioedema and hereditary angioedema. This study aim to compare groups with isolated wheals, isolated angioedema, combination of both and hereditary angioedema in terms of coagulation pathways. the main objective is to highlight a difference between the rates of different coagulation factors in the 3 groups presenting different categories of angiodemes patients with a group of patients with isolated superficial chronic urticaria</detailed_description>
