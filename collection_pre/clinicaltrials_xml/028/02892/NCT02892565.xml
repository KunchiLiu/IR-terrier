	<brief_summary>The purpose is to determine the hypercoagulable phenotype by thrombinography associated to an increased risk of symptomatic and objectively confirmed first venous thrombotic event. This is a case-control study in a population with patients having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid antibodies (APL). Secondary purposes are: 1. To determine the frequency of hypercoagulable phenotype in study population; 2. To analyze the sensibility: consequences of variation of hypercoagulable phenotype threshold on the importance of risk; 3. To identify (genetic and not) factors for hypercoagulable phenotype and their frequency in different groups.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cases : Patients with SLE and/or APL and first documented deep vein thrombosis episode (minimum 6 months, maximum 6 years) Any weight and height Absence of current anticoagulant treatment but possibility of platelet function inhibitory treatment; actual guidelines suggest longterm anticoagulant treatment in patients with first episode of venous thrombosis and having APL; however, these patients can be studied if they are in one of these circumstances: 1/ "inconvenient" stop by patient, 2/ aspirin decided by doctor after prolonged treatment Controls: Patients with SLE and/or APL without thrombosis (venous or arterial) Any weight and height Possibility of platelet function inhibitory treatment (primary prophylaxis of arterial manifestations) Cases and Controls : Pregnancy Refusal of consent Difficulty of followup (not sufficient motivation)</criteria>
