	<brief_summary>This is a volunteer study examining the effect of different doses of IV dexamethasone on prolongation of median nerve block in the forearm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IV Dexamethasone for Prolongation of Peripheral Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18 healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited (6 patients in each dosing group). Each volunteer will receive two forearm median nerve blocks separated by a two week washout period. One block will be conducted alongside an infusion of normal saline (control). The other block will be conducted alongside a randomised dose of IV dexamethasone (2, 4 or 8mg). The order of these interventions will be random. Blocks will be assessed quantitatively with cold and sharp sensation, electrical stimulation, quantitative sensory testing (thermal tolerance) and grip strength dynamometry. Measures or sensory and motor block including onset, intensity and duration will be compared between dosing groups.</detailed_description>
