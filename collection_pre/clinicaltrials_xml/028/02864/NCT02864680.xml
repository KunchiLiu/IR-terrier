	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the impact of regular use of cannabis on the spatial sensitivity of magnocellular system (visual event-related potential, visual ERP). Secondary purposes of this study are to evaluate the impact of regular use of cannabis on the temporal sensitivity of magnocellular system (visual event-related potential), on the dynamics of cortical visual processing during face perception test (visual event-related potential) and on functioning of retinal photopic and scotopic systems (electroretinogram). The ancillary study is a genetic analysis of a group of candidate genes that aims to identify biomarkers for changes in visual processing. This will allow to distinguish among more homogeneous and specific groups in future studies on larger cannabis user population. This ancillary study concerns all participants subject to their informed consent (facultative study).</brief_summary>
