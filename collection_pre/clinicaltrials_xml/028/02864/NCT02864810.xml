	<brief_summary>[18F]GP1 targets platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor in thrombus. [18F]GP1 PET/CT imaging will noninvasively assess thrombus in whole body with good sensitivity with information of thrombus. Safety, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, internal radiation dosimetry and diagnostic performance of [18F]GP1 will be assessed in all subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient is ≥ 19 years of age and male or female of any race/ethnicity. Patient has signs or symptoms of acute DVT of the leg, acute PE or ATE; or had arterial intervention or surgery, such as endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair preferably within 14 days prior to the planned study with [18F]GP1. Patient has thromboembolic focus/foci confirmed by standard imaging modalities within 5 days prior to administration of [18F]GP1. Patient has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 at time of screening. Patient has clinical laboratory tests that are within the following ranges, determined within 7 days prior to administration of [18F]GP1: White blood cell count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L; Platelets ≥ 75.0 x 109/L; ALT and AST ≤ 3.0 times upper limit of normal; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal; and Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal A patient will be excluded from this study if the patient does not fulfill the inclusion criteria, or if any of the following conditions are observed: Patient or patient's legally acceptable representative does not provide written informed consent. In case of acute DVT or PE, patient has a previous history of objectively diagnosed DVT or PE. Patient had pretreatment with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors within 15 days before the administration of [18F]GP1 Chemotherapy is scheduled to given to patient before or within 24 hours after administration of [18F]GP1. Female patient is pregnant or nursing. Patient has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease other than cancer (e.g. congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, severe pulmonary disease, chronic renal or hepatic disease which could compromise participation in the study) in the judgment of the investigator. Patient is a relative of the investigator, student of the investigator or otherwise dependent. Patient has been involved in another investigative clinical study involving administration of an investigational drug from preceding 4 weeks before to 24 hours after administration of [18F]GP1. Patient has been previously included in this study. Patient has any other condition or personal circumstances that, in the judgment of the investigator, might make collection of complete data difficult or impossible. Additiverelated precautions: This investigational product contains sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergictype reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and lifethreatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.</criteria>
