	<brief_summary>Newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with complete or partial surgical resection, CMV seropositive patients will be eligible to enroll on this 2-arm randomization trial. Following standard of care chemoradiation, eligible subjects will be consented and randomized to cycles of either 5-day standard of care post-radiation temozolomide (TMZ) or 21-day dose-intensified TMZ. Subjects will receive tetanus-diphtheria (Td) pre-conditioning on day 22 of the first post-radiation cycle of TMZ and the following day, receive the first of 3 every other week via intradermal (i.d.) injections of the study drug cytomegalovirus peptide (PEP-CMV), a vaccine mixture comprised in 2 components (referred to as Component A and Component B). The subjects will resume cycles of TMZ, resulting in a ~35-day delay between cycle 1 and 2, and continue PEP-CMV vaccinations every month with cycles of TMZ and then monthly to a maximum of 20 vaccines unless progression occurs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients may be enrolled following radiation therapy and prior to initiation of post-radiation therapy cycles of TMZ provided they meet all eligibility criteria (a screening consent will be obtained for CMV screen only to confirm eligibility, this can be done prior to chemoradiation). At time of enrollment, after signing consent, patients will undergo immune monitoring blood work and Tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccination with 0.5 mL of Td (tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, adsorbed) and will be randomized to receive (1) standard TMZ (150-200 mg/m^2/day on days 1-5 of each 28 day cycle) with vaccination on Day 23 (±1 day) of each TMZ cycle, or (2) dose-intensified TMZ (75-100 mg/m^2/day on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle) with vaccination on day 23 (±1 day) of each TMZ cycle. Each arm will have 18 patients. In order to randomize 36 with the goal of 26 evaluable patients for the primary outcome, up to 45 will be consented. For both arms, the patients must be screened at Duke within 3+/- 1 weeks after completion of standard of care radiation. For the 5-day arm, the initial cycle of TMZ will begin 3 (±1) weeks after completing radiation therapy (RT) at a standard targeted dose of 150-200 mg/m^2/d for 5 days. For the 21-day arm, the initial cycle will be at the dose-intensified dose of 75-100 mg/m^2/d for 21 days. All patients will receive a tetanus pre-conditioning injection in the right groin (as described below) on day 22 (±1 day) and the following day receive the vaccine prepared as follows: 500 µg of PEP-CMV Component A mixed with Montanide ISA-51 (Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant) intradermally administered in the right groin and 500 µg of PEP-CMV Component B mixed in 150 µg of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) intradermally administered in the left groin. Vaccines #2 and #3 will be given at 2 week intervals, which will result in a ~35-day delay before starting TMZ cycle 2. An unacceptable toxicity will be defined as any of the following toxicities that are attributed to the vaccine: Grade 3 toxicity not attributable to TMZ or disease progression that does not resolve to baseline within 2 weeks, any Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions requiring steroids, and any Grade 4 toxicity, including neurologic events not due to progressive disease, or any life threatening-event not attributable to concomitant medication, co-morbid event, or disease progression. The prevalence of unacceptable toxicities occurring during the vaccinations administered concurrently with temozolomide will be continuously monitored. If more than 25% of accrued patients experience unacceptable toxicities, then accrual will be suspended and reported toxicity will be carefully reviewed to determine if modifications to the protocol treatment should occur. Peptide vaccinations employing GM-CSF and Montanide ISA-51 as adjuvants have generally been well tolerated in human patients in numerous phase I-III trials. Treatment Plan: Patients will be vaccinated in conjunction with subsequent 28-day TMZ cycles for a total of 6 to 12 cycles of TMZ after RT. Cycles may be given every 5 (± 1) weeks in order to adjust for slight delays on startup of each 28-day cycle and the total number of cycles are given at the discretion of the treating oncologist. During TMZ cycles, vaccinations will occur on day 23 (±1 day) of each cycle for each arm: (1) standard TMZ (150-200 mg/m^2/day on days 1-5 of each 28 day cycle) with vaccination on Day 23 (-1 day, + 2 days) of each TMZ cycle, or (2) dose-intensified TMZ (75-100 mg/m^2/day on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle) with vaccination on day 23 (±1 day) of each TMZ cycle. All vaccines will be given i.d. approximately 10 cm below the inguinal ligament bilaterally (Component A will be administered in the right groin and Component B will be administered in the left groin). A target of six cycles with maximum of twelve cycles of TMZ may be given at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist. Vaccines will continue after the completion of TMZ cycles beginning 5 (± 1) weeks after completion of the last TMZ cycles to a maximum number of 20 vaccines (unless tumor progression occurs). Patients will be imaged with contrast-enhanced MRI pre &amp; post-surgical resection (prior to initiation of chemoradiation), post-chemoradiation and every 2 months after starting TMZ. The modified Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria will be used for assessment of pseudoprogression and patients demonstrating definitive progression will be removed from study. Any patient removed prior to immune monitoring post vaccine 3 will be replaced for immunologic endpoints. Clinical endpoint comparisons will be made amongst patients successfully randomized to adjuvant TMZ treatment arms. Prior to post-RT TMZ cycle 1 and the upfront Td booster immunization, blood for immune monitoring will be obtained. In addition blood for immune monitoring will be obtained prior to vaccine 1 (or at the Td per-conditioning visit), at the clinic visit before second cycle TMZ, and prior to vaccines 4, and 6. Finally, blood for immune monitoring will be obtained at tumor progression (if feasible). As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure, consent will be obtained separately. Patients that have this procedure done here at Duke University Health System, may be approached to participate in the Duke Brain Tumor Center Bio-repository study (Pro00007434). Tissue obtained from patients who consented to the Duke Brain Tumor Center Bio-repository will be used to assess immunologic cell infiltration, antigen expression, and bio-markers for immunologic response.</detailed_description>
