	<brief_summary>Adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) will be extracted from lipoaspirate by enzymatic digestion. 10 mL of autologous ADRC suspension injected intramuscularly, close to the site of muscle injury. All patients will receive cell therapy. This is a single arm study with no control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fat tissue obtainment: Subjects will undergo liposuction under local anesthesia. In this procedure, Ringer's solution with the anesthetic lidocaine and vasoconstrictor adrenaline infused into the adipose compartment to minimize blood loss and contamination of the tissue by peripheral blood cells. 15 minutes later a hollow blunt-tipped 3 mm cannula introduced into the subcutaneous space through small (0.5 cm) incision. The cannula attached to syringe and under gentle suction moved through the adipose compartment, mechanically disrupting the fat tissue. Aspirate volume - approximately 150-200 cc. Procedure time - 30 minutes. ADRC isolation: Harvested adipose tissue will be processed according to patent pending technology based on enzymatic digestion, washing and concentration of cell pellet in 10.5 ml of normal saline. Obtained ADRC divided into 2 portions. First portion (0.5 mL) used for counting, viability and sterility assessment. The second portion (10 ml) placed into sterile syringe for injection. Autologous ADRC administration 10 mL of autologous ADRC suspension will be injected intramuscularly, close to the site of muscle injury. 10 to 20 injections (0.5 to 1.0 mL each) will be performed so as to infiltrate the injured muscle.</detailed_description>
