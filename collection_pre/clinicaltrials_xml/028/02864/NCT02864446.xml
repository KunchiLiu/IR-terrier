	<brief_summary>Urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP), a marker of intestinal mucosal cell damage, has recently been proposed as a clinically useful measure in the early detection of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, there are no data on urinary i-FABP in meconium obstruction of prematurity (MOP). This study aimed to evaluate urinary i-FABP in MOP patient as a marker for early detection.</brief_summary>
