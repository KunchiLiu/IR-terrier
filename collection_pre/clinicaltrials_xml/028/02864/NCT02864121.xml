	<brief_summary>High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are involved in cervical cancer development. Integration of HR-HPV DNA in cellular genomes is considered as a major event in the cervical cancer development. The aim of this study is to validate the integration of the HPV-HR as an appropriate biomarker of the severity of precancerous lesions and progression of cervical lesions towards cervical cancer. HR-HPV integration status will be analyzed by Molecular Combing technology, which allows direct and high-resolution visualization of the integration of high-risk HPV genomes.</brief_summary>
