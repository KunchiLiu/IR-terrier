	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (area under the curve [AUC], maximum concentration [Cmax], and other parameters) and tolerability of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin combination therapy following single and multiple doses in participants with CHC infection and moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 48 weeks, and the target sample size is 48 individuals.</brief_summary>
