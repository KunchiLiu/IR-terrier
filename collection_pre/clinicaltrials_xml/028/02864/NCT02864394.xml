	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus docetaxel in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors who have experienced disease progression after platinum-containing systemic therapy. The primary hypothesis of this study is that pembrolizumab (MK-3475) prolongs overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to docetaxel in participants with PD-L1 positive tumors</brief_summary>
