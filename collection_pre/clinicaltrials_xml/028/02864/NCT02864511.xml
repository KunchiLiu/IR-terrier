	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin for Neck Rejuvenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The abobotulinumtoxinA will be used for the Nefertiti lift The abobotulinumtoxinA will be prepared by adding 2.5 cc of normal saline to a 500-unit DysportÂ© (Ipsen Ltd, Berks, UK) vial Preinjection frontal, oblique and lateral patient pictures will be taken (at rest and with contraction) Injection points: - A series of 4 injection points 1-2 cm apart on a horizontal line under the mandible posterior to the hypothetical line were the nasolabial fold meets the mandible - If present, injection of each platysmal band every 2 cm with 2 to 4 injection points per band (Injection of platysmal band will be done by holding the band between 2 fingers and injecting intramuscularly) For all injection points 5 units per point of abobotulinumtoxinA will be used A maximum of 125 units of abobotulinumtoxinA will be allowed for the global neck treatment Follow up will be done at 15 days for retouching or for post op pictures if no retouching is needed. if retouching is needed post injection pictures will be taken 10 days post retouching Retouching: each residual platysmal band will be reinjected every 2 cm with 2 to 4 injection points per band (Injection of platysmal band will be done by holding the band between 2 fingers and injecting intramuscularly) (5 units per point of abobotulinumtoxinA will be used) A total of 30 patients will be recruited</detailed_description>
