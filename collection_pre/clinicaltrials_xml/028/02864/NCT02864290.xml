	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AGS62P1 given at two dosing schedules (Schedule A, every three weeks [Q3W] or Schedule B, weekly), in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In addition, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), the immunogenicity and the anti-leukemic activity of AGS62P1.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject has morphologically documented primary or secondary AML by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (2008) which is relapsed or refractory after failing at least 1 regimen and is not a candidate for established salvage treatment regimens Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG) ≤ 2 Subject has adequate renal function with an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min by the CockcroftGault equation adjusted for body weight Subject has a total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), albumin ≥ 2.5 g/d, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Negative pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential Sexually active fertile subjects, and their partners, must agree to use medically accepted doublebarrier methods of contraception (e.g., barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the study and at least 6 weeks after termination of study therapy Subjects must be competent to comprehend, provide written informed consent, and date an independent ethics committee/institutional review board/research ethics board (IEC/IRB/REB) approved informed consent form Subject has a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) Subject has preexisting sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 at baseline Subject has received small molecule therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, investigational drug, or chemotherapy within 14 days before first dose of study drug, with the exception of hydroxyurea Subject has any Grade ≥ 2 persistent nonhematological toxicity related to allotransplant Subject with Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD) who is receiving treatment with systemic glucocorticoids &gt; 10 mg/day equivalent of prednisone; however, treatment with low dose glucocorticoids (≤ 10 mg/day equivalent of prednisone) is permitted The use of systemic glucocorticoids in excess of 10 mg/day equivalent of prednisone is permitted provided it is not for the treatment of GVHD (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, antiemetic, infusion reactions). The chronic use of topical, inhaled, and locally injected steroids is permitted Subject requiring concomitant use of Pgp inhibitor(s) or inducer(s) is excluded. Subject who discontinues use of Pgp modulators must have a washout period of at least 14 days prior to the first dose of AGS62P1 Subject has known current central nervous system (CNS) disease Active angina or Class III or IV Congestive Heart Failure (New York Heart Association CHF Functional Classification System) or clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of the first dose of study drug, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, Grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or arrhythmias not controlled by medication Subject has clinical evidence of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Subject has known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus Subject has known positivity for Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody Subject has an uncontrolled active infection requiring treatment and fever 38.3°C or higher 48 hours before the first dose of study drug. Controlled infections (i.e. 3 negative cultures completing antibiotics and/or stable fungal infection in therapy) are allowed provided the subject has a temperature of &lt; 38.3°C within 48 hours of the first dose of study drug. Subject has a known sensitivity to any of the components of the investigational product AGS62P1: AGS62P1 LHistidine base LHistidine HCl α, α Trehalose Dihydrate Polysorbate 20 Major surgery within 28 days of the first dose of study drug Subject is pregnant or lactating Subject has a condition or situation which may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with subject's participation in the study Subject has any medical, psychiatric, addictive or other disorder which compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with procedures</criteria>
