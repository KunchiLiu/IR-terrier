	<brief_summary>Necrotizing scleritis with severe ischemia is refractory to conventional treatment because of avascular necrosis. The investigators assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of autologous perichondrium transplantation in patients with severe ischemic necrotizing scleritis, and analyzed the therapeutic effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perichondrium Autograft in Refractory Necrotizing Scleritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic necrotizing scleritis patients who showed persistent and progressive scleral melting were included in this study. Perichondrium tissue was harvested from the patient's ear cartilage and transplanted to reconstruct the scleral defect after the necrotic tissue removal.</detailed_description>
