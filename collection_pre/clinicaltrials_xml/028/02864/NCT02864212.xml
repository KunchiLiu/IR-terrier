	<detailed_description>The aim of this observational study is to create a database to extract feature of fast-acting drugs that can be monitor in real time to design control strategies based on high order sliding mode controller to create a robust drug infusion system. The observed drugs in this study are fast acting insulin, propofol and sodium nitroprusside. The effect of insulin will be measured by a continuous glucose monitor, the effect of propofol by a bispectral index monitor and the the effect of sodium nitroprusside by a invasive blood pressure monitor.</detailed_description>
