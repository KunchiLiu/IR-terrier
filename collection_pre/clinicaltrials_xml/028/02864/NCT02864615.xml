	<brief_title>Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of SBRT in Patients With Metastatic RCC Treated With Targeted or IO Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is prospective phase 1b study. Patients with metastatic RCC receiving targeted or IO therapy (VEGFR inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor or checkpoint inhibitors in approved treatment lines and in standard therapeutic regimens) with stable diseaseor durable partial response for at least 4 months, are enrolled in the study. The initial examination includes CT with contrast, where the selected measured 2 metastatic sites, stable for at least 4 months but no more than 6 months of targeted therapy (increase or decrease in size in the course of targeted therapy should not exceed 10%). Metastases have to be located in one organ. Allowed location of metastases: lungs, liver, lymph nodes, contralateral kidney, adrenal gland. Size of selected metastases should not be less than 5 mm and not more than 4 cm.</detailed_description>
