	<brief_summary>When attempting to wean a patient from the ventilator, even if he/she passes the spontaneous breathing test, 10-20% of the time extubation failure occurs and the patient is reintubated. When the patient is reintubated the mortality rate increases and the length of intensive care unit stay is also increased. It is vital to intensively assess the patient before extubation and correctly predict extubation success. Muscular ultrasound may be helpful in these situations.</brief_summary>
