	<brief_summary>Koning Breast CT (KBCT) was approved by FDA PMA. The X-ray detector originally used in Koning Breast CT was PaxScan 4030CB. Recently, Koning Breast CT uses a modified X-ray detector PaxScan 4030MCT. The modified detector is essentially identical to the previous model except a different detector housing which allows a narrower dead-space between the active area and the top of the housing. The benefit of the modified detector is that it allows Koning to modify the patient exam table, achieving a flatter surface in the center. The flatter surface will increase patient comfort and improve workflow. Meanwhile, flatter surface may also affect patient positioning and the coverage of the breast. The adequacy of the overall image quality with the new table/detector should be verified by radiologists.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Koning Breast CT (KBCT) was approved by FDA PMA. The X-ray detector originally used in Koning Breast CT was PaxScan 4030CB. Recently, Koning Breast CT uses a modified X-ray detector PaxScan 4030MCT. The modified detector is essentially identical to the previous model except a different detector housing which allows a narrower dead-space between the active area and the top of the housing.

The flatter surface will increase patient comfort and improve workflow. Meanwhile, flatter surface may also affect patient positioning and the coverage of the breast. The adequacy of the overall image quality with the new table/detector should be verified by radiologists. Images from ten (10) female patients (cases) with different breast sizes will be evaluated by 3 independent board-certified, MQSA-qualified radiologists (readers). The images were acquired from a separate clinical trial using KBCT system with the new table/detector. Two readers will independently evaluate the image quality of each case and choose to "accept" or "reject" the case. If there is a disagreement for a certain case, a third reader will independently evaluate that case and give the final result.</detailed_description>
