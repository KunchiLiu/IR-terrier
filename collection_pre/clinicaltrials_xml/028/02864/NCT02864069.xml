	<brief_summary>Vast evidence supports use of physical exercise and cognitive stimulation for lowering risk for cognitive decline and dementia, with combinations of non-pharmacological interventions providing greatest promise for impacting cognitive aging. This, paired with limited cognitive benefits from pharmacological interventions in dementia, has shifted focus to non-pharmacological interventions administered earlier in the disease course. This application, therefore, proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT; 12-week active intervention, 3- and 6-month follow-up) comparing 3 conditions: walking program (guided progressive increases in weekly step counts), computer-based cognitive training program (Brain HQ, Posit Science), and combination of the exercise and cognitive program, on cognitive, functional, and diagnostic outcomes in 60 sedentary, community-dwelling adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</brief_summary>
