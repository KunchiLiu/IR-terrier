	<detailed_description>A total of 80 (13 Class 1 and 67 Class 2) lesions in 40 patients (21 females, 19 males) with ages ranging between 18-38 years (23.15Â±5.15) were either restored with Charisma or Charisma Classic (Heraeus Kulzer) in combination with an etch and rinse adhesive system (Gluma 2 Bond) under rubber dam isolation by two experienced operators according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two independent examiners, who were blinded to the composites used evaluated the restorations according to the FDI (World Dental Federation) criteria. Bite-wing radiographs and intraoral digital photographs were taken before and after treatment and at 6 months. The statistical analyses were carried out with McNemar, Pearson Chi-square and Cochran Q tests (p&lt;0.05).</detailed_description>
