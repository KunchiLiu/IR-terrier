	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and validate the accuracy and usability of a deployed beta sensor-based system. This is a cross-sectional validation study of 100 apparently health community dwelling adults aged 60+ years. Participants will perform standardized lifestyle, exercise and sedentary type physical activities in a clinic laboratory and home setting.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wearable activity monitors have the potential to continuously and objectively measure physical activity. However, existing monitors do not address the unique challenges that face older adults, who comprise the largest segment of population who suffer from physical disabilities and dexterity issues that can make using such monitors exceedingly difficult. In fact, the majority of wearable devices on the market address the needs of three broad segments: 1. Consumers: these devices are designed and optimized for motivated, healthy younger individuals and require pairing with smartphones to transmit data, while restricting or, at best, limiting access to raw data and algorithms. 2. Researchers: research-focused devices tend to be validated across a wide range of studies, but are not optimized for wearability or longitudinal use. 3. Developers: Developer-focused devices typically provide high configurability, a high- definition screen, and a variety of sensors (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope, air pressure, light, temperature, etc.) that are suited for research and development, but are not optimized for power-efficient use. To overcome the barriers that existing monitors impose on measuring free-living physical activity data, EveryFit developed in-home activity monitoring technology that addresses the specific and unique needs of the older population (incorporated in product called QMedic). The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and validate the accuracy and usability of a deployed beta sensor-based system. The technology utilizes novel power-efficient engineering to continuously measure physical activity (including intensity, type and duration) in both laboratory and free-living settings. To accomplish this objective we will enroll 100 adults 60+ years of age who will perform standardized lifestyle, exercise and sedentary type physical activity in the laboratory. A subset of participants will also be asked to wear the monitor in free-living settings. The proposed work can have far-reaching impact given the growth in the older adult population, which suffers disproportionally from chronic disease and functional impairments. Validating technology that measures physical activity continuously and accurately at the home is a critical step in scaling the system, conducting affordable population- scale studies, and maximizing the societal impact of the innovation.</detailed_description>
