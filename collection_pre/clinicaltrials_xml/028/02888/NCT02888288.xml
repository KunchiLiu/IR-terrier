	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if implementing an adapted Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) curriculum plus mental health intervention versus HIV curriculum alone is acceptable and feasible and if it improves mental health, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and virologic outcomes among HIV-positive adolescents. HIV curriculum will continue to take place prior to the start of the monthly Saturday youth clinic. Mental health intervention sessions will take place three times a month for four months in groups of eight based on age and gender. Caregivers will attend two sessions to support the youth and provide the guardian perspective on caring for HIV-positive adolescents. The investigator hypothesizes the mental health intervention will be acceptable, feasible, and will improve mental health and ART adherence among participating youth and this improvement will be sustained over time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will enroll 100 participants from the established Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre and Mawenzi Saturday Teen Clinics. Participants will be assigned to eight persons per group, based on age and gender. Groups will be matched in pairs as closely as possible (ex. two groups of females 12-16 years of age) and assigned to Wave 1, 2, or 3. Randomization will occur just before the start of mental health intervention for each wave. Matched groups will be randomized at this time point to reduce potential drop out of those with delayed start (Wave 2/3). Randomization will occur by a coin flip for the matched groups: heads will be intervention group (I) and tails the standard of care group (SOC). This feasibility study is longitudinal with up to 24 month follow-up after intervention. Feasibility measures from lay counselors will be monitored weekly. Outcome measures will be obtained by blinded interviewers using a structured survey to inquire about mental health symptoms, self-report adherence, obtain an ART drug concentration level from a hair sample, and HIV-1 viral load from a blood sample will be collected by the same research assistants at six potential time points: 1) baseline, 2) pre-intervention, 3) post-intervention, 4) 6-months post-intervention, 5) 12-months post-intervention and 6) 24-months post-intervention.</detailed_description>
