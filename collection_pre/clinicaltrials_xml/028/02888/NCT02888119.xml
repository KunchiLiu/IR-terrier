	<brief_summary>This study aims to develop, evaluate and translate highly accelerated imaging sequences (each protocol under 5 minutes) for in-vivo knee Osteoarthritis applications on a standard clinical 3T scanner using novel compression sensing and parallel imaging strategies.The overarching objective of the study is to establish a non-invasive imaging biomarker based on the development of rapid relaxation mapping with compressed sensing (CS) that will be clinically useful for assessment of early Osteoarthritis. A total of 90 subjects including 30 patients with high risk of developing knee OA, 30 patients with mild OA and 30 healthy controls will be accrued.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current noninvasive imaging methods to evaluate knee joints include plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and clinical morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of joint structures. These techniques can only detect later-stage, macroscopic joint structural abnormalities that are irreversible and not amenable to early therapy. This study aims to develop highly accelerated imaging sequences for ex-vivo knee OA applications on a standard clinical 3T scanner using novel CS and parallel imaging (PI) strategies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients in the HJD OA database, ages 4075 with high risk of developing OA as defined by: (i) KL score of 0 (ii) Knee pain present in at least 1 knee (iii) Normal radiographs, (iv) At least one abnormal clinical MR finding such as prior knee injury, overweight or traumatic bone marrow edema lesions Patients ages 4075 with early OA as determined by KL scores 12 Healthy controls in the HJD OA database (KL score 0, no knee pain, no meniscal or ligament tears) Contraindications for MRIs (e.g. pacemakers, ferromagnetic vascular clips, metal implants, claustrophobia, etc). Subjects with any joint disease (example: Rheumatoid or inflammatory arthritis) other than knee OA, corticosteroid injections within the previous 3 months, and history of avascular necrosis, Paget's disease of bone, Wilson's disease, gout, total knee replacement (or plan for replacement within next 24 months). Major comorbidities such as diabetes, mellitus, cancer, congestive heart failure and chronic infectious diseases. Alignment interventions such as insoles and knee braces Vulnerable patients will not be recruited for this study</criteria>
