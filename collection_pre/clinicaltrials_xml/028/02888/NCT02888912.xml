	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical trial was to compare the clinical performances of a glass ionomer restorative system with a micro hybrid resin based composite in class I and class II cavities. A total of 140 (80 class I and 60 class II) lesions in 59 patients were restored with a glass ionomer restorative system (Equia) or a micro hybrid composite(Gradia Direct). Restorations were evaluated at baseline and yearly during 6 years according to the modified-USPHS criteria. Data were analyzed with Cohcran's Q and McNemar's tests (p&lt;0.05).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since the introduction of glass ionomers many modifications of these materials have been performed over the years. Compared to other permanent filling materials like resin-based composites, glass ionomers show several advantages, such as the ability to adhere to moist enamel and dentin and anti-cariogenic properties such as the long-term fluoride release. So, it was doubtful that glass ionomers represent a capable counterpart of amalgam or resin-based composites in posterior teeth.</detailed_description>
