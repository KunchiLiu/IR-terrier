	<brief_summary>The para-aortic lymph node involvement in the advanced stage of cervical cancer is a poor prognostic factor for overall survival. Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy has become the standard treatment for advanced cervical cancer. In case of para-aortic lymph node involvement, an extension of radiotherapy fields is recommended. A prospective multicentre study shown that the survival rate of patients with node ≤ 5 mm and which benefited from the expansion of radiotherapy fields was identical to the survival of pN0 patients. However, due to a specific disease, this technique should not be performed in all patients. It is necessary to reliably select patients with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. For this, it is recommended that prior to the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, nodal staging surgery with a definitive histological analysis. So we propose to use molecular diagnostic test OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) to improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity to achieve ultra-staging compared to conventional histology.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The para-aortic lymph node involvement in the advanced stage of cervical cancer is a poor prognostic factor for overall survival. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment for advanced cervical cancer. In case of para-aortic lymph node involvement, an extension of radiotherapy fields is recommended. A prospective multicenter study shown that the survival rate of patients with node ≤ 5 mm and which benefited from the expansion of radiotherapy fields was identical to the survival of pN0 patients. However, due to a specific disease, this technique should not be performed in all patients. It is necessary to reliably select patients with retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. For this, it is recommended that prior to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, nodal staging surgery with a definitive histological analysis. So we suggest using molecular diagnostic test OSNA (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) to improve lymph node metastasis detection sensitivity to achieve ultra-staging compared to conventional histology. We propose to consider a new concordance study to assess the feasibility of the technical OSNA in a new indication: cervical cancer. The analysis protocol of a concordance study is the same regardless of the location of the cancer. We evaluate the use of OSNA in order to ultrastaging of lymph node involvement for patients with advanced cancer of the cervix. Our hypothesis is that OSNA would be: - better than the usual histological staging method - and equivalence in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared to intensive histological method To complete this study we propose to search the initial brain tumor expression of cytokeratin 19.</detailed_description>
