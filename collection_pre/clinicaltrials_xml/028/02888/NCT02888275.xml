	<brief_summary>Dexmedetomidine is a selective Î±-2 receptor agonist with a sedative and cardiopulmonary profile that makes it an attractive anesthetic for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). The aim of this study was to investigate the renal protective effect of dexmedetomidine in the perioperative setting in children with heart disease. Total 144 pediatric patients allocated dexmedetomidine (DEX) and did not receive the drug (NoDEX) group. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the use of intraoperative dexmedetomidine and the incidence of acute kidney injury in pediatric patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. The secondary objective was to determine whether there was an association between dexmedetomidine use and duration of mechanical ventilation or cardiovascular ICU stay.</brief_summary>
