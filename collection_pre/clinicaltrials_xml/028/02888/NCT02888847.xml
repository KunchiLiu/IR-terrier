	<brief_title>High Light Intensity Bleaching Versus Descending Light Intensities Bleaching on Post Bleaching Teeth Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be applied to patients suffering from teeth discolorations. Nowadays, vital tooth bleaching is one of the most requested cosmetic dental procedures asked by patients who want and aesthetically more pleasing smile. The American Dental Association (ADA) has advised patients to ask the dentists to adamant the most suitable bleaching treatment, especially for those complaining of tooth sensitivity, dental restorations, extremely dark discolorations, and single dark teeth. Tooth sensitivity (TS) is the most common clinical side effect of tooth bleaching. Tooth sensitivity (TS) caused by bleaching procedures usually results in mild and transient pain; however, it can occasionally cause significant discomfort that is a main deterrent to patients successfully completing bleaching treatments. Considering that TS has been reported as a common side effect, affecting more than 60% of the patients that undergo this cosmetic treatment. Greater tooth sensitivity has been reported with in-office bleaching with adjunct light compared with no light. Existing literature reveals that activation of bleaching agents by heat or light may have an adverse effect on pulpal tissue. It was already reported that the use of intense lights does elevate bleach temperature, but it results in increased intrapulpal temperatures, which may further impact patient sensitivity and pulpal health.Hence, in this study different light intensities bleaching protocol will be used aiming at overcoming this complication.</detailed_description>
