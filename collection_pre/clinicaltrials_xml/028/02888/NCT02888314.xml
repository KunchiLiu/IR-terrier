	<brief_title>Pokemon Go and Physical Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pokemon Go is a location-based reality mobile game for iOS and Android devices developed by Niantic. Making use of GPS and the camera of compatible devices, the game allows players to capture virtual creatures, called Pokemon, who appear on cellphone screens as though in the real world. In order to search and capture the Pokemon, the players needs to go out and become more active. For this reason, the game has great potential to promote physical activity. Nevertheless, there has no study evaluating the potential impact of Pokemon Go on physical activity. The investigator proposes a retrospective online survey. Participants are instructed to enter data of their daily physical activity as reported in iPhone Health App. Number of "Steps" and % greater than 10,000 steps/day will be compared before and after installing the Pokemon Go app.</detailed_description>
