	<detailed_description>The proposed study will determine the abuse liability of altered composition cigarettes compared to standard cigarettes using a behavioral economics abuse-liability approach. Behavioral economic demand analysis constitutes a comprehensive examination of drug reinforcement and abuse liability. Laboratory determination of cigarette consumption under various response requirements will occur before and after 3 weeks of at-home exposure, with participants randomized to cigarettes varying in composition to determine the role of experience on the abuse-liability of various cigarettes. Abuse liability will be assessed by 2 essential demand metrics: lower demand intensity and increased demand elasticity, as well as other demand metrics and subjective ratings of "liking". The study will also determine the degree to which altered composition cigarettes may substitute for standard composition cigarettes - testing whether an altered composition policy would achieve the goal of reducing standard cigarette consumption.</detailed_description>
