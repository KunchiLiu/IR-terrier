	<brief_summary>Patients who are discharged from hospital can be overwhelmed when they suddenly have to manage new conditions or medications. These changes can be particularly difficult for people on many medications or with multiple health conditions. There is a real risk that this will lead to emergency room visits, hospital readmission, and even death. In addition to endangering patients, these adverse events are very costly to the healthcare system. The good news is that these events can be preventable if patients receive care that is better coordinated. Patient-oriented research will be conducted to determine if a pharmacist-led medication therapy management service can improve health outcomes of 'medically complex' patients transitioning from acute to primary care in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). This a more comprehensive service than their community pharmacist would normally provide. The program will use a new Pharmacist Clinic service to provide care and support which does not currently exist for patients in NL after they leave hospital. After discharge, patients will be randomly divided into two groups: one group will receive care as usual from their doctor; the other group will have their medications assessed by a clinic pharmacist within one week of hospital discharge along with their usual care from their doctor. The two groups will be compared to determine whether specialized pharmacist services after hospital discharge is satisfactory to patients/providers, improves patient health, and reduces emergency room visits, hospital readmissions, and repeat trips to the doctor. If successful, this project will help ensure that patients are taking the right medications in the right way, improving individual health and making better use of healthcare system resources.</brief_summary>
