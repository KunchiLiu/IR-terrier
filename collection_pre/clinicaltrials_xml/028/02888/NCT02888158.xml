	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare two groups of gynecologic/urologic/visceral internes in terms of the time required to perform a laparoscopic surgical intervention (nephrectomy) on an animal model (pig). The two groups of internes differ by the type of training they received: (1) Pelvic-Trainer training with robotic assistance versus (2) Pelvic-Trainer training without robotic assistance.</brief_summary>
