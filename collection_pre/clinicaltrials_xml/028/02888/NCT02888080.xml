	<criteria>Key Male and female subjects ages 18 to 80 years of age (both inclusive) Pulmonary sarcoidosis disease duration of ≥1 year Evidence of biopsyproven, clinically active disease defined by having all of the following criteria: 1. MMRC dyspnea scale ≥1 2. Threshold FVC 50 80% of predicted 3. Evidence of parenchymal lung involvement by HRCT Key Treated pulmonary hypertension Previous exposure to concomitant treatment within according to the following criteria: 1. Prednisone &gt;15 mg/day or changes in prednisone dose in the 8 weeks prior to screening 2. More than one immunemodulator (i.e., methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine) or changes in their dosing levels within 12 weeks of randomization. 3. Mycophenolate use within 12 weeks of randomization Prior treatment with any biologic drug targeting the immune system within 180 days of randomization or history of any previous use of rituximab History of bleeding disorder Forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;50% of predicted Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis as primary treatment indication (e.g., involving brain, heart, eye and renal disease with significant hypercalcemia) Any conditions or significant medical problems which in the opinion of the investigator immunecompromise the patient and/or places the patient at unacceptable risk for immunomodulatory therapy, such as: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;LLN (1,500/μl) 2. Thrombocytopenia CTCAE v4.03 Grade 1: Platelets &lt;LLN (75.0 x 109/L) 3. Any active or recurrent bacterial, fungal (with exception of onychomycosis) or viral infection 4. Presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections based on screening lab results 5. Presence of active or latent tuberculosis (TB) established during screening 6. Clinical evidence or history of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases, or Felty's syndrome Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to the start of the trial Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the clinical investigator renders the patient unsuitable for the trial Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using methods of contraception defined in the protocol for the study.</criteria>
