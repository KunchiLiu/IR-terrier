	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies 18F-clofarabine positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in imaging patients with cancer before and after treatment with a therapy that activates the patient's immune system (immunotherapy). PET/CT scans give detailed pictures of areas inside the body. 18F-clofarabine is a drug that contains a radioactive substance that is taken up by cells expressing deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which is highly expressed in activated immune cells, making them light up during PET/CT scans. Doctors also want to know how 18F-clofarabine is distributed throughout the body before and after treatment with immunotherapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-Clofarabine PET/CT in Imaging Cancer Patients Before and After Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether positron emission tomography (PET) using the new imaging agent 18F-clofarabine can be used for imaging cancer, and whether interventions that activate the immune system can change the biodistribution of 18F-clofarabine. OUTLINE: Patients receive 18F-clofarabine intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan at baseline and 2-4 weeks after completion of immunotherapy.</detailed_description>
