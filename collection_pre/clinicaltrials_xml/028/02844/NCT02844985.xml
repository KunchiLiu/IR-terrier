	<brief_summary>The study is intended to identify gene polymorphisms significantly associated with specific behavioral- and preoccupation-typologies of sexual addiction, and to identify additional potential genetic markers of sexual addiction. Research subjects with sexual addiction will be identified from the out-patient and in-patient populations of the investigative sites. Research subjects in the Control Group will be identified from the general population and from the student body of selected colleges. Approximately 1100 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Anticipating 10% drop-out, this is intended to generate a population of approximately 500 men and women clinically diagnosed with sexual addiction, and approximately 500 healthy men and women who do not meet diagnostic criteria for sexual addiction nor have psychopathology who will serve as the control population.</brief_summary>
