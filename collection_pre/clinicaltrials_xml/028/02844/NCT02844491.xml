	<brief_summary>Cancer-specific splice variants gain significant interest as they generate neo-antigens, that could be targeted by immune cells. CD20, a membrane antigen broadly expressed in mature B cell lymphomas, is subject to an alternative splicing named Delta-CD20 leading to loss of membrane expression of the spliced isoform. The investigators group would now determine if it's possible, in patients with lymphoproliferative B, to detect the presence of a specific memory response to delta-CD20 peptides. If this memory response exists, it will confirm the interest of this antigen as a target for tumor immunotherapy.</brief_summary>
