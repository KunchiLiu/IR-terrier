	<brief_title>Stereotactic Laser Ablation for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation system for necrotization or coagulation of epileptogenic foci in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The study will include approximately 120 adult patients with drug-resistant MTLE treated at selected epilepsy centers across the United States. After the Visualase procedure, patients will be followed for 12 months and evaluated for freedom from seizures, quality of life, adverse events, and neuropsychological outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History of drugresistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) If the subject has a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), must have failed to achieve sustained seizure freedom with the VNS implanted for at least 6 months On stable antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (and/or stable VNS setting, if applicable) and compliant with medication use An average of at least 1 complex partial or secondarily generalized seizure compatible with MTLE per month Seizure symptoms and/or auras compatible with MTLE Video EEG shows evidence of seizures from one temporal lobe consistent with MTLE MRI has evidence consistent with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis Willing and able to remain on stable AEDs (and stable VNS setting, if applicable) for 12 months following the Visualase procedure Willing and able to comply with protocol requirements Unwilling or unable to sign the study informed consent form Pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the course of the study Currently implanted with a device contraindicating MRI Progressive brain lesions and/or tumors not associated with epileptic disease state History of previous intracranial surgery for treatment of epileptic seizures Persistent extratemporal or predominant contralateral focal interictal spikes or slowing, or generalized interictal spikes on EEG Seizures with contralateral or extratemporal ictal onset on EEG Aura and/or ictal behavior suggest an extratemporal focus MRI evidence of epileptogenic, extratemporal lesions or bilateral hippocampal damage If additional testing has been performed, results are discordant with the seizure focus scheduled for ablation Noncompliance with AED requirements IQ &lt; 70 Dementia or other progressive neurological disease Unstable major psychiatric illness, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, or medical illness that would contraindicate the Visualase procedure or affect the neuropsychological assessments Participation in other research that may potentially interfere with SLATE endpoint(s) Allergy to gadolinium</criteria>
