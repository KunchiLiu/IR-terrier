	<brief_title>EYE-TRAC Advance: Technology Verification (ETA-TV) Cohort 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes. Athletes will be tested with the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device prior to the start of an athletic practice or competition (pre-test) and then after the conclusion of the practice/competition (post-test). The investigators hope to understand if eye-tracking scores are effected by exercise and non-concussive bodily contact commonly incurred during athletic play.</detailed_description>
