	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the interaction of GLP-1 and GIP to regulate insulin secretion in nondiabetic subjects. The first part of this aim will determine the threshold plasma concentration of GLP-1 that increases insulin secretion to test the hypothesis that fasting levels of circulating GLP-1 are insufficient to mediate β-cell secretion. The second part of the aim will determine whether the insulin response to specific amino acids is dependent on the α-cell release of GLP-1. The study will enroll up to 40 healthy overweight participants and while it is anticipated that the screening blood draw will yield a number of screen failures, it is estimated that 12 subjects will complete the entire study protocol. Enrolled participants will be asked to complete five study visits including the consent visit and four infusion study visits that will include hyperglycemic clamps. Each infusion procedure will last 4 hours. The primary outcome for visits 2-3 will be insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia and GLP-1. Data will be analyzed using 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures using time and treatment as the two factors. Post-hoc comparisons will be used to determine the stage when intact GLP-1 levels exceed fasting levels and the stage when insulin secretion exceeds that of the clamp alone. The primary outcome for visits 4-5 will be arginine-stimulated insulin secretion with and without GLP-1r blockade. The mean increment of ISR above baseline in the 15 minutes after arginine stimulation will be used to integrate insulin secretion, the primary outcome measure, and two-way analysis of variance with fasting/hyperglycemia, and Ex-9/saline as the two factors; post-hoc comparisons among the 4 insulin responses will be made if a significant interaction is present.</brief_summary>
