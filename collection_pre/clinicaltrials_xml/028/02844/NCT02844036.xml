	<brief_summary>Currently, the standard treatment for proximal thromboses lesions responsible for post-embolic pulmonary hypertension, is the surgical thromboendarterectomy. When the ravages are judged too distal or the patient is judged inoperable for a curative surgical gesture, there is no evidence of any therapeutic option, exept for K anti-vitamins for recurrent embolism. Prognosis is then pejorative with a 60% mortality at 5 years. This study propose an alternative treatment for these patients in therapeutic "dead end". This is about applying arterial thrombosis technique to the pulmonary circulation.</brief_summary>
