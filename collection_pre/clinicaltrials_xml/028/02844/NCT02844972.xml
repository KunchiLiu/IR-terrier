	<brief_summary>Decisions to limit and stop active therapeutics are common in the emergency unit. They are framed by the Leonetti law of 22 April 2005 recommending the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy and care of the patient's pain in later life. The pain assessment is an issue for these patients whose in majority, are not communicating. Moreover, no specific tool and the teams in charge, not knowing the patient make the recognition and treatment of pain symptoms very complex. This is the potential interest of directly involving the family or the person of confidence in this management , the first step being the detection and evaluation of pain.</brief_summary>
