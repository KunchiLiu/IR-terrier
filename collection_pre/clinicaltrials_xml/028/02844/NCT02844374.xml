	<brief_summary>Epilepsy is a devastating chronic disease due to multiple causes that affect close to 50% of the world's population. Although effective, epilepsy surgery fails in many cases, the percentage of patients free from crisis on a long term (â‰¥ 5 years) varies from 27% to 66% according to the kind of epilepsy. It is in this context that EPISTIM is interesting, and its aims isb a better electrophysiology delimiting of cortical networks that imply the genesis of seizures with the aim to improove surgery results. This study will rely on the intracerebral records and on corticales electrical stimulation as they are currently routinely used by epileptic patients candidates for surgery.</brief_summary>
