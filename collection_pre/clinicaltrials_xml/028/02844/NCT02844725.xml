	<brief_title>Evaluate the Analgesic Efficacy and Safety of VVZ-149 Injection for Post-operative Pain Following Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VVZ-149 is a dual antagonist of GlyT2 and 5HT2A. GlyT2 blockage increases inhibitory synaptic transmission by glycine in the spinal cord, resulting in a reduction of pain transmissions to the brain. 5HT2A blockage decreases descending serotonergic facilitatory modulation on pain transmission by the brain and reduces nociceptor activation in peripheral nerves, which are primary sources of pain in post-surgical pain. VVZ-149 has been shown to have comparable efficacy to morphine in well controlled (blind, complete randomization with a positive control) animal studies using rat models of post-operative pain and formalin-induced pain. The PK/PD study in animals indicates that therapeutic plasma concentration in human subjects will be 600-1,900 ng/ml. A clinical Phase 1 study performed in healthy subjects has shown no clinically significant adverse events up to a plasma concentration level of 3,261 ng/ml other than brief symptoms of mild nausea or dizziness, and mild somnolence when the plasma exposure level is more than 2,000 ng/ml.</detailed_description>
