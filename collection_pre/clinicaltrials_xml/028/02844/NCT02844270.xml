	<brief_title>Galaxy Rapamycin Drug-Eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Stent System First-in-man Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, single arm clinical trial. 45 patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to queue1 (n=30) and queue 2 (n=15). The clinical follow-up will be performed in all subjects at 1 month,6 months,1 year,2 years,3 years,4 years and 5 years after stent implantation; angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 6 months and 2 years after stent implantation in queue 1; angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 1 year and 3 years after stent implantation in queue 2. The primary endpoint of the study is target lesion failure (TLF) at 30 days after stent implantation.</detailed_description>
