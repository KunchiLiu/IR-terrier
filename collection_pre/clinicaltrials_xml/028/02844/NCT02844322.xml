	<brief_title>The Comparison of RCD Versus BCD in Newly Diagnosed Waldenström Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newly diagnosed WM patients will be randomly assigned to BCD or RCD group for introduction chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic response will be evaluated after 3 cycles. If a PR or better response achieves, addition 3 cycles will be given. If not, patients will be crossed to control group for another 3 cycles.
