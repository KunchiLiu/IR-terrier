	<brief_summary>In this study, participants with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma will receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy with paclitaxel,carboplatin and pembrolizumab then undergo surgery. The primary study hypothesis is that adding pembrolizumab will increase complete pathologic response rate at surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed ESCC 2. Clinical stage T1N12 or T234aN012 (AJCC 7 TNM classification) 3. No evidence of metastasis 4. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. 5. Be 20 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 6. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion through repeated biopsies. Newlyobtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newlyobtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor. 7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. 8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. 9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 10. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.2) must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 Contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. 11. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.1) must agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.1 Contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 1. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis) 4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients. 5. Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. 7. Has another malignancy within the last 5 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative surgery, or in situ cervical cancer. 8. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. 9. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis. 10. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. 11. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. 12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. 13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. 14. Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent. 15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies). 16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). 17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.</criteria>
