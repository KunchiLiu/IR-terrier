	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works in treating patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that has come back and has not responded to treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may block specific proteins found on white blood cells which may strengthen the immune system and control tumor growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atezolizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent BCG-Unresponsive Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate complete response at 25 weeks after registration for those with a carcinoma in situ (CIS) component and to evaluate event-free survival at 18 months in patients with BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta/T1/CIS) treated with atezolizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate event-free survival at 18 months for the subset of patients with papillary cancer (Ta/T1). II. To estimate progression-free survival, cystectomy-free survival, bladder cancer-specific survival, overall survival in all patients. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the level of agreement between local and central pathology review in terms of recurrence (for all patients) and complete response (for the CIS subset). II. To identify markers that predict response to atezolizumab in the CIS population and that are associated with event-free survival (EFS) in patients with Ta/T1/CIS BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The following markers will be tested: expression of PD-L1 and CD8 by immunohistochemistry (IHC); expression of immune signatures by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). OUTLINE: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses (51 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years and then every 24 weeks for 3 years.</detailed_description>

(CIS disease is not expected to have been completely excised) Patients must have had cytology within 21 days prior to registration; cytology for patients with CIS component is not expected to be negative for malignant cells; if the cytology for patients with only Ta/T1 disease is positive for malignant cells, patient must have had a biopsy of the prostatic urethra within the previous six months All patients with T1 urothelial carcinoma must undergo retransurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) within 60 days prior to registration, and must have uninvolved muscularis propria in the pathologic specimen from either the first or the second TURBT; tissue from the reresection must be submitted; the TURBT that identified the recurrent T1 disease may have taken place more than 60 days prior to registration Patients must not have had urothelial carcinoma in the prostate or upper urinary tract within the previous 24 months, or muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder at any time; patients must have a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out upper tract malignancy and intraabdominal metastases within 90 days prior to registration Patients must be deemed unfit for radical cystectomy by the treating physician, or the patient must refuse radical cystectomy, which is considered standard of care for these patients; the reason for patients not to undergo cystectomy will be clearly documented Patients must be BCGunresponsive; a patient is BCGunresponsive if they meet one or more of the following criteria: Patient has persistent or recurrent highgrade Ta/CIS urothelial carcinoma after completing therapy with at least induction BCG (&gt;= 5 doses) and first round maintenance or second induction (&gt;= 2 doses) Patient has high grade T1 urothelial carcinoma after induction BCG (&gt;= 5 doses) only or after induction BCG (&gt;= 5 doses) and first round maintenance or second induction BCG (&gt;= 2 doses) Patient is diseasefree at 6 months after starting BCG (i.e., complete response) but then experiences a highgrade recurrence within 6 months after the last BCG dose All adverse events associated with any prior surgery and intravesical therapy must have resolved to grade =&lt;

patients must not have received or be planning to receive any of the prohibited therapies during protocol treatment; prior intravesical interferon therapy is allowed Patients must not be planning to receive concomitant other biologic therapy, radiation therapy, intravesical chemotherapy, surgery, or other therapy while on this protocol Patients must not have received any prior radiation to the bladder for bladder cancer Patients must not have received treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor [antiTNF] agents) within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1; exceptions: (1) patients may have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (e.g., a onetime dose of dexamethasone for nausea); (2) the use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 microliter (mcL) Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Total bilirubin =&lt;
