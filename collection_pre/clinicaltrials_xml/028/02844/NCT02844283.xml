	<criteria>Male or female 1880 years of age Clinical diagnosis of anterior STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within the last 30 days, with any one of the following 12lead electrocardiographic changes: a) Greater than or equal to 2 mm STsegment elevation) in 2 adjacent electrocardiographic precordial leads b) A new left bundle branch block AND and an increase in cardiospecific enzymes &gt;3x CK, or increase in troponin compared to institution laboratory normal ranges Successful PCI with stent implantation to infarctrelated artery within the last 30 days; defined as residual stenosis no greater than 30%, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow of at least 2 and a reference diameter of at least &gt; 2mm Is considered hemodynamically stable at time of enrollment and immediately prior to AdHGF delivery Screening LVEF for the first 12 enrolled participants, must be no greater than 40% by echocardiography (determined by Simpson's method) performed at least 2 days after revascularization procedure. Subsequent participants enrolled in the trial, must have an LVEF no greater than 45%. (All screening echos done within the first 4 days post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) must be repeated either by echocardiography or MRI prior to AdHGF delivery to ensure that the variability does not exceed 10%) In the case of a previous myocardial infarction, documented LVEF must be 50% or greater Female participants must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal, have documented infertility, or are of childbearing potential wih laboratory confirmation of nonpregnant state Provided written informed consent and is willing to comply with study followup visits Significant unprotected left main disease (stenosis of 50% or greater)on diagnostic angiography An increase in LVEF by greater that 10% from initial LVEF evaluation for repeat assessments The presence of significant coronary lesions, other than the index lesion of the infarction related artery A history of significant ventricular arrhythmia not related to index STEMI A history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 6 months of enrollment Inability to undergo apheresis procedure(i.e.: poor venous access, laboratory abnormalities A history of uncorrected significant valvular heart disease A history of left ventricular dysfunction prior to index STEMI A history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)or hepatitis B or C infection A history of malignancy within 5 years (Except for lowgrade and fully resolved nonmelanoma skin cancer) A history of allergy to gentamycin or amphotericin A history of noncompliance Active inflammatory autoimmune disease requiring chronic immunosuppressive therapy Creatinine clearance &lt;60 by CockcroftGault Calculator Confirmed pregnant or lactating Is enrolled in a current investigational drug or device trial Participant has received cell or gene therapy in past The presence of any significant comorbidities that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude the participant from taking part in the trial Inability to provide informed consent and comply with the followup visit schedule</criteria>
