	<brief_summary>Meningococcus C vaccine was first used in France to prevent epidemics. It was a success in Puy-de-Dôme, Landes, Pyrénées Atlantiques and Hautes Pyrénées. Following many European countries, France introduced meningococcus C conjugate vaccine in 2009 but this recommendation was not suffiicently applied (6,6% of the 20-25 years-old were vaccinated in 2015). The situation in France is very different from UK and there is no data on the subject. The vaccination campaign in 2002 in Puy-de-Dôme offers much more detachment, possible comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated people, among which meningococcus circulation could maintain immunity. This is the reason why we have decided to assess in 2016 the vaccinal and natural immunity among Puy-de-Dôme population.</brief_summary>
