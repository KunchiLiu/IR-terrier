	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is for clinical staff to gain experience using the proposed artificial pancreas system named inControl and the inControl Cloud and assess 24/7 in-home usability prior to initiating a large randomized controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) Trial: Research Site Training Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participation in this study will require 5 study visits over 2-4 weeks. - Visit 1: screening/enrollment visit to assess study eligibility. - Visit 2: continuous glucose monitor (CGM) training and initiation session based upon current or prior use of a CGM; if subject doesn't currently use a CGM, subject will be trained and may be asked to wear the CGM at home for 1 week. - Visit 3: subjects will be taught how to use the study insulin pump. - Visit 4: subjects will be trained on the use of inControl and wear it at home for 14 days. - Visit 5: subjects will return study equipment and to complete questionnaire.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Clinical diagnosis, based on investigator assessment, of type 1 diabetes for at least one year and using insulin for at least 1 year 2. Use of an insulin pump for at least 6 months with established parameters for basal rate(s), carbohydrate ratio(s) and insulin sensitivity factor(s) for at least 3 months. 3. Age 14.0 to &lt;75.0 years 4. HbA1c level &lt;10.5% at screening 5. For females, not currently known to be pregnant. If female and sexually active, must agree to use a form of contraception to prevent pregnancy while a participant in the study. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test will be required for all premenopausal women who are not surgically sterile. Subjects who become pregnant will be discontinued from the study. Also, subjects who during the study develop and express the intention to become pregnant within the timespan of the study will be discontinued. 6. Have care partner committed to participating in all training activities, knowledgeable at all times of the participants location, and being present and available to provide assistance when the system is being used at night 7. Willingness, if using the closedloop system, to stop closedloop when taking acetaminophen and avoid closedloop for at least 4 hours afterward 8. Willingness to suspend use of any personal CGM for the duration of the clinical trial once the study CGM is in use 9. Willingness to establish network connectivity on a daily basis either via local WiFi network or via a studyprovided cellular service 10. Investigator has confidence that the subject can successfully operate all study devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol 11. Currently using no insulins other than one of the following rapidacting insulins at the time of enrollment: insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (Novolog), or insulin glulisine (Apidra) Exclusion Criteria 1. More than one episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the 6 months prior to enrollment 2. More than one episode of severe hypoglycemia involving seizure of loss of consciousness in the 6 months prior to enrollment 3. Medical need for chronic acetaminophen 4. Concurrent use of any noninsulin glucoselowering agent (including GLP1 agonists, Symlin, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, biguanides, sulfonylureas and naturaceuticals). 5. Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder 6. A condition, which in the opinion of the investigator or designee, would put the participant or study at risk 7. Participation in another pharmaceutical or device trial at the time of enrollment or during the study 8.
