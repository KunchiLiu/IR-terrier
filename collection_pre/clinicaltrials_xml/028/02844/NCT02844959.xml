	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate inflammatory response as a prognostic factor of atrial fibrillation recurrency after ablation. Inflammatory response will be assessed by double measurement of C-reactive protein, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8) and body temperature. Dynamics of change of troponin I will be measured additionally. After ablation each patient will be monitored with ECG telemonitoring system for 7 days.</brief_summary>
