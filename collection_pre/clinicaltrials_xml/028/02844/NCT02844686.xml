	<brief_summary>New CZT-based SPECT cameras are potentially capable of dynamic 3-D acquisition. Preliminary results suggested that dynamic acquisitions could allow the assessment of myocardial flow reserve using 99mTc-labelled perfusion tracers. The Flow-Heart study will assess the feasibility of myocardial flow reserve measurement by means of 99mTc-DTPA dynamic cardiac SPECT in 20 patients.</brief_summary>
