	<brief_summary>Neonatal intensive care is necessary for the survival of preterm baby. Several studies show the deleterious effect on the immature brain due to stimulations caused by the environment and hospital care. However, a specific and individualized support to the development during the first weeks of this preterm patient has a positive effect on newborn development. A new practical newborn behavioral observation scale has been developed by the investigators care unit in order to adapt care and individualized support to the development for each patient. The goal of this study is to estimate the external reproductibility of this scale by experimented nurse in order to implement an individualized care program.</brief_summary>
