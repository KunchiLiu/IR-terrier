	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the differences in quality of life , inflammation, stress, telomere length, and mucosal immune function of Hispanic and non-Hispanic caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).

	<brief_title>Stress-Busting Program and QoL, Bio-markers of Immunity/Stress and Cellular Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching goal of this project is to (1) explore the differences in quality of life (QoL), inflammation, stress, telomere length, and mucosal immune function of Hispanic caregivers of persons with ADRD and (2) determine whether a caregiver intervention can effectively improve the QoL, inflammation, stress, telomere length, and mucosal immune function biomarkers of Hispanic caregivers. The proposed study is a non-randomized trial design with three groups of ADRD caregivers that vary based on Hispanic ethnicity and English/Spanish language preference. The project's specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To compare the quality of life (QoL) (stress, depression, and burden), mucosal immunity function (sIgA), stress (sCortisol and sAmylase), inflammation(CRP), and telomere length in Spanish-speaking Hispanic, English-speaking Hispanic, and English-speaking non-Hispanic caregivers who participate in an evidence-based Stress-Busting Program (SBP) for family caregivers of family members living with ADRD. Working hypothesis: At baseline, Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers have lower QoL and immune function, higher levels of inflammation and stress, and shorter telomeres as compared to Hispanic and non-Hispanic English-speaking caregivers. Specific Aim 2: To compare the impact of the SBP on QoL and biomarkers for stress, aging, inflammation and mucosal immunity among those caregivers completing the SBP (Hispanic caregivers completing the culturally adapted translated version to Spanish of SBP and Hispanic and non-Hispanic caregivers completing the English-SBP). Working Hypothesis: Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers completing the Spanish-SBP show more improvement in their QoL and biomarkers of stress, mucosal immunity, aging and inflammation post-intervention as compared to Hispanic and Non-Hispanic caregivers completing the English-SBP. To achieve these aims, the investigators propose to deliver the 9-week English SBP and the translated and culturally adapted Spanish-SBP. Saliva and blood samples and self- report measures of QoL will be collected at baseline and 9 weeks (end of intervention)</detailed_description>
