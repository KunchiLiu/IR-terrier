	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the tolerability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of intranasal oxytocin administration prior to motivational enhancement group therapy sessions on laboratory-based measures of addiction, social connectedness, and stress responsivity in methamphetamine(meth)-using men who have sex with men (MSM). The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, study of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo 40 IU prior to each of three Motivational Enhancement Group Therapy (MEGT) sessions in 28 mixed HIV sero-status MSM initiating treatment for amphetamine use disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxytocin HIV Meth Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high prevalence of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) among men who have sex with men (MSM) leads to significant health disparities, including increased risk for HIV sero-conversion. Reducing methamphetamine use mitigates HIV risk. Currently no psychopharmacological agent exists for the treatment of AUD; innovative interventions are desperately needed. Oxytocin, a social neuropeptide, has well-studied anti-addiction effects in animal models of substance dependence. The use of intranasal oxytocin for a variety of human substance use disorders is under early investigation, although no one has studied oxytocin's effects in AUD. In other populations, oxytocin's effects are known to vary depending on social context. Psychosocial treatment alone has been shown to reduce methamphetamine and HIV risk in MSM at a community-based clinic in San Francisco, The Stonewall Project. The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind pilot study of psychopharmacological-psychosocial combination therapy, administration of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo prior to three Motivational Enhancement Group Therapy (MEGT) sessions, in 28 mixed HIV sero-status MSM initiating treatment for AUD. The investigators aim to assess: 1) tolerability, 2) feasibility for larger randomized controlled trials, and 3) exploratory measures of efficacy, including: a) urine levels of methamphetamine and metabolites, b) methamphetamine craving, c) engagement in MEGT through third-party coding of videotaped group sessions and self-reported measures of group connectedness, d) psychophysiological stress responses to group engagement, and e) sexual risk taking.</detailed_description>
