	<brief_summary>Objective: Because many people with type 1 diabetes drink ethanol and because glucagon is used to treat mild hypoglycaemia, it is essential to determine whether ethanol will impair the effectiveness of glucagon to increase glucose, which may impair the effectiveness of the dual hormone treatment in preventing hypoglycaemia. The purpose of this study is to determine, whether ethanol influences the glucose response to subcutaneous glucagon during mild hypoglycaemia. The investigators hypothesize that prior evening ethanol consumption does not reduce the effect of a glucagon bolus to raise plasma glucose compared with no prior ethanol consumption. The study aims: 1. To determine the late effects of ethanol on the efficacy of subcutaneous glucagon to restore plasma glucose after an episode of mild hypoglycemia. 2. To determine the late effects of ethanol on the counter-regulatory hormones and hypoglycaemia awareness during mild hypoglycaemia A double-blinded placebo-controlled study will be conducted. Participants will serve as their own controls. Eligible participants will after an informed consent complete two study visits, one with and one without ethanol consumption, in a random order. On each study visit, participants are induced a insulin induced hypoglycemia, seven-eight hours after a meal with or without ethanol. Once plasma glucose is below 3.9 mmol/l, a subcutaneous injection of 100 mcg glucagon is administered. Two hours later a second bolus is administered.</brief_summary>

Use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates or opiates or other central nervous system depressant drugs that could act synergistically with ethanol to lower the level of consciousness History of drug abuse Current participation in another diabetesrelated clinical trial that, in the judgment of the principle investigator, will compromise the results of the study or the safety of the subject.
