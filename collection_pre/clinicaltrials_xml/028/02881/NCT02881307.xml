	<brief_title>Ultrasound Assessment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Who Changed Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot 12-week RCT (Randomized Clinical Trial) in 60 obese RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) patients to evaluate if a weight loss intervention will improve PDUS (Power Doppler Ultra Sound), traditional disease activity measures (DAS28, Disease Activity Score - 28), and adipokine/MBDA (Multi-Biomarker Disease Activity) assessments. While there have been observational weight loss RA studies, none were RCTs and they did not utilize objective measures (PDUS or MBDA).</detailed_description>
