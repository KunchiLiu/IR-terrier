	<brief_summary>Most immunodeficiencies are related to severe immunoglobulin deficiencies which require lifelong replacement therapy with immunoglobulin G (IgG) to reduce the incidence and severity of infections. IgG can be administered intravenously (IGIV) every 21 or 28 days or subcutaneously every week or every other week (IGSC) for subjects who do not tolerate IV infusions or have difficulties with venous access. No head-to-head data are available to directly compare HyQvia with conventional SCIG. However, SCIG is indicated for administration frequencies from daily up to every other week dosing while HyQvia is indicated for infusion frequencies every 2-4 weeks. This study is designed to assess the IgG trough level after switching from standard SCIG to every other week HyQvia and HyQvia every 3-4 weeks</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IgG Level in Primary Immunodeficiency Switching From Standard SCIG to Every Other Week HyQvia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, one arm study conducted in France in subjects with PI to IgG trough level at steady state after standard SCIG dosing and after HyQvia administered every other week and every 3-4 weeks at equivalent dose. The study will have three periods: - The first period is a one-week ramp-up period. The first administration of HyQvia will be with a one-week dose as specified in the summary of product characteristics of HyQvia. - During the first three-month follow-up period, HyQvia will be administered, every other week at a dose equivalent to the dose administered with the previous treatment (standard SCIG). - At the end of this first follow-up period, the dose of HyQvia will be increased for the next infusion to reach a 3-week equivalent dose. If it this volume is well tolerated, the following dosing will be a 4-week equivalent dose. HyQvia will then be administered every 3 or 4 weeks for three months.</detailed_description>
