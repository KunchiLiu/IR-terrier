	<detailed_description>This cross -sectional study measured IL-6, procalcitonin and VEGF level in plasma and overnight effluent. PSTR of small solutes was evaluated by standard peritoneal equilibration test (standard PET). Weekly Kt/V and creatinine clearance (CCr ) were evaluated in all patients.</detailed_description>
