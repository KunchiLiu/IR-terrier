	<brief_summary>The FuRST 2.0 scale is being developed as a Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) with information coming directly from the Huntington's Disease Gene Expansion Carrier (HDGEC) and companion through self-report. The purpose of this study is to identify real or potential comprehension or usage problems with questionnaire items or response options. Through a process of structured cognitive de-briefing with HDGEC participants and companions, independently, followed by qualitative analysis, the final phrasing of the individual items and response options for the scale will be generated. Depending on the results of the first round of cognitive pre-testing, additional rounds of cognitive pre-testing may be required.</brief_summary>
