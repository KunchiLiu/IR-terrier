	<brief_summary>Fermentable Oligo-, Di and Mono-saccharides And Polyols (FODMAPs) are carbohydrates that are poorly digested in intestines. The undigested carbohydrates are fermented in the colon by gut bacteria. Fermentation of these carbohydrates can lead to diarrhea, gas and distension of the colon. Low FODMAP diet effect may be mediated by changing the gut bacteria and/or by production of chemicals that influence Veteran's intestines which then result in reduced disease symptoms. The goal of this study is to compare a low FODMAP (modified healthy) diet to a high FODMAP (typical healthy) diet for effect on Veterans with IBS and symptoms of Gulf War illness.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This will be a prospective, blinded randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups. There will be 1-week screening period, 3-week diet treatment and, follow-up one month later while Veterans choose their own diet. Veterans who were deployed and served in Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield will be recruited to participate. The two study diets to be provided to the Veterans and compared are: Low FODMAP (modified healthy) diet: High FODMAP (typical healthy) diet: The FODMAP content of this diet will be higher than low FODMAP diet. All questionnaires will be answered and measurements performed at baseline, end of treatment and at follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
