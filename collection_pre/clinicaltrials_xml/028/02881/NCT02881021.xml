	<brief_summary>Background: Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCTe) is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain, resulting in considerable losses to society and public coffers. Muscle imbalance and inadequate sensorimotor control are deficits often associated to RCTe. Kinesiotaping (KT) has been widely used for rehabilitation of RCTe. While previous studies have examined the effects of KT on shoulder injuries only in short-term and as an isolated method of treatment, no published study has addressed its mid- and long-term effects when combined with a rehabilitation program (RP) for patients with RCTe (as used in clinics). The main objective of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic KT application added into an RP in reducing pain and disabilities in patients with RCTe. Secondary objectives will cover underlying factors related to shoulder control, such as muscular activity, acromiohumeral distance (AHD), and range of motion (ROM). Methods/Study design: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Fifty-two patients, randomly allocated to one of two groups (KT or no-KT), will receive 10 physiotherapy sessions over six weeks. The KT-group will receive therapeutic KT added to the RP, whereas no-KT group will receive only the RP. Primary outcomes will be symptoms and functional limitations assessed by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Measurements will be taken at baseline, week-3, week-6, week-12 and 6-month. Secondary outcomes will include shoulder active ROM, AHD at rest and at 60ยบ of abduction, and shoulder muscle activation during arm elevation. The added effects of KT will be assessed through 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures. Discussion: Investigations with a high level of evidence are needed to determine scientific evidence-based concerning the efficacy of KT for the rehabilitation of individuals with RCTe. This RCT will be the first to assess the effectiveness of KT added into a conventional RP for patients with RCTe, addressing underlying factors that could explain the possible benefits of this method, in a mid- and long-term. Results may contribute to build solid evidence on the addition of KT in a physiotherapy intervention for this population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria. To be eligible, participants will present one positive finding in each of the following categories: Painful arc of movement during flexion or abduction; Neer (sensitivity 0.78, specificity 0.58) or KennedyHawkins impingement signs (sensitivity 0.74, specificity 0.57); Pain on resisted external rotation, abduction or empty can test (sensitivity 0.69, specificity 0.62). Exclusion Criteria. Patients will be excluded if they have: an open wound that compromises KT application; had a previous shoulder surgery; allergy or intolerance to KT; adhesive capsulitis, defined as loss of passive shoulder ROM greater than 50%; history of glenohumeral luxation or fracture to the shoulder girdle; shoulder pain reproduced by cervical movements; clinical signs of fullthickness RC tears identified by lag signs tests (drop, internal, and external rotation signs).</criteria>
