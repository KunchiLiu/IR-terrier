	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) for bictegravir (GS-9883) and confirm the dose of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years of age) and children (6 to &lt; 12 years of age). This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of B/F/TAF FDC through Week 24 in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents and children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key HIV1 infected adolescents and children who are virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months on a stable regimen Cohort 1 only: 12 to &lt; 18 years old and weight at screening ≥ 35 kg (77 lbs) Cohort 2 only: 6 to &lt; 12 years old and weight at screening ≥ 25 kg (55 lbs) Documented plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL on a stable regimen (or undetectable HIV1 RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is ≥ 50 copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months preceding the Screening visit. Unconfirmed virologic elevations of ≥ 50 copies/mL (transient detectable viremia, or "blip") prior to screening are acceptable. If the lower limit of detection of the local HIV1 RNA assay is &lt; 50 copies/mL (eg, &lt; 20 copies/mL), the plasma HIV1 RNA level cannot exceed 50 copies/mL on two consecutive HIV1 RNA tests. Stable antiretroviral regimen of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in combination with a third agent for a minimum of 6 months prior to the screening visit. Individuals undergoing dose modifications to their antiretroviral regimen for growth or who are switching medication formulation(s) are considered to be on a stable antiretroviral regimen. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 according to the Schwartz Formula No documented or suspected resistance to emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir (TFV), or integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) including, but not limited to, the reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R and M184V/I Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
