	<brief_summary>The physiotherapist in the ICU is involved in taking patient's respiratory load, especially in the treatment of ventilation disorders, swallowing disorders, weaning from mechanical ventilation, aerosol therapy, oxygen therapy and the establishment noninvasive ventilation (NIV). The choice of one or more techniques, defining the modalities of treatment in respiratory physiotherapy, is at the end of a systematic, focused and disciplined. Patient evaluation is necessary to determine the indication for respiratory physiotherapy, choose the method of treatment and monitor patient progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. When the physical therapist patient assessment usually used clinical examination, blood gases, auscultation and thoracic imaging. However, the diagnostic accuracy of chest radiograph and auscultation is weak with regard to the pathologies which may indicate respiratory physiotherapy in the ICU: pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, atelectasis or interstitial syndrome. Thoracic CT remains the gold standard in the evaluation of lung parenchyma but requires patient transport, exposed to radiation and is more expensive. Compared to CT, lung ultrasound has greater sensitivity and specificity than the radiography in the diagnosis of these pathologies. It also assesses the diaphragm with greater accuracy and reproducibility than the tools Routine measurements (Maximum inspiratory pressure, P0.1). Ultrasound can diagnose dysfunction in intensive care with excellent sensitivity and specificity compared to the measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressures. The French physiotherapist is authorized to perform an ultrasound as part of its balance sheet (4), pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound could allow the therapist to clarify the indication for respiratory physiotherapy and avoid unnecessary or inappropriate treatments. This provision of information may also change the therapeutic management of the physiotherapist. Given its relatively recent appearance, the interest of the use of pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound respiratory physiotherapy has never been evaluated. Xirouchaki et al. evaluated the impact of lung ultrasound on the physician's clinical decision among ICU patients and showed that it significantly influenced the medical diagnosis and modified the therapeutic management. A ur knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of the information provided by ultrasound in the clinical decision-making in respiratory physiotherapy in patients hospitalized in intensive care or not</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Impact of the Use of Pulmonary and Diaphragmatic Ultrasound the Clinical Decision-making in Respiratory Physiotherapy in Patients in ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective / secondary Primary objective The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of using the results of pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound in the clinical decision-making in respiratory physiotherapy in patients hospitalized in intensive care. secondary objectives Secondary objectives are to: - Determine if the ultrasound has an impact on clinical decision process chest physiotherapy when a CT scan is less than 12 available; - Determine the level of agreement between the clinical diagnosis of the physiotherapist and ultrasound diagnosis, and overall clinical hypothesis; - Determine the frequency change of the physical therapy treatment modalities Respiratory after reading the ultrasound results, overall and by assumption clinical; - Determine if pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound provides information when additional clinical examination does not conclude that disability; - Determine whether the use of ultrasound data changes the frequency of choice to treat the patient with chest physiotherapy; - Determine whether the use of ultrasound data changes the frequency of choice not indicate respiratory physiotherapy; - Determine whether the use of ultrasound data changes the frequency of choice by the physiotherapist to use medical advice resuscitator; - Determine whether the use of ultrasound data modifies the frequency of diaphragmatic dysfunction is suspected; - Determine which originally sonographic signs of a change therapeutic choice when the diagnosis of disability is not changed by ultrasound data</detailed_description>
