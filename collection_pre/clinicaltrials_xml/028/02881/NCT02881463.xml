	<brief_summary>Knee joint osteoarthritis (OA) reduces functional mobility and performance of daily tasks such as rising from a chair. Therefore interventions aimed at improving muscle strength and sit-to-stand task performance are very important for these patients. The effect of exercise programs, including home exercise programs (HEP), on muscle strength, joint pain and function is well known and widely researched, yet not many studies have investigated the effect of an HEP on electromyographic activity (EMG) of muscles when performing everyday tasks, such as rising from and sitting on a chair. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of prehabilitation in women with severe knee joint OA scheduled for knee joint arthroplasty (TKA).</brief_summary>
