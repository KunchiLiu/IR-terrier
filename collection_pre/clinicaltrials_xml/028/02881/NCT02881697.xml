	<brief_summary>The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that controls growth and metabolism. In mammals (including humans), mammalian TOR complex 2(mTORC2) contains mammalian TOR (mTOR), RICTOR, mSIN1 protein, and mLST8 gene. In an animal model, the adipose-specific rictor knockout (AdRiKO) mouse, systemic insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular dysfunction develop upon high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity or aging. To find a molecular link between adipose mTORC2 and systemic insulin resistance, investigators have already performed transcriptomics and proteomics analysis on visceral white adipose tissue in a mouse model. The aim of the study is to confirm a molecular link between adipose mTORC2 and systemic insulin resistance in humans.</brief_summary>
