	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate two standard post-operative pain regimens routinely used after laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. The investigators hypothesize that the use of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen in addition to IV ketorolac with narcotic pain pump will decrease time to transition off patient/nurse controlled analgesia (PCA) to oral pain medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of IV Acetaminophen on Pain After Appendectomy for Perforated Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess pain control, patient and family perception of pain control, time to return of bowel function defined as passage of first flatus (in days), doses of anti-emetic medications, doses of narcotic pain medications, time to toleration of regular diet (in days), narcotic associated adverse effects (nausea, emesis, respiratory depression, constipation), length of stay, and overall hospital cost in admission. Post-hospitalization the investigators will assess complications including number and reasons for emergency visits and abscess formation, length of post-hospitalization analgesic use, length of post-hospitalization narcotic use, and time to return to school.</detailed_description>
