	<brief_title>Vulvar Mucosal Specialty Clinic Chart Review</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vulvar disorders are common, but their frequency and importance are often under-recognized. The spectrum of vulvar disease is vast and includes congenital malformations, inflammatory mucocutaneous diseases, blistering and erosive diseases, benign and malignant tumors, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and various idiopathic conditions. Evaluation and management of genital complaints and dermatoses are complicated by the frequent multifactorial nature of vulvar symptoms and variable clinical expressions of disease on the vulva. In many cases, empiric treatment is instituted in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. Of note, expertise in the diagnosis and management of vulvar disorders is often lacking on the parts of gynecology, dermatology and primary care physicians. The investigators seek to analyze the data on this patient population at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) and the outpatient clinics of the Northwestern Memorial Faculty Foundation (NMFF) to better define the clinical spectrum of vulvar disease. The investigators will also assess approaches to the diagnosis and management of patients with vulvar disease with attention given to clinical outcome and the impact on quality of life. This information with help the investigators to better understand the scope of care these patients currently receive, to identify deficits in current practice, and to advance potential new standards of care.</detailed_description>
