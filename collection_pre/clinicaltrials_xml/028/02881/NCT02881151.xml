	<brief_summary>This study involves the treatment of cognitive impairment secondary to moderate to severe brain injury using central thalamic deep brain stimulation. Although all patients will receive stimulation continuously through an implanted pacemaker-like device, half of the patients will have the device deactivated during a blinded assessment phase. The device will be reactivated following this assessment and patients will have the option to continue stimulation in an open-label continuation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This preliminary safety study evaluates the use of the Medtronic Activa PC+S system and Medtronic Nexus-E system for central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) in the treatment of cognitive impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The proposed study, if successful, will provide supporting evidence for the development of a novel therapeutic approach utilizing CT-DBS to improve these enduring cognitive impairments arising in persons with multi-focal structural brain injuries. This research will address the critical gap of the lack of any available treatments. CT-DBS targets well-defined neuronal populations within the central thalamus that have known anatomical and physiological specializations, which not only provide a key role in arousal regulation during cognitively-mediated behaviors, but also exhibit a particular vulnerability to dysfunction in the setting of multi-focal, non-selective brain injuries. Our proposed study aims to support development of CT-DBS as a novel therapeutic avenue for accessing cognitive reserve in patients with acquired brain injuries. In the proposed feasibility study of 6 subjects at a single investigational site, we will test the safety of CT-DBS in the severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) population with GOSE 6-7 level recovery and collect data to establish the translation of preclinical studies into human application of CT-DBS.</detailed_description>
