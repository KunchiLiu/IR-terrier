	<brief_summary>Pressure Support Ventilation use Expiratory triggering sensitivity(Esense) to transfer inspiration to expiration,the value of Esense is fixed.That may lead to asynchrony between humans and ventilators,making people uncomfortable and prolonging weaning time.Some ventilators have auto cycle function Based on curves of pressure on respiratory patterns,it will make the transforming more synchrony with humans.Our prospective observational study will prove the superiority of the auto cycle function.</brief_summary>
