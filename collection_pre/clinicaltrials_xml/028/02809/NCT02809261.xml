	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a short duration. Recently, the ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose was widely used for entrapment neuropathy with positive benefit. However, current studies have not entirely proved the effects of perineural injection on peripheral neuropathy because these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose in patients with CTS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with CTS were randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose and control group received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with normal saline. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24th week after the treatment.</detailed_description>
