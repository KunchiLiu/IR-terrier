	<brief_title>A Novel Combination of Peripheral Nerve Blocks for Patients Scheduled for Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analyzing block effects of the lateral sagittal infraclavicular brachial plexus block(posterior and lateral chord), the investigators found it affecting all shoulder relevant nerves , except for the suprascapular and the supraclavicular nerves. Accordingly, by combining a superficial cervical plexus block, suprascapular nerve block and block of the posterior and lateral chords infraclavicularly, the investigators believe this novel combination would provide anesthesia for patients scheduled for shoulder surgery.</detailed_description>
