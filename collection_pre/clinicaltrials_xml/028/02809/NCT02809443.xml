	<brief_summary>The clinical trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of GLS-5700. GLS-5700 is a synthetic DNA plasmid vaccine against the Zika virus. ZIKA-001 is the first in man clinical trial of this vaccine which encodes for the premembrane-membrane and envelope regions of Zika virus. Zika virus, first discovered in the Zika forest in 1947, has caused a large epidemic in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean islands commencing in late 2014 or early 2015. Zika virus can cause significant neurologic disease to include Guillain Barre Syndrome in adults and microcephaly and other birth defects among children born to mothers who are infected during pregnancy. At present no vaccines or treatments have been approved for Zika virus infection.</brief_summary>

Dengue seronegative at baseline by screening laboratory evaluation 11. Not currently or within the previous 4 weeks taking immunosuppressive agents (excluding inhaled, topical skin and/or eye dropcontaining corticosteroids, lowdose methotrexate, or corticosteroids at a dose less than 20 mg/day). 1. Administration of an investigational compound either currently or within 30 days of first dose; 2.

Administration of any vaccine within 4 weeks of first dose; 4. Administration of any monoclonal or polyclonal antibody product within 4 weeks of the first dose 5. Administration of any blood product within 3 months of first dose; 6. Pregnancy or breast feeding or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study; 7. Positive serologic result for dengue virus (any serotype) or history of receipt of either dengue virus or yellow fever virus vaccination at any time in the past; 8. Positive serologic test for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); or any potentially communicable infectious disease as determined by the Principal Investigator or Medical Monitor; 9. Positive serologic test for hepatitis C (exception: successful treatment with confirmation of sustained virologic response); 10. Baseline evidence of kidney disease as measured by creatinine greater than 1.5 (CKD Stage II or greater); 11. Baseline screening lab(s) with Grade 2 or higher abnormality, except for Grade 2 creatinine; 12. Chronic liver disease or cirrhosis; 13. Immunosuppressive illness including hematologic malignancy, history of solid organ or bone marrow transplantation; 14. Current or anticipated concomitant immunosuppressive therapy (excluding inhaled, topical skin and/or eye dropcontaining corticosteroids, lowdose methotrexate, or corticosteroids at a dose less than 20 mg/day); 15. Current or anticipated treatment with TNFÎ± inhibitors such as infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept; 16. Prior major surgery or any radiation therapy within 4 weeks of group assignment; 17. Any preexcitation syndromes, e.g., WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome; 18. Presence of a cardiac pacemaker or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) 19. Metal implants within 20 cm of the planned site(s) of injection; 20. Presence of keloid scar formation or hypertrophic scar as a clinically significant medical condition at the planned site(s) of injection. 21. Prisoner or participants who are compulsorily detained (involuntary incarceration) for treatment of either a physical or psychiatric illness; 22. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements or assessment of immunologic endpoints; or 23. Not willing to allow storage and future use of samples for Zika virus related research 24. Any illness or condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the safety of the participant or the evaluation of any study endpoint.</criteria>
