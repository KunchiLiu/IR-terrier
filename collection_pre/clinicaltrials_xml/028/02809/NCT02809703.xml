	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine the quality of life of patients in the years following treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The study population will include all adults treated with any configuration of ECMO at Duke University Medical Center during the period of Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2015. Patient's will be contacted by direct mail, in conjunction with a surgeon who performed their ECMO procedure or managed them while on ECMO, and asked to complete a validated survey (WHOQOL-Bref) which assesses quality of life. In addition, patients will be asked to opt-in to participate in a phone survey in which they can give a narrative about their ICU experience and answer specific questions regarding long-term comorbidities. Data will be stored in a secure online server which is HIPAA compliant and analyzed by the department of anesthesiology statistical support services. De-identified data will be shared with the WHO as specified in their usage agreement.</brief_summary>
