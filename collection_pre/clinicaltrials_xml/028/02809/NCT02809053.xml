	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the statistical equivalence of efficacy, and to assess the safety of SAIT101 versus MabThera® in asymptomatic patients with LTBFL. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study drug once a week for 4 weeks, and will then be followed up for up to 52 weeks after the first dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologicallyconfirmed Low Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma, without B symptoms, Ann Arbor stage II to IVA NHL (CD20+ FL of Grades 1, 2, or 3a) 2. Low tumor burden according to GELF criteria defined as: Normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β2microglobulin levels. No mass ≥7 cm. Less than 3 masses &gt;3 cm. No systemic or B symptoms (fever &gt;38°C for 3 consecutive days; recurrent, drenching night sweats; unintentional weight loss exceeding 10% body weight in the last 6 months. No splenomegaly ≥16 cm by CT scan. No risk of vital organ compression. No pleural or peritoneal serous effusion. No leukemic phase &gt;5,000/µL circulating tumor cells. No cytopenias (defined as platelets &lt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL, or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,500/mm3). 3. Patients not previously treated for their FL, including any previous treatment for FL under clinical trials except localized radiation therapy for previous limited stage disease. 1. Previous treatment with any chemotherapy and/or rituximab or other monoclonal antibody. 2. Prior radiotherapy completed &lt;28 days before study enrollment. 3. Anticipated need for concomitant administration of any other experimental drug, or a concomitant chemotherapy, anticancer hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy during study participation. 4. Concomitant disease which requires continuous therapy with corticosteroids at doses equivalent to prednisolone &gt;20 mg/day. 5. Transformation to highgrade lymphoma secondary to previously untreated lowgrade lymphoma. 6. Prior or concomitant malignancies within 5 years prior to screening, with the exceptions of nonmelanoma skin cancer, adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, adequately treated breast cancer in situ, and localized prostate cancer stage T1c, provided that the patient underwent curative treatment and remains relapse free. 7. Patients with a body surface area &gt;3.0 m2. 8. Major surgery (excluding lymph node biopsy) within 28 days prior to randomization. 9. Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of, or currently active), including known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive test at screening. 10. Acute, severe infection (e.g., sepsis and opportunistic infections), or active, chronic or persistent infection that might worsen with immunosuppressive treatment (e.g., herpes zoster). 11. Positive serological test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis C serology. Patients with a negative HBsAg and positive HBcAb must have a hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level &lt;20 IU/mL (or 112 copies/mL) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These HBV patients must be willing to undergo PCR HBV DNA testing during treatment and may participate following consultation with a hepatitis expert regarding monitoring and use of HBV antiviral therapy, and provided they agree to receive treatment as indicated. An HBV retest will be performed at each study visit from Week 5 onwards, and at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients with a positive test because of HBV vaccine may be included (i.e., antiHBs+, antiHBc). Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if PCR is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). 12. Confirmed current active tuberculosis (TB). Patients with latent TB as determined by positive QuantiFERONTB test may be enrolled if such patients have written confirmation from their health care provider (e.g., Pulmonologist or Infection Specialist) of adequate prophylaxis before or within the screening period, and no evidence of tuberculosis on a chest Xray performed within 3 months of Day 1. 13. Central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal involvement, or cord compression by the lymphoma; history of CNS lymphoma. A brain scan should be conducted at screening ONLY if lesions are suspected on the brain, to exclude patients with brain localization of FL. 14. History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to a biological agent or history of hypersensitivity to any component of the trial drug (e.g., hypersensitivity or allergy to murine products). 15. Patients who have significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to history of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III/IV; see Appendix 7), unstable angina, or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia. 16. Uncontrolled or severe hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease. 17. Serious underlying medical conditions that, per the Investigator's discretion, could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (including but not limited to ongoing active infection, severe immunosuppression, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers, or active autoimmune disease). 18. Any other coexisting medical or psychological condition(s) that will preclude participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent and/or comply with study procedures. 19. Treatment with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 4 weeks prior to initiation of 1st infusion of study drug, or treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication within 4 weeks or a minimum of 5 halflives, whichever is longer, of the 1st infusion of study drug. 20. Receipt of a live/attenuated vaccine within 6 weeks prior to the screening visit. 21. Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy during the treatment period or within 12 months after the last infusion of study drug. 22. Patients who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the trial, and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or patients who are Archigen employees directly involved in the conduct of the trial.</criteria>
