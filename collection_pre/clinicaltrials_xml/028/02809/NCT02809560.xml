	<brief_summary>Asthma affects about 10% of children and 6% of adults in industrialized countries. Lymphocytes (L) Th2, a T cell population (LT) producing interleukin (IL) -4, 5 and 13 are broadly involved in this pathology in experimental models and in humans. Many studies show that the signaling pathways activated by the commitment of T receiver differ depending LT. The identification of specific signaling pathways links to Th2 offer new therapeutic approaches. Precedent study showed that mouse Th2 selectively expressed related to calcium channels sensitive channels Cav1 voltage, normally found in excitable cells where they are defined as receivers dihydropyridine (DHP). The goal of the present study is to show the presence of Cav1 channels in inflammatory cells in allergic asthmatics and show overexpression of these channels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatic subjects before and / or after stimulation with the TCR in comparison with controls.</brief_summary>
