	<brief_title>Effects of Beta-blockade on Platelet Aggregation in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) beta-blockers are recommended for secondary prevention. It is known that catecholamine levels can potentiate platelet reactivity and beta-blocking agents may also affect platelet aggregation. This effect is mainly mediated by adrenergic receptors on platelets. This suggests that nonselective beta-blockers would have a more pronounced effect on platelet aggregation than selective beta-blockers. However, little is known about the effect of beta-blockers on platelet aggregation in patients with cardiovascular disease and, to date, nothing is known in the setting of ACS. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of selective and nonselective beta-blockers on platelet aggregation in ACS patients treated with dual anti platelet therapy.</detailed_description>
