	<brief_summary>Many patients receiving opioid based analgesia after spinal surgery experience postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) despite prophylaxis and treatment with antiemetic agents. Dehydration caused by fasting prior to surgery is associated with the development of PONV. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of oral carbohydrates loading prior to surgery in patients at high risk of PONV undergoing spinal surgery.</brief_summary>
