	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that leads to blindness and paralysis. Since disability accrues incrementally related to attacks, attack prevention with immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of preventing disability. However, there is no standard immunosuppressive treatment strategy for NMO relapse prevention. In a previous study, the investigators provided evidence supporting the use of azathioprine plus a low dose corticosteroid as an effective strategy which is associated with a reduction in the risk of relapse in Chinese patients with NMO, but azathioprine has bone marrow suppression and other side effects. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a new immunosuppressant with rapid onset, fewer side effects and other advantages. In recent years, MMF has been used in different immune-related neurological diseases; some literature shown the possible efficacy of MMF in NMO treatment. In this research, a multi-center (Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre of Sun Yat-sen University, Nangfang Hospital of Southern Medical University) study will carry out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil therapy in NMO spectrum disorders.</brief_summary>
