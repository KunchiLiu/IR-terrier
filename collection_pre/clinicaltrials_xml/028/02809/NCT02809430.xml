	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with impaired stroke recovery. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may prevent this but is limited by poor adherence. In this study, the investigators will enroll eligible stroke patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation into an intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) with an aim to increase tolerance and adherence to auto-titrating CPAP (APAP). The iCAP will include patient education and encouragement, device adjustments, close monitoring of adherence and a 3-night run-in period of APAP to identify those patients who 1. have OSA and 2. have APAP tolerance. If both criteria are met, APAP treatment with iCAP will continue during the rehabilitation stay and over a 3-month period. The goal of the intervention is to achieve 50% of subjects meeting APAP adherence (an average â‰¥ 4 hours per night) over the 3-month treatment period. The investigators will evaluate if demographic, co-morbid or stroke-specific factors predict APAP adherence and assess the relationship between APAP adherence and neurological recovery. Successful completion of the project will establish the feasibility of a definitive trial assessing the ability of APAP to improve stroke recovery in the short-term and reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in the long-term.</brief_summary>
