	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate PEMF Therapy on Experimentally Inducted Pain in Subjects With Painful Peripheral Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover clinical trial conducted on subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of age with Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain, numbness, tingling, and/or burning in at least one foot. Pain threshold, tolerance to thermal stimuli and pressure response to the induced pain stimuli will be measured at three time points using five standardized experimental pain measures: baseline, after a single 30 minute treatment with active PEMF or sham treatment and after a second 30 minute treatment with active PEMF or sham treatment. Eligible subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy will undergo Diabetic Screening (Nerve Conduction Velocity, Skin Perfusion Pressure, Ankle-Brachial Index, and Vibratory Testing) in the index foot prior to randomization. Following the Diabetic Screening tests, subjects will return to the research center for the Enrollment/Randomization Visit and complete measures of pain by completing the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and functional assessments. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to one of the two groups; control (sham) or experimental (active) device by a research assistant blinded to the device status. Patients will also be randomly assigned to the sequence order of experimental induced pain tests. The ischemic pain testing (SMET) will always be conducted last. Patients will return to the research center within 7 days after the Enrollment/Randomization Visit where they will be crossed over to the other treatment assignment and be randomly assigned to the sequence order of experimental induced pain tests on the same extremity as previously randomized.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject age is greater than or equal to 22 years and less than 80 years of age. 2. Subject has documented Type 2 diabetes. 3. Subject's BMI â‰¤ 38. 4. Subject has peripheral diabetic neuropathy with pain, numbness, tingling, and/or burning in at least one foot. 5. Subject is in pain Phase 2, 3, or 4 (Appendix B). 6. Subject is willing to forego smoking during the Enrollment Visit and Visit 3 (Crossover) for 4 hours prior to and through the duration of testing (~5 hours). 7. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent and to comply with all parts of the study protocol. 8. Female subjects must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, abstinent, or practicing (or agree to practice) an effective method of birth control if they are sexually active for the duration of the study. (Effective methods of birth control include prescription hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, doublebarrier methods, and/or male partner sterilization). 9. Subject is able to eat in the morning prior to the induced pain tests and provide a meal/snacks for themselves during the day to maintain blood sugar levels. 1. Subject has current pain other than their painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. 2. Subject has a concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would confound the ability to conduct induced pain testing in the upper and lower extremities. 3. Subject has taken prescription opioids for their pain within 30 days of the Screening Visit or 6 weeks of Screening for long acting medications. 4. Subject has used topical capsaicin within 30 days of the Screening Visit. 5. Subject has Type 1 diabetes. 6. Subject is in pain Phase 1 or 5 (Appendix B). 7. Subject has an active, open ulcer on either lower extremity of arterial, venous or mixed disease origin. 8. Subject has peripheral arterial disease as determined by an AnkleBrachial Index (ABI) of &lt;0.5 or &gt; 1.4. See Appendix C for details on obtaining the ABI. 9. Subject has venous insufficiency classified by the Venous Insufficiency Classification System (CEAP) of grade C6. See Appendix D for description of the venous insufficiency grading. 10. Subject has an unhealed surgery on the legs, feet, arms or hands. 11. Subject has smoked within 4 hours of the Screening Visit. 12. Subject has received any investigational drug or device within 30 days or 5 halflives of the drug, whichever is longer, prior to the Screening Visit or is enrolled in another clinical trial. 13. Subject has used systemic corticosteroids within 2 months of the Screening Visit. 14. Subject has a history of a solid tumor that is not in complete remission for greater than 2 years other than successfully treated nonmetastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin in the treatment area. 15. Subject has a serious psychosocial comorbidity. 16. Subject has a selfreported history of drug or alcohol abuse, within one year prior to the Screening Visit. 17. Subject has an implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, neurostimulator, spinal cord stimulator, bone stimulator, cochlear implant, or other implanted device with an implanted metal lead(s). 18. Subject is currently pregnant. 19. Subject has been previously treated with the PROVANT Therapy System within 30 days of the Enrollment Visit. 20. Subject is unwilling or unable to follow study instructions.</criteria>
