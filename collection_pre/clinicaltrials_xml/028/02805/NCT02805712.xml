	<detailed_description>Patients will be assigned to one of two groups a) longitudinal goals of care discussion led by a palliative care-trained social worker or b) usual care + written information regarding advanced directives. The intervention group will be enrolled in the hospital and then be followed longitudinally for 3 months by a palliative care-trained social worker who will shepherd a conversation around prognosis, expectations, and goals of care. The results of these conversations will be documented in the electronic medical record and shared with the clinical team. Clinical symptoms that are identified during these conversations will be evaluated by a Palliative Care Physician who will relay suggestions regarding management to the primary treating clinician. Baseline surveys will assess prognostic awareness, symptom burden, anxiety, depression, and quality of life for both groups. At the conclusion of the study, an individualized follow-up plan will be devised for each patient based on a needs assessment by the study social worker. Patients assigned to the control/usual care arm will complete the same series of questionnaires as those assigned to the intervention group and will undergo usual in hospital and post-discharge treatment as directed by their care team. All control subjects will receive written Advanced Care planning and Heart Failure education materials as provided routinely to inpatients at Brigham and Women's Hospital. At the three month visit (Final Visit) following hospitalization, these patients will be asked to complete follow up questionnaires and then will be given the option to participate in the above verbal intervention and guided "Goals and Values" conversation that was provided to the intervention group.</detailed_description>
