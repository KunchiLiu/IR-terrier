	<brief_title>Combination Trastuzumab With Expanded Natural Killer Cells for Treating HER2-positive Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies, block oncogenic signaling and induce Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated cytotoxicity, are considered to be one of the most successful strategies in cancer therapy. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against HER2, was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. The use of cellular immunotherapy has increased significantly over the past two decades. Natural killer cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that have the ability to recognize and kill malignant cells. There is growing evidence show antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells contributes to the efficacy of Herceptin. Therefore, methods to enhance ADCC, such as stimulating the innate immune response, may clinically translate to improved antitumor activity. In this study, the investigators sought to enhance the clinical activity of trastuzumab, administrated in combination with expanded autologous NK cells. The enrolled patients are diagnosed HER2+ advanced gastric cancer. The eligible patient will administrate herceptin on 2 days prior to blood collection. The initial dose of herceptin is 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes IV infusion. On day 0 peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated from 40-50ml blood by density gradient centrifugation. Then were cultured with human NK cell culture medium and stimulation cytokines in a humidified, 5% carbon dioxide incubator for about 14 days. After NK expansion and verification that the resulting NK cells meet purity, gram stain, and endotoxin release criteria, NK cells were washed and resuspended in isotonic sodium chloride. NK cellular therapy conduct 2 cycles per year. The maintenance dose of herceptin monotherapy is 6 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes IV infusion every 3 weeks. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of this novel combinational therapeutic strategy in HER2 positive gastric cancer.</detailed_description>
