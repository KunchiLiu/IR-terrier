	<brief_summary>Smart phones are omnipresent. Apps exist to calculate size of medical equipment and doses of medication if a valid weight or age is entered. During emergency situations, these values are often unknown. An App has been developed to measure the size of a child noninvasively. This App is now to be validated in clinical practice. App measured size is calculated and compared to the real size of a child. Via known percentiles of age/weight of the child is calculated upon the App measured size. This value is compared to the mother`s, physician`s and nurses estimation of the size and weight. Depending on the size multiple algorithms exist to estimate weight, age and medical values. ("Kindersicher ®", "Notfalllineal ®" and "Broselow Tape ®"). These estimations by the calculations will also be compared to actual weight and age. Children from 0-12 years of age are included in the emergency Department of the Children`s Hospital of the University of Zurich after informed consent obtained by the parents. No therapy decisions from these calculations will be made. The therapy is independent of this study.</brief_summary>
