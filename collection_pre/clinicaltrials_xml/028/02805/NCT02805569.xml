	<brief_summary>Indirect videolaryngoscopes provide an improved view of the glottis. Unfortunately enhanced video blade angulation leads to difficulty in passage of the endotracheal tube (ETT) towards the larynx around the steep blade angulation despite adequate visualization of the glottis. Pre-shaping the ETT with the rigit malleable stylet is recommended. The investigators hypothesized that using articulating stylet (AS) would enhance first attempt intubation, shorten the intubation time, reduce the possibility of the soft tissue trauma compared to conventional intubation stylet (IS) in patients with difficult airway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Intubation Conditions of the Articulating Stylet and Intubating Stylet Guided Videolaryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with known airway difficulty (anticipated difficult airway (ADA) score &gt;6) will be included to the study. All patients will receive general anesthesia for a variety of elective surgical procedure. Tracheal intubation will be performed by senior anesthesiologist. Patients will be intubated using AS-videolaryngoscope (n= 30) or IS-videolaryngoscope (n=30) randomly. Patients demographic details (age 18-65 yr, body mass index, ASA phisical status), ADA scores, Cormack-Lehane scores, intubation difficulty scores, intubation attempts, intubation time, hemodynamic variables, sore throat, anesthesiologists satisfaction will be recorded.</detailed_description>
