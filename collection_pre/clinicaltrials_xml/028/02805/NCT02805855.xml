	<brief_title>Autologous Culture Expanded Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventions to alter the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee are elusive and joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far, the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators' pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female ages 4070 years Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to receiving the study drug and will agree use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or postmenopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit Females becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will be recorded. Females in the multipledose cohorts (M50 and M100) who become pregnant during the treatment cycle will not receive their remaining injections. 2. Chronic (&gt; 3 months), unilaterally symptomatic, primary femorotibial knee OA 3. Radiographic medial and/or lateral femorotibial knee OA at least KellgrenLawrence grade 2 accompanied by definite joint space narrowing as agreed upon by two study coinvestigators 4.

Pregnant or nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant during the study period 2. Congenital or acquired malformation of the target knee resulting in significant deformity or leading to problems with the study treatment or analysis of the results 3. Significant malalignment on full length, standing radiographs 4. Orthopedic hardware or implantable devices anywhere in the body, other than dental 5. Surgery on the index knee within 1 year of study enrollment 6. Injections of any into the index knee within 3 months prior to study enrollment 7.

History of superficial infection in the index knee within 6 months of study enrollment, or evidence of current superficial infection affecting the index knee 11. History of falls requiring medical attention, or gait instability 12. Abnormal hematology (complete blood count with differential), blood chemistry, or urinalysis screening laboratory results, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, creatinine, and CRP 13.

Taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (e.g. COX2 inhibitors) without a stable dosing regimen for at least 4 weeks before baseline evaluation, or anticipating not remaining on a stable dose until at least 30 days following completion of the study drug treatment cycle 17. Use of electrotherapy or acupuncture for OA, unless there is a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks before baseline assessment 18. Taking antirheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other antimetabolites) within 3 months prior to study enrollment 19. On chronic, immunosuppressive transplant therapy or having a chronic, immunosuppressive state, including use of systemic steroids/corticosteroids 20. Current tobacco product use, including nicotine patch or other nicotine products 21. Systemic inflammatory, rheumatological or connective tissue disorder including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, system lupus erythematosus, and EhlersDanlos Syndrome 22.
