	<brief_title>uPAR PET/CT and FDG PET/MRI for Preoperative Staging of Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/CT and FDG PET/MRI for detection of regional lymph node metastases will be tested by observer-blinded readings and compared to diagnostic performance of conventional preoperative procedure. The reference test will be histopathology of lymph nodes obtained by operative lymph node dissection based on 6 regions. The suspected lymph nodes will be assigned to 6 regions based on the images. During the following operation the lymph nodes will be removed and analysed in each of these regions.</detailed_description>
