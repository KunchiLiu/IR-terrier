	<brief_summary>This study investigated whether vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism is altered in primary open-angle glaucoma subjects carrying the risk allele.Primary open-angle glaucoma patients and age-matched people in the Han population were enrolled. Vitamin D receptor polymorphic analysis was studied by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique.</brief_summary>
