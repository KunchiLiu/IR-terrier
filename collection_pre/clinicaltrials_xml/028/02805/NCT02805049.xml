	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of the prescribed echinocandins for septic shock with secondary peritonitis for which intra-abdominal fungal infection is suspected or proven.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study on Echinocandins for Patients With Septic Shock Following Secondary Peritonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: - Determine whether the current recommended doses of caspofungin achieve the Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target for this molecule. - Determine whether the current recommended doses of micafungin achieve the PK / PD target for this molecule - Describe the peritoneal concentrations of echinocandins in secondary peritonitis complicated with septic shock - Identify via modeling PK / PD parameters and based on monte Carlo simulations the optimal dosing regimen for caspofungin and micafungin in this population</detailed_description>
