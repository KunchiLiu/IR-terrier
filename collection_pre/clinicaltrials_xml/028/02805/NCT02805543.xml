	<brief_summary>Objective: The main target of this study was to research the early changes of retrobulbar and intrarenal hemodynamics, then to research the correlation between them in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Method: 35 T2DM patients (diabetes group) without vascular complications and 30 healthy people (control group) were recruited to research the early changes of renal function, retrobulbar and intrarenal hemodynamics, and then to research the correlation between them. The primary endpoints were the intrarenal hemodynamic (bilateral kidney RI) in bilateral interlobular renal arteries were evaluated using Doppler Sonographic; the secondary endpoints were the retrobulbar hemodynamics RI in the bilateral central retinal artery (CRA), posterior ciliary artery (PCA), and arteria ophthalmica (OA) were evaluated using color doppler imaging (CDI); the tertiary endpoints were the biochemical endpoints: blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG), FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and renal function parameters (BUN, Cr, and GFR); in addition, the albumin excrete rate (AER), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. The patients were diagnosed with T2DM according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association ; 2. No smoking history, pulmonary disease, cold, nor pulmonary infection within a fortnight; 3. Did not have hepatopathy, nephropathy, hyperuricemia, and gastrointestinal disease; and 4. Likely to have good compliance and able to visit our hospital for periodic assessments. 1. T1DM, gestation and lactation; 2. Renal inadequacy,hypohepatia,and heart failure; 3. Intensive care with insulin treatment; 4. The patients combined with DR and hypertension (antihypertensive drugs were used); 5. Patients with other eye conditions that could affect the blood flow, such as high degree myopia, maculopathy of any origin, glaucoma, and those with a history of laser treatment or intraocular surgery; 6. The patients combinated with DKD; 7. Patients with other renal conditions that could affect the blood flow, such as urolithiasis, urinary infection, and renal cyst (diameter &gt; 3 cm); 8. Cholesterollowering drugs can not control the bloodfat (TC &gt; 250 mg/dl, HDLC &lt; 30 mg/dL, LDLC &gt; 170 mg/dl, TG &gt; 200 mg/dl) adequately.</criteria>
