	<brief_summary>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure for older adults with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. Despite symptomatic and survival benefits, many patients experience functional decline after TAVR. This pilot study aims to test the feasibility of a home-based exercise intervention targeting endurance, strength, and balance as well as cognitive behavioral intervention to improve physical functioning and disability after TAVR.</brief_summary>
