	<brief_summary>Mocetinostat (MGCD0103) is an orally administered HDAC inhibitor. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human monoclonal antibody that is an inhibitor of the Programmed Cell Death Ligand (or PD-L1). Durvalumab is also known as a checkpoint inhibitor. This study is evaluating the combination regimen of mocetinostat and durvalumab in subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Patients eligible for this study may have previously received treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study of Mocetinostat and Durvalumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment regimen will begin with a 7-Day Lead-in Period of mocetinostat alone followed by start of the combination regimen of mocetinostat and durvalumab. The Recommended Phase 2 Dose of mocetinostat will be established in the Phase 1 dose escalation segment, followed by evaluation of the clinical activity of the combination regimen in Phase 2.</detailed_description>
