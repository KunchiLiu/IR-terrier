	<brief_summary>The main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the alterations in brain cortical activity induced by micro- and hypergravity conditions. A secondary objective is to correlate changes in brain cortical activity and brain oxygenation level with neurocognitive performance. Another secondary objective is to differentiate between the influences of hemodynamic and electro cortical changes and the influence of stress on cognitive performance alterations</brief_summary>
