	<brief_summary>PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) are commun used. Just one paper report morbidity with suture as fixation system for PICC (dislodgement, infection) In the guidelines it's recommended to use sutureless device. The devices actually used are unsatisfactory because of the high risk of migration, accidental removal. A new device, called KTFIX PLUS, seem to be more secure for PICC fixation and offer the possibility to simplify the after care. This device may stay on patient for 4 weeks. Others devices may be changed 1/week. The investigators aimed to compare morbidity between this new device and the old one. The investigators also want to perform an economic evaluation of this device and compare patient quality of life.</brief_summary>
