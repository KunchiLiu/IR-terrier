	<brief_summary>Evaluate the feasibility of an autologous cell preparation composed of a mixture of cells enriched for endothelial progenitor cells (EnEPCs) and multipotent adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) (BGC101), in the treatment of patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who have not responded to optimal pharmacological treatment or control of risk factors and/or had a revascularization failure, and do not have the option of further revascularization treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Have the time and ability to complete the study and comply with instructions. 2. Capable of understanding the purpose of the study and the contents of the informed consent form 3. Age &gt; 18 Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female 4. At least one of the clinical diagnostic indications of CLI: Clinical assessment as Rutherford 45 Rest pain Nonhealing ischemic ulcers Minor tissue loss 5. At least one of the hemodynamic indicators of severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease: Ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.45 Toe brachial index (TBI) &lt;0.4 TcPO2 &lt; 40mmHg A poor candidate for standard revascularization treatment options for peripheral arterial disease due to (1) unfavorable anatomy (e.g. small vessel disease with no major vessel stenosis/obstruction) OR (2) continued presence of smaller vessel microvasculature) disease six weeks or more after revascularization (performed as part of standard care) based on patency of the treated vessel(s). Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for this study. 1. Concurrent therapy that, in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study medication. 2. Treatment with any investigational product within the last 6 months or enrollment in any active study involving the use of investigational devices or drugs. 3. Presence of any other condition or circumstance that, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk to the patient or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study. 4. Based on clinician opinion prognosis of a major amputation (below or above the knee) within 4 weeks from the assessment visit 5. Lack of femoral artery blood flow 6. Based on clinician opinion inability to perform intramuscular injections in cases such as sever skin lesions, severe edema or morbid obesity 7. Blood transfusions during preceding 4 weeks (to exclude the potential of nonautologous cells in the harvested blood) 8. Heart failure (NYHA 34) 9. Hgb Less than 9gm 10. Myocardial infarction, brain infarction, uncontrolled myocardial ischemia or persistent severe heart failure (EF&lt; 25 %) during the preceding 3 months 11. Significant valvular disease or after valve replacement (based on medical record) 12. Renal failure (eGFR &lt;30, Chronic Kidney Damage Stage 45) 13. Liver function tests are more than three times normal upper limit (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, LDH). 14. Abnormal coagulation tests (PT(INR) &gt;2) 15. Pregnant or lactating women at entry to study 16. People who are unwilling to agree to use acceptable methods of contraception such as condom from screening during the study to prevent pregnancy and chronic infectious diseases (such as HIV1,HIV2, HBV, HCV) 17. Malignancy within the preceding 3 years, except for BCC 18. Concurrent acute infectious disease with septicemia 19. Chronic infectious diseases (HIV1,HIV2, Hepatitis viruses B and C) 20. Immunodeficiency syndrome 21. Cytotoxic drugs treatment 22. Inability to communicate (that may interfere with the clinical evaluation of the patient) 23. Patient unlikely to be available for followup</criteria>
