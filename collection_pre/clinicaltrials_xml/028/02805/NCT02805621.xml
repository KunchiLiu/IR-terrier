	<brief_title>Machine leArning Based CT angiograpHy derIved FFR: a Multi-ceNtEr, Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT, in patients with known or suspected CAD. the investigators propose to do technical assessment of the software and evaluate how different parameters effect the outcome. Validate the FFTCT outcome by comparing the FFRCT values with invasive FFR values from retrospective patient data. To analyze the potential of FFRCT on decision making and prognosis.</detailed_description>
