	<brief_summary>The maculopathy induced by the retinal toxicity of the synthetic antimalarials must be detected at the infra-clinical state, when it can still be reversible. Identifying early retinal anatomical changes has always represented (a challenge for medical interns, dermatologists, rheumatologists, and ophthalmologists). Currently, the gold-standard for its screening and its diagnostic is the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), however it is a long and tedious exam, offered by only few medical centers. It is recommended to find a simple non-invasive alternative, on a commonly used equipment. The study of the ellipsoid (junction line between, the external and internal photoreceptor segments) using optical coherence tomography (OCT-SD) "en face" enables us, to obtain a panoramic viewing of the state of the photoreceptor layer, and to detect any modification, even subtle, within this layer. The OCT-SD "en face" can be easily done by any ophthalmologist who owns one. The proportion of "en face" OCT-SD showing suggestive retinal damage and patients who present retinal damage in relation with synthetic antimalarial treatments and diagnosed by mfERG is considered in this study.</brief_summary>
