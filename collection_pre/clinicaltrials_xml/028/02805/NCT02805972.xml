	<detailed_description>Obesity is associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, diabetes, and mortality, and is a heterogeneous condition with various causes and thus a diversity of intervention targets. Compulsive overeating afflicts 30% of people seeking obesity treatment and increases risk for CVD factors. This trial involves two participant visits to test whether opioid blockade (Day 1 or 2, depending on randomization), compared to placebo (Day 1 or 2, depending on randomization), will elicit common symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including nausea. Participants will receive each condition on separate days.</detailed_description>
