	<brief_summary>Main objective of the experiment is threefold: 1) to technically test a device for central blood pressure estimation for its applicability in a spaceflight-related environment and on the International Space Station. 2) Furthermore the objective is to compare central blood pressure estimates based on arterial pressure readings of different peripheral arteries. For central blood pressure estimation mathematical transfer functions as described by Karamanoglu and colleagues (11) will be used. 3) Finally the experiments' objective is to simultaneously apply phonocardiography together with ECG and carotid plethysmography to determine cardiac systolic time intervals in parabolic flight during gravity transitions. Secondary objective of the experiment is to simultaneously measure key variables of the central circulation during gravity transitions to expand the understanding of cardiovascular regulation in weightlessness. Furthermore spirometric measurements shall be performed during a parabolic flight day to observe changes in end-expiratory CO2. Arterial CO2 content is central for cardiovascular regulation. Our main hypothesis is that there is no difference between different methods of central arteria pressure determination. Concerning our secondary objective, this experiment is designed as an observational study. Thus no clear hypothesis was generated but the measured cardiovascular and respiratory variables will be analysed regarding differences correlated to gravity.</brief_summary>
