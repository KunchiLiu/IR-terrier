	<brief_title>Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Surgery With Mitomycin-C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a leading cause irreversible blindness worldwide. Glaucoma valve surgeries such as Ahmed valve implantation, which are conventional surgeries performed to control intraocular pressure in eyes, are sometimes associated with complications due to fibrosis. Mitomycin-C is a commonly used antifibrotic agent used in glaucoma surgeries. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Mitomycin-C injections intraoperatively and postoperatively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inadequately controlled glaucoma on maximum tolerated medical therapy with intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to 18 mm Hg.

Unwilling or unable to give consent, unwilling to accept randomization, or unable to return for scheduled protocol visits. Pregnant or nursing women. Previous cyclodestruction or glaucoma drainage device (GDD) surgery. Patients with nanophthalmos. Patients with SturgeWeber syndrome or other conditions associated with elevated episcleral venous pressure. No light perception vision. VA &lt;20/200 in nonstudy eye. Need for glaucoma surgery combined with other ocular procedures (i.e. cataract extraction, penetrating keratoplasty, or retinal surgery) or anticipated need for additional ocular surgery. Previous scleral buckling procedure or silicone oil present. Uveitic glaucoma.</criteria>
