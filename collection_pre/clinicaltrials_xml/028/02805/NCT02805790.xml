	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study which will enroll up to 36 subjects (anticipated) with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease who have completed participation in the SPIMM-201 (MMPOWER) study. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two sequence groups: 4-weeks of treatment with 40 mg elamipretide administered once daily subcutaneously in Treatment Period 1 followed by 4-weeks of treatment with placebo administered once daily subcutaneously in Treatment Period 2 (separated by 4-week washout period), or vice versa</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject completed participation in the SPIMM201 study without a significant protocol deviation that would suggest the subject may not be able to complete all study requirements in the opinion of the Sponsor Subject must reside in North America for the duration of the study Subject has not received study drug in the SPIMM201 study within 3 weeks prior to Screening Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 of the methods of birth control specified in the protocol from the date they sign the ICF until two months after the last dose of study drug Subject has been on stable (unchanged and constant) medications (including overthe counter treatments, vitamins, or supplements) for at least 1 month prior to the Baseline Visit Subject has any prior or current medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing all study requirements (i.e. unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction) Subject has received any investigational compound and/or has participated in another interventional clinical study within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit or is concurrently enrolled in any noninterventional research of any type judged to be scientifically or medically incompatible with the study as deemed by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Subject experienced an adverse reaction to study drug in the SPIMM201 study that contraindicates further treatment with elamipretide in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating Subject has undergone an inpatient hospitalization within the 1 month prior to the Screening Visit or is likely to need inpatient hospitalization or a surgical procedure during the course of the study Subject has a creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft Gault equation Subject has QTc elongation defined as a QTc &gt;450 msec in male subjects and &gt;480msec in female subjects. Note: At the initial electrocardiogram (ECG), if QTc exceeds these parameters, the ECG may be repeated 2 more times, and the average of the 3 QTc values used to determine the subjects eligibility Subject has uncontrolled hypertension in the judgment of the Investigator (e.g. elevated above &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;100 mmHg diastolic despite appropriate treatment on two consecutive readings) Subject has a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the excipients contained in the study drug Subject has a history of active alcoholism or drug addiction during the year before the Screening Visit</criteria>
