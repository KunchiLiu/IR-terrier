	<brief_summary>Study CC-90011-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion, First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90011 in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors (including neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC)) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90011 to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90011.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Subjects With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. Screening Period The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90011. The informed consent document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff prior to the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be completed within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90011. Treatment Period During the Treatment Period, CC-90011 will initially be administered orally in each 4-week (28 day) Cycle. Follow-up Period In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of CC-90011 for safety. After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (± 2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: ≥ 18 years of age Subjects with histological or cytological confirmation of advanced unresectable solid tumors (including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC)) or NonHodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) and indolent NonHodgkin's lymphomas (iNHL) The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment: 1. low grade (G1) neuroendocrine tumors (≤ 2 per high power fields (HPF) and/or ≤ 2% Ki67 index) such as carcinoid are excluded. 2. Subject has received anticancer therapy (either approved or investigational) ≤ 4 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, prior to signing the ICD. &lt; 42 days for prior nitrosureas or mitomycin C 3. Toxicities resulting from prior systemic cancer therapies must have resolved to ≤National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 prior to starting CC90011 treatment (with exception of grade 2 peripheral neuropathy and alopecia). 4. Prior ASCT ≤ 3 months before first dose or those who have not recovered. 5. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant with either standard or reduced intensity conditioning. 6. Subject has undergone major surgery ≤ 4 weeks or minor surgery ≤ 2 weeks prior to signing the ICD or who have not recovered from surgery. 7. Subject has completed any radiation treatment &lt; 4 weeks prior to signing the ICD or &lt; 2 weeks for palliative bone radiotherapy (single fraction). Subjects with &gt; 25% of myelopoetic BM radiation are not allowed to be enrolled on this study. 8. Subject has persistent diarrhea due to a malabsorptive syndrome (such as celiac sprue or inflammatory bowel disease) ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2, despite medical management), or any other significant GI disorder that could affect the absorption of CC90011. 9. Subject with symptomatic or uncontrolled ulcers (gastric or duodenal), particularly those with a history of and/or risk of perforation and GI tract hemorrhages. 10. Subject with any hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 or haemoptysis &gt; 1 teaspoon within 4 weeks prior to the first dose 11. Symptomatic or untreated or unstable central nervous system (CNS) metastases as per protocol. 12. Subject with SCLC that has history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR a history of pneumonitis that has required oral or Intra Venous (IV) steroids 13. Subject has known symptomatic acute or chronic pancreatitis. 14. Subject has impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, as per protocol. 15. Subject has other clinically significant heart disease such as congestive heart failure requiring treatment or uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 160/95 mm Hg). 16. Subject is a pregnant or nursing female. 17. Subject has known Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 18. Subject has known chronic active hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HCV) infection. 19. Subject with ongoing treatment with chronic, therapeutic dosing of anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, Factor Xa inhibitors, thrombin antagonist). Low dose low molecular weight heparin for catheter maintenance and for shortterm prophylaxis for subjects with prior PE and DVT are permitted under careful consideration by the Investigator. 20. Subject has a history of concurrent second cancers requiring active, ongoing systemic treatment. 21. Subject has any significant medical condition (eg, active or uncontrolled infection or renal disease), laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating (or compromise compliance) in the study or would place the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study. 22. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.</criteria>
