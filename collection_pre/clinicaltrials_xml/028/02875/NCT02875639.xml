	<brief_title>A Clinical Research of Qi Deficiency and Blood Stasis Syndrome (Different Disease With Syndrome)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modern research has shown that the main mechanism of the qi deficiency and blood stasis of coronary disease combined with cardiac failure is the disorder Nerve-endocrine-immune network mechanism, disorder of energy metabolism, blood coagulation/anticoagulation imbalances, vascular endothelial injury and the expression of inflammatory factors and cytokines disorder, etc. Some studies have identified that the Chinese traditional medicine of supplementing qi and activating blood circulation drugs could adjust the nerve - endocrine - immune network, improve endothelial function, improve ventricular remodeling, ameliorate heart function, alleviate the clinical symptoms, enhance the quality of life, and so on. This study by comparing the curative effect of Yi-Qi Formula, Huoxue prescription and two prescription of yiqi huoxue (buyang huanwu decoction and Qishen Yiqi Drop Pill) on improving energy metabolism, ameliorating heart function, adjusting the blood coagulation and the expression of cell adhesion factor, improving endothelial function, to reveal the curative effect mechanism of Yiqihuoxue prescription which treat the disease of qi deficiency and blood stasis, and confirm the TCM theory that "Qi and blood are correlated.</detailed_description>
