	<brief_summary>Establishment of a BNA reference database for the Adult and Elderly Population. Hypothesis-generating study designed to collect data that will aid in future scientific and engineering exploration of correlations between clinical assessments and BNA scores. The results are primarily intended for scientific inquiry and engineering development purposes, and may be used in future regulatory submissions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently, there is no reliable, bedside, and non-invasive method for assessing connectivity changes in electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related pathologies, e.g., concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both a non-invasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording, spatial resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization. The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision-making in brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been developed to fill this gap.</detailed_description>
