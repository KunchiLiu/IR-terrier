	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy is commonly used as myeloablative conditioning treatment to prepare patients for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Chemotherapy leads to several side effects, with gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis being one of the most frequent. Current models of GI mucositis pathophysiology are generally silent on the role of the intestinal microbiome. The aim of the study is to identify functional mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome may play a key role in the pathophysiology of GI mucositis, the investigators applied high throughput DNA-sequencing analysis to identify microbes and microbial functions that are modulated following chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
