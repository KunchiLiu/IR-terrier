	<brief_title>Fucoidan Improves the Metabolic Profiles of Patients With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fucoidan is a water-soluble dietary fiber which is extracted from brown seaweed. Slimy surface of brown seaweed has unique ingredients and different kind of brown seaweed has slightly different effectiveness. The strongest fucoidan among all seaweed for inhibiting cancer cells is in Okinawa Japanese waters. For chemically speaking, the major components for fucoidan consisted of mainly fucose which is a kind of polysaccharide with strong biological activity. However, patients need to take actual fucoidan in order to reach the best effectiveness for inhibiting cancer cell. Studies reveal special function of fucoidan so far include anti-virus, anti-tumor, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, blood fat, anti-oxidation and liver and kidney dysfunction and improve fibrosis. The subject of this study focus on assessing the impact on the metabolism of fatty liver and liver fibrosis after taking oral FucoHiQ capsules.</detailed_description>
