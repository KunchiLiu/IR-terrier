	<brief_summary>Screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, monitoring its growth and evaluation of its risk of rupture are based on the measure of its maximum diameter. The abdominal aortic aneurysm's treatment to prevent its rupture is recommended from a threshold of 50-55 mm in men and of 45-50 mm in women. The importance of this measure for patient management justify a specific and homogeneous protocol of measure. However, the diversity of methods of measuring the maximum diameter with scanner and ultrasound was shown. The impact of various angio-CT based measures of maximum AAA diameter, and the impact of reproducibility limits on the decision to operate have never been investigated.</brief_summary>
