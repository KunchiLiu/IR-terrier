	<brief_summary>A prospective, non-interventional, non-controlled multicenter observational study to evaluate aspects of pharmaceutical care and the treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive, HER2-receptor negative, advanced breast cancer treated with everolimus and exemestane. The main objective of the study is to evaluate medication adherence in postmenopausal, hormone-receptor positive, HER2-receptor negative, advanced breast cancer treated with a combination of everolimus and exemestane. Additionally, other aspects of the pharmacotherapy, with focus on the patient perspective, will be investigated: - Patient satisfaction with treatment information - Patient satisfaction with treatment - Health-related quality of life - Treatment efficacy - Treatment-related toxicity - Patient follow-up by the oncologic team/general practitioner and or specialized home nurses This study should reveal information necessary for the development of pharmacotherapeutic care concepts that meet the needs of cancer patients treated with an oral anti-cancer drug over a long period.</brief_summary>
