	<brief_title>A Study of VAL401 in the Treatment of Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, open label study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VAL401 in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma after failure of at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen. Eligible patients will be enrolled as a single cohort and treated with VAL401, given as oral capsules. VAL401 is a formulation of Risperidone (active pharmaceutical ingredient) in a liquid lipid filled capsule.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. Patients with mixed histology will be eligible if adenocarcinoma is the predominant histology. Measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1. Prior chemotherapy for relapsed or metastatic non small cell lung cancer. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Negative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test in women of childbearing potential (defined as women ≤ 50 years of age or history of amenorrhea for ≤ 12 months prior to study screening). Sexually active male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control e.g. barrier methods with spermicides, oral or parenteral contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices, during the entire duration of the study and for 1 month after the final administration of VAL401. Note that female patients may be surgically sterile (with appropriate documentation in the patient's medical records). Ability to give written, informed consent prior to any studyspecific screening procedures with the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice. Patient is capable of understanding the protocol requirements, is willing and able to comply with the study protocol procedures, and has signed the informed consent document. Radiotherapy or surgery (other than biopsy) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Any chemotherapy regimens (including investigational agents) with delayed toxicity with 6 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1, or received any chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis which have limited potential for delayed toxicity within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Palliative treatment regimens, and other concomitant drugs regimens are permitted with stable toxicity, and recording of all concomitant medications (including herbal). Pregnant or lactating female patients. Active hepatitis B or C or other active liver disease (other than malignancy). Any active, clinically significant, viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; other than cytomegalovirus which may be present providing any required concomitant antiviral treatment is recorded appropriately. Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity. History of clinically significant cardiac condition, including ischemic cardiac event, myocardial infarction or unstable cardiac disease with 3 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Active brain metastases (defined as stable for &lt;4 weeks and/or symptomatic and/or requiring treatment with anticonvulsants or steroids and/or leptomeningeal disease). Any known contraindications to Risperidone or patients who would not be eligible to receive the treatment as defined in the Special Warnings and Precautions section of the local label for Risperidone. Any medical history that in the Investigator's opinion would jeopardise compliance with the protocol.</criteria>
