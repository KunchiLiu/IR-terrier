	<brief_title>Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. Bupivacaine Hydrochloride and Lidocaine During Suburethral Sling Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, comparative, randomized study. Women with pure stress urinary incontinence or mixed urinary incontinence with a predominant stress component who had chosen to proceed with a midurethral sling will be randomized to two groups. The study group will have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted liposomal bupivacaine solution. The comparison group would have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted bupivacaine HCL and Lidocaine solution. The postoperative pain will be compared between groups using a visual analog scale. The quality of recovery will be compared between the groups using the quality of recovery short form. Postoperative opioid consumption will be compared between the two groups.</detailed_description>
