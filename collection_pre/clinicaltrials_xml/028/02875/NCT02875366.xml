	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of LUM/IVA on manifestations of CF affected by exercise tolerance &amp; training.</brief_summary>

FEV1 at least 40% and not greater than 90% of predicted. History of any comorbidity that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the use of CPET as an assessment, or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject.

History of solid organ or hematological transplantation. For subjects under 18 years of age at Screening, except those who have had bilateral lens removal, selected findings on a screening ophthalmologic examination will be exclusionary Using or expected to require any concomitant medication that is prohibited in this study History of alcohol or drug abuse, as deemed by the investigator, in the past year, including but not limited to cannabis, cocaine, and opiates.
