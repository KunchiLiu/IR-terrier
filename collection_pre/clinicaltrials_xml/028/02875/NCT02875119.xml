	<brief_summary>This is a two-part study. The first part is a single-dose open label design. The second part employs a multiple dose, randomized, placebo controlled study design. Studies have demonstrated that GRFT is highly potent for HIV prevention and is effective at very low concentrations. One 4 mL dose of PC-6500, designed to provide an adequate vaginal concentration of GRFT for the prevention of HIV, based on preclinical data, will be evaluated. Rising dose tolerance is not the goal of this study because GRFT is likely to be minimally absorbed systemically, if at all.</brief_summary>

Note: Women with a history of condylomata or genital herpes who have been asymptomatic for at least six months may be considered for eligibility. 6) Positive test for Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) at screening. 7) Symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis (BV), or urinary tract infection (UTI) at screening. (Participants who test positive at initial screening may be treated and retested once, and reconsidered for screening). 8) Presence of any clinically significant genital epithelial findings (e.g. abrasions, ulcerations, or lacerations, or vesicles) suspicious for STIs at screening. 9) History of hysterectomy or menopause. 10) Use of excluded contraceptive methods including Nuvaring®, condoms (male or female), contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap. 11) History of gynecological surgery or procedure within past 2 months. 12) History of uterine prolapse, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding or urethral obstruction within the last 3 months, including unexplained breakthrough bleeding requiring sanitary protection. 13) Known current drug abuse, including illicit drugs, or alcohol abuse. 14) Abnormal finding on laboratory or physical examination or a social or medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation in the study unsafe or would complicate interpretation of data. 15) Unable to comply with study requirements, including but not limited to, attending all study visits, using the gel as directed, observing abstinence throughout the study and use of allowable effective contraceptives. 16) History of latex allergy.</criteria>
