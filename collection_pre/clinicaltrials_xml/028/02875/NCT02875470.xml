	<brief_summary>This study compares the efficacy of diamond burs and Gracey curettes in non-surgical periodontal treatment of chronic periodontitis by clinical, microbiological, biochemical parameters and scanning electron microscopic investigations on root surfaces. Two quadrants of each of the 12 patients were treated with diamond burs whereas other 2 quadrants were treated with Gracey curettes. Also 21 hopeless teeth received root planing either with diamond burs or curettes or no treatment at all and were then extracted for microscopic evaluations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Burs Versus Curettes in Root Planing.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gracey curettes are the most widely used instruments for root planing and regarded as the gold standard, but their usage is technic sensitive and time consuming for the clinician and efficacy reduces in deep pockets, root irregularities, and furcations. Alternative sonic, ultrasonic and rotary instruments have been investigated for potential benefits in improving mechanical access. Sonic and ultrasonic instruments are used for scaling, but they cannot provide smooth root surfaces. Intensiv Perio Set is a rotating diamond bur system developed for odontoplasty, scaling and root planing. It is used only in right angle hand piece, at rotation speeds of 6000 rpm, with reduced pressure application. These burs have two different head types for morphologically different areas; flame or tapered, three different grains; 75, 40, or 15 μm, with either a short or long neck for each unit. Burs with 75 μm grain are used only in odontoplasty, whereas, 40 and 15 μm burs are used for scaling and root planing.</detailed_description>
