	<brief_summary>Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation of the ciliary body is an effective technique to reduce intraocular pressure in case of glaucoma. Due to concerns over complications, the main indications for this second-line treatment are refractory glaucoma medication / surgery and low visual prognosis. The 2000 milliwatts (mW) for 2 seconds settings are used by the majority of researchers and clinicians according to the published literature. Some have proposed using 1250 mW for 4 seconds to improve the use of this medical procedure. The aim of this study is to determine how different parameters affect the efficacy of the treatment. This is a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing two groups, the experimental group using 1250 mW for 4 seconds and the control group using 2000 mW for 2 seconds.</brief_summary>
