	<brief_summary>This research aims to investigate the feasibility for the treatment of OnPulse(TM) for the treatment of faecal incontinence (FI) (including mixed faecal and urinary incontinence) in older people living at home or in a Care Home. It will determine patient acceptability, tolerability and usability of the T-2 gekoTM device for FI by assessing: 1. device user factors: acceptability of use, ease of device placement, ease of device interface control and understanding of device instructions; 2. tolerability of device: skin tolerability.</brief_summary>
