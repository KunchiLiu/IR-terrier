	<brief_summary>This study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled pilot trial of moderate systemic hypothermia (33°C) vs normothermia (37°C) for 48 hours in infants with neonatal encephalopathy instituted within 6 hours of birth or hypoxic-ischemic event.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial tested the ability to initiate systemic hypothermia in outlying hospitals and participating tertiary care centers, and determined the incidence of adverse neurologic outcomes of death and developmental scores at 12 months by Bayley II or Vineland tests between normothermic and hypothermic groups. This trial identified potential safety outcomes, compared the adverse effects of hypothermia among hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) infants in the normothermic and hypothermic treatment groups, and obtained rates of adverse outcomes.</detailed_description>
