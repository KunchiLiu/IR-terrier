	<brief_summary>Normal values for female external genitalia size at birth, particularly clitoris and blood level of androgens are not well known. This study's aim is to collect normal values in 180 newborn girls of 24 to 41 weeks of pregnancy, and to build genitalia growth charts according to gestational age and birth weight. The investigators will measure clitoris, genito-anal ratio using a small plastic caliper, at birth, and their evolution until Day 3 of life (if the child is still at the hospital). The investigators also want to establish normal values of blood testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, delta4-androstenedione, 21-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrostenedione, and dihydrotestosterone), using samples taken for systematic post natal screening of diseases (only in new born of 35 or more weeks of birth). This is an observational prospective study.</brief_summary>
