	<brief_summary>The aim of present study is to investigate any relationship between hyperlipidemia and periodontal disease regarding the periodontal parameters and plasma lipid parameters, along with age, gender, brushing habit, body mass index, dietary habit, physical activity, alcohol consumption. In this cross sectional study, a total of 160 individuals were divided into two groups based on their metabolic status: hyperlipidemic group (n=97) and normolipidemic group (n=63). Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) clinical parameters and community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) scores were measured. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels had been determined previously during individuals routine systemic examinations. Daily brushing habits and interdental cleaning together with dietary habits, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels were also recorded.</brief_summary>
