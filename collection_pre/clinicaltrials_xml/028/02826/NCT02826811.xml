	<brief_summary>BKV nephropathy (BKV) is one of the most frequent complications of kidney transplantation. In the absence of specific anti-BKV treatment, pre-emptive reduction of immunosuppression is the main strategy that has proven effective in reducing the risk of BKVN. However, it exposes a transplant rejection risk estimated between 4 and 14% according to studies. Despite the pre-emptive reduction of immunosuppression, a significant number of patients continue to progress towards BKVN suggesting that pre-emptive strategy is late. It's therefore urgent to develop new prognostic markers to identify earlier and more effectively patients with a higher risk of developing BKVN.</brief_summary>
