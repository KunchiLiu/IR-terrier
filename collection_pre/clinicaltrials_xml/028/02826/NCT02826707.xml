	<brief_summary>Despite physical activity (PA) being a valuable modality for promoting health, the evidence for effective PA intervention strategies for manual wheelchair (MWC) users is underdeveloped. Community-based programs and telephone-counselling interventions to increase PA among MWC users have had some success, but the uptake and adherence to these interventions remains low within this population. Community-based programs may not reach MWC users who live in rural areas and have issues with transportation, while health professionals may not optimally relate with MWC when providing telephone counselling. Although the PA needs of MWCs are not fully understood, there is reason to believe that including peers into intervention delivery may have benefits. A feasibility trial is critical and prudent prior to moving forwards with a large and expensive multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) to ensure that: the intervention meets the needs of the target population; the right outcomes are measured; and that the intervention is feasible to administer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a Smartphone-delivered Peer-led Physical Activity Counselling (SPPAC) program for MWC users.</brief_summary>
