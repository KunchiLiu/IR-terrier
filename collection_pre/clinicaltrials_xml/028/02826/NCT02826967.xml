	<brief_summary>This study will allow investigators to determine whether colonic irrigation may allow for a non-oral, same-day alternative to traditional oral bowel prep regimens. This in turn could lead to more persons able to undergo screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer and thus increased cancer prevention and early detection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary endpoints for this study are: - Overall quality of bowel cleansing for each of the three segments of the colon (ascending, transverse, and descending) as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Score (BBPS), a validated numerical scale for bowel cleanse (0-3 for each colon segment; 0-9 total score) (6). - Patient satisfaction, as measured by a questionnaire administered by a study investigator via follow-up phone call after completion of the colonic irrigation and subsequent colonoscopy.</detailed_description>
