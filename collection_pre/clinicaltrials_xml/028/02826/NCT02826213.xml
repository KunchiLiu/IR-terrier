	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Techniques of Renal Pre-transplant Infusion on the Evolution of Renal Function in the Recipient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both machines differ in their operation: the LifePort® machine manufactured by the "Organ Recovery System (ORS)," says renal perfusion by maintaining a continuous perfusion pressure that is adjustable, while the Waves machine company "Medical Waters" assures infusion maintaining a controlled pulsatile flow. Both machines are now available but the investigators currently have no study of whether an infusion type is superior to the other in terms of results on renal function recipients. Study the impact of both types of infusion on renal function recipients evaluated in the early days of transplantation, at three months and one year after the transplant.</detailed_description>
