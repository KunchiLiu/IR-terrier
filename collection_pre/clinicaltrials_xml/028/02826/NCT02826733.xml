	<brief_summary>Many cognitive functions in human are based on asymmetric brain networks. For most adults, language is processed largely by the left hemisphere while other auditory treatments, such as voice recognition are rather based on the right hemisphere. Many studies helped to highlight the presence of anatomical and functional asymmetries both in the first months of life. What are the causes of these imbalances? How do they develop? Are they necessary for operation or for effective learning? The investigators would like in this work, in collaboration with applied mathematics team of Compi√®gne and INSERM team, to determine from which period the development of hemispheric dominance is set up for recognition of language and in which brain structure it occurs in preterm infants whose sound environment is usually very different from that of the fetus. The impact of this environment on brain development of infants and their early learning will be assessed.</brief_summary>
