	<brief_summary>This study investigates the feasibility of a cognitive strategy training intervention for people with Parkinson disease (PD). We plan to recruit 8 non-demented PD participants to complete 6 weekly treatment sessions and Pre- and Post-testing (8 sessions total, entire study duration per participant = 8 weeks). We will measure participant responsiveness and the overall efficiency of the intervention process.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility and Optimization of a Cognitive Intervention for Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson disease (PD) and is a significant source of disability and reduced quality of life. Existing rehabilitative interventions, which focus on cognitive process training, have not been successful in mitigating its negative functional consequences. We have developed a client-centered cognitive strategy training intervention to enable people with PD to work around their cognitive deficits and maintain their functional performance. This study is an exploratory case series to assess aspects of its feasibility. Specifically, we will assess participant responsiveness to the intervention (acceptance, engagement, adherence), and we will track logistical information (e.g., scheduling). We will also administer an exploratory outcome measure of treatment effect to gain preliminary evidence on the effect of the intervention on self-identified cognitive performance problems. This information will guide modifications and enhancements in preparation for future clinical trials.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females over age 50 who meet criteria for idiopathic typical PD, are Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage IIII (mild to moderate disease; Hoehn &amp; Yahr, 1967) and are treated with levodopa/carbidopa. For this early phase of development we will limit enrollment to people who can identify at least one daily cognitive performance problem and are willing to learn strategies to address it. Possible dementia, medication change over the study period, other neurological disorders, brain surgery (e.g., STN DBS), history of psychotic disorder or significant current psychiatric disorder (i.e., moderate to severe anxiety, apathy or depression), or any condition that would interfere with participation (e.g., nonEnglish speaking). Participants taking benzos will be excluded.</criteria>
