	<detailed_description>This is an expanded access study under an IND with a total of 300 participants with prostate cancer. Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. Study participants will receive 11C-Sodium Acetate and will undergo a PET/CT imaging study. All patients referred by Oncologists and Urologists will be screened by a UCLA Nuclear Medicine physician and then accepted for scanning if clinically appropriate. The following steps will take place. 1. Informed consent will be obtained. 2. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oxymetry) will be recorded. 3. Participant will be injected with 20 - 40mCi of 11C-Sodium Acetate intravenously (i.v.). 4. PET/CT Scans will be performed with or without oral and IV contrast. All investigational scans will be read by at least one board-certified nuclear medicine physician with established expertise in PET/CT of at least 5 years' experience. Fifteen minutes after injection of 11C-Sodium Acetate, the investigators will acquire a scan. Emission images will be acquired for 3-5min/bed position. Intravenous and oral contrast will be given for the CT portion of the study. 5. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oxymetry) will be recorded following the completion of the scan. 6. Within 24-48 hours of PET/CT imaging, a follow-up telephone call or email will be conducted to discuss any side effects or reactions to the investigational agent.</detailed_description>
