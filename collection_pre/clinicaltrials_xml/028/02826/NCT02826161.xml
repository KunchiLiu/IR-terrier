	<brief_summary>This is an international, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of the cancer stemness inhibitor napabucasin administered with weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who have disease progression following systemic treatment with a platinum-based combination regimen in the metastatic setting, who have received treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor if a candidate, additional approved therapies, and for whom weekly paclitaxel is an acceptable treatment option.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC. Must have progressed following treatment with platinumbased combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and patients with an EGFR or ALK/ROS1 genetic aberration must have received appropriately targeted treatment. Must have received either nivolumab or pembrolizumab or a different INDapproved antiPD1 or antiPDL1 therapy, unless medically contraindicated Weekly paclitaxel must be an acceptable treatment option Must submit tumor tissue for correlative analyses Women of childbearing potential and partners of women of childbearing potential must take measures to avoid pregnancy while receiving and for a period of time following protocol therapy Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ function, and a life expectancy of ≥ 3 months Key Has squamous NSCLC Has received prior systemic treatment with a taxane for advanced/metastatic disease Has received systemic anticancer therapy within the 14 days prior to randomization Has received radiotherapy within the 28 days prior to randomization, with the exception of palliative radiotherapy to focal lesions for pain or other symptom control Has brain metastases with evolving neurologic symptoms or a steroid requirement. Has had major surgery requiring general anesthesia and/or mechanical ventilation within the 28 days prior to randomization Has a corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 ms or has an electrocardiogram (ECG) with a new abnormal finding that is clinically significant Has peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 (NCICTCAE) Refuses to complete quality of life questionnaires either alone or with assistance from study staff despite adequate fluency Has an intercurrent (nonmalignant) chronic medical or psychiatric illness or condition(s) not optimally controlled and carrying a moderate to high risk of interfering with protocol therapy administration or compliance with required procedures, in the judgment of the investigator</criteria>
