	<brief_summary>Goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of 3D computer-planned fracture fixation with patient-specific instruments for clavicle, upper extremity, lower extremity and pelvis fractures compared with the standard procedure of fracture fixation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Geplante Osteosynthesen Mit Patientenspezifischen Zielvorrichtungen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research hypothesis is: The medical product permits the fracture fixation of clavicle, upper extremity, lower extremity and pelvis fractures to be more accurate compared with standard procedures of fracture fixation. Accuracy is evaluated by calculating translation and rotation comparing the postoperative 3D model versus the preoperative 3D plan. Secondary outcome is an assessment of the surgical outcome using validated outcome instruments for each fractured body part like "Patient related wrist Evaluation" (PRWE) scores for distal radial fractures, as well as evaluation of range of motion.</detailed_description>
