	<brief_summary>The corpus callosum agenesis is an interesting malformation between 0.05% and 1.5% of the general population. This malformation is mostly diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound, usually at 22 weeks of gestation, and the use of prenatal advice is routinely offered to the couple. Several studies in recent years have helped to define the determinants of prognosis for the unborn child suffers from agenesis of the corpus callosum, whether total or partial. These, mainly retrospective, demonstrated that the isolated nature of the deformity (defined as no other brain malformations and brain extra, absence of abnormal karyotype, maternal poisoning or viral seroconversion when pregnancy) is associated with favorable developments in terms of psychomotor development in 80% of cases Similar results were also found in prospective studies, while the associated nature of the defect seems most heavily encumber the prognosis as other malformation or syndrome associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum Although these recent data have already significantly influence prenatal counseling and outcome of pregnancy, questions about the future of the child carrying a prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum are still valid.</brief_summary>
