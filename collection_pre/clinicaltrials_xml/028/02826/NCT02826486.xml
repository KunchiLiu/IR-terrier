	<brief_title>Study Assessing Safety and Efficacy of Combination of BL-8040 and Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients (COMBAT/KEYNOTE-202)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, single arm, phase IIa study in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study will include 30 subjects with unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study consists of two periods: - Monotherapy period: One week, with BL-8040 administered daily on days 1-5. - Combination therapy: Three week cycles of a combination of BL-8040 administered three times a week (TIW) and pembrolizumab administered once every three weeks. Subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled and receive BL-8040 monotherapy for five days followed by a combination treatment of BL-8040 and pembrolizumab. During the monotherapy period, eligible subjects will receive daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 (1.25 mg/kg) on days 1 - 5. From Day 8 subjects will begin a combination period consisting of treatment with SC BL-8040 (1.25 mg/kg) three times a week (TIW) and pembrolizumab (200mg) once every three weeks. The combination therapy will continue for up to two years, or until progression, clinical deterioration or early termination, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. 18 years and older. 2. Patients must sign a written informed consent prior to entering the study. 3. Histologically confirmed (either previously or newly biopsied) metastatic unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. 4. Have measurable disease (≥ 1 measurable lesion) based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by the site study team. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. 5. Subjects with one or more prior treatments for their pancreatic cancer. 6. Willing to submit an evaluable tumor tissue sample, preferably from a liver metastasis, unless tumor is considered inaccessible or biopsy is otherwise considered not in the subject's best interest 7. Complete resolution of toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to Grade 1 or less (except alopecia). If the subject received major surgery or radiation therapy of &gt; 30 Gy, they must have recovered from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention. 8. ECOG status ≤1. 9. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 10. Adequate organ function at baseline as defined below. All laboratory assessments should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. 1. Hematological: WBC ≥ 2,500/mm^3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 /mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L Hematocrit ≥30% 2. Renal function: Creatinine ≤1.5x ULN OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (Glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) &gt; 60 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5x institutional ULN 3. Hepatic function: Total Bilirubin: ≤1.5xULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5xULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT): ≤2.5xULN OR ≤5xULN for subjects with liver metastases 4. Coagulation: INR or PT: ≤1.5xULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants aPTT: ≤1.5xULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 11. Subjects must use effective contraception: 1. Female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential or, if of childbearing potential, must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to taking study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the subject to be eligible. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as (by other than medical reasons): ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for over 2 years Amenorrheic for &gt; 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation Post hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to screening. Documented hysterectomy or oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or confirmed by ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure otherwise the subject must be willing to use two adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Information must be captured appropriately within the site's source documents 2. Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 1. Has pancreatic tumor other than adenocarcinoma, including: acinar cell carcinoma, pancreaticoblastoma, malignant cystic neoplasms, endocrine neoplasms, squamous cell carcinoma. Vater and periampullary duodenal or common bile duct malignancies. 2. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy or uncontrolled infection. 3. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions are adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 4. Has an Underlying medical condition that would preclude study participation. 5. Has a disease that is suitable for therapy administered with curative intent. 6. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 7.
