	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of lumbar spine ultrasound on the success rate and efficiency of labor epidural placement in the lateral position. The investigators hypothesize that ultrasound imaging of the lumbar spine of women in early labor will yield similar ultrasound results when done immediately prior to epidural placement. The investigators also hypothesize that the use of ultrasound with landmarks marked and depth to the epidural space estimated will facilitate epidural placement in terms of both efficiency (time required for placement) and efficacy of pain relief.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Lumbar Ultrasound on Resident Learning Curve for Lateral Labor Epidural Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have demonstrated a significant benefit in pre-procedural ultrasound for epidural placement by anesthesia residents, particularly when performed in the obese population. To the investigators knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated this teaching modality for the lumber epidural technique in the lateral position. Formalizing the educational process for this less frequently performed, highly technical and critical skill may have a profound impact on trainee learning curves, and may enhance the overall success and efficiency of epidural placement, quality of analgesia provided, and safety of the procedure.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pregnant Subjects pregnant women 18 years or older in early labor (cervix dilated &lt; 5 cm pain visual analog score (VAS) &lt; 3, or both) requesting consultation by the anesthesia team for anticipated epidural pain relief. absolute contraindications of neuraxial anesthesia including patient refusal uncorrected coagulopathy infection at the skin site of epidural placement increased intracranial pressure, or untreated hemodynamic instability. In addition, patients with a history of scoliosis or spine surgery body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 allergy to local anesthetic, or allergy to opioids will be excluded. Anesthesiologists Inclusion criteria: Anesthesia residents or fellows who are performing the epidural technique in pregnant subjects who agree to be part of the study. Anesthesia residents or fellows with prior experience in the lumbar epidural technique, defined as having placed 20 or greater lumbar epidurals during their residency and prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria: individuals who do not want to participate in the study.</criteria>
