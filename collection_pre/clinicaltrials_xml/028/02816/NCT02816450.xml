	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the influence of changes in water intake on changes in cognitive function among preadolescent children. Further, the proposed work will determine the relationship between urinary markers of hydration process and cognitive function. We hypothesize that an increase in water intake will result in greater cognitive performance. In addition, improvements in hydration demonstrated by lower urine concentration will be correlated with greater cognitive performance.</brief_summary>
