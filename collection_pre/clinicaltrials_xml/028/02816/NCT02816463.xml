	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the leak pressure of the recently introduced laryngeal mask airway, Ambu AuraGain performs superior to the established laryngeal mask LMA Supreme in surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. This leak pressure is the pressure at which a gas leaks around the airway, which is a key marker of efficacy and safety of its use; a higher leak pressure suggests a better seal between the artificial airway and patient's airway.</brief_summary>
