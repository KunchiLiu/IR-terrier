	<brief_summary>In type-1 diabetes patients, bad cholesterol tends to accumulate because apoC1 function is slowed down. ApoC1 is a protein whose role is to diminish the activity of CETP, another protein that regulates cholesterol transfer in the body. The aim of this study is to determine whether it is possible to correct apoC1 function by improving glycaemic balance. 240 persons will be recruited in this study and allocated to one of two groups: - 160 Type-1 diabetes patients with uncontrolled diabetes: - 4 additional blood samples will be taken at the time of the systematic biological examination at inclusion and then again 3 months later. - 80 control subjects with normal lipids and normal glycaemia balance will be included in the study following the results of the biological assays. - 4 blood samples will be taken at the time of inclusion.</brief_summary>
