	<brief_title>Extraluminal Use of the Bronchial Blocker of Univent Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-lung ventilation is desirable for Several clinical procedures, such as thoracic,pulmonary, and cardiac surgery to facilitate lung exposure for these surgical procedures by collapsing the lung and most commonly used device is the double-lumen tube (DLT) for this surgical procedures.Bronchial blockers (BBs), such as univent tube with an bronchial Blocker, has more advantages than the double-lumen tube: no need exchange tube when mechanical ventilation is required postoperative, easier insertion,less postoperative sore throat (ST) and hoarseness. However, BBs requires more time for placement and more difficult to position, especially patients undergoing left-side thoracic surgery. So, this study intends to evaluate the feasibility and security issues of univent bronchial blockers outside the single lumen endotracheal tube for one- lung ventilation in left thoracic surgery patients.</detailed_description>
