	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) guided laser ablation liver, pancreas, and retroperitoneal tumors, the investigators used preoperative and postoperative US/CEUS/CT/MRI to assess lesions, and laboratory tests including the tumor markers to evaluate the general condition of patients. Intraoperative US/CEUS/CT would be applied to monitor ablation lesions.</brief_summary>
