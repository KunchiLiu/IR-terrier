	<brief_summary>Background: There is evidence linking conditioned pain modulation (CPM) deficiency with musculoskeletal pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, migraine, tension-type headaches and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as with temporomandibular disorders, idiopathic facial pain and chronic fatigue syndrome. Evidence shows that in pre-surgical situations of chronic pain there is no activation of CPM. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to measure the CPM response and determine whether neural tensioner exercise in patients with chronic neck pain is effective in the improvement of neck pain intensity, neck disability and cervical range of motion. Design: Double-blind, randomized placebo clinical trial. Methods: Patients with neck pain will be randomly allocated into two groups: the neural tensionner exercise group (NTE) or the sham technique (ST) group. Individuals will be included in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria: aged 18-65 years, neck pain perceived in the posterior region of the cervical spine, from the superior nuchal line to the first thoracic spinous process with more than 12 weeks of evolution and without radicular symptoms radiated to the head. Neck pain intensity with a visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), CPM, and cervical rang of motion will be measured pre and port intervention.</brief_summary>
