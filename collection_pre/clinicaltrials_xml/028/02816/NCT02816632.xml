	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to identify and probe the neural networks involved in feedback processing. It aims at translating this knowledge to clinical populations in which this network is disrupted or compromised. It includes two studies: 1) with fMRI in healthy subjects to identify the neural bases of feedback processing on decision making using different types of feedback (neutral, social and monetary) presented either infra- or supra-laminary and 2) probing the role of one structure, the anterior cingulate cortex, using Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) in healthy subjects. The interventional part consists in the administration of Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), which by means of small intensity currents activates the vestibular organs and subsequently vestibular-related brain areas. GVS will be delivered to healthy participants engaged in behavioural tasks requiring the processing of feedbacks of different nature (e.g. social or monetary feedbacks)</brief_summary>
