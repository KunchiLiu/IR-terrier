	<criteria>Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If there are abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population. This determination must be recorded in the participants source documents and signed by the investigator Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at Screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel including liver enzymes, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be recorded in the participants source documents and signed by the investigator A woman, must have been proved to be nonpregnant via a highly sensitive serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (betahCG) pregnancy test at Screening; and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 of each treatment period Due to the lack of adequate reproductive toxicity data, in addition to the user independent highly effective method of contraception, a male or female condom with or without spermicide is required. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction) Body mass index (BMI; weight [kilogram {kg}]/height^2 [meter {m}]^2) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square [kg/m^2] (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50 kilogram (kg) History of or current clinically significant medical illness including cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, gastrointestinal disease, or any other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis at screening or at admission to the study center as deemed appropriate by the investigator Presence of hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs or 12Lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening or at admission to the study center as deemed appropriate by the investigator Known allergy to the Domperidone or any of the excipients of the formulation</criteria>
