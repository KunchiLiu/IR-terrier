	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), is the leading cause of maternal mortality and is responsible for approximately 25% of maternal mortality deaths.It is defined as blood loss in excess of 500 ml following vaginal childbirth. Primary (immediate) PPH occurs within the first 24 hours after delivery. In clinical practice, if after giving birth, the placenta is not expelled naturally, an active management should be triggered. After obstetric maneuvers therapeutic, options begin with uterotonic treatments before considering invasive treatments such as embolization, vessel ligation and hysterectomy. However, the morbidity associated with these techniques and the desire to preserve fertility mean that new therapeutic solutions have been conceived, which has recently led to the development of an innovative intrauterine hemostasis medical device : a hemostatic intrauterine suction cup. Assuming that postpartum hemorrhages are mainly due to uterine atony, we propose in this biomedical research, the study of a new medical device. Our hypothesis is that the uterine walls will append to the walls of the suction cup after the latter is put under vacuum. The actuation of the suction cup will lead to the aspiration of all sides of the uterus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, as a first pass in human of this innovative non CE marked medical device, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using the hemostatic intrauterine suction cup for patients who present primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 500ml) after a vaginal delivery requiring administration of Nalador®. We will evaluate its placement in the uterus, the application of vacuum and its removal from the uterus.</detailed_description>
