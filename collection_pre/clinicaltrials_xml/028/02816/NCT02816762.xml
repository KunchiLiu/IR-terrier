	<brief_summary>Objectives: Main objective: To assess the effect of 12 months of CPAP treatment added to conventional drug treatment on the albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Secondary objectives: To evaluate the effect of CPAP treatment on the estimated glomerular filtration rate of patients with diabetic nephropathy and OSA; determine the additional longterm CPAP effect on glycemic control, insulin resistance, lipid profile, health-related quality of life and biomarkers of cardiac function, inflammation, oxidative stress, sympathetic tone and appetite-regulating hormones in patients with diabetic nephropathy and OSA; and to identify the subgroup of patients with diabetic nephropathy and OSA in which 12 months of treatment with CPAP achieve a more pronounced reduction in albuminuria. Methodology: Randomized, multicenter, non-blinded, parallel groups, conventional treatment-controlled trial of 12 months of duration. Subjects will randomize to conventional dietary and pharmacological treatment or conventional dietary and pharmacological treatment plus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Study subjects: Subjects 18 to 80 years with overweight or obesity and a clinical diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy, increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;20 ml/min/1.73 m2, and treatment with stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or anti-aldosterone drugs in the last four weeks. Efficacy variables: urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c); fasting glucose and insulin; homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and QUICKI indices; total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides; Troponin I, proBNP, homocysteine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; systemic biomarkers (inflammation [IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α], oxidative stress [8-isoprostane], endothelial damage [endothelin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1], sympathetic activity [neuropeptide Y] and appetite-regulating hormones [leptin and adiponectin]) and clinical questionnaires: short form (SF)-12, EuroQoL and iPAQ.</brief_summary>
