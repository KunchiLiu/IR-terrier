	<brief_summary>Background: The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is an established treatment option for patients at high risk for ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), either in whom this risk may only be temporarily present, or in patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) or after VT/VF in whom an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD is currently not possible for other reasons (infection, recent MI &lt;40days, recent PCI/CABG &lt; 3months etc.). Methods: Comprehensive registry including all patients in Austria who received a WCD in 2010-2016.</brief_summary>
