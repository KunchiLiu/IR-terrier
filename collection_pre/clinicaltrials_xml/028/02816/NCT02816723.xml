	<brief_summary>Evidence shows the positive effects of Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes in younger individuals. The proposed study investigates the usefulness of these classes in older Veterans aged 50-85. We hope to show that such classes can lead to improvements in both thinking skills as well as stress levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness Training in Healthy Older Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The expansion of the aging Veteran population, in addition to the frequent presence of comorbidities (e.g., PTSD and TBI) that exacerbate age-associated cognitive and health declines, has generated substantial interest in interventions that promote brain health in older Veterans. A growing body of evidence shows the positive effects of Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes on brain health in younger and middle-aged adults, thus training might be able to enhance brain health in older Veterans and offset age-related declines. Such training holds particular promise in enhancing areas of cognition that are especially susceptible to aging processes (e.g. attention and executive control), potentially through multiple mechanistic pathways. It is in many respects a cognitive exercise and may strengthen neural networks involved in such processes. Additionally, there is evidence for further facilitating brain health in other ways related to, for instance, altering the stress response. Currently, there is little information regarding the potential brain health benefits in older adults. As a first step to understanding these potential beneficial effects in Veterans, the aim of the proposed pilot study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of two Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes in healthy older Veterans through a randomized, controlled trial.</detailed_description>
