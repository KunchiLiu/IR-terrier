	<brief_summary>This project will fully develop and preliminarily validate CampAir, an empirically-based dynamic e-health intervention (based on the evidence-based ASMA) to assist adolescents with uncontrolled asthma to learn how to manage their illness and improve their asthma control. In addition to developing a highly novel product for adolescents with asthma, the research proposed for this project will address unique scientific questions. Despite the high asthma prevalence among adolescents, few interventions have specifically targeted adolescents. This study is innovative in that it is among the few to focus on adolescents, who are often overlooked by the healthcare system. This research will assess factors associated with successful implementation of CampAir, thereby providing new information regarding how e-health interventions can be effectively developed and implemented for use with adolescents with asthma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project will fully develop and preliminarily validate CampAir, an empirically-based dynamic e-health intervention (based on the evidence-based ASMA) to assist adolescents with uncontrolled asthma to learn how to manage their illness and improve their asthma control. In addition to developing a highly novel product for adolescents with asthma, the research proposed for this project will address unique scientific questions. Despite the high asthma prevalence among adolescents, few interventions have specifically targeted adolescents. This study is innovative in that it is among the few to focus on adolescents, who are often overlooked by the healthcare system. This research will assess factors associated with successful implementation of CampAir, thereby providing new information regarding how e-health interventions can be effectively developed and implemented for use with adolescents with asthma. To ensure the software and website function as intended, investigators will systematically test each of the seven CampAir modules with target end users. Participants will review one module per week for seven weeks. As part of each module, participants will also complete a daily asthma checklist. Following the review of each module, participants will be prompted to complete measures assessing technology acceptability and usability and product quality. Results will be used to modify and finalize the user interface and navigation to maximize usability. Results are expected to support that all participants find the CampAir product to be of high quality and technical acceptability. Participants are expected to rate the usability and relevance of the CampAir product highly. All participants are expected to advocate use of the product and recommend continued development and testing.</detailed_description>
