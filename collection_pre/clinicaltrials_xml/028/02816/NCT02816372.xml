	<brief_summary>Despite the use of protective ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agent and prone position, ARDS mortality remains high (30%-50%) in observational studies, and pneumothorax rate in randomized controlled trial remains stable (10%). The driving pressure (the ratio of tidal volume over respiratory system compliance) has recently been strongly associated with ARDS mortality, suggesting that tidal volume reduction below 6ml/kg may offer mortality benefit. While extracorporeal CO2 removal technique are currently under investigation in association with tidal volume reduction</brief_summary>
