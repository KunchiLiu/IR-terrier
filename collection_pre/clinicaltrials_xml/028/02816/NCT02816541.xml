However, no studies have investigate the PM exercises performed with pelvis in different positions on the improvement of performance, APAs and these influences on motor control. This study aims to compare the effects of practicing a single session of Pilates-based therapeutic exercises with posterior pelvic tilt and neutral position of the pelvis on the APAs of elderly subjects.</brief_summary>
