	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators utilized protein supplementation over an 8-day period following eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage in order to test the initial hypotheses : i) protein supplementation after exercise-induced muscle injury affects exercise-induced aseptic inflammation and muscle performance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective was to examine weather protein supplementation is able to affect the inflammatory response as well as recovery of muscle performance following an intense eccentric exercise protocol. In a double-blind, counterbalanced design, 14 men received either Placebo (PLA) or milk protein isolate (PRO) for 8 consecutive days following a single bout of exercise (300 eccentric contractions at 30 deg/sec). In both conditions, performance was assessed at baseline, immediately post-exercise, 2h post-exercise and daily for 8 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 2h post-exercise and daily for the remaining 8 days. Muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis were collected at baseline as well as at day 2 and day 8 of the post-exercise period.</detailed_description>
