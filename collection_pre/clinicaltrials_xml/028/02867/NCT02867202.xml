	<brief_title>Comparing the Efficacy of Intrauterine Balloon and Intrauterine Contraceptive Device for the Therapy of Uterine Adhesion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine balloon and IUD are both effective in the therapy for intrauterine adhesion. The IUD is usually inserted into the uterine after a hysteroscopic adhesiolysis and removed after two or three month later. Several investigators demonstrated its favorable effect in the recurrence of adhesion after the treatment of intrauterine adhesion. The heart-shaped intrauterine balloon is specially designed to fit into the cavity of the uterus, and usually removed on the 7th day after surgery.</detailed_description>
