	<detailed_description>Study 2: Because of a recent research, it is shown that a narrative message from a peer generates an identification, a sense of self-efficacy and intention to practice in sedentary patients with breast cancer. The investigator hypothesize that a promotional message about physical activity, issued by a self-determined peer (intrinsic motivation), compared to a non-self-determined peer (extrinsic motivation), generate higher scores of positive beliefs about physical activity and intention to engage in a physical activity program for sedentary patients. These promotional messages will be delivered through two videos, one featuring the self-determined pair, the other featuring the non-self-determined pair.</detailed_description>
