	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the correlation between invasively measured parameters (work of breathing/power of breathing, resistance and elastance), derived using esophageal pressure measurements, and their corresponding non-invasive estimated values (noninvasive work of breathing/power of breathing, resistance and elastance), computed using airway pressure and flow measurements only.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the correlation between invasively measured parameters (work of breathing/power of breathing, resistance and elastance), derived using esophageal pressure measurements, and their corresponding non-invasive estimated values (noninvasive work of breathing/power of breathing, resistance and elastance), computed using airway pressure and flow measurements only. Vent settings will be adjusted to test accuracy over a range of respiratory support conditions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult medical/surgical ICU patients (Ageâ‰¥18) on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, spontaneously breathing and receiving eligible for pressure support ventilation (PSV). Prisoners and patients with closedhead injury (e.g., trauma), hemodynamic instability, multiple organ system failure or late term pregnancy will not be studied.</criteria>
