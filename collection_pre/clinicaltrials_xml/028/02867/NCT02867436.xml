	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this pilot study is to test whether gluten-free diet (GFD) instituted in children shortly after onset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) can decelerate the decline in beta cell function as compared to age matched controls. Primary objective of the trial is the change in C-peptide area under the curve measured by mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) between group on GFD and standard gluten-containing diet. Secondary objectives are: - Changes in immune parameters between gluten-free diet group and control group; - Differences in fecal microbiome between children on normal diet and children on GFD;</brief_summary>
