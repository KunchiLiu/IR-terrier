	<brief_title>Impact of Physical Activity for Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the impact of moderate-intensity physical activity on pelvic pain in women with chronic pelvic pain. We will develop a moderate-intensity physical activity program for patients with chronic pelvic pain in conjunction with exercise physiologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) physicians. Based on prior research in fibromyalgia and other centralized pain disorders, we hypothesize that eight weeks of moderate-intensity physical activity will reduce pain intensity and pain interference in women with chronic pelvic pain. We will also evaluate the impact of moderate-intensity physical activity on physical function, fatigue, sexual function, sleep, anxiety, depression, catastrophization and patient global impression of change in women with chronic pelvic pain. We hypothesize that eight weeks of moderate-intensity physical activity will result in improvements in these measures of function and quality of life.</detailed_description>
