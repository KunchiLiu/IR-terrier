	<brief_summary>Botulinum toxin is used in musculoskeletal therapy routinely for 15 years. This is one of the most potent neurotoxins. It comes in 7 serotypes (A to G).Therapeutic application of botulinum toxin are mainly based on its ability to block the neuromuscular transmission by preventing the release of acetylcholine, creating paralysis muscle relative and reversible. It has been used in the treatment of cervical dystonia, migraine headaches, and an antinociceptive effect. The analgesic effect occurred even prior to the release muscular. Several randomized studies have been published about it. The investigators assume that intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin is effective in the treatment of tendinopathy rotator cuff.</brief_summary>
