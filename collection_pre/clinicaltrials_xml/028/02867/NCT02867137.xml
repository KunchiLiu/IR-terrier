	<brief_summary>The PreTBI I study will investigate whether prehospital blood samples drawn already in the ambulance can rule-out intracranial lesions in patients suffering head trauma. The study aims to improve triage and treatment of patients suffering mild head trauma, who are considered low-risk patients. These patients do not always benefit from hospitalization, but are nevertheless admitted on precaution, as clinical assesment can be difficult. Hypotheses: 1. A prehospital measurement of serum S100B ≤ 0,10 microgram/L in mild TBI patients rules out traumatic intracranial lesion with a sensitivity &gt;97%. 2. A prehospital measurement of serum GFAP (glial acidic fibrillary protein) in mild TBI patients rules out traumatic intracranial lesion with sensitivity &gt;97% and results in lower false positive rate than S100B. 3. Prehospital measurements of both GFAP and S100B results in lower false positive rates than in-hospital measurements.</brief_summary>
