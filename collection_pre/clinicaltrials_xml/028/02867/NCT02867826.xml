	<brief_title>The Use of Cap-assisted Forward Viewing Endoscopy for Examination of the Ampulla of Vater</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The complete visualization of the ampulla of Vater for the detection of ampullary neoplastic lesions is technically challenging with a forward-viewing endoscope. There are limited data in the relevant literature regarding the effectiveness of the Cap assisted forward viewing endoscope for accurate evaluation of the ampulla de Vater. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the visualization rates of the ampulla of Vater using forward-viewing endoscopes with or without cap attached to the distal end in the same patient.</detailed_description>
