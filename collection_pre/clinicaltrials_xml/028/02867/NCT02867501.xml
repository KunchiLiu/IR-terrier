	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess if venous distension in patients with aneurysmatic arteriopathy is higher compared to patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and in controls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Venous Distension in Patients With Aneurysmatic Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with aortic aneurysm and patients with PAOD and Controls will be investigated in the following manner: Duplexsonography with assessment of the arterial diameters in the aorta and leg arteries. Duplexsonography with assessment of venous reflux in proximal and deep veins of both legs Duplexsonography testing of venous distension in the common femoral vein, the great saphenous vein and the femoral vein.</detailed_description>
