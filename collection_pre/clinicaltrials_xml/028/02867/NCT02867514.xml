	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of 10 sessions of anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS - 1 mA) applied to left vs right CDLPF of tobacco-dependent subjects compared to the application of a placebo tDCS (sham procedure) on the craving, which is evaluated by the item 1 of Fagerström test between day 1 and day 10. Craving is also evaluated 1 month post-treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Dependent Smoking People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco is the second leading cause of death worldwide. It is currently responsible for the death of one in 10 adults (about 5 million deaths per year) and it is the fourth disease risk factor in the world. Many methods to quit smoking are available but in all cases, relapse is a common phenomena. The main risk factor for relapse is craving. So, acting on the craving seems essential to modulate tobacco consumption. Many functional neuroimaging studies have established a neuroanatomical substrate for craving process, in particularly dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), accessible par neuromodulation.</detailed_description>
