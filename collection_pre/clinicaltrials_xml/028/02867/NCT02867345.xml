	<brief_title>PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose-escalation study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and selected PD-1 knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to determine the maximal tolerant dose. After the lower number of cycles are considered tolerant, an arm of the next higher number of cycles will be open to next patients. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.</detailed_description>
