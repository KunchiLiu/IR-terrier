	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Ta1 for Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous study reported that the 7-day treatment of Ta 1 demonstrated positive active effect as to the 28-day all-cause mortality and the augmentation of mHLA-DR (monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen DR) at the secondary endpoint. Therefore, we intend to verify this finding through a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial and the trail will include subjects with impaired immunologic functions.</detailed_description>
