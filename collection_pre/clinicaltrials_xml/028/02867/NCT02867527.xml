	<brief_summary>Few publications provide information on the natural history of glaucoma, outside of clinical trials do not always reflect what is observed in common situation for various reasons (specific selection criteria and sometimes restrictive, stronger motivations patients and physicians to comply with follow-up visits and prescribed treatments, etc.). Therefore, much information on the natural history of glaucoma are unknown to date (degradation rate of visual field and visual function over time, risk of blindness in the years following diagnosis, effects of various treatments to reduce intraocular pressure and preserving visual field deterioration, etc.). Obtaining such important data to improve the management of glaucoma patients (choice of treatment methods, identification of predictors of rapid change that can make choosing more aggressive treatment and more regular monitoring, etc.) requires the establishment of cohort of patients followed and treated with the methods usually used in current practice, and besides therapeutic trial.</brief_summary>
