	<brief_summary>The Archimedes System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples in the lungs. This study is being conducted to confirm the performance of the Archimedes System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose highly suspicious lung cancer or metastatic disease. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor is conducted.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Age 2175 years at screening 2. Highly suspicious pulmonary nodule(s), defined as distinct nodule with a diameter of ≥8mm in its largest dimension 3. No known endobronchial tumor 4. Tumor located anywhere in parenchymal tissue &gt;1 cm from pleura and accessible bronchoscopically through a POE. 5. Willing to participate in all aspects of study protocol for duration of study 6. Able to understand study requirements 7. Subject or legally authorized representative signs studyrelated informed consent document 1. Any contraindication to bronchoscopy, for example: 1. Untreatable lifethreatening arrhythmias 2. Inability to adequately oxygenate the patient during the procedure 3. Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia (unless the patient is intubated and ventilated) 4. Recent myocardial infarction 5. Previously diagnosed highgrade tracheal obstruction 6. Uncorrectable coagulopathy 2. Known coagulopathy 3. Platelet dysfunction or platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3 4. History of major bleeding with bronchoscopy 5. Suspected pulmonary hypertension: additional testing required, such as echocardiogram 6. Moderatetosevere pulmonary fibrosis 7. Severe emphysema or COPD: additional testing and PI consent is required 8. Bullae &gt;5 cm located in vicinity of target nodule or tunnel 9. Any other severe or lifethreatening comorbidity that could increase the risk of bronchoscopic biopsy or ATV tunneling, for example: 1. ASA class &gt; 3 2. &gt; stage 3 heart failure 3. severe cachexia 4. severe respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia 10. Ongoing systemic infection 11. Contraindication to general anesthesia 12. Inability to stop anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, Warfarin) or antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel) prior to procedure 13. Participation in any other study in last 30 days 14. Prior thoracic surgery on the same side of the lung as the SPN. 15. Breastfeeding women or females of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test prior to the procedure or the intent to become pregnant during the study. 16. Life expectancy of less than one year. 17. Scheduled for lung surgery within 72hrs postscheduled diagnostic bronchoscopy 18. Prior radiation therapy treatment in the target lobe</criteria>
