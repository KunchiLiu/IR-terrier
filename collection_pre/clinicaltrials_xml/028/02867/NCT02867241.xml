	<brief_title>An Intervention to Protect Young Children From Tobacco Smoke Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this intervention is to reduce exposure of children to tobacco smoke, through an intervention program designed to help parents better perceive exposure and its harms, and to provide tools for assisting them in protecting children. Secondary aims are to understand the relationships between parentally-reported and objectively measured child tobacco smoke exposure, to assess the relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and health and health care utilization, and to better understand parental perceptions of tobacco smoke exposure (PPE) and parental perceptions of risk (PPR) from tobacco smoke exposure. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. This RCT is a continuation of previous work. Originally the entire research project, which included a Pilot Study and a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was registered as NCT01335178. Upon completion of the Pilot Study, we closed NCT01335178 and opened a new one for the RCT with the current registration number.</detailed_description>
