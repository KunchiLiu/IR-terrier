	<brief_summary>The medical teams are increasingly sought by patients to get the most possible information, probably expressed in a different form and thereby supplementing the information already received. Coulter et al. reached similar conclusions in their study of the writings of patient information documents. They point out, moreover, the best adaptation of the patients better informed compared to those with less or no information. This need for information varies over time. It is present before treatment begins, continues during treatment and persists after treatment. Given the specific features of radiotherapy, the manipulators are important interlocutors to participate in the accompanying caregiver time. In conclusion, the quality of information delivered to the patient has been poorly evaluated, let alone with validated tools in this area. The impact of information on the tolerance of the treatment also needs to be confirmed, knowing that an informed patient seems less anxious and better prepared for future treatment.</brief_summary>
