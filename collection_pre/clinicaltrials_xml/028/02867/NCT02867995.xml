	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether glaucoma drop aids will be cost-effective in delivery of ophthalmic medications by improving medication compliance, visual function, and even decreasing medication waste in the patient population at Boston Medical Center</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Glaucoma Drop Aids in Medication Compliance in the Patient Population at Boston Medical Center</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients being treated for their glaucoma at BMC's Yawkey Eye Clinic will be selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three out of these five drop aids will be used in this study (Ezy Drop Eye Delivery system, Fabrication Autodrop Eye Drop Guide, DROPin Eye Drop Guide, Cress Dropper, Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze). Patients will be randomly placed on one of these drops aids for a total of 3 study groups, in addition to a styrofoam cup control, or no drop aid control, for a total of 5 groups. Prior to use of the drop aid, patients will be instructed on how to use the drop aid by a resident physician and a pre- intervention intraocular pressure check will be performed by the resident physician using an applinator. Intraocular pressure is the only adjustable risk factor for glaucoma; thus, glaucoma treatments slow progression of glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure. In addition, patients will be requested to deliver their drops with the drop aid with every use. Furthermore, each patient will record the number of days taken to complete the glaucoma medication bottle while using the drop aid. At the 3 and 6 week marks, the patient will fill out a satisfaction survey. Patients will need to return to the clinic at the 6 week mark and can fill out the satisfaction survey at the clinic in addition to checking the intraocular pressure post-intervention. Thus, the number of subject contact will be two, pre and post-intervention, the duration of participation for each subject will be 6 weeks, and the patient will also be required to fill out two satisfaction surveys. The effectiveness of the drop aids will be compared to the two controls and measured with any changes in intraocular pressure readings, length of time to medication completion, and patient satisfaction according to the surveys.</detailed_description>
