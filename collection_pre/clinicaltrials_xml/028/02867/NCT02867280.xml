	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treatment in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Microvascular Invasion After Radical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, blank controlled study which initiated by Investigators. The study population include patients without macroscopic vascular invasion and distant metastasis, undergoing R0 resection, postoperative pathology confirming hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion (MVI) (BCLC A or B stage; T2 or part T3aN0M0). The primary end point of this study is recurrence free survival（RFS）at the 2nd postoperative years, and the secondary end points include postoperative median time to recurrence (TTR), 1-year, 3-years, 5-years postoperative recurrence free survival (RFS), 3-years, 5-years postoperative overall survival, and safety and tolerance of sorafenib as an adjuvant therapy for HCC. Patients in the treatment group will start Sorafenib within 4 weeks after hepatectomy at doze of 400mg per day, and last continuously for 2 years, or until disease progression. Patients in the control group will take regular treatment with no use of Sorafenib. Both groups are forbid receiving postoperative anti-cancer therapy such as adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and TACE. Patients of both groups should receive antiviral therapy according to guidelines. Chinese traditional medicine and nutritional support can be used without limitation, and the information of concomitant drug need to be recorded for further analysis. Treatment for relieve drug related AEs can be used as needed. Patients of both groups will be treated with best clinical practice as routine after confirmed recurrence/metastasis, and the information of further treatment need to be recorded and follow-up till death.</detailed_description>
