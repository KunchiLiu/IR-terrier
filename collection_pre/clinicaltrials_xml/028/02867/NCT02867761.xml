	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that symptomatic current and former smokers with spirometric values within the normal range (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC≥0.70 and post-BD FVC &lt; 80% predicted [to guard against restrictive lung disease]) will still derive symptomatic benefit from long-acting bronchodilator therapy even though they are excluded from current GOLD guideline recommendations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RETHINC: REdefining THerapy In Early COPD for the Pulmonary Trials Cooperative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RETHINC is a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate 27.5/15.6 mcg inhaled twice daily in symptomatic current and former smokers with respiratory symptoms despite preserved spirometry as defined by CAT ≥ 10 and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.70, respectively.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must be able to understand and provide informed consent 2. Age 4080 3. ≥20 packyear smoking history 4. Postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.70 5. Baseline CAT≥10 1. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply with study protocol. 2. Subject is pregnant, breastfeeding, or plans to become pregnant. 3. Active pulmonary infection or prior pulmonary infection where antibiotic and/or steroid treatment was completed ≤4 weeks prior to enrollment. 4. PostBD FVC &lt; 80% predicted 5. A primary diagnosis of asthma established by each study investigator based on ATS/ERS criteria as previously implemented in the MACRO clinical trial. 6. Known concomitant lung disease, pulmonary tuberculosis (unless confirmed by chest xray to be no longer active), or clinically significant bronchiectasis. 7. History (or family history) of long QT syndrome. 8. History of paroxysmal (intermittent) atrial fibrillation will be considered an exclusion. Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation as defined by continuous atrial fibrillation for at least 6 months and controlled with a rate control strategy (i.e., selective beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, pacemaker placement, digoxin or ablation therapy) for at least 6 months may be considered for inclusion. In such patients, heart rate at enrollment must be &lt; 100/min. 9. Patients with BMI &lt; 15 or more than 40 kg/m2. 10. Patients with diabetes Type I or uncontrolled diabetes Type II. 11. Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator, have a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition such as (but not limited to) significant renal disease, psychiatric disease, gastrointestinal disease, unstable ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia (excluding chronic stable atrial fibrillation), uncontrolled hypertension or any other condition which in the opinion of investigator might compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with evaluation, or preclude completion of the study. 12. Patients with any history of lung cancer. 13. Patients with narrowangle glaucoma, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia or bladderneck obstruction or severe renal impairment or urinary retention. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) patients who are stable on treatment can be considered. 14. Any other past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study. 15. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs from similar chemical classification, including untoward reactions to sympathomimetic amines or inhaled medication or any component thereof. 16. Patients unable to successfully use a dry powder inhaler device or perform spirometry measurements. 17. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment or within 30 days or 5 halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer. 18. Patients receiving any protocolspecified prohibited medications.. 19. Patients receiving any protocolspecified prohibited COPD related medications (will be required to undergo a required washout period prior to enrollment).</criteria>
