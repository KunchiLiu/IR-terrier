	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the use of vibrotactile feedback to traditional vestibular treatment protocols. Half the patients will have vibrotactile feedback added to their treatment protocols while the other half will undergo traditional vestibular treatment without vibrotactile feedback.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibrotactile Feedback During Vestibular Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vestibular and balance rehabilitation is an effective way to improve balance for individuals with balance impairments by using the strategies of adaptation, habituation, or substitution. Typical vestibular treatment is usually 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks. For people with uncompensated unilateral vestibular hypofunction or bilateral vestibular loss, recovery/adaptation is often incomplete and chronic balance impairments result. Vibrotactile feedback (VTF) is a strategy of substitution, or augmentation, to replace disrupted or absent vestibular function. The sensory information replaces disrupted or absent vestibular function to give persons additional signals about their body position in space. Real-time VTF applied to the trunk has been shown to decrease postural sway but the long-term benefits of training with VTF on balance and function have not been examined.</detailed_description>
