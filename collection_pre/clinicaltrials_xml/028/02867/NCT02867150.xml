	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether red light therapy using LED 635nm red light for body contouring of the waist, hips and thighs is as effective as red light therapy using Laser 635nm red light.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Analysis of the Effects of Red Light Therapy on Body Contouring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Red light laser therapy using 635nm red light laser technology has previously been shown to cause lipolysis in subcutaneous fat as a non-surgical method to promote weight loss and body contouring. This study hypothesizes that red LED light therapy using 635nm red light LED (light emitting diode) technology produces similar results to the laser device (red LASER 635nm) when performed using a specified treatment protocol. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the UltraSlim Cold Light therapy program achieves the results after a single 32-minute treatment. The predicate 635nm laser device (Zerona by Erchonia) achieves its results after six treatments combined with a diet and exercise regimen. UltraSlim Cold Light® is a patented process using the Photonica Professional device for fat removal using LED red light therapy. This multi-site study reviews results from 58 randomly selected patients after a single treatment using the Photonica Professional device (i.e. UltraSlim Cold Light®).</detailed_description>
