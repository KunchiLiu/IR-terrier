	<brief_title>Comparing Constraint-Induced Therapy and Occupation-Based Intervention for Optimal Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate change in motor performance and the extent of neuroplastic change associated with both occupation-based intervention and modified constraint-Induced therapy (m-CIT) in the recovery of upper extremity motor function following a stroke. Transcranial Magnetic Imaging (TMS) will be used to compare the difference in the brain reorganization of each client before and after the intervention to identify which technique is more effective in changing brain function. Central Hypothesis: Stroke subjects with motor deficit receiving occupation-based interventions will demonstrate improved motor function greater to that of the subjects receiving m-CIT interventions. Sixteen participants with chronic stroke will be recruited for the study over the age 21. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two therapy groups and will receive 55 minutes of therapy 2 times per week for 4 weeks for a total of 8 sessions.</detailed_description>
