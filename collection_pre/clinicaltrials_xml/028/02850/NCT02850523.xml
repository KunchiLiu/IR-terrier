	<brief_summary>Anxiety Disorders (AD) are a serious mental health concern, affecting up to 15% of perinatal women. AD often coexists with depression and result in high distress and an impaired ability for new mothers to take care of themselves and their babies. In spite of the high prevalence of AD during pregnancy and postpartum, research and clinical attention in this area is lacking and no know empirically supported psychological treatments exist. Further, since many perinatal women are unable to choose not to take medication for their mental health symptoms, establishing an effective non-pharmacological alternative is imperative. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a well-established psychological treatment for mental health disorders, with noted moderate to large effect sized (.5-1.3). The investigators have recently developed a novel CBT treatment program for perinatal women with AD and ran an initial pilot study thereafter. A significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression was found, along with reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. The purpose of the current study is to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment using a larger sample in the form of a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT).</brief_summary>
