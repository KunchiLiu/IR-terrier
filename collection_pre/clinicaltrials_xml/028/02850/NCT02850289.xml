	<brief_summary>This multi-center, observational study will examine the clinical use and outcomes of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2a and ribavirin combination (PEGASYS RBV) in participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Study visits will be scheduled for baseline, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after baseline. An additional follow-up visit at week 72 will be required for participants with an HCV genotype other than 2 or 3. Quality of life data will be collected at baseline, and at each follow-up visit.</brief_summary>
