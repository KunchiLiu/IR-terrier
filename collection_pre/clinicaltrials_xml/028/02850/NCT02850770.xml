	<brief_title>Physical Activity and Social Support Prompting Via Phone Messaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the promise of phone-based interventions to effectively support diabetes self-management (DSM), little is known about their impact on the outcomes of highly vulnerable populations such as low-income, inner-city, racial/ethnic minorities. And while phone-based interventions have generally been successful at reaching and engaging adults with diabetes, they have failed to do the same with family members/friends (FF) whom are a promising source of ongoing support for DSM. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility, perceived usefulness, and potential effectiveness of a short text or voice message (ST/VM) intervention to activate 1) physical activity (PA) behavior change among low-income, urban, Latino patients in diabetes management and 2) supportive behaviors by FF. The investigators conducted a 12-week pilot study in which participants were randomized into one of three study arms: control, phone messaging (PM), and phone messaging plus social support from FF (PM+FF). Participants were recruited in person from a diabetes management program at a safety-net ambulatory care clinic. All participants were given a pedometer and walking log for self-monitoring. Participants in the PM and PM+FF arms received ST/VMs as reminders to review daily step goals and to self-monitor; explaining the benefits of regular PA, importance of regular PA to daily life, and ways to overcome commonly identified barriers to PA; asking participants to report on PA performance; providing feedback based on responses. Participants in the PM+FF identified a FF to receive ST/VMs with suggested behaviors that are perceived as supportive by individuals making PA behavior changes. Participants received semi-structured assessments in person at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Participants were asked about the extent to which the program enhanced the participant's ability to make PA behavior changes. The primary outcome measures were daily step counts and perceived FF social support.</detailed_description>
