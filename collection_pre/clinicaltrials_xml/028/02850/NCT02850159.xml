	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dual-mode non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex of the lower leg and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with rTMS alone in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with freezing of gait (FOG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Simultaneous Dual Stimulation on Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients in the dual-mode group underwent five consecutive daily sessions of dual-mode NIBS with simultaneous high-frequency rTMS and tDCS, whereas patients in the rTMS group underwent high-frequency rTMS with sham tDCS. Assessments of FOG, motor, ambulatory and cognitive function were performed three times: at baseline before NIBS, immediately after NIBS, and one week after cessation of NIBS.</detailed_description>
