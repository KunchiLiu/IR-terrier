	<brief_title>Geniculate Artery Embolization for the Treatment of Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: The primary aims of this study are to determine if geniculate artery embolization (GAE) will reduce the severity of pain as well as global disability (resulting from the combination of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee OA and if it can be performed safely. The secondary aim is to determine if GAE can result in the decreased necessity for ongoing conservative OA therapies such as medication therapy and joint injections. Participants: Twenty patients with knee osteoarthritis resulting in knee pain that is refractory to conservative therapies, who are not planning to undergo surgery within 6 months. Procedures (methods): This will be an open label 24-month pilot study with a small population undergoing GAE to determine safety and efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will consist of a preoperative screening assessment to determine if the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24 hours, 1, 3 &amp; 6 months. An MRI will be performed at the 1-month visit to detect a change in synovial vascularity and to exclude complication.</detailed_description>
