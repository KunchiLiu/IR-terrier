	<brief_summary>Multi-institutional registry on a cohort of 310 patients with biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma treated by Radiofrequency ablation. All patients will be included consecutively and retrospectively in all centers to obtain the required number of patient followed during 5 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy of Radiofrequency in the Treatment of Renal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is actually used in elderly patients with small renal tumors (diameter ≤ 4 cm) and presenting a high risk of surgery (due to co-morbidity) and/or reduced renal function. RFA is a minimally invasive technique, considered as an alternative to surgery to limit morbidity and to preserve kidney function. The technique is well known and has proven his efficacy for the treatment of small tumors. An enlargement of the indications of RFA to patient without contra-indication to surgery will depend on the efficacy of the technique. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the local efficacy of the ablation based on the technical success, and on the evaluation of local cancer recurrence over 5 years.</detailed_description>
