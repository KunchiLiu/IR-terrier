	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy for Severe COPD Patients in the Stable Phase by an Oxyhydrogen Generator With Nebulizer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, severe COPD patients in stable phase who were included in both treatment and control groups, administered randomly oxyhydrogen generator with nebulizer (treatment group) or oxygen Nebulizer Machine （control group ）for adjuvant therapy. The therapeutic outcomes in both treatment and control groups are analyzed and evaluated to verify safety and effectiveness of the test product.This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study. The trial lasted for 3 months. The curative effect was observed for subjects in the second week, first month, second month and third month respectively as the observing time point. Total patients which are planned to be included are 140 cases, where, 70 cases in the treatment group and control group respectively are distributed in 5 clinical hospitals.</detailed_description>
