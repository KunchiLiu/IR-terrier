	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of airway management (a set of medical procedures performed to prevent airway blockage and thus ensure an open path between a patient's lungs and the atmosphere) during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [(ERCP), a procedure commonly used to treat conditions of the bile ducts and pancreas] and the effect on airway complications (problems), time to biliary cannulation (access into bile duct) and total procedure duration (length of time). Two methods are being compared and studied: 1) general endotracheal anesthesia: an inhalation anesthetic (substance that blocks pain) technique in which anesthetic and respiratory gases pass through a tube placed in the trachea (throat) via the mouth or nose vs 2) deep sedation without endotracheal intubation: local anesthesia together with sedation (drug that produces sleep) and analgesia (drug that treats pain) only.</brief_summary>
