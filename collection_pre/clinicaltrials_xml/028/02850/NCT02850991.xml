	<brief_summary>Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer. NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) recommends radiation dose of 50-50.4 Gy as the definitive radiation dose for esophageal cancer with definitive chemo-radiation. However, as many studies in China showed that the most common recurrence site after definitive chemo-radiation was within the radiation region. But there have not been large randomized clinical trials to investigate the optimal radiation dose with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal cancer in China. The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the optimal radiation dose for thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Radiation Dose With Concurrent Chemotherapy for Thoracic Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy increases overall survival for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate if high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy increased progression-free survival for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma II.To evaluate if high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy increased local control for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms ARM 1:Patients receive high-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy.High-dose RT:59.4 Gy in 33 fractions, 1.8 Gy per fraction, 5days/week.concurrent chemotherapy: Paclitaxel 50mg/m2 D1+carboplatin AUC (area under curve) =2 D1, weekly for 6 weeks. After that, patients receive consolidative platinum-based 3-week chemotherapy for 2 cycles. ARM 2:Patients receive standard-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy.Standard-dose RT:59.4 Gy in 33 fractions, 1.8 Gy per fraction, 5days/week . Concurrent chemotherapy: Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 D1+carboplatin AUC (area under curve) =2 D1, weekly for 6 weeks. After that, patients receive consolidative platinum-based 3-week chemotherapy for 2 cycles. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
