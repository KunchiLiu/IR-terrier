	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to establish a clinically feasible simultaneous evaluation of heart and lower limb using MRI and to assess the combined benefit of clinical and cardiac MRI imaging markers in the evaluation of PAD and prediction of treatment outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical and MRI Cardiac Biomarkers on Peripheral Arterial Disease in Patients With Long Term DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We expect to enroll about 60 long-term DM patients (&gt;10 years) from main study. Patient will receive evaluation of the perfusion in the lower limb by using blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) sequence with measurement of the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as an indicator of fibrosis severity in calf muscles. All patients will receive cardiac MRI (cardiac function, ischemia and fibrosis) and MR angiography (severity of PAD). The baseline studies will be completed within 2 years and 3 additional follow-up studies will be performed by the end of 4th year.</detailed_description>
