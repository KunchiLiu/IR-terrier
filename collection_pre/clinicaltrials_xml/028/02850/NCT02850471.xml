	<brief_summary>TEAS might protect against postoperative pulmonary such as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and atelectasis. We tested the hypothesis that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation protects against postoperative pulmonary complications in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants: 100 patients who underwent elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery Methods: We recruited 100 patients who are planned for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Patients were enrolled from March 1, 2015. We randomly allocated patients into two groups: controlled group ( patients treated without transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation) and TEAS group (patients treated with TEAS on Feishu, Hegu, Chize half an hour before the surgery). Blood pH, Pco2, Po2 and oxygen saturation were measured by an automatic blood gas analyzer immediately after obtaining the samples from the aorta. Sample all the patients blood before and after the surgery. And then measure the level of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.</detailed_description>
