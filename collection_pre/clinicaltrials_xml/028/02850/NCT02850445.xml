	<brief_summary>Regular psychosocial intervention combined with antipsychotic drugs, compared with usual medication alone treatments, can reduce psychiatric symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. However, it's expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes inconvenient for patients and their family members in developing areas where the number of well-trained therapist remains limited in local psychiatric settings. The investigators aimed to establish an efficient model of integrated treatment (IT) for patients with schizophrenia. The procedure contains two stages: a centralized treatment during hospitalization and the following consolidation treatments with long intervals.</brief_summary>
