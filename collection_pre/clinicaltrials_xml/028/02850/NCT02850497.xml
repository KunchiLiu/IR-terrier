	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to compare at 6 months follow-up, endothelization and malapposition, evaluated by means of optical coherence tomography, in terms of number of struts not endothelized or malapposed, after the implantation of three new generation stent: Cre8, Biomatrix and Xience.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6-month Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Evaluation of Three New Generation Drug Eluting Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study aimed at evaluating in 60 patients with either acute coronary syndromes or stable coronary artery disease submitted with PCI and stenting, endothelization and malapposition at 6 months follow-up (primary endpoint), evaluated by means of optical coherence tomography in terms of number of struts not re-endothelized or malapposed, after the implantation of three new generation stent: Cre8, Biomatrix and Xience. Further clinical follow-up will be performed to evaluate MACE at 12 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
