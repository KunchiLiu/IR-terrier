	<brief_summary>Cerebral saturation will be measured pre-hospital during an out-of hospital cardiac arrest with O3TM regional oximetry for Root速 (Masimo速). The O3TM regional oximetry for Root速 (Masimo速) is a device that can measure not only cerebral saturation but also end-tidal CO2 (capnography). Currently, end-tidal CO2 is already measured during Advanced Life Support following most recent European Resuscitation Guidelines but with another monitor. Until now it is the only parameter which may predict return of spontaneous circulation. Because of this, researchers want to measure both with the same device, which gives the investigators the opportunity and advantage to compare end-tidal CO2 and cerebral saturation very precisely. In this manner researchers want to investigate the predictive value of cerebral saturation and compare it end-tidal CO2.</brief_summary>
