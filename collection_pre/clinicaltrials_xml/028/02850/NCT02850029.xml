	<detailed_description>Aminoglycosides are commonly used antibiotics for difficult to treat infections. However, aminoglycoside administration varies widely among countries. The aim of this multicenter observational study is to provide up-to-date and comprehensive descriptive data on current aminoglycoside (tobramycin, amikacin or gentamicin) use in a large cohort of critically ill patients in different countries. The benefits expected from this study are a better understanding of worldwide aminoglycoside prescription variability in critically ill patients and to determine the risk factors of inadequate aminoglycoside dosing regimens.</detailed_description>
