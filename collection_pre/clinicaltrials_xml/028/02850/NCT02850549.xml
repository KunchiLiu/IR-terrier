	<brief_title>Preliminary Neck Classification Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess pain and function scores in patients with neck pain, with therapists specifically trained to implement a treatment based classification and matched interventions system. This study consisted of two phases to determine whether implementing a classification changed patient outcomes. In phase one, baseline data was obtained while physical therapists continued with their current neck pain evaluation and intervention approaches. The second phase involved educating the therapists in the neck classification system with the matched interventions. Pain and function outcomes were analyzed for 2 phases. The overall goal was to prospectively determine if the implementation of this classification system with matched interventions could enhance patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
