	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly prevalent condition among women that impairs quality of life, daily activities and sexual function. Latina women are disproportionally affected, with significantly higher rates of POP compared to women of other ethnicities. Decision aids have been used to increase patient knowledge prior to physician intervention and to facilitate informed patient participation on treatment selection. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a video decision aid prior to initial Urogynecology specialist evaluation of Latina women with POP in a border region university-affiliated medical clinic, will increase patient knowledge regarding the condition, decrease decisional conflict regarding selection among different treatment options and increase patient satisfaction with selected treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly prevalent condition among women that impairs quality of life, daily activities and sexual function. Latina women are disproportionally affected, with significantly higher rates of POP compared to women of other ethnicities. Counseling Latina women suffering from POP is often complex due to a variety of factors, including language barriers, limited patient understanding of anatomy and disease etiology and confusion regarding surgical versus nonsurgical treatment options. Decision aids have been used to increase patient knowledge prior to physician intervention and to facilitate informed patient participation on treatment selection. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a video decision aid prior to initial Urogynecology specialist evaluation of Latina women with POP will increase patient knowledge regarding the condition, decrease decisional conflict regarding selection among different treatment options and increase patient satisfaction with selected treatment, empowering these women as active participants in their healthcare instead of relying on provider input alone.</detailed_description>
