	<brief_summary>NO is an ubiquitous molecule contributing to many physiological functions such as vasodilation, immune and oxidative stress responses. NO production can be supplemented either by providing substrate to the NO-synthase (L-Arginine and L-Citruline) or by providing nitrate which can lead to NO. In the present project the investigators evaluate the effect of various acute and chronic oral NO precursors supplementation on exercise performance and responses in healthy young and older subjects.</brief_summary>
