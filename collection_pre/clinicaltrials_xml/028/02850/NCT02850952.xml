	<brief_title>Rehab MATRIX: Impact of a Nursing-Led Acuity Algorithm on Patient Safety and Healthcare Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The provision of efficient and conscientious nursing care is at the forefront of health care quality. Unfortunately, a lack of objectivity in the assignment of patients to nurses can lead to inequalities of care. Such inequalities translate to poor patient outcomes and diminished patient satisfaction. Furthermore, staff attrition related to nursing fatigue increases the cost of care due to a reliance on supplemental nurses. Rehab MATRIX is a patient assignment tool that objectively categorizes patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation based on nurse identified acuity variables.</detailed_description>
