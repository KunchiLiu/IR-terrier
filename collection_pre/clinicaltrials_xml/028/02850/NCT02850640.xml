	<brief_title>Cost and Medical Care of Patients With Advanced Serious Illness in Singapore (COMPASS) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will recruit 600 patients with advanced cancer, their primary informal caregivers and their treating physicians. Eligible patients will be recruited from study-sites in Singapore and will be followed until death. Patients and their consenting primary informal caregivers will be interviewed first at baseline and then every 3 months thereafter until the patient's death. A post-death interview with primary informal caregiver will be conducted at 8th week and 6 months after the patient's death. As the majority of the care during last year of life is provided by hospices, the eligible patients will be followed as they receive treatment and care at various hospices. Treating physicians of the patients will be invited to take part in the study. They will be asked to answer a survey conducted only once during the duration of the study. Data on medical expenditures incurred by a patient from diagnosis of advanced cancer until death will be collected. With patient consent, these data will be extracted every 6 months from the time of patient enrolment from relevant databases, including hospitals and hospices.</detailed_description>
