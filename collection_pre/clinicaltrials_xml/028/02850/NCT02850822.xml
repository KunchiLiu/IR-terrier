	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) appears to be an efficient tool to cure refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At present, the necessity of chemotherapy pre-transplantation for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion. In this study, the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy and no chemotherapy pre-transplantation in patients with RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Chemotherapy vs No Chemotherapy Pre-transplant to MDS Undergoing Allo-HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allo-HSCT appears to be an efficient tool to cure patients with MDS and AML secondary to MDS. Decitabine and/or chemotherapy pre-transplantation could reduce the blast cells in bone marrow and improve the complete remission rate. However, decitabine and/or chemotherapy had side effects and might increase treatment-related mortality. At present, the necessity of chemotherapy pre-transplantation for RAEB-1, RAEB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT remains in discussion. In this study, the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy and no chemotherapy pre-transplantation in patients with RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML secondary to MDS (bone marrow blast cells less than 50%) undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.</detailed_description>
