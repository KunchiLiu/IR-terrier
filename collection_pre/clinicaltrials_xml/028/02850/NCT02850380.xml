	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate spatial orientation in weightlessness as it manifests not in perception but rather in motor performance by direction and reaction time of flip switch. Hypotheses are that flip switch: 1. will be biased towards visual allocentric cues when those are available; 2. will be biased towards the egocentric reference when tactile cues are added; 3. will be dominated by egocentric cues when visual cues are not available; 4. will be delayed and more variable when confirmatory gravitational cues are absent; 5. will be faster and more reliable in absence of conflicting gravitational cues, and even more so when tactile cues are added; 6. The difference will be more pronounce when tested under Dual-task condition</brief_summary>
