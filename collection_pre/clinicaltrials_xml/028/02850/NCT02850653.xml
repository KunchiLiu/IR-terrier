	<brief_summary>Endophthalmitis is a serious eye infection of exogenous origin (post-operational, post-traumatic) or endogenous origin (metastatic). This is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. Each patient suffering from endophthalmitis must have immediately an ocular sampling, an intra ocular injection of antibiotics and a systemic antibiotic cover. The etiological treatment will be adapted according to the infectious agent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted PCR and Acute Endophthalmitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal of this prospective multi-centre trial is to improve the sensitivity and rapidity of the infectious agent's identification involved in endophthalmitis cases, particularly virulent species (like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae...) from ocular samples with the help of real-time PCR. This will help the ophthalmologist to be more efficient in accordance with the kind of the bacteria. Data will also enable to compare both PCR techniques used in this study. The secondary goal of the prospective study is to characterize the resistance of bacterial's species found during acute endophthalmitis with the antibiogram and by the study of resistance genes, to enable to correlate the resistance in vitro with the therapeutic response in vivo and get precious epidemiological data to adapt prophylactic antibiotic.</detailed_description>
