	<brief_summary>BIM deletion polymorphism might be associated with a poor clinical response to EGFR-TKIs in patients who had NSCLC with EGFR mutations. In the study, the investigators want to use EGFR-TKI with chemotherapy as first line treatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients with both EGFR mutation and BIM deletion polymorphism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BIM deletion polymorphism was a poor clinical response marker to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations. In the study, the investigators want to use EGFR-TKI with chemotherapy as 1 st treatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients with both EGFR mutation and BIM deletion polymorphism.</detailed_description>
