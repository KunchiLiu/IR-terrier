	<brief_summary>Relapsed and refractory T-cell lymphomas have been reported to have dismal outcomes. The role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been demonstrated in these patients. This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of busulfan plus fludarabine as conditioning therapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) in T- and NK/T-cell lymphoma patients who have relapsed or are refractory to previous chemotherapies including autologous transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Relapsed/Refractory T-, NK/T-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conditioning therapy - Busulfan (Busulfex®; Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC, Greenville, NC 27834) 3.2 mg/kg + 5% DW (the diluent quantity should be 10 times the volume of Busulfan, so that the final concentration of busulfan becomes approximately 0.5 mg/mL), intravenously for 3 hours once daily for 3 days (days -7 to -5) - Fludarabine (Fludarabine®, Zydus Hospira Oncology Private Ltd., Ahmedabad, India) 30 mg/m2 + 5% DW 100㎖, intravenously for over 1 hour once daily for 6 days (days -8 to -3) - Busulfan should be infused as soon as completion of fludarabine infusion Primary objective of this study I. To determine the 2-year progression-free survival of this reduced toxicity conditioning in relapsed or refractory T- and NK/T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma patients. Secondary endpoints I. To evaluate the response rate, engraftment rate and time to engraftment, 2-year overall survival, 100-days treatment-related mortality, regimen-related toxicities by CTCAE version 4.03, post-transplantation complications (HVOD, acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,CMV disease) of this reduced toxicity conditioning in relapsed or refractory T- and NK/T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma patients.</detailed_description>
