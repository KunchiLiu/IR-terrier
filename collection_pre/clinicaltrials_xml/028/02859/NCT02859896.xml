	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: Evaluate the effect of Hectorol® capsules in reducing elevated levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Secondary Objectives: - Evaluate the safety profile of Hectorol® capsules versus Rocaltrol® (calcitriol) capsules. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 after administration of Hectorol®.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Male or female aged 5 to 18 years old. Weight ≥15 kg. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 3 or 4 not on dialysis, defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 15 and 59 mL/min/1.73m^2 (established by Schwartz equation) at Week 2 visit. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) value &gt;100 pg/mL for CKD Stage 3 or &gt;160 pg/mL for CKD Stage 4, at Week 2 visit. Signed informed consent/assent form. Exclusion criteria: The patient has a serum 25hydroxyvitamin D level &lt;30 ng/mL at screening. The patient has a corrected calcium ≥10 mg/dL at the Week 2 visit. The patient has a serum phosphorus &gt;4.5 mg/dL for children 13 to 18 years of age; &gt;5.8 mg/dL for children 5 to 12 years of age at the Week 2 visit. The patient is anticipated to require maintenance hemodialysis within 3 months. The patient used cinacalcet or vitamin D sterol therapies such as calcitriol, doxercalciferol, or paricalcitol within 14 days prior to the baseline visit. The patient has a history of, or active, symptomatic heart disease within 12 months prior to the baseline (Week 0) visit. The patient currently has a chronic gastrointestinal disease (ie, malabsorption, severe chronic diarrhea, chronic ulcerative colitis, or ileostomy). The patient currently has primary hyperparathyroidism or has had a total parathyroidectomy. The patient has an active malignancy. The patient is unable to swallow a capsule in size similar to the Hectorol® and Rocaltrol® capsules. The patient has a history of sensitivity or allergy to doxercalciferol, calcitriol or other vitamin D analogs. The patient currently uses aluminum or magnesiumbased binders. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
