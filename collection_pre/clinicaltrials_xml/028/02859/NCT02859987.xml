	<brief_summary>Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) are intravascular devices used on patients undergoing IV therapy. Insertion of these catheters can be achieved either by using the anatomical landmarks for the veins or using ultrasound guidance. The guidelines recommend the use of ultrasound guidance for central venous access catheterization to facilitate central venous cannulation (CVC) and to reduce the risk of complications, but the scientific evidence is limited and heterogeneous. This is a prospective randomized clinical trial in adults patients requiring peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement for intravenous therapy. The principal aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guidance technique for successfully peripherally central venous catheterisation in the first attempt versus landmark method, in the context of PICC cannulation. Patients are randomized (1:1) in two groups: Control arm (landmark technique) versus Experimental group (ultrasound guidance technique). In order to avoid expected biases the investigators stratified the cases by difficulty for venous cannulation. Crossover was allowed if catheterisation could not be reached after two unsuccessful venipunctures, to prevent suffering of the patients and troubles in its care.</brief_summary>
