	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-122 in Combination With Nivolumab in Subjects With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will have received either none or no more than 2 previous systemic therapies. The dose escalation part of the study will explore 1 or more dose levels of CC-122 in combination with nivolumab using a modified dose escalation (3+3) design, followed by an expansion part once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined. A modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to identify the initial toxicity of the combination. Up to six subjects will be concurrently enrolled into a dose level. Decisions as to which dose level to enroll a new subject will be based on the number of subjects enrolled and evaluable, the number of subjects experiencing DLTs, and the number of subjects enrolled but who are not yet evaluable for toxicity in the current cohort at the time of new subject entry.</detailed_description>
