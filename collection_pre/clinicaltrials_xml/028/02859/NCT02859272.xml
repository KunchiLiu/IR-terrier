	<brief_summary>Female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is characterized by lack of vaginal support which enables pelvic organs to bulge into the vaginal walls and sometimes protrude through the genital hiatus. POP is more frequent among women who had their uterus removed. We would like to investigate whether suspension of the top of the vagina during remowal of the uterus prevents subsequent POP. The purpose of the PhD project is therefore to describe validity, terminology, and operative performance of used suspension methods during benign hysterectomy in Denmark. Further, to investigate these suspension methods' possible association with pain, life quality, sexuality, pessary use, and POP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaginal Vault Suspension During Benign Hysterectomy. A Questionnaire and Register-based Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2012 the investigators introduced codes of suspension methods to the Danish hysterectomy and hysteroscopy Database's registration chart. Consequently, validity of these codes needs to be ensured to enable their use in further research. Thereafter, the prevalence of Danish gynecologists' use of the different suspension methods will be investigated. A questionnaire will elucidate a possible relation between the suspension methods and pain, life quality and sexuality. Through a register based study in the National Patient Register the association between suspension methods and post hysterectomy POP and possible confounding will be investigated.</detailed_description>
