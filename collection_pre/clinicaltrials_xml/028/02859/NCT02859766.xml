	<mesh_term>Macular Degeneration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Presence of active subfoveal and/or juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to agerelated macular degeneration (AMD). History of or active periocular, ocular, or intraocular infection. Previous use of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) or any ocular antiangiogenic therapy (eg, aflibercept, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib), approved or investigational, for the treatment of neovascular AMD or previous therapeutic radiation in the region. Prior use of ocular antiVEGF agents for neovascular eye diseases other than AMD. Macular hemorrhage that involves the center of fovea in the study eye. Any prior or current systemic or ocular treatment (including surgery) for neovascular AMD in the study eye. Treatment with ocular corticosteroid injections or implants within 6 months in the study eye. History or evidence of eye surgery: Pars plana vitrectomy, Submacular surgery or other surgical interventions for AMD, Incisional glaucoma surgery or Cataract or refractive surgery within the last 3 months. AMD in the nonstudy eye that requires antiVEGF treatment.</criteria>
