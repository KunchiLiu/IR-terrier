	<brief_summary>Patients will receive oral SKLB1028 for 28 days to study the side effects, tolerability and best dose for treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia With FLT3 Mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of SKLB1028 in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is open-label, dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally administered SKLB1028 as a single agent given daily for 28 days. Cohorts of 3 patients receive SKLB1028 until dose limiting toxicity is noted (DLT). At that point cohorts will expand to 6 patients until MTD is determined. Patients not experiencing DLT or significant disease progression could continue receiving SKLB1028 up to 1 year.</detailed_description>
