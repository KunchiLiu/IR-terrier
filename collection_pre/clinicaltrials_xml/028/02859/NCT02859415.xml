	<brief_summary>Background: Mithramycin is a new cancer drug. In another study, people with chest cancer took the drug 6 hours a day for 7 straight days. Many of them had liver damage as a side effect. It was discovered that only people with certain genes got this side effect. Researchers want to test mithramycin in people who do not have those certain genes. &lt;TAB&gt; Objectives: To find the highest safe dose of mithramycin that can be given to people with chest cancer who have certain genes over 24 hours instead of spread out over a longer period of time. To see if mithramycin given as a 24-hour infusion shrinks tumors. Eligibility: People ages 18 and older who have chest cancer that is not shrinking with known therapies, and whose genes will limit the chance of liver damage from mithramycin Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Lung and heart function tests X-rays or scans of their tumor Liver ultrasound Tumor biopsy Participants will be admitted to the hospital overnight. A small plastic tube (catheter) will be inserted in the arm or chest. They will get mithramycin through the catheter over about 24 hours. If they do not have bad side effects or their cancer does not worsen, they can repeat the treatment every 14 days. Participants will have multiple visits for each treatment cycle. These include repeats of certain screening tests. After stopping treatment, participants will have weekly visits until they recover from any side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous 24h Intravenous Infusion of Mithramycin, an Inhibitor of Cancer Stem Cell Signaling, in People With Primary Thoracic Malignancies or Carcinomas, Sarcomas or Germ Cell Neoplasms With Pleuropulmonary Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Increasing evidence indicates that activation of stem cell gene expression is a common mechanism by which environmental carcinogens mediate initiation and progression of thoracic malignancies. Similar mechanisms appear to contribute to extra-thoracic malignancies that metastasize to the chest. Utilization of pharmacologic agents, which target gene regulatory networks mediating stemness may be novel strategies for treatment of these neoplasms. Recent studies performed in the Thoracic Epigenetics Laboratory, TGIB/NCI, demonstrate that under exposure conditions potentially achievable in clinical settings, mithramycin diminishes stem cell gene expression and markedly inhibits growth of lung and esophageal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings add to other recent preclinical studies demonstrating impressive anti-tumor activity of mithramycin in epithelial malignancies and sarcomas that frequently metastasize to the thorax. Primary Objectives: - Phase I component: To determine pharmacokinetics, toxicities, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mithramycin administered as a continuous 24hr infusion in patients with primary thoracic malignancies or carcinomas, sarcomas or germ cell tumors metastatic to the chest. - Phase II component: To determine objective response rates (CR+PR) of mithramycin administered as 24h intravenous infusions in patients with primary thoracic malignancies or carcinomas, sarcomas or germ cell tumors metastatic to the chest. Eligibility: - Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary malignancies involving lungs, esophagus, thymus, pleura, chest wall or mediastinum, or extra-thoracic malignancies metastatic to the chest. - Patients with germline SNPs in ABCB4 and ABCB11 that are associated with resistance to mithramycin-induced hepatotoxicity. - Patients must have had or refused first-line standard therapy for their malignancies. - Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0-2, without evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted; pCO2 less than 55 mm Hg and pO(2) greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg on room air ABG. - Patients must have a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 times upper limits of normal. Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Design: - Single arm Phase I dose escalation to define pharmacokinetics, toxicities and MTD. - Patient cohorts will receive 24h infusions of mithramycin targeting total doses currently administered during 7 daily six hour infusions at 30-50mcg/kg. - The 24 h infusions will be administered every 14 days (1 cycle). Four cycles will constitute one course of therapy. - Pharmacokinetics and toxicity assessment to define MTD will be assessed during cycle 1 of the first course of therapy. - Due to uncertainties regarding potential cumulative toxicities, no intra-patient dose escalation will be allowed. - Once MTD has been defined, patients will be stratified into two cohorts (primary thoracic malignancy vs neoplasm of non-thoracic origin metastatic to the chest) to determine clinical response rates at the MTD, using a Simon Optimal Two Stage Design for Phase II Clinical Trials targeting an objective response rate (RECIST) of 30%. - Following each course of therapy, patients will undergo restaging studies. Patients exhibiting objective response to therapy or stable disease by RECIST criteria will be offered an additional course of therapy. - Patients exhibiting disease progression will be removed from study. - Biopsies of index lesions will be obtained at baseline and on day 4 of the first and if feasible second cycle of therapy for analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints. An additional biopsy may be requested in patient exhibiting objective responses following one course of therapy.</detailed_description>
