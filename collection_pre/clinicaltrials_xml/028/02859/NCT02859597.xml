	<brief_title>Use of High Flow Nasal Cannula During Sedation of Morbidly Obese Patients in the Endoscopy Suite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The respiratory physiology of morbidly obese patients is altered due to restriction of the chest wall motion which decreases pulmonary compliance. In addition, anatomical changes lead to an increased incidence of airway obstruction in morbidly obese patients during periods of sedation. Both a typical nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula provide supplemental oxygen to the patients to prevent desaturation and hypoxia. However, the higher flow rates of high flow nasal cannulas are able to produce allows for washout of carbon dioxide from the respiratory system aiding with ventilation and creates 3 to 5 cm H2O of positive end expiration pressure which helps prevent collapse of the airway aiding with oxygenation.</detailed_description>
