	<brief_summary>Paradoxical Vocal Fold Motion Disorder (PVFMD), otherwise known as vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a laryngeal breathing disorder that has several potential causes. In some individuals, exertion is the predominant trigger. PVFMD can present like an asthma attack, but asthma medication is ineffective in treating it. The effects of untreated PVFMD can be devastating, leading to harmful, invasive, and ineffective treatments over a period of years. Numerous anecdotal reports indicate that several behavioral techniques, may be surprisingly effective and even curative. However, data are lacking. The form of respiratory retraining technique tested in the current study educates people with PVFMD about breathing and teaches them a number of breathing exercises specially designed to restore normal breathing patterns. This case series study will use a dyspnea perception questionnaire, patient daily logs, and physiological measurements of heart rate and breathing to examine whether this form of therapy can improve exertion-induced PVFMD symptoms.</brief_summary>
