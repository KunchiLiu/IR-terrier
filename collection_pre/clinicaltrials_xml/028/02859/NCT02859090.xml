	<brief_summary>It has recently been shown that various HSPs are strongly expressed in B lymphomas. Indeed, HSP90 stabilizes the protein Bcl-6 in diffuse large-cell B lymphomas. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 in vitro induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells (Cerchietti et al. Nat. Medicine, 2009, 1369-1376). In addition, HSP110 is strongly expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and targeting this HSP at the cell surface using specific antibodies could constitute a future therapy (Zappasodi et al. Blood, 2011, 4421-4430). Despite the importance of these proteins in the development of lymphomas, their expression and their role in the activation of normal B lymphocytes and the normal development of germinal centres is not known. The expression of Heat shock proteins should vary among the different B lymphocyte populations present in the tonsils (na√Øve B cells, memory B cells, germinal centre B cells). The aim of this study is to establish an expression profile for heat shock proteins in populations of B lymphocytes in human tonsils</brief_summary>
