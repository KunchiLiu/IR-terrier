	<brief_summary>This study will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying anorexia in persons with Crohn's disease flare-ups. The practical spin-off from this research is potentially very important for the management of nutritional disorders associated with the disease by guiding diets towards foods that correspond to patients' preferences and/or to modified tastes. In addition, the results could lead to the identification of sensory markers that herald an inflammatory flare-up of the disease.</brief_summary>
