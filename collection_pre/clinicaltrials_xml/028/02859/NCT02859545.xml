	<brief_summary>Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and costly health care problem. Yet, little is known about the optimal ways for health care providers and family members to respond to the distress expressed by people with chronic pain. The aim of the current study is to compare two models of responsiveness to identify responses that result in better functioning and adjustment. An experimental design will be used to test the extent to which emotional validation (e.g., an empathic response to distress) increases or decreases pain behaviors during physical activity. Romantic partners of individuals with chronic pain will be randomly assigned to receive validation or control training. Following training, people with chronic pain and their partners will engage in a discussion about pain and complete household tasks to examine the effects of partner training on communication, pain intensity, and pain behavior. Additionally, each individual in the couple will complete self-report measures after the discussion, after the household tasks, and one-month following the laboratory visit.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Romantic couples who are married or living with each other for 6 months or longer. One individual in the couple must have chronic back pain, lasting 3 months or longer. Participants may have additional pain sites, as long as they also have chronic back pain. The individual with chronic pain must have an average pain intensity of 3 or greater on an 11point scale (from 0: no pain to 10: worst pain imaginable) The individual with chronic pain must have an average pain interference of 3 or greater on an 11point scale (from 0: does not interfere to 10: completely interferes) One or both individuals in the couple are unable to speak, read, or write in English. Both individuals in the couple have chronic pain. One or both individuals in the couple have widespread pain (e.g., fibromyalgia) Couples in which neither individual has pain that has lasted 3 months or longer, or couples in which only one individual has pain that has lasted less than 3 months.
