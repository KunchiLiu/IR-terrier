	<brief_summary>Single-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, single ascending dose study. The study will comprise of 2 parts: Part A (Cohorts 1 and 2); Part B (Cohorts 3 to 8).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of AK002 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study. Blood sampling for PK and PD analysis will be also collected during the course of the study. Up to approximately 48 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be screened from -28 days prior to dose administration. Participants will be admitted to the unit on Day -1 and will remain confined to the clinic until completion of Day 4 procedures. On Day 1, participants will receive a single dose of AK002 or placebo and complete study procedures. Participants will return to the clinic for follow up at Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 112 or end of study (EOS) visit.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Normal healthy volunteers, age at screening 18 to 65 years, inclusive. 2.

Participants must weigh at least 50 kg and have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 Inclusive. 4. Participants must have clinical laboratory values within &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) as specified by the testing laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator. 5.

The participant has any underlying physical or psychological medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make it unlikely that the participant will complete the study. 3. The participant has evidence of any medical or surgical disease or condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might compromise the haematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, skeletal, or central nervous system; or other conditions that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of AK002, or would place the participant at increased risk. 4. The participant has a history of cancer, except basal cell carcinoma which has been in remission for at least 5 years prior to Day 1 5. Use of any new drugs (including prescription and overthecounter drugs and herbal supplements) within 1 week or 5 halflives (whichever is longer), prior to administration of study drug. 6. Use of any prescription medication or neutraceuticals within 30 days of randomization. 7. Use of overthe counter medication (with the exception of paracetamol), vitamin supplements, or herbal medicines within 7 days of randomization. 8. Participants who initiated immunotherapy 90 days or more before the Screening visit and have been on a monthly regimen for allergy prevention or treatment may be considered for inclusion, 9. Use of immunosuppressants, oral corticosteroids, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta blockers within 2 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer), prior to Screening. 10. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality or ECG. 11. The participant has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of AK002. 12. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500/microliter. 13.
