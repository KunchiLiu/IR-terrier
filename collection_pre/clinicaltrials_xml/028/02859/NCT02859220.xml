	<brief_summary>This study included 80 patients with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis treatment to evaluate two techniques for the determination of parathyroid hormone (PTH) Objective: To evaluate whether the monitoring of hemodialysis patients by measurement of PTH 1-84 Complete (CAP =cyclase activating PTH) and the ratio (1-84 PTH (CAP)/7-84 PTH (CIP = cyclase inactivating PTH) with kit "Duo PTH Immunoradiometric Scantibodies" allows an improvement in the therapeutic management of abnormal calcium and phosphate, with a better match to the targets of current international recommendations, followed by the conventional intact PTH assay. Primary endpoint: For each patient, a score will be awarded based on the number of criteria (including calcium, phosphorus and calcium phosphate product) in the target international guidelines :0-1-2 or 3. The primary endpoint will be the average scores in both groups at the beginning and the end of the study, Main secondary endpoints: - Changes in the number of patients responding to international guidelines for each of the three parameters studied (serum phosphate, corrected calcium, phosphorus product) in the 2 groups, - Evolution of Elecsys intact PTH Roche in the 2 groups, - Salaries and changes in the number of drugs to normalize the phospho-calcium balance in each group received, - cardiovascular events (morbidity and cardiovascular mortality), - Total mortality. Statistical analysis: This is a randomized, two parallel arms. The investigators will compare the average number of criteria on calcium and phosphate in the target according to a Mann-Whitney. The analysis will be performed with the software Splus.</brief_summary>
