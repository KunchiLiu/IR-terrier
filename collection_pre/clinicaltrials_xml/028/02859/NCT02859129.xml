	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the 2-Way Interaction Between Multiple Doses of Epanova™ and a Single Dose of Rosuvastatin (Crestor®)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PK of rosuvastatin will be monitored following single-dose administration of rosuvastatin with and without multiple-dose administration of 4 g Epanova™ for 13 consecutive days in order to detect a possible interaction between rosuvastatin and Epanova™. The PK of total EPA, total DHA and total EPA+DHA will also be monitored following multiple-dose administration of Epanova™ with and without single-dose administration of 40 mg rosuvastatin. A single dose administration for rosuvastatin has been judged sufficient to yield plasma concentrations that will be detectable with an adequate validated analytical method and characterize adequately the PK of rosuvastatin.</detailed_description>
