	<brief_summary>The coloscopy is considered as the gold standard for screening and resection of colorectal adenomas. However the literature reports that the rate of omitted adenoma is still high (24 to 41%). The development of the FUSE system (Endochoice, USA) allows a larger field of view with a projection onto 3 screens (330° vision). A pilot study and a randomized multicentre has demonstrated the feasibility with a significant improvement of the rate of detected adenomas. This first study in France concerning this technology has the objectives to demonstrate the feasibility in France, the safety and to compare the rate of detected adenomas with data of the literature.</brief_summary>
