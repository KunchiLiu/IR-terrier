	<brief_summary>To date, the majority of studies that have evaluated the efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions in cirrhotic patients and compared its efficacy with that of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for local recurrence and survival have been retrospective. There have been no prospective randomized studies comparing percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) with RFA for ablated tumour volume, the response after one session, local recurrence rates in the first year, complication rates and survival at 3 and 5 years for HCC lesions &gt; 2 cm in patients with Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis. The hypothesis the investigators wish to explore is that though the 2 methods are equivalent for lesions ≤ 2 cm, MWA could show better efficacy with a similar risk for lesions &gt; 2 cm and for lesions close to vessels ≥ 3 mm in diameter, as shown in retrospective studies.</brief_summary>
