	<brief_summary>Today, we know that olfactogustatory alterations occur in cirrhotic patients before the liver transplant but no study has been conducted to show eventual disturbances after the transplantation able to explain modifications in eating behaviour. In parallel, the metabolic status, itself dependent on liver metabolism, influences food preferences and is modified after the transplantation as the liver recovers its ability to store glycogen, but is not able to inform the brain as the afferent nerve impulses have been suppressed. The innovative aspect of this project is to provide information on the importance of the liver in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The results of this study will improve our understanding of eating behaviour and olfactogustatory sensitivity and allow us to orient liver transplant patients towards appropriate diets.</brief_summary>
