	<brief_title>Continuous Versus Intermittent Oxytocin for Induction of Labor: A Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the continuous oxytocin group, traditional treatment of oxytocin used at a starting dose of 1-2 mIU/min and the dose was increased by 2 mIU/min at every 15 minutes until regular contractions obtained at a rate of 3-5 contractions in a 10-minute period. The maximum dose of oxytocin was 40 mIU/min and oxytocin was administered until delivery. In the intermittent group, oxytocin was discontinued when cervical dilation was 5 cm and 2 hours after discontinuation oxytocin was reused at a starting dose of 1-2 mIU/min and was increased as the same protocol used for continuation oxytocin group.</detailed_description>
