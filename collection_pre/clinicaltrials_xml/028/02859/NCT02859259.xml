	<criteria>1. Signed Informed Consent 2. Target Population: Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal in medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital sign measurements, 12lead ECG measurements, , and clinical laboratory test results. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 32.0 kg/mÂ². 3. Subject Reenrollment: This study permits the reenrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pretreatment failure (i.e., subject has not been randomized/ has not been treated). If reenrolled, the subject must be reconsented. 4. Age: Males and Females, ages 18 or age of majority to 50 years, inclusive. 5. Reproductive Status: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum/urine (urine test not allowed at screening and Day 1 of Period 1) pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. Women must not be breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception (Appendix 1) for the duration of treatment with study drug plus 5 halflives of study drug (60 hours) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 33 days posttreatment completion. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug plus 5 halflives of study drug (60 hours). In addition, male subjects must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time. Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Women of childbearing potential who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from contraceptive requirements, and still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section. 1. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases: History of any chronic or acute illness, gastrointestinal disease, gastrointestinal surgery within less than 4 weeks of dosing, blood donation within 4 weeks of dosing, blood transfusion within 4 weeks of dosing, smoking within less than 12 months prior to dosing, alcohol abuse, inability to tolerate oral medication, or inability to be venipunctured. Any other sound medical, psychiatric and/or social reason as determined by the investigator. 2. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings: Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs measurements, ECGs, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population. 3. Exposure to any investigational drug or placebo within 4 weeks of study drug administration.</criteria>
