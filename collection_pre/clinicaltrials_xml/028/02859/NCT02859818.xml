	<brief_summary>Introduction: Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) is the key of the interdisciplinary management of type 1 diabetes for adolescents, favoring their adherence and improving their quality of life and metabolic control. Six pediatric diabetes teams have engaged in action research to build a regional ETP program based on social cognitive theory of Bandura, assuming that the learning strategies of theory, applied in ETP program, should strengthen self-efficacy of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, which could induce an improvement behaviors adherence, quality of life and physiological profile of participants about 6 months post-inclusion in the program. Aims: The main objective is to describe the evolution over 6 months of self-efficacy in a cohort of adolescents with type 1 diabetes who followed a therapeutic education program based on social cognitive theory of Bandura in region PACA (ETPACAP program). Secondary objectives are to describe the evolution of 6 months of glycemic control, behavior of adherence, quality of life and other components of social cognitive theory for this population, to explore the effects of socio-cognitive profile on adherence, quality of life and glycemic control among adolescents with type 1 diabetes followed this program. Method: A prospective multicenter cohort study of adolescents with type 1 diabetes who participated in ETPACAP program, consisting of three components: - A quantitative component: collection and analysis of changes over 6 months of self-efficacy, adherence, quality of life and HbA1c levels (ANOVA repeated measures); - A qualitative component: interviews with 32 participants at M0, M3 and M6 on the socio-cognitive factors according to Bandura (analysis continues theming); - An integrative component, exploring the effects of the components of social cognitive theory on adherence, glycemic control and quality of life of adolescents with type 1 diabetes cohort. Expected results: This research is expected to bring new knowledge about the ETP programs and the adolescent cohort studied to make an improvement and adjustment of educational sessions relevant to the needs and expectations of this population.</brief_summary>
