	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - Phase I: To evaluate safety and tolerability of isatuximab in Japanese patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. - Phase II: To evaluate efficacy of isatuximab at recommended dose and to further evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of isatuximab in Japanese patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety including immunogenicity of isatuximab. The severity, frequency and incidence of all adverse events will be assessed. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab in the proposed dosing schedule. - To assess the efficacy using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria. - To assess the relationship between baseline CD38 receptor density on multiple myeloma cells and efficacy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of up to 21 days, the treatment period consisting of 28 day cycles and a follow-up period. Treatment with isatuximab may continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event or other reason for discontinuation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Males or females, age 20 years or older. Patient must have a known diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma. Patients must have received at least 3 prior lines of therapies OR Patients whose disease is double refractory to an Immunomodulatory Drug (IMiD) and a Proteasome Inhibitor (PI). Subject must have been responsive (ie, minimal response [MR] or better) to at least one prior line of therapy. Refractory to the most recently received IMiD or PI included therapy. Patients with measurable disease defined as at least one of the following: IgG Type: Serum Mprotein ≥1 g/dL (≥10 g/L); IgA and D Type: Serum Mprotein, quantification should be performed; Urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 hours. Patients with a Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2. Exclusion criteria: Patients treated with any antiCD38 agent. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 5 years prior to enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or lowrisk prostate cancer after curative therapy. Prior anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapy) within 21 days prior to the first drug infusion unless otherwise specified below: Alkylating agents (eg, Melphalan) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Steroids treatment (eg, prednisone &gt;10 mg/day orally or equivalent except patients being treated for adrenal insufficiency/replacement therapy or treated for inhalation corticosteroids) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participated in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Patients treated with systemic radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment OR Localized radiation therapy within 1 week prior to the first dose of study treatment. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Any toxicity Grade ≥2 (excluding alopecia, neutropenia or neuropathy) related to any prior anticancer therapy according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Neuropathy Grade ≥3 or painful peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥2. History of significant cardiovascular disease unless the disease within the past 6 months is wellcontrolled. Previously received an allogenic stem cell transplant. Diagnosed CrowFukase (POEMS) syndrome OR plasma cell leukemia. Patients with known or suspected amyloidosis. Patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia OR Multiple myeloma IgM subtype. Patients with active infection. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C viral infection. Serious psychiatric illness, active alcoholism, or drug addiction that may hinder or confuse followup evaluation. Any severe underlying medical conditions including presence of laboratory abnormalities, which could impair the ability to participate in the study or the interpretation of its results. Hypersensitivity or history of intolerance to boron or mannitol, sucrose, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt) and polysorbate 80 or any of the components of study therapy that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit further treatment with these agents.
