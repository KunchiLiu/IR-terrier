	<brief_summary>The breast MRI is used in the preoperative scenario to evaluate the extension of a newly diagnosed breast cancer and to screen the contralateral breast. The scan consists of a series of images taken after the use of intravascular contrast media that may detect areas of enhancement that look malignant, but are actually benign tissue, producing a false positive result. The investigators aim to evaluate a novel MRI sequence of images that does not use contrast, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Addition of DTI sequence does not add significantly to the time of standard breast MRI exam. This novel technique provides improved detection of tissue microstructure and is able to differentiate malignant from benign tumor. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that DTI may decrease the false positive rate when compared with standard dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.</brief_summary>
