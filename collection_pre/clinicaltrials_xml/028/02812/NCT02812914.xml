	<brief_summary>Greater efforts are needed to bring affordable, clean stoves and adaptive behavioral strategies to the millions of households worldwide that continue to burn solid cooking fuels using inefficient stoves. Two of the leading causes of infant mortality, preterm birth and pneumonia, are associated with high exposures to household air pollution during pregnancy and early infancy. The proposed study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of an introduced liquid petroleum gas stove, complemented by two alternative approaches to delivering tailored behavioral change interventions, among pregnant women and their neonates.</brief_summary>
