	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and imatinib mesylate work in treating patients with melanoma with c-KIT mutation or amplification that has spread to nearby tissue or other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and imatinib mesylate may work better in treating patients with melanoma with c-KIT mutation or amplification that has spread to nearby tissue or other places in the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Imatinib in Patients With Locally Advanced/Metastatic Melanoma With c-KIT Mutation/Amplification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the best overall response rate (BORR = complete response + partial response) of the combination of pembrolizumab and imatinib for treatment of melanomas harboring c-Kit mutation or amplification. II. To evaluate the safety and adverse effect profile of the combination of pembrolizumab and imatinib in patients with melanomas harboring c-KIT aberrations (mutations or amplifications). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the median time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assessment of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L)1 expression in melanoma patients with c-KIT aberrations before and after combined therapy. OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and imatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 9 weeks for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage III melanoma inoperable/not amenable to local treatment or stage IV melanoma. Patient must have either mutation or amplification of cKIT gene tested by commercially available molecular or gene sequencing techniques Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial Have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion; newlyobtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on day 1; subjects for whom newlyobtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the sponsor Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500 /mcL Platelets &gt;= 100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL or &gt;= 5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) or measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) &gt;= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X ULN or direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 X ULN OR =&lt; 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin &gt;= 2.5 mg/dL International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =&lt; 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication; subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment; individuals who are receiving systemic steroid therapy at a stable dose less than or equal to 10mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent will be permitted to participate Has a known history of active TB (bacillus tuberculosis) Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab, imatinib, or any of its excipients Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy and/or alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study Note: if subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids at a dose exceeding 10mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment; this exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids exceeding 10 mg prednisone per day or its equivalent, or immunosuppressive drugs);
