	<brief_summary>Does baseline impedance measured during the landmark phase of esophageal High resolution impedance manometry HRIM correlates with direct mucosal impedance measurement and discriminates GERD from non GERD patients?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HRIM vs Mucosal Impedance in GERD Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Rochester for a clinically indicated high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM), 24 hour impedance pH (MII-pH) study, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be recruited. Gastroesophageal reflux will be defined as a total 24 hour esophageal acid exposure time ≥5% regardless of concomitant Proton Pump inhibitor (PPI) use. A negative 24 hour MII-pH study will be defined as an acid exposure time ≤2% off PPI therapy or ≤1% if on PPI therapy.</detailed_description>
