	<brief_summary>Dynamic indices of preload dependence (such as stroke volume variability -SVV , pulse pressure variability - PPV and plethysmograph variability index - PVI ) are reportedly predictive of the response to vascular filling in sedated, mechanically ventilated patients. However, the influence of the sedation depth on these dynamic indices has never been evaluated.</brief_summary>
