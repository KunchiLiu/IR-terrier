	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe disease with high mortality. Our previous study have demonstrated that peripheral infusion of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) weekly for 4 times is safe and improves 24 weeks survival rate of ACLF patients. In this study, we intend to assess the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood derived MSCs for HBV-related ACLF patients.</brief_summary>
