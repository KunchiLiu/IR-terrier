	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance has been reported in 44-86% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is the source of considerable stress for the affected individual and family. Sleep plays a role in development and learning processes; thus, the appropriate treatment of sleep disturbance is paramount to optimal outcomes. The empirical base for treatments to address sleep in ASD is sparse, despite wide use of pharmacologic agents such as clonidine (CLN) to target sleep disturbance. A randomized, controlled pilot investigation of CLN for sleep disturbance in children with ASD will allow investigators to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a much larger multisite trial to address the general lack of systematic data available to guide practitioners. Subjects will be 16 children, ages 6-14 years, inclusive, with sleep disturbance and ASD. This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled (PBO), parallel groups study will test the efficacy of CLN following a brief sleep hygiene intervention. Outcome measures include: informant completed sleep questionnaires, daytime behavior questionnaires, and actigraphy. Biomarkers for medication response will include galvanic skin response and skin temperature. Side effects will be monitored throughout the study.</brief_summary>
