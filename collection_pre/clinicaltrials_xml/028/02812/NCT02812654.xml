	<brief_summary>Prospective phase II study. Patients will be submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cT) and hypo fractionated radiotherapy (hRT) following by surgery. The remain viable cells will be analyzed and the patients whithin less than 30% will receive more 3 cycles of cT. All patients have deep high grade soft tissue sarcoma of extremity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective phase II non controlled study. Staging: All patients will be submitted to a local Magnetic Resonance (MR), Chest Tomography (CT) and Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET CT) previous to treatment. After the first cT cycle a new PET CT will be provided and one more at the end of the neoadjuvant treatment. Chemotherapy: cT neoadjuvant: Doxorubicin 75mg/m2 (cycles 1,2 and 3), and ifosfamide 9 g/m2 (cycles 1 and 3). Radiotherapy: RT 25 Gy / 5 x 500 cGy/day, beginning at Cycle 2/Day1. The surgery will be performed after 4-6 weeks from cycle 3. The remain of viable cells in surgical specimen will be analyzed and whether the the percentage value is less than 30% the patient will receive more 3 cycles of cT. A boost of RT is indicated if margins are considered R1 (microscopic positive margin).</detailed_description>
