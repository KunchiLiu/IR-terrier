	<brief_summary>The principal objective is to show noninferiority of nebulized salbutamol through the high flow nasal system moistened AIRVO â„¢ 2 in terms of reversibility of airflow obstruction compared to nebulization by the usual method (spray mask).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Nebulization Bronchodilators Under High Nasal Flow Humidified</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, comparative, non inferiority study between two nebulization strategies bronchodilators, one according to the method tested namely the spray - in across the top humidified nasal flow system and the other according to a customary procedure, through a mask. A third arm will be evaluated (control arm) to overcome a possible own bronchodilator effect of high flow nasal humidified.</detailed_description>
