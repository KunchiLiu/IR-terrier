	<brief_summary>Monitoring the bispectral index (BIS) as a peri-operative hemodynamic tool appears to be justified by the agreement between various clinical situations in which BIS monitoring appears to be of value: the prognosis in traumatic head injury, the diagnosis of brain death , and the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism. The current controversy concerning the "triple low" state reinforces the need for an accurate study in this field. Furthermore, the recent review by Bidd argues in this sense.</brief_summary>
