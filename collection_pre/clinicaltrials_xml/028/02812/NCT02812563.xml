	<brief_title>Familial Analysis of Keratoconus Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keratoconus is a common bilateral progressive corneal ectatic disease causing visual impairment by inducing irregular astigmatism and corneal opacities. This disorder typically begins during teenage years, progresses until the age of 30 to 40 years and, in severe forms, may need a corneal transplantation. Currently, keratoconus has not known etiopathogenesis, and it is difficult to detect subclinical forms. Several risk factors seem to be implied, environmental and genetic : the risk of keratoconus in case of familial history of keratoconus isn't well known at that time, but seems to be important to consider to promote screening and follow up of patient with a familial history of keratoconus (KC).</detailed_description>
