	<brief_summary>This study aims to understand the impact of time-of-the day on human myocardial tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion by exploring atrial myocardium biopsied during cardiac surgery. Patients scheduled for non-urgent cardiac surgery (coronary artery by-pas graft and/or aortic valve replacement) will be assigned to a morning or an afternoon cardiac surgery based on randomization. Myocardial biopsies will be explored in ex vivo conditions mimicking ischemia-reperfusion.</brief_summary>
