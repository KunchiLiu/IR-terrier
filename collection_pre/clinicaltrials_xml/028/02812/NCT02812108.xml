	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Analysis for Intracranial Aneurysms Recanalization After Endovascular Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the rapid development of endovascular technique, endovascular treatment has become the first line treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Compared to microsurgical clipping, less invasive and lower morbidity have been shown after endovascular treatment. However, the aneurysms recanalization is the drawback of such modality. It has been reported that many factors, including complete initial embolization, stent assisted coiling, dense packing and flow diverter, could reduce recanalization rate. Larger size, wide neck, rupture status and intraluminal thrombosis are reported as risk factors of aneurysm recanalization. However, no analysis of hemodynamic risk factors affecting the aneurysm recanalization has been conducted in a large prospective series of patients. Hemodynamics is reported to play an important role in aneurysm initiation, growth and rupture. Previous studies have showed that the hemodynamics is associated with outcomes of aneurysms after endovascular treatment. High wall shear stress and flow velocity are risk factors of aneurysm recanalization. However, the relationship between hemodynamics and aneurysm outcomes is still unclear. To explore the hemodynamic predictors of aneurysm recanalization is of great value for clinical practice. Hemodynamic analysis for intracranial aneurysms recanalization after endovascular treatment (HARET) is a prospective trial designed to collect a large series of patients with aneurysms treated endovascularly to analyze hemodynamic factors that affect aneurysm recanalization.</detailed_description>
