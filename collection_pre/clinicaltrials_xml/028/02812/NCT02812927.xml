	<brief_summary>This study compared two methods of insulin infusion by syringe pumps to assess the impact of medical devices on the glycaemic variability in patients under IIT in ICU. The main objective of the study was to show the superiority of the infusion system which permitted to dedicate a line for the insulin administration on the "standard" installation in terms of control of glycaemic variability.</brief_summary>
