	<brief_summary>A sample of plasma and whole blood will be obtained at 3 time points (pre-procedural, early post-procedural and at hospital discharge). Test for platelet reactivity (LTA, light transmittance aggregometry and Elisa PRI, Platelet reactivity index) and for multimeric VWF (von Willebrand factor) analyses will be performed at the time of blood sampling. Aliquots of plasma will be stored and frozen for further analyses</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Collection and Registry of Patients Who Will Have a TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two major objectives: - To correlate changes in VWF and platelet reactivity after TAVR with clinical outcomes - To correlate changes in VWF and platelet reactivity with antithrombotic regimens after TAVR (direct anticoagulants apixaban versus standard of care, ie Vitamin K antagonist or antiplatelet therapy).</detailed_description>
