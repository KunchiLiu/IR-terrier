	<brief_summary>Melasma is an acquired form of hyperpigmentation that is seen most commonly on the face, characterized by symmetrically distributed brown patches of variable darkness. The cosmetically unattractive nature of this disorder has been shown to negatively affect a patient's quality of life. Unfortunately, the treatment of melasma is challenging and often disappointing. Treatment includes a combination approach with strict sun protection, cosmetic camouflage, topical lightening agents, laser therapy, and chemical peels. Today, the investigators define chemical peeling as the application of chemical exfoliating agents to the skin, which results in destruction of one or more parts of the epidermis and/or dermis with subsequent regrowth of these layers. Chemical peels are divided into superficial (light), medium, and deep; with superficial peels being the focus of this study. Superficial peels penetrate into the epidermis only, and are a safe, widely available and well-tolerated treatment modality. These peeling agents include glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, salicylic acid and trichloroacetic acid, each with unique properties. For instance, alpha-hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid, are known to be hydrophilic, whereas salicylic acid is lipophilic and anti-inflammatory. As each peeling agent has unique properties, it can be hypothesized that the combined use of these agents may result in better clinical outcomes than the use of an agent alone. Prior studies have demonstrated that the combined use of these peels are safe and effective in improving a variety of skin conditions including acne scars, hyperpigmentation, and infraorbital dark circles. Overall however, studies on the combined use of these chemical peels in the treatment of melasma are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to conduct a controlled comparison of the efficacy and safety of a combination peel (glycolic acid and salicylic acid) as compared to glycolic acid peel alone in the treatment of melasma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female and males aged 18 or older Subjects with melasma on both sides of the face (forehead or cheek). Subjects in general good health Female of childbearing age will be on a reliable form of contraception during the course of treatment other than oral contraceptive pills or hormonal intrauterine device. Subjects must be willing to sign consent, answer questionnaires, comply with all clinical visits, and use sunscreen and sunprotection. Subjects must be willing to not apply other treatment options for melasma during the course of the study Subjects suffering from other pigmentation disorders.

Subjects with history of abnormal scaring Subjects who cannot communicate with investigators or who are unlikely to cooperate. Subjects in a situation in which in the opinion of the investigators, may interfere with optimal participation in the study. Subjects who have used chemical peels, microdermabrasion or facial laser treatments in the past 3 months.</criteria>
