	<brief_summary>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a recently discovered phosphaturic hormone produced by osteocytes. It is involved in phosphate-calcium metabolism (via its phosphaturic action and inhibition of 1,25-OH vitamin D). There are no published studies on the role of FGF23 in undernourished anorexic adolescents taking oral phosphorus supplements.</brief_summary>
