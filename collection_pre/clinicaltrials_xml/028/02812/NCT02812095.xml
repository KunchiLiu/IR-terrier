	<brief_summary>Refeeding is an extracorporeal stool transport from the proximal stoma end to the distal end of stoma. Refeeding may be beneficial in preventing malabsorption, electrolyte imbalance, cholestasis and atrophy of the distal intestine. Investigators are focused on evaluating the efficacy and safety of the practice of refeeding in preterm infants with enterostomy. Clinical data including weight gain, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) usage, and other laboratory findings will be collected. Serial citrulline levels during refeeding procedure and pathologic specimens of bowel (at the time of stoma closure) will be collected for evaluating bowel adaptation.</brief_summary>
