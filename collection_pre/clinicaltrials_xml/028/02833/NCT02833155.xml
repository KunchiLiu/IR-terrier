	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of entinostat administered orally as a single agent in a weekly dosing schedule. Additionally, this study will characterize the pharmacokinetics parameters in Chinese postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. And to define the profile of adverse events, including laboratory parameters in these subjects</brief_summary>

Patients have known central nervous system metastasis except patients who have terminated steroid treatment for brain metastasis or spinal cord compression with remain disease stable for at least 1 month. Previous treatment with entinostat or any other histone deacetylase inhibitor (Valproic acid, Chidamide etc). Known allergy to any ingredients of entinostat and other drugs in the same class. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding (premenopausal). For women of childbearing potential, agreement to use a medically approved contraception measures (such as the intrauterine device (IUD), birth control pills or condoms) and to continue its use for the duration of study treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Had received chemotherapy/radiotherapy or other anticancer therapy during the study or within 4 weeks of start of study treatment. Patients must completely recovered from all adverse events due to previous agents administered before 4 weeks (except alopecia). Major surgery within 28 days of start of study treatment. Patients have serious or uncontrolled systemic disease (such as severe liver dysfunction, severe renal dysfunction, poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled acute infections). Unstable or decompensated respiratory or cardiovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease (including diabetic vascular disease), or organ transplantation. Received potent CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 inducer and/or inhibitor (including but not limited following drug: ketoconazole, rifampicin, atazanavir, Clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, rifabutin, phenytoin, Carbamazepine and phenobarbital). Patients with another active cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia （CIN）/cervical carcinoma in situ] or melanoma insitu). Prior history of other cancer is allowed, as long as there is no active disease within the prior 5 years.
