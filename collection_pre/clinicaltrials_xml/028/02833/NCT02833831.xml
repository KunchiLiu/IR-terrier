	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of ALS-008176 on Cardiac Repolarization Interval in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two-part Phase 1 study consisting of a dose escalation part (Part 1) and a TQT part (Part 2), performed in two separate panels (Panels 1 and 2). Panel 1 will be a double blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo controlled dose escalation study in healthy participants to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ALS-008176 after administration of single doses of 1500 milligrams (mg), 2500 mg and 3000 mg under fasted conditions. The final dose to be used in the Panel 2 will be determined based on the results of this dose escalation part. An interim analysis will be conducted on Panel 1 to select the dose for Panel 2. Panel 2 will be a double blind, double dummy, randomized, 3 period crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence), placebo and positive controlled study to evaluate the effect of ALS-008176 on the QT/QTc interval in healthy participants. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

If there are abnormalities the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the Investigator Participants must have normal values for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (&lt;= 1.0*upper limit of laboratory normal range [ULN]) Participants has a history of current clinically significant medical illness including (but not limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results Participants with one or more laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined in the
