	<brief_summary>There are few scientific reports on preterm infants with birth weights between 1500 and 2000g. Adequate and properly balanced supply of nutrients believed to better growth and cognitive development in this patient group, and optimized nutrition is an important part of treatment There is a need for more studies that can provide knowledge of growth and weight development in preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants with a birth weight between 1500 and 2000g.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Intensive Dietary Intervention in Children With Birth Weight Between 1500 and 2000 g</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been little focus, at least there are few scientific reports on preterm infants with birth weights between 1500 and 2000g, at least in Norway. Studies have shown the benefit of enhanced protein and energy supplements in very low birth weight infants (VLBW, birth weight &lt; 1500g), regarding growth and neurodevelopment . Adequate and properly balanced supply of nutrients is believed to give better growth and cognitive development in premature infants with slightly higher birth weight, i.e between 1500 and 2000g (1). In an intervention study of VLBW children at four Norwegian hospitals we found lower supply of energy and protein than international recommendations (2). A larger proportion of premature children were stunted growth (weight below 10 percentile for age) during hospitalization. Although this applies to preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g, this may also be the case for larger premature patients. More studies that can provide knowledge of growth rate, weight and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants are warranted. This study examines those with birth weight between 1500 and 2000g. Overall, this may provide new and useful knowledge that can help to optimize the nutrition to preterm and SGA infants with a this range of birth weights</detailed_description>
