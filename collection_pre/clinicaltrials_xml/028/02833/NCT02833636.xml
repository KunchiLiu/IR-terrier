	<brief_summary>The age, creatinine, and ejection fraction (ACEF) score has been used to evaluate the clinical prognostic to patients who underwent PCI. However, it is not known if ACEF score could evaluate the prognostic of recanalization of non-infarct-related coronary arteries (non-IRA) chronic total occlusions (CTO) in patients who successful underwent primary PCI. The objectivity of current study was to assess the prognostic value of ACEF score in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with non-IRA CTO after successful primary PCI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Value of The Age, Creatinine, and Ejection Fraction Score for Non-infarct-related Chronic Total Occlusion Revascularization After Primary Percutaneous Intervention in Acute ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients: A Retrospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Among the 2952 patients with STEMI successful treatment by PCI, 395 patients (13.4%) had a nonIRA CTO lesion. 18 patients were excluded from current study as they death within 7 days (n=6) or were not to followup (n=7). Due to unavailability of ejection fraction or renal function before CTOPCI, ACEF score could not be calculated in 5 patients. The remaining 377 patients (95.4%) were finally analyzed in the study. 279 patients performed a staged CTOPCI attempt(ranging 728 days) and was successful in 221 of them. Due to low possibility of PCI success or patients refused to perform PCI, 98 patients did not undergo the PCI attempt. The patients were then divided into successful CTOPCI group (221 patients) and failed/ nonattempted CTOPCI group (156 patients).</criteria>
