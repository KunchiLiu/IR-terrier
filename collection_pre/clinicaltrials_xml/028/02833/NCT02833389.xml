	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of repeat dosing of UTTR1147A in patients with neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers that do not respond adequately to standard wound care. Patients across multiple sites will be assigned to one of the 4 cohorts (Cohort A, B, C and D) based on the eligibility criteria and randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either UTTR1147A or placebo over 12 weeks, in addition to standard wound care.</brief_summary>
