	<brief_summary>Diagnosis of angioedema (AE) is difficult especially in emergency room. Two forms should be evoked: histaminic AE (allergic or not, which represent 95% of cases) and bradykinic AE (hereditary or acquired deficiency, with or without C1 Inhibitor) rarer but with more severe prognosis. The distinction is based on clinical features (spontaneous crisis duration, presence of concomitant hives, atopic history...). Sometimes it could be difficult to make the difference. Nowadays, there is no biological marker of the crisis. The search for biomarkers could improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of AE. Previous work has identified targets: D-dimer, C4, and VE-cadherin. We wanted to know the sensitivity and specificity of these markers. We conducted a prospective study evaluating the D-dimer assays, complement and VE-cadherin during an episode of AE. Three groups of patients were tested: bradykinic AE (peripheral or abdominal attacks), histaminic AE, and abdominal pain (non-bradykinic and non-histaminic etiology) at the time (day 0) and at distance from the crisis (D7).</brief_summary>
