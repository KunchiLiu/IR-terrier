	<brief_summary>Pathology of the rotator cuff and subacromial bursa is considered to be the principal cause of pain and symptoms arising from the shoulder. Physiotherapy specialists often disagree about which type of exercise is most appropriate. Manual Physiotherapy combined with guided exercise is a commonly applied clinical treatment, but no proof of its effectiveness has been shown. Clinical trials comparing results of treating subacromial syndrome of the shoulder with guided self-treatment and conventional physiotherapy yielded a slightly higher improvement, basically because patients suffered from chronic tendinitis and the treatment period lasted only two weeks. That is the reason why the investigators propose a long-term follow-up study and a more complete assessment of effectiveness of the exercise prescribed to improved this pathology. Objectives: - Assessment of effectiveness of two different types of treatment of subacromial syndrome of the shoulder. - Comparison of effectiveness of both treatments in order to select that one yielding better results as the one to be applied as a routine practice. Patients will be assigned one of the following treatments: - Group 1: patients will be taught exercises in groups of six people, on a daily basis for twelve sessions. - Group 2: patients will be taught the same exercise as Group 1, individually, and will receive manual therapy consisting of muscular and joint re-centering. A modified version of the Constant scale will be used to assess mobility and pain shoulder.</brief_summary>
