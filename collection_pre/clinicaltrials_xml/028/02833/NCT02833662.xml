	<brief_summary>Higher risk of cardiac and respiratory post-operative events is observed in patients with unrecognised Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The efficiency of a simple method of OSA screening by analysing ventilation with measurement of nose pressure and nocturnal hypoxemia (oxygen desaturation index) will be assessed. These sleep respiratory analyses will be compared with the research of arrhythmia, in order to show if they are linked to the hypoxemia events. Aggravation of nocturnal respiratory disorder and higher incidence of cardiac and respiratory postoperative complications will be assessed in OSA patients.</brief_summary>
