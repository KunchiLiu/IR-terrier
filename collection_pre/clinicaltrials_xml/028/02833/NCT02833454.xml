	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to study the effect of anatomical direct insertion ACL reconstruction compared with conventional anatomical ACL reconstruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Anatomical Direct Insertion Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators divide 320 patients with ACL rupture into 4 groups, each group has 80 patients. The operation technique is different among the groups: group A: conventional anatomical double bundle acl reconstruction, group B: conventional anatomical single bundle acl reconstruction, group DA: direct insertion double bundle acl reconstruction, group DSB: direct insertion single bundle acl reconstruction. The investigators compare the results of the patients of each group at 2 years of surgery.</detailed_description>
