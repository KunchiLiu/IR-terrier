	<brief_title>Trial of Intraperitoneal (IP) Oxaliplatin in Combination With Intravenous FOLFIRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two common combinations of chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer of the colon, rectum, or appendix that has spread to the abdomen. One uses 5-fluorouracil (also called 5-FU), leucovorin and oxaliplatin, and is called FOLFOX. The other uses 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan, and is called FOLFIRI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved each of these combinations as treatment for colon or rectal cancer. Each is given through the veins. FOLFOX and FOLFIRI do not work well for tumors growing in the abdominal cavity. The investigators are trying to determine if giving chemotherapy called oxaliplatin directly into the abdominal cavity will have a greater effect on the cancer. The FDA has approved oxaliplatin to be given to people through their veins to treat advanced colorectal cancer. Giving oxaliplatin directly into the abdomen in this study is experimental and is not approved by the FDA. This study will give the standard chemotherapy FOLFIRI through the veins and oxaliplatin directly into the abdomen. This is the first time intraperitoneal oxaliplatin is being given in combination with FOLFIRI.</detailed_description>
