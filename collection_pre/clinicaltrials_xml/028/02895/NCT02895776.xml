	<brief_summary>Thrombectomy is now the standard of care of revascularization in acute ischaemic stroke. Data tend to show that final neurologic outcome is superior if the thrombectomy procedure was performed under conscious sedation. The Rothschild Foundation is a high output centre with more than 400 thrombectomy procedures every year. We report a rate of 5% of these procedures requiring general anesthesia despite conscious sedation being the standard of care. This study aims to identify clinical factors associated with a risk of conversion of a conscious sedation to a general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
