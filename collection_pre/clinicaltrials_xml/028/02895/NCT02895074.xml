	<brief_title>Subfoveal Choroidal Thickness After Surgery for Age-related Cataracts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is not clear whether femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) alters retinal and choroidal thickness. The goal of the present study was to determine the changes of retinal and choroidal thicknesses in patients who have undergone FLACS compared to patients who have undergone conventional phacoemulsification surgery (CPS).</detailed_description>
