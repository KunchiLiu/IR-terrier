	<brief_title>Effect of Fermented Maillard Reacted Whey Protein on Immune Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 80 participant without diabetes and obesity. Over a 8-week testing period, the F-MRP group consumed 6 g of powder containing 4.2 g F-MRP each day, whereas the placebo group consumed the same amount with dextrin. NK cell activity (%) was measured based on the ratios of effector cells (E; peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) from each participant to target cells (T; K562 cells) at E:T= 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1, or 1.25:1.</detailed_description>
