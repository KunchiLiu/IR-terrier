	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if temporarily relocating clinicians who deliver remote care using the eICU telehealth system to Sydney, Australia will lead to greater job satisfaction, reduced physiologic stress, and improve performance. Four nurses and six physicians will be sent to a site in Sydney Australia on a rotating basis to determine whether providing care during the Australian daytime is more efficient and precise than providing care during the night in the United States.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine if temporarily relocating clinicians who deliver remote care using the eICU telehealth system to Sydney Australia will lead to greater job satisfaction, reduced physiologic stress, and improve performance. Four nurses and six physicians will be sent to a site in Sydney Australia on a rotating basis to determine whether providing care during the Australian daytime is more efficient and precise than providing care during the night in the United States. As part of this pilot, each participant will undergo a series of evaluations before leaving, while in Australia, and after returning. The evaluations will include questionnaires related to well-being, task assessment (such as completing a paper maze or performing arithmetic), physiology assessment (such as continuous measure of heart rate by a wristwatch type device), and stress assessment (by sampling saliva and measuring cortisol and interleukin-1 Beta). The researchers would like to determine whether normalization of the provider's (physician or nurse who are the research subjects) sleep-wake cycle improves subjective and objective well-being. Additionally, investigators seek to determine whether normalization of the provider's (physician or nurse who are the research subjects) sleep-wake cycle improves alertness and focus, and determine whether normalization of the provider's (physician or nurse who are the research subjects) sleep-wake cycle improves job performance.</detailed_description>
