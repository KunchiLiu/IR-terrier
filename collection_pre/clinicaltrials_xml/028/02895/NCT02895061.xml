	<brief_title>Effectiveness Between Daily Versus Pulse Oral Alfacalcidol for Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ESRD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in 3 hemodialysis centers were enrolled. They were assigned to either oral daily or pulse (trice a week) alfacalcidol treatments using block-of-4 randomization. Alfacalcidol in both groups were equal at the dose of 6 microgram per week. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and were monitored every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was the difference of the mean PTH reduction between two groups at the end of the study by unpaired-T test. All possible adverse events were carefully monitored.</detailed_description>
