	<brief_summary>The purpose is to compare and evaluate multiple functional imaging methods (perfusion, diffusion, spectroscopy) for initial benign/malignant characterization of osteoarticular tumors and to determine which method or which association of methods could improve non invasive tissue characterization. Secondary purposes are: - to determine a possible correlation between some parameters and the histological grade (FNCLCC) - to suggest a coherent diagnostic imaging approach for osteoarticular tumors. The ancillary study will enroll patients needing radiological tumor follow-up. The purpose is to identify tools for evaluation of tumor activity and therapeutic response before modification of morpho-volumetric data.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients refered for the initial evaluation of suspected osteoarticular masses will be included in this study after signing an informed consent. Histologic analysis will be used as a gold standard. The following imaging techniques will be evaluated: - contrast enhanced ultrasonography - Low dose CT perfusion - Magnetic resonance perfusion - Diffusion weighted imaging - Magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy</detailed_description>
