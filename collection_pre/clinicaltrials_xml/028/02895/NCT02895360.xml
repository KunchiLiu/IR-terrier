	<brief_title>Phase 1/2a Study of BAL101553 Administered as 48-hour Intravenous Infusions in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first study of prolonged intravenous infusion of BAL101553. BAL101553 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 48 hours, to adults with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is available. The primary goal of the study is to find the highest dose of BAL101553 that can safely be given to humans and to assess what side effects occur. The study will start by treating patients with a low dose. Once it has been shown that this low dose is well tolerated, new patients will be treated at higher dose levels ("dose escalation"). Once the highest, well tolerated dose is identified, 40 new patients will be treated at that dose (this part is called "dose expansion") to further assess the tolerability and potential anticancer activity of oral BAL101553. The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects and assess biomarkers.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 years 2. Patients with either histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or recurrent solid tumor, who failed standard therapy or for whom no effective standard therapy is available. 3.

Acceptable organ and marrow function at baseline (protocol defined laboratory parameters) 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 7. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. 1. Patients who have received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of prior therapies 2. Patients who have had prior exposure to BAL101553. 3. Inability to swallow oral medication. 4. Patients with gastrointestinal disease. 5. Patients with malignant primary brain tumors. 6. Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease, indicative of active disease. 7. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2. 8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would unduly increase the risk of toxicity or limit compliance with study requirements 9. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg at the screening visit. 10. Blood pressure (BP) combination treatment with more than two antihypertensive medications. 11. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
