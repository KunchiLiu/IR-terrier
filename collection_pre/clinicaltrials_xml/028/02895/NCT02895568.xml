	<brief_title>Prevalence Survey of Plasmodium Falciparum Antimalarial Drug Resistance Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cross-sectional, observational study using dried blood samples collected from P. falciparum-infected individuals at the time of malaria diagnosis to measure the prevalence of known and candidate molecular markers of resistance to artemisinin and non-artemisinin ACT partner drugs. A maximum of 200 participants will be enrolled at each participating site per year. Study duration is 2 years. Therefore total participant is up to 400. Prospective participants will have blood collected for dried blood spot (DBS) study sample after providing informed consent. Individuals with confirmed P. falciparum infection will have DBS samples included for molecular analyses for known and candidate molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance.</detailed_description>
