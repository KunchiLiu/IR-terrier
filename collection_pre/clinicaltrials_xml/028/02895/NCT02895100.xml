	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of PTG-100 in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II multi-center, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an oral peptide, PTG-100, administered as capsules for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Following screening procedures and confirmation of subject eligibility, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of three daily doses of PTG-100 (150, 300 or 900 mg) or placebo. Stratification will be based on subjects' prior treatment with anti-TNF agents, with a maximum of 50% of subjects with prior unsuccessful anti-TNF agent treatments. Subjects will be treated with study drug for 12 weeks. Sigmoidoscopies will be performed at the Screening Visit and on Week 12. A final Follow Up Visit will occur on Week 16, when subject has been off study treatment for 4 weeks. Clinical, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters will be evaluated on an ongoing basis during the 16 week study.</detailed_description>
