	<brief_title>Prehabilitation for Adults With End Stage Renal Disease on the Kidney Transplant Waitlist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prehabilitation is the enhancement of functional capacity of a patient to improve their ability to withstand a future stressor. The investigators primary objective is to demonstrate feasibility for prehabilitation in Aim 1 and test whether the number of prehabilitation sessions is associated with increased physical activity. The investigators will formally test whether prehabilitation is associated with a reduction in short term and long term KT outcomes as part of Aim 2. The investigators will test whether there is an effect of prehabilitation on short-term (KT length of stay&gt; 2 weeks, early hospital readmission and delayed graft function) and long-term (acute rejection (within the first year), 1 year patient and graft survival) outcomes compared to standard of care controls. Participants will be followed for 3-6 months or until they receive a kidney transplant.</detailed_description>
