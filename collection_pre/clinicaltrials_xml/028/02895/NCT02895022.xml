	<brief_summary>The need to resort to a midwifery course work in cesarean is a common practice. Epidural analgesia for labor analgesia is practiced in 90% of women in obstetric work, as when the cesarean decision is taken course work in practice and the recommendations are to use the epidural catheter in place to convert the epidural analgesia in epidural anesthesia by re-injecting a local anesthetic on the catheter. General anesthesia is reserved only cases of extreme urgency and cons-indications for regional anesthesia as a purveyor of high maternal morbidity and mortality. The initial assumption is that the 2% lidocaine with epinephrine is the optimal and recommended local anesthetic solution.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There is a real variability in the volume administered by practitioners repository fault. The main objective is to determine the ED95 dose of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine injected into the epidural catheter for which it does not arise from failure to surgical anesthesia for cesarean during labor. The secondary objectives are to determine the failure risk factors, the hemodynamic consequences related to the volume administered and evaluate maternal satisfaction.</detailed_description>
