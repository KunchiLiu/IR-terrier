	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that the efficacy of intravenous (IV) itraconazole followed by oral itraconazole is non-inferior to that of intravenous caspofungin as empiric therapy for suspected fungal infection participants with fever and neutropenia.</brief_summary>
