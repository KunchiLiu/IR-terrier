	<brief_summary>This study is a phase 2, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm parallel group (1:1:1) intervention trial to determine the efficacy of 4 weeks rapamycin treatment and 4 weeks rapamycin treatment plus 3 months vildagliptin treatment versus placebo in increasing endogenous insulin production and correcting glycemic lability. It will involve 60 patients with long standing type 1 diabetes (T1D). Patients will receive for one month placebo (Group 1), rapamycin plus placebo (Group 2), or rapamycin plus Vildagliptin (Group 3). Rapamycin will be administered at an initial dose 0.2 mg/kg orally on day 0 followed by 0.1 mg/kg/die (target trough levels: 8-10 ng/ml). Vildagliptin will be administered at a dose of 50 mg x2/die starting from day 0. After 4 weeks of treatment (period A), patients will discontinue rapamycin or relevant placebo treatment, but continue Vildagliptin or placebo for a further 8 weeks and be monitored over this period (period B).</brief_summary>
