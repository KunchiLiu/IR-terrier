	<brief_summary>Many children admitted to hospital in Botswana without bloody diarrhoea are presumed to have viral gastroenteritis and so not treated with antibiotics - but they may indeed have a treatable cause for their illness. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to see if rapid testing using novel methods to identify potentially treatable causes of diarrhoea leads to improved outcomes. The investigators will also be randomizing children to Lactobacillus reuteri DSM (daughter strain) 17938 therapy versus placebo (the standard of care) to see if this treatment decreases the duration of diarrhoea. The proposed study is a large multi-centre trial following the previous pilot trial.</brief_summary>
