	<brief_summary>This pilot project is a cooperative effort between the Leisure in Fun Environments (LIFE) Program and the Specialized Communication Resources for Children (SCRC) Program at the Rehabilitation Centre for Children (RCC). The investigators will blend and enhance two pre-existing programs in order to provide a new, specialized program for parents of children with ASD or developmental delay. The two programs that will be blended together are "Promoting Flexible Thinking and Interaction with Your Child at Home" and "Saturday Cooking Club." This new program will be a series of ten workshops that alternates between "parents only" learning sessions and practical "cooking club" sessions that allow parents to focus on practicing what they are learning with their child. These programs are based on the principles of Relationship Development Intervention (RDIÂ®), which focuses on providing opportunities to establish a guided participation relationship, which will lead to development of dynamic intelligence and important social thinking abilities. The program is individualized to each child and builds on the principles of typical development to assist the child in achieving social competence. Using this program, children are expected to develop sociability in a naturally progressing order of complexity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Build Your Parenting Toolkit: Guiding Children to Become Flexible Thinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parenting children with developmental disabilities or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can be challenging. Often, these children process information in an atypical manner and they may struggle to learn through social engagement. At times, regular parenting techniques do not work with these children, which may leave parents feeling distressed and confused. In their ground breaking interpretation of the International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability (ICF), The 'F-words' in childhood disability, (2011) Dr. P. Rosenbaum and Dr. J. Gorter state that, "Family represents the essential environment of all children." They point to research that confirms that parental physical and mental health is challenged in families who have a child with a disability. Specifically, behavioural issues of these children significantly contribute to parental stress scores, impact attachment, the relationship with a spouse, parental depression and in particular, a sense of competence. By providing parents the opportunity to understand their child's unique learning style, and the opportunity to learn how to mindfully engage their child, it is the investigators' goal to restore parental competence and the natural parent/child relationship. The objectives of this new learning series program are to help parents understand their child's unique learning style and to give parents the practical tools to become their child's best teacher and guide. Becoming a mindful parent requires a solid understanding of the child's underlying social learning challenges, and it requires parents to be both self-reflective and analytical. Behaviour change takes time and repeated experience. Parents also need the opportunity to practice in a safe and supportive environment. This learning series will consist of ten in-person sessions, over a period of 12-14 weeks.</detailed_description>
