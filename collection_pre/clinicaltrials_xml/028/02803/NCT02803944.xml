	<brief_summary>Azithromycin is an antibiotic currently prescribed continuously in cystic fibrosis patients. It was shown that this treatment taken every day or every week for 12 months, can improve the respiratory state of patients. From the second year of treatment, it would appear there is more profit to continue such treatment. The main objective is to study the association between continuous use of azithromycin and lung function measured by Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), after two years of treatment.</brief_summary>
