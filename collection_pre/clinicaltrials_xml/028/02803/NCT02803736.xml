	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Acupuncture for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema (BCRL) is classified as "edema", and is considered to be caused by qi (chi) deficiency and blood stagnation. Acupuncture, as an ancient therapy in TCM, is thought to have the efficacy to stimulate the transformation of qi and drainage of dampness, and is widely used for various diseases including edema in China. Early clinical trials as well as our own clinical observation have demonstrated that acupuncture can ameliorate limb swelling and decrease lymphedema. However, no randomized placebo-controlled trial has been performed to evaluate this efficacy of acupuncture. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of acupuncture to treat chronic upper-limb lymphedema.</detailed_description>
