	<brief_title>Effect of Testosterone Replacement on Exercise Capacity in Hypogonadal Men After a Recent Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Testosterone deficiency can decrease muscle strength. The researchers will replace testosterone in hypogonadal men undergoing rehabilitation exercises after heart attack.</detailed_description>
