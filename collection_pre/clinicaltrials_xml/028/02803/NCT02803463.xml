	<brief_title>Peritoneal Closure Versus Non Closure During Open Appendectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been no consensus over closure versus non closure of peritoneum during abdominal operations. in literature, few reports suggested that peritoneal closure may prolong the operation time, may increase the costs and has a probable aggravating effect on postoperative pain. In addition, there have been some reports that suggest non closure of peritoneum may not increase the postoperative complications. The need of further studies to clarify the effect of peritoneal closure versus non closure on postoperative pain and life quality especially has been specified in some literature. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of peritoneal closure versus non closure over postoperative pain, early complications and life quality.</detailed_description>
