	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of combining the drugs osimertinib and bevacizumab at different dose levels. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking osimertinib and bevacizumab has on the patient and lung cancer. This study will try to find the best dose of osimertinib and bevacizumab given together that does not cause significant side effects. Once the investigators determine that combining osimertinib and bevacizumab is safe, they want to see if the combination is effective in treating lung cancers with the EGFR mutation.</brief_summary>
