	<brief_title>Drug Use Investigation of Xofigo, Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer With Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a local, non-interventional, multi-center, single-cohort study using primary data of patients treated with Xofigo for the indication of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastases. A total of 300 patients (valid for safety analysis) are enrolled within 18 months. During the observation period, safety and effectiveness information is collected. Since patient's visit occurs under the routine clinical practice, the study protocol does not define exact referral dates for those visits. The physician records patient data as defined in the protocol. The outcome variables for the primary objective are Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs) and Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs). The outcome variables for secondary objectives include laboratory findings (e.g. Alkaline Phosphatase [ALP], bone markers if measured) and pain status (analgesic utility). The results of this study have to be submitted to the Japanese regulatory authorities as a part of the re-examination package after the completion of the re-examination period (8 years). This study is conducted in accordance with Article 14-4 (re-examination) of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, and Good Post-marketing Surveillance Practice from a ministerial ordinance of Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan.</detailed_description>
