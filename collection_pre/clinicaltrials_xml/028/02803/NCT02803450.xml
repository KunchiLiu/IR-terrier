	<brief_title>Epidural Loading: High Volume, Low Concentration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, randomized, single blinded control trial will investigate the effects of epidural loading with a high volume, low concentration local anesthetic solution via the epidural needle versus the epidural catheter. Control patients will receive local anesthetic in lower volume more concentrated solution via the epidural catheter which is current standard practice. Outcome measures will include quantifying pain relief with respect to time using VAS scores. In addition, post delivery patient satisfaction regarding anesthesia regimen, blood pressure changes, heart rate, anesthetic level, total dose of epidural used during labor, rescue doses and incidence of fetal bradycardia will be assessed. 35 patients will be recruited for each of the three arms of the study, totaling 105 patients, in order to obtain significance when performing statistical analyses following complete enrollment in the study. The impetus of this study involves investigation of the effects of loading the epidural space with high volume, low concentration local anesthetic via two different modalities and studying which method is more efficacious.</detailed_description>
