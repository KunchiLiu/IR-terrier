	<brief_title>Circulatory Management and Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Partial Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies found that the incidence of acute kidney injury afer partial nephrectomy is higher than 30%. In addition to nephron loss induced by renal parenchyma resection, ischemia/reperfusion injury produced by clamping/unclamping of renal arteries is also an important reason. However, studies investigating the effect of circulatory management on the incidence of acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy are limited. It has been shown that perioperative hemodynamic optimization protected renal function in surgical patients. And in patients undergoing renal transplantation, adequate hydration and optimal perfusion enhances early graft function. The investigators hypothesize that hydration and circulatory management to guarantee optimal renal perfusion may decrease the occurrence of acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether circulatory management based on LiDCOrapid hemodynamic monitoring can reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy when compared with routine circulatory management based on blood pressure and urine output monitoring.</detailed_description>
