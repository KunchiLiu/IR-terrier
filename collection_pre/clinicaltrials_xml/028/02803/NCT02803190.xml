	<brief_summary>The investigators' previous studies in 2014 and 2015 have demonstrated that among community-dwelling older adults with high osteoporotic fracture risks. many sarcopenia indices can be improved and bone mineral density (BMD) maintained with different exercise programs. In 2016, the investigators aim to determine the effects of 2 exercise interventions on posture corrections and further improvement of sarcopenic indices</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osteoporosis and Fall Prevention and Posture Correction Interventions in the Metropolitan Area</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study enrolled subjects who already participated in the 2015 study (n=109) at the National Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch (NTUHBB). Subjects will be maintained in their original integrated care group (ICG, target n=50) and muscle training group (MTG, target n=50) when possible. If target sample size is not reached, clinic patients are screened for high risk of fall, osteoporosis/fracture by standardized questionnaires or FRAX for enrollments. New participants are randomized into the ICG and MTG groups. Other than assessments provided in 2015, digital photography on posture and low back pain assessments are done in 2016. All participants received a CD-ROM and one hour education on osteoporosis, sarcopenia, frailty, fall prevention, nutrition, low back pain, good posture, and coping strategy and another hour of professional led exercise program with more focus on central muscle groups. ICG subjects received once weekly group exercise while MTG subjects received twice weekly machine-based resistance training on major muscle groups. Major outcomes were muscle mass (measured by bio-impedance analysis), grip strength, walking speed, and lower leg extension power, Chinese version of Oswestry Disability Index v 2.1 score (for low back pain), and spine curve angle (by photography) at baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention.</detailed_description>
