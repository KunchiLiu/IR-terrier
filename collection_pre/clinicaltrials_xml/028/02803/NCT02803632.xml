	<brief_summary>An excess suicide-related morbidity is observed among young people in the Picardie region, as reflected by the &gt; 100% occupation rate of the Amiens University Hospital Adolescent Medicine Unit. New approaches have been proposed to these problems that have led us to reorganize our diagnostic practices: 1) more precise characterization of suicidal behaviour by using standardized instruments such as the French version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale developed by Posner (C-SSRS); 2) new clinical entities, such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, are now proposed in international classifications (DSM 5 field trial); 3) investigations such as recording of the circadian rhythm of motor activity by actigraphy are being studied as a laboratory complement to psychiatric diagnosis.</brief_summary>
