	<brief_summary>To describe the natural history of the coronary atherosclerotic plaque development and progression in mild to moderate CAD over time by CCTA with demographic and laboratory data for refinement of risk stratification of patients referred for CCTA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Progression of AtheRosclerotic PlAque DetermIned by Computed TomoGraphic Angiography Imaging(PARADIGM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All PARADIGM study patients underwent initial and follow-up CCTA based on order from their primary physician. Demographic data, targeted medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, and laboratory data was prospectively collected in electronic case report forms (eCRFs) at the time of the initial CCTA and at the time of follow-up CCTA.</detailed_description>
