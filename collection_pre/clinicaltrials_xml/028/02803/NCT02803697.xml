	<brief_summary>Non functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) are the most common pituitary adenomas. Their growth is usually slow and diagnosis is often made in the context of masse effect .The therapeutic alternatives are surgery and radiotherapy such as fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Nowadays, there is no clinical or histological prognostic factor to allow an individualized follow-up and recurrence could happen 10 or 15 years after the first surgery. In this study, the investigators evaluate NFPAs recurrence rate after surgery and try to find predictive factors of recurrence to personalized the follow-up of each patient.</brief_summary>
