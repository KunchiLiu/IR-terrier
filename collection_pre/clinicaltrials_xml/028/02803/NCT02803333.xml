	<brief_summary>The Moffitt Cancer Center and PatientsLikeMe.com (PLM), an online patient community, are working together to better understand the patient's entire lung cancer experience, both inside and outside the doctor's office. By combining the data that is captured by their care team in the clinic with the data participants enter at their home on PatientsLikeMe.com, the investigators hope to improve patient-physician treatment decisions, so that the patient's personal treatment goals and quality of life have the highest chances of being fulfilled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) Lung Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to assess the real-world patient experience by evaluating the patients' quality of life, treatment toxicities, and clinical measures over a 6-month period. The ultimate goal of this research is to improve patient-physician treatment decisions, so that the patient's personal treatment goals and quality of life have the highest chances of being fulfilled. Aim 1. To track the toxicities/side-effects of FDA approved molecular targeted agents, immunotherapies, and combinations of treatments for NSCLC in a clinical setting for six months. Aim 2. To assess the impact of these treatment regimens on patient toxicities, symptoms, function, and quality of life, after adjustment for clinical factors and patient characteristics during the 6 month follow-up period.</detailed_description>
