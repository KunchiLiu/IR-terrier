	<brief_summary>Anxiety is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease and negatively impacts quality of life yet it frequently remains untreated and there have been no clinical trials dedicated to evaluating the pharmacological treatment of anxiety in Parkinson's disease. Buspirone is effective for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the general and elderly population. It is not known if it is effective for the treatment of anxiety in Parkinson's disease. This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind design with participants randomized with a 4:1 allocation ratio to flexible dosage buspirone (maximum dosage 30 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
