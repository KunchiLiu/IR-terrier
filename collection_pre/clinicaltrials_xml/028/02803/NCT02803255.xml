	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a robot-aided rehabilitation protocol that follows the "assist-as needed" paradigm provide statistically significant improvements in arm and hand motor functions when compared to robot-aided protocols that passively move patients' arms along pre-defined trajectories, in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Twenty adults with chronic incomplete SCI (according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) CD level) will be recruited from TIRR and from the Houston area. 1. Providing written informed consent prior to any study related procedures; 2. Age between 1875 years; 3. Diagnosis of chronic complete or incomplete spinal cord injury as defined by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment scale classification and at least for 6 months; 4. Not being involved in any specific exercise program (e.g., NMES, FES) within the previous 3 months; 5. No planned alteration in upperextremity therapy or medication for muscle tone during the course of the study; 6. Eligibility for standard rehabilitation at the time of enrollment (i.e., absence medical comorbidities that would prevent standard rehabilitation); 7. No condition (e.g., severe arthritis, extreme shoulder pain) that would interfere with valid administration of the measures or with interpreting motor testing; Subjects will be excluded if they have: 1. Any joint contracture or severe spasticity in the affected upper extremity, as measured by a Modified Ashworth Score &gt; than 3 out of 4; 2. Subject who cannot provide selftransportation to the study location.</criteria>
