	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate safety of 14-day repeated lixisenatide doses with 3 ascending doses as compared to placebo in pediatric patients with T2DM. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate plasma concentrations of lixisenatide after repeated doses (3 ascending doses) and pharmacokinetic parameters of repeated lixisenatide doses in pediatric patients with T2DM. - To evaluate the change from baseline in fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose concentrations during a standardized meal test after 3 ascending repeated doses of lixisenatide in comparison to placebo.</brief_summary>

Body mass index (BMI) &gt;85th percentile for age and gender; BMI ≤50 kg/m^2. Male and female patients with documented T2DM insufficiently controlled with metformin ≥1000 mg/day (or maximum tolerated dose according to the Investigator's judgment) at a stable dose and regimen for 8 weeks prior to randomization and/or basal insulin at stable dose (±20%) and regimen for 8 weeks prior to randomization.

Diabetes other than T2DM. Fasting plasma glucose &gt;250 mg/dL (&gt;13.9 mmol/L) at screening. Use of other oral or injectable antidiabetic or hypoglycemic agents other than metformin and basal insulin (eg, alpha glucosidase inhibitor, glucagonlike peptide (GLP1) receptor agonist, dipeptidyl peptidaseIV (DPPIV) inhibitors, shortacting insulin etc.) within 1 month prior to the screening visit. History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease.
