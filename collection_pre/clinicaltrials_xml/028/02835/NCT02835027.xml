	<brief_summary>Study of acute lower ischemia therapies based on data collected from the Swedish Vascular Surgery Registry between 1994 and 2014. Primary endpoint is long term amputation-free survival and secondary end-points are 30 days and 1 year amputation-free survival as well as different revascularization techniques results and time trends.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prospective Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) started in 1987 and since 1994 it has included more than 95 percent of the vascular surgical procedures performed nationwide. The registry has received extensive high internal and external validation. Roughly 16000 open surgical and endovascular revascularisation procedures for acute limb ischemia have been performed during this period of time. The fact that every Swedish citizen has a unique personal identification number makes it possible to obtain 100 percent accurate survival and amputation data. Survival data were obtained through crosschecking the personal identification number with the national population registry in June 2016. This offers a unique opportunity to study a large population-based cohort of unselected patients.</detailed_description>
