	<criteria>Patient requires a chronic indwelling Foley catheter for at least 3 days. Catheters will not remain indwelling greater than 30 days at a time Patient is more than 18 years of age Patient is able to give informed consent Patient is able to attend followup sessions Patient is less than 18 years of age Patient is pregnant Patient with a known allergy to silicone Patient has urinary tract anatomic abnormality that would prevent placement of a standard Foley catheter Patient unable to accommodate the catheter Patient has an active urinary tract infection (UTI) or other diagnosed infection that is untreated. Patient currently taking (or expected to take) more than a single dose of antibiotics for prevention of other infections during the catheter indwell period Patient has uncontrolled fecal incontinence (uncontrolled stool/poop passage) Patient is unable to feel and/or communicate their symptoms Informed consent is unable to be obtained Patient is unable or unwilling to comply with the study followup schedule Patient has a medical condition or disorder that would limit life expectancy to less than 30 days or that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound the data analysis Any other reason that if in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment in the study</criteria>
