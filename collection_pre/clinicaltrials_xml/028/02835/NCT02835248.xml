	<brief_summary>Medical alert devices with automatic fall detection functionality use accelerometry to detect a fall and can signal for help if the wearer forgets to, or is incapable of, pressing the alert button. This can save lives and prevent complications associated with long periods of time spent on the floor after a fall. In this project, the sensitivity and false alarm rate of a commercially available medical alert device will be tested in a population of 200 community-dwelling older adults.</brief_summary>
