	<detailed_description>Children and adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (age ≥ 13 years) whose clinical conditions have not been effectively controlled by current standard medical therapies (topical moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and oral antihistamines) for more than 2 months will be include. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study on the efficacy, safety of intramuscular injections of autologous immunoglobulin in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. After providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the baseline visit. Patients will undergo screening within 28 days prior to randomization as "wash out period", and during the screening period, treatment with medications (including systemic corticosteroids and systemic immunomodulating agents) for atopic dermatitis will be wash-out for at least 28 days prior to baseline (exclude moisturizers). Topical corticosteroid and topical calcineurin inhibitors will be required to stop at least the 7 consecutive days before the baseline. At screening, plasma will be separated from patients' venous blood (400ml) aseptically and autologous immunoglobulin fraction will be purified from the plasma by chromatography using Protein A during the screening period. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly treatment with autologous immunoglobulin or placebo (normal saline) for 2 months will be administrated by intramuscular injection, once a week for 7 weeks (total 8 injections). The investigators will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of intramuscular injections of autologous immunoglobulin in those patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis by measuring changes in the standardized clinical severity scoring system for atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) values, Eczema Area and Severity index (EASI), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and quality of life together with laboratory parameters in blood samples before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
