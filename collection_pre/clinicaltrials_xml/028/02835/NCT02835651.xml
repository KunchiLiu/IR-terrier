	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) have different effects on HDL metabolism during the fasted state.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design: Double blind, randomized, cross-over study with two different diets: one diet will be high in palmitic acid (C16:0) and the other diet will be high in stearic acid (C18:0). Subjects will receive both diets for 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4-6 weeks in between. Contrast in the intakes of palmitic acid and stearic acid is 6% of energy. A postprandial test will be carried out at the end of each dietary period. Study population: Accounting for a dropout rate of 20%, 40 healthy men and postmenopausal women, aged between 45 and 70 year, having a BMI (body mass index) between ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2 will be recruited.</detailed_description>
