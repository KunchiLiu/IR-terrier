	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that chronic inflammatory dysimmune state promotes the development of cardiovascular complications. The biological assumption is based on the fact that chronic inflammation promotes lesions of the vessel wall (endothelial alterations, calcification, atherosclerosis). The clinical aim is to allow to identify high-risk patients and to act in prevention. The project CARMIN involves the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, their management, and their influence on cardiovascular prognosis in patients with autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies acquired. It is based on the creation and monitoring of a cohort of patients with different types of dysimmune disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, systemic vasculitis ANCA, kidney transplants, and hematopoietic stem cells transplants.</brief_summary>
