	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of three main perfusion methods in surgical repair of coarctation of aorta with aortic arch hypoplasia in infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment of Perfusion Techniques During Repair of Coarctation With Aortic Arch Hypoplasia in Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three perfusion techniques of visceral protection will be assessed - deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion and double arterial cannulation (perfusion of brachiocephalic artery with thoracic descending aorta by two arterial cannulas)</detailed_description>
