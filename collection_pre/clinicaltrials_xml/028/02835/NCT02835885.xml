	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) in healthy controls. Tested in healthy subjects (HS) the physiological effects of tVNS at different stimulation parameters. The electrical stimulation variables will be pulse width, frequency, and current. This will be tested in a laboratory setting and will measure tVNS effects on heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and perceived pain. This is a feasibility and small safety study. Hypothesis: tVNS is feasible and safe</brief_summary>
