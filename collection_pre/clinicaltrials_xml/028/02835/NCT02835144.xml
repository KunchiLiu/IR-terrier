	<detailed_description>The prevalence of addictive disorders in old age is increasing. Age specific and appropriate therapeutic concepts tailored to inpatients thus represent a promising approach for the future. The investigated therapeutic intervention is a "therapy program for integrated qualified acute treatment of alcohol and drug problems" (TIQAAM). Subjects ≥ 65 years, in which according to the WHO ASSIST V3.0 a risky consumption of alcoholic beverages, or benzodiazepines / non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon), or both, are examined before and after a psychotherapeutic intervention during their inpatient stay exists. The data collected in part 1 of the study pertain to social integration, the motivation to change, quality of life in old age, general psychiatric symptoms. The data collected in part 2 of the study pertain to brain structure and functions. Data from standard procedures will be correlated to the data above.These relate to psychiatric symptoms, past consumption behavior, cognitive abilities, perceived social support and risk appetite.</detailed_description>
