	<brief_summary>Community Paramedicine @Home (CP@Home) is a novel community paramedicine health assessment program for high users of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Individuals who have been identified as active callers to EMS, individuals who have called EMS for lift-assists, and direct paramedic referrals are referred into the community paramedicine home visit program. The program will focus on in-home chronic disease management, community health service connections, and EMS usage education. Aside from chronic disease management, aspects of the program include health-related quality of life, social isolation and other social determinants of health. Participants in the program will have up to 3 one-on-one home visits from a community paramedic to ultimately reduce repeat EMS calls and improve their overall health.</brief_summary>
