	<brief_summary>This clinical trial will evaluate if Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is safe for the treatment of stroke and will help understand if DBS improves motor recovery for patients who continue to have significant impairment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation of the Dentate Nucleus for Upper Extremity Hemiparesis Due to Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a safety and feasibility study intended to provide preliminary data to design a future pilot study. The objective of this study is to document the safety and patient outcomes of electrical stimulation of the dentate nucleus area for the management of chronic, moderate to severe upper extremity hemiparesis due to ischemic stroke.</detailed_description>
