	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate of the effectiveness of Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) on hand functionality in patients with Distal Radius Fracture (DRFx). This study was carried out on 36 patients. These patients were randomly assigned to two groups: classic treatment group (n=19) and GMI group (n=17). Both groups received a 8-week (2 days a week) physical therapy and rehabilitation intervention. Outcome measurements were based on upper extremity functional status (Disability of the Arm Shoulder Hand and Michigan Hand Questionnaire scores), pain (on the rest and during the activity with Visual Analog Scale), range of motion (wrist flexion, extension, ulnar/radial deviation, supination and pronation with goniometer), grip strength (standard grip strength with Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer; lateral, palmar and pinch strength with pinch meter).</brief_summary>
