	<brief_title>ATG Combined With Cyclophosphamide And Cord Blood Transfusion in Treating Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aplastic Anemia( AA), is a set of bone marrow hematopoietic dysfunction caused by a variety of causes, with hyperplasia of bone marrow hematopoietic cells to reduce whole blood cells and peripheral blood at the characteristics of clinical main performance for anemia, bleeding and infection. According to the severity of the bone marrow failure and the progress of the clinical course ,it is divided into Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) and the Non - Severe Aplastic Anemia (NSAA).Severe Aplastic Anemia can be divided into two categories: Very Severe Aplastic Anemia (VSAA) and Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA), with the characteristics of rapid progress, refractory, poor prognosis, high mortality .The natural course is six months or so, and most patients die in a year . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy are two main treatment . The former is by far the only possible cure. It is recommended as first-line treatments, if patients have a matched sibling donor. The recommended age limit is 40 years old. But for those who have no sibling donor or patients older than 40 years old, it is recommend the immunosuppressive therapy. The investigators have already summarized the effectiveness of rabbit antithymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide (Cy) and cyclosporine, A (CsA) and the combination of the umbilical cord blood infusion for SAA/VSAA patients without suitable donor, with short duration, without long-term immunosuppressive therapy history. The total effectiveness rates has improved to 88%, with shorter immunosuppressive maintaining therapy , rapid hematopoietic reconstruction, fewer complications. The aim of this study is to further explore whether this solution can accelerate hematopoietic reconstruction of SAA/VSAA patients and its clinical curative effect and security. This study scheme has been approved by the Jinan military region general hospital medical ethics committee.</detailed_description>
