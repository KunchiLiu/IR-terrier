	<brief_summary>Current scales are not suited to a direct measure for the elderly with cognitive disorders and are difficult to handle for the care teams. In this context, a visual analog scale was created to answer a single question "How are you feeling now, immediately?" with the help of pictograms. This study aims to assess the validity and reliability of the Scale of Well-Being Assessment (SIWA) (in french : Echelle d'Evaluation Instantan√©e du Bien-Etre (EVIBE)) in people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disease.</brief_summary>
