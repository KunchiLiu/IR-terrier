	<brief_summary>Goals : ( a) to examine differences in cortical activity during hand movements with a mirror compared to imagery of the same movements, and (b) to examine correlation between cortical activity during imagery or mirror treatment and the pain and performance measures in finger amputees. A cross-sectional study of 20 subjects in a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) preforming mirror therapy hand movement and imagery hand movement. Also, Visual Analogue Scale for pain and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test will be used.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Goals : ( a) to examine differences in cortical activity during hand movements with a mirror compared to imagery of the same movements, and (b) to examine correlation between cortical activity during imagery or mirror treatment and the pain and performance measures in finger amputees. A cross-sectional one-meeting study of 20 subjects (finger amputees) in a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) preforming mirror therapy hand movement and imagery hand movement. Also, Visual Analogue Scale for pain and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test will be used.</detailed_description>
