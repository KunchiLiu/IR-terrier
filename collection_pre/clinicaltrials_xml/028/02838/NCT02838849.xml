	<detailed_description>Demographic and clinical data were collected and recorded in the first interview after signing the informed consent. The protocol was composed of two phases. The baseline phase lasted 7 days, when participants reported their usual diet on a food dairy in the first 3 days, between Sunday and Tuesday. Calculation of nutrient intake was performed using ADS nutri software (UFPEL, Pelotas, Brazil). Participants approved for the next phase were then randomized to fiber and fiber+water groups, which lasted 14 days. During this period participants were asked to report their intestinal habits including bowel movements, graduation of straining and subjective stool consistency. Participants were instructed to rank straining using a Likert scale from 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum), and the Bristol scale for stool consistency. In the last day of treatment phase (Saturday) participants collected feces and urine of 24 hours, and responded a symptoms questionnaire. Food and liquid intake were recorded on a diary during the last 3 days of treatment for comparison with the baseline phase stage.</detailed_description>
