	<brief_summary>The Bio-bank and Registry for StratIfication and Targeted intErventions in the Spectrum Of Type 2 Diabetes (BRITE-SPOT) has been set up to prospectively collect clinical data and biologically relevant samples from individuals with, and at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D), with the aim of delineating factors related to susceptibility, progression, complications and response to treatment. Expanded from BRITE-SPOT, Assessing the Progression to Type - 2 Diabetes (APT-2D) is a prospective cohort with a focus on non-diabetics (normoglycemic or prediabetic), to expand the sample size and depth of metabolic phenotyping in these upstream groups, with the more targeted aim of delineating factors related to insulin sensitivity versus secretion, that relate to progression to T2D.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Progression to Type-2 Diabetes (APT-2D): A Prospective Cohort Study Expanded From BRITE-SPOT (Bio-bank and Registry for StratIfication and Targeted intErventions in the Spectrum Of Type 2 Diabetes)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective open cohort study. The study will comprise the following periods: Screening â€¢ Complete screening checklist and informed consent form Procedures. - Following the screening visit, subjects are required to return to undergo the following: - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to assess glucose tolerance and beta cell function - Frequently-Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance test (FSIVGTT) to assess acute insulin response to glucose - Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (EHC) to obtain the insulin sensitivity index and assess insulin action - The Disposition index (DI) that quantifies the relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, will be determined through the results obtained during FSIVGTT and EHC to determine subject's risk for Type 2 diabetes. - OGTT will be repeated every 6 months to assess for conversion to Type 2 Diabetes. Plasma C-peptide, and glucose will be measured at 7 time points during the OGTT for minimal model assessment of beta cell function - FSIVGTT and EHC will be repeated within 3 months of conversion to Type 2 Diabetes, or at 3 years from recruitment, whichever comes sooner. Normoglycemic Subjects: 800 Pre-Diabetic Subjects: 1500</detailed_description>
