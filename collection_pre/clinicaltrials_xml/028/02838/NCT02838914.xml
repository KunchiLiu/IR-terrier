	<brief_title>Assessment of Reconstruction and Inverse Reconstruction in Right Atrium by Multimodal Echocardiographic Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) has increased in recent years. The construction and function of right atrium haven't shown clearly before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFCA).The purpose of the study is to investigate whether RFCA can lead to inverse reconstruction of right atrium for atrial fibrillation patients, which diagnosing by speckle tracking echocardiography combined with real-time three dimensional echocardiography. All patients will be followed up for 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. With a history of paroxysmal Af (PAF) and PAF record within 6 months prior to ablation, confirming at least one of the following findings: AF lasting for â‰¥30 s recorded in Holter or 12lead ECG. 2. No response to more than one antiarrhythmic drug, or unwilling to receive longterm drug treatment. 3. Can provide informed consent form expressing willingness to participate in the study and comply with followup tests and evaluation procedures. 4. Aged 1880 years. 1. With acute diseases, such as acute phase after myocardial infarction (within 3 months), within 3 months after acute heart failure or new cerebral infarction; 2. In the list of heart transplantation; 3. Expected survival less than 1 year; 4. With other hemorrhagic diseases and anticoagulant therapy is not allowed; 5. Thrombosis in left atrium; 6. Heart failure, New York Heart Association(NYHA) III/IV or eject fraction(EF)&lt;40%; 7. Patients with uncontrolled cancer; 8.
