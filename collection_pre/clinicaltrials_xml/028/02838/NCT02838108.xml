	<brief_title>The Relationship Between GOLD Risk Group and Clinical Outcomes in a Community-based COPD Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to collect information on the current level of symptoms and ability to breathe, treatment and outcomes of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This information will be used by the researchers to better understand the impact of COPD on patients. It will also help the researchers study the current recommendations for treatment of COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a growing public health problem and is now the third leading cause of death in the United States. The risk of exacerbations, hospitalizations and death in patients with COPD tends to increase with increasing severity of airflow limitation. However, the correlation between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), symptoms, and health-related quality of life is weak. The shortcomings of using airflow limitation alone to assess the clinical severity of COPD led the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) committee to develop a potentially more clinically meaningful approach to assess the impact of COPD on the patient. The GOLD committee has subsequently proposed a model for pharmacologic therapy of patients with stable COPD (i.e. those not currently experiencing a COPD exacerbation) according to GOLD risk group. The therapeutic recommendations proposed by GOLD are widely cited as a strategy for selecting therapy even though this model is predominantly based on expert opinion. This study will acquire data in a community-based cohort in which patients with COPD will be classified into GOLD risk groups A-D at enrollment and followed longitudinally. This study will assess the frequency of change in GOLD risk group during 5 years of follow-up, look at the use of COPD medications this cohort and how provider-selected therapy for COPD compares to GOLD-recommended pharmacologic therapy thus addressing a critical knowledge gap in the scientific community.</detailed_description>
