	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to identify a strategy to reduce wound complications in women who undergo cesarean delivery by Pfannenstiel skin incision. Currently, many Pfannenstiel skin incisions are closed by subcuticular sutures followed by either placement of Steri-Strips or Dermabond. Either Steri-Strips or Dermabond can be placed over the wound as a covering but it is unclear which may reduce wound complication rates. The hypothesis of this study is that Dermabond will result in a reduction in wound complication rates when compared to Steri-Strips. Previously published studies in non-obstetric populations have identified Dermabond as a potential intervention to reduce wound complications. The eligible population for this study will include women at NorthShore University HealthSystem Evanston Hospital and University of Chicago Hospital who will undergo primary or repeat cesarean delivery via Pfannenstiel skin incision. Women in the study will be randomized to receive either Steri-Strips or Dermabond. The primary outcome to be evaluated will be wound complication which will include wound infection (cellulitis or subcutaneous infection), wound separation (partial or complete), wound seroma/hematoma. Secondary endpoints to be investigated include cosmetic outcome, patient satisfaction, cost comparison, and difference in total time for application.</brief_summary>
