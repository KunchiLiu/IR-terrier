	<brief_title>Practice With Simulator Improves Basic ERCP Skills of Surgical Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Practicing Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures using the EMS provides opportunities for novice endoscopists to learn basic ERCP skills without a patient. In two randomized controlled trials (RCT), coached EMS practice increased selective bile duct cannulation success rate of novice endoscopists. Surgical trainees do not have sufficient endoscopy experience to meet the perceived basic requirement for ERCP training. However, ERCP is done with a side-viewing scope and even experienced GI trainees have difficult initially mastering the basic skill with scope manipulation and cannulation. It is not known whether EMS can provide additional benefit to novice surgical ERCP trainees.</detailed_description>
