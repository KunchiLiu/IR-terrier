	<brief_summary>ASCs will be administered via intra-articular use into the knee joint affected by OA where they are expected to exert their therapeutic effects. The objective of this clinical trial is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of single injections of 2 dosages of autologous ASCs versus standard of care (placebo), when administered locally into a knee joint affected by OA after in vitro cell expansion. The potential of ASC to lead to a disease-modifying therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be assessed by MRI after 1 and 2 years. This will be a phase IIb, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind study, comparing culture-expanded autologous ASC with placebo.</brief_summary>
