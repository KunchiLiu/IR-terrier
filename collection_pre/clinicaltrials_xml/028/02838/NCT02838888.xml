	<brief_summary>Screening colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for adenoma detection in the colon. However, it has been shown that a considerable number of polyps can be missed during screening colonoscopy. Until now the endoscopist himself is responsible for the detection of adenomatous polyps. No automatic tools are available supporting the colonoscopist to detect lesions. Recently, a computer program was developed that can be used to recognize and extract suspicious structure from colonoscopy video sequences. The program was built to automatically detected colonic polyps and to highlight the polyps by colour marking. The program was now refined so that the respective structures can be highlighted during real time colonoscopy. The aim of this feasibility study is to test whether the software is applicable during real time colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
