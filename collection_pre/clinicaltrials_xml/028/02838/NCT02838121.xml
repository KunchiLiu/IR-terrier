	<brief_summary>Periprosthetic bone loss caused by stress-shielding effect, a phenomenon of bone atrophy under mechanical unloading after THR implantation, further compromises the longevity of implant. The prospective randomized study is aimed to investigate the periprosthetic bone loss after primary total hip replacements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Periprosthetic Bone Loss After Total Hip Replacement by Annual Bisphosphonate Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial. The study will be performed in patients after obtaining informed consent. Group assignment is by drawing a sealed envelops based on random table. (1) Group 1: Experimental group 30 cases, AclastaÂ® (Zoledronic acid 5mg/100ml) is given intravenously on the 4th postoperative day and one year after the total hip replacement, (2) Group 2: Control group, 30 cases, no bisphosphonate is given to the patients. Only the unilateral coxarthrosis will be recruited for the study. Patients will be analyzed with (1) DXA study (2) Clinical assessment (Harris hip score and SF-12) (3) X-ray (4) serum marker of bone turnover. Patients will be scheduled for specified examinations preoperatively, postoperatively 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.</detailed_description>
