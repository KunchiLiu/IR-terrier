	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a device that delivers freezing temperature compared to injecting lidocaine (an anesthetic medication) in providing pain relief to patients with disorganized nerve bundle between the toes, also known as Morton's neuroma. The same ultrasound technology that the obstetricians use to visualize a fetus inside a pregnant woman will be used to help the study physician to locate the Morton's neuroma while precisely delivering the freezing temperature and lidocaine near the nerve.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will be a 3-arm randomized single-blinded placebo controlled study in which human subjects with intermetatarsal neuralgia will receive subcutaneous normal saline or subcutaneous lidocaine or ultrasound guided cryoablation. The first follow up will take place 4 weeks post procedure to monitor the magnitude and duration of pain relief. Subjects will then be crossed over. Those who had received saline or lidocaine will receive ultrasound guided cryoablation. Individuals, who had previously been given ultrasound guided cryoablation without any improvement, may opt for another denervation procedure at 4 weeks. All of the participants will be followed up at 3 months post procedure to determine the magnitude and duration of pain relief. Study procedures will be conducted by the principle investigator who is a Board Certified pain management attending physician and an expert in performing ultrasonography guided interventions The cryoablation device is routinely used to treat various painful pathologies at Mount Sinai and Beth Israel pain management offices. The device manual and instructions will be available at both locations. All research staff has prior experience working with individuals with foot and ankle injuries at Mount Sinai.</detailed_description>
