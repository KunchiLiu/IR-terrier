	<brief_summary>Arthralgia has been a common complaint in postmenopausal period which seems to be involved with estrogen depletion, although, its pathophysiology isnÂ´t completely clarified. It seems to relate with the level of physical activity, climacteric symptoms and pain catastrophizing. In view of the multiple dimensions involved in arthralgia in postmenopausal women which characterize it as a complex phenomenon, this study aims to describe the effects of hormone replacement therapy in women aged between 45 and 55 years, considering estrogen as a possible anti-nociceptive factor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Hormone Replacement Therapy on Arthralgia in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial with postmenopausal women aged between 45 and 55 years with chronic arthralgia related to climacteric. They will be evaluated climacteric symptoms, pain intensity, level of physical activity, pain catastrophising, depression, anxiety, quality of sleep and quality of life. The volunteers will be randomized, in the proportion 1:1, to treatment with either 0,625 mg conjugated equine estrogen, via oral administration, for 12 weeks or placebo, via oral administration, for 12 weeks. The randomization will be performed by a computer-generated random numbers list. The investigators will be blinded until completion of 12 weeks. Evaluation of climacteric symptoms, pain intensity, level of physical activity, pain catastrophising, depression, anxiety, quality of sleep and quality of life will be performed in the hospital at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6 months and 15 days.
