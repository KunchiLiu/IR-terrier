	<brief_summary>Background: Over 39% of approximately 3,000 doctors (The British Medical Association quarterly survey, 2015) admitted to frequently feeling drained, exhausted, overloaded, tired, low and lacking energy. Such occupational distress may link to psychological and physical difficulties in doctors and have negative outcomes for organization and patients. The aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of an induction programme on occupational distress of doctors. Methods/design: Doctors will be invited to take part in an online research. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Participants in the experimental groups will complete one of the induction topics (about stress at work). Before and after an induction programme participants will be asked to fill in an online survey about their current occupational distress and organizational well-being. Discussion: The investigators expect that doctors' psychological, physiological and organizational well-being will improve after an induction programme which should serve as a resource for better doctor's own health understanding.</brief_summary>
