	<brief_summary>Airway epithelium integrity is essential to maintain its role of mechanical and functional barrier. Recurrent epithelial injuries require a complex mechanism of repair to restore its integrity. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an abnormal airway epithelial repair may participate in airway remodelling. The objective was to determine if airway epithelial wound repair of airway epithelium is abnormal in COPD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for lung resection were prospectively recruited. Demographic, clinical data and pulmonary function tests results were recorded. Emphysema was visually scored and histological remodelling features were noted. Primary bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) were extracted and cultured for wound closure assay. The investigators determined the mean speed of wound closure (MSWC) and cell proliferation index, matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and cytokines levels in supernatants of BEC 18 hours after cell wounding. In a subset of patients, bronchiolar epithelial cells were also cultured for wound closure assay for MSWC analyze.</detailed_description>
