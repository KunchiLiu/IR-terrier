	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Dexlansoprazole in Healing and Maintaining Healing of Erosive Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being tested to treat people who have EE. This study will look at erosive esophageal healing in people who take dexlansoprazole. The study will enroll approximately 450 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups with 1:1 ratioâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Dexlansoprazole 60 mg - Lansoprazole 30 mg After 8 weeks of treatment, participants will be evaluated to assess esophageal healing. If the EE is healed participants will be randomly assigned to one of two different treatment groups with 1:1 ratio: - Dexlansoprazole 30 mg - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient. All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 39 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 5 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>

Participant is required to take excluded medications, or it is anticipated that the participant will require treatment with at least 1 of the disallowed concomitant medications during the study evaluation period. 2. Has a hypersensitivity to any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (including, but not limited to, lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole or ilaprazole), any component of dexlansoprazole, or antacid (example, magnesium trisilicate or similar antacid). 3.

The participant requires chronic use (&gt;12 doses per month) of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) NSAIDs within 30 days prior to the Screening Period and throughout the study. 6. Has comorbidities that could affect the esophagus (eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal varices, scleroderma, viral or fungal infection, esophageal strictures); a history of radiotherapy or cryotherapy of the esophagus; and a history of corrosive or physiochemical injury (with the possible inclusion in the study of those with Schatzki's ring). 7. Has a history of surgical procedures that may affect the esophagus (example, fundoplication and mechanical dilatation for esophageal strictures) or a history of gastric or duodenal surgery other than endoscopic removal of benign polyps. 8. Participant is known to have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or hepatitis, including hepatitis virus carriers (that is, hepatitis B surface antigen HBsantigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis C virus (HCV)antibody positive). 9. Has current ZollingerEllison syndrome (gastric acid hyper secretion) or a history of gastric acid hypersecretion. 10. Participant is scheduled for surgery that requires hospitalization or requires surgical treatment during his/her participation in the study. 11. Has donated or lost &gt;300 milliliter (mL) blood volume, undergone plasmapheresis, or has had a transfusion of any blood product within 90 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 12.
