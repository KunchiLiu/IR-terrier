	<brief_summary>Approximately 10 US Study Sites will participate over total 18 months Study population will consist of adults age 22 or over, reporting overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for at least 3 months. Primary Study Objective 1. To assess efficacy of the StimRouter stimulation therapy in improving OAB symptoms of urgency and frequency as measured by Patient Voiding Diary when targeting the posterior tibial nerve 2. To assess safety of the StimRouter therapy Secondary Study Objective To evaluate: Efficacy of the StimRouter stimulation therapy in decreasing specific OAB symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urinary urge incontinence as measured by the Global Response Assessment (GRA) and 7-day Patient Voiding Diary Study Design is prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the investigational and control groups in proportion of responders, defined as a return to normal voiding (7-day average in voids/leak episodes &lt; 8) OR &gt; 50% improvement in average voiding frequency above 8 that patient had at baseline OR &gt; 50% improvement in average number of moderate to severe urgency episodes at approximately three months after programming as measured by 7-day Patient Voiding Diary. Primary Outcomes: 1. Proportion of responders based on Patient Voiding Diary 2. Adverse Event Reports Secondary Endpoints: The secondary efficacy endpoint will be the difference in specific OAB symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urinary urge incontinence as measured based on (1) the difference in proportion of subjects in the investigational and control groups who have moderately or markedly improved overall response on a 7 level Global Response Assessment (GRA) at approximately three months after programming; and (2) the difference in responses on the 7-day Patient Voiding Diary between the baseline visit and approximately three months after programming. Secondary Outcomes: 1. Global Response Assessment (GRA) 2. Urgency, frequency, and urinary urge incontinence as measured by Daily Patient Voiding Diary</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Overactive Bladder Treatment Using StimRouter Neuromodulation System: A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in the Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) for Overactive Bladder study. After signing the informed consent and completing the screening visit, eligible candidates will be asked to (1) stop any OAB medications (including but not limited to anti-muscarinic medication or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) as well as stabilize dosage and frequency of any concomitant medications for 3 weeks, if applicable, and then (2) complete a daily Patient Voiding Diary for 7 days . Subjects will then return to the office for baseline review. If all screening and baseline criteria are met, the subject will be enrolled, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the "control group" or the "investigational group" and scheduled for implant with the StimRouter device. After approximately 3 weeks for healing post-implant, study participants will be programmed according to their randomization assignment. All subjects will be instructed to apply stimulation at least 3 days/week for at least 30 minutes/day (i.e., the minimum protocol requirements for device use) for 6 months and to apply stimulation when they anticipate OAB events. Patient Voiding Diaries will be completed by the participants for 7 days prior to each follow-up visit and provided to the office at each follow-up visit. Follow-up visits will occur at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 5 and Month 6. Each follow-up visit will include the review of subject voiding diaries and the completion of other subject questionnaires for measuring OAB and quality of life assessments. Final follow-up evaluations for all subjects will occur at Month6.</detailed_description>
