	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Dexlansoprazole on Heartburn Relief in Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being tested to treat heartburn in people who have non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study will look at heartburn relief in people who take dexlansoprazole. The study will enroll approximately 200 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups with 1:1 ratio â€”which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Dexlansoprazole 30 mg - Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient. All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the study, and will be asked to record any time they have heartburn symptoms in a diary. This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 11 weeks. Participants will make 4 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 5 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
