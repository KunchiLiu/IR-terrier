	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to show that postoperative Total Knee Replacement (TKR), an analgesic perineural catheter in position under sartorial (KTSS) best preserves motor quadriceps femoral perineural catheter that (KTF) infused with even low doses of local anesthetics, this motor being evaluated by a semi quantitative simple clinical test locking of the knee feasible at the bedside. Patients will be randomized in two arms: - catheter in position under sartorial (experimental group) - femoral catheter (control group)</brief_summary>
