	<brief_summary>In independent elderly people, the aim is to test recipes for different types of food from different countries (starter, main course with culinary aids, carrot purees, desserts and smoothies) likely to improve sensory acceptability of foods for elderly people who are dependent for their meals (persons for whom at least one meal per day is provided by a catering service - meals at home, old people's home). All of the recipes were developed thanks to the first two parts of the OPTIFEL project so as to take into account the needs of elderly people and recommendations in each country. The interest is to increase the sapidity/ attractiveness of meals by optimizing sensory properties and the nutritional content of the foods, to meet the nutritional needs of this specific population with enriched recipes (with leguminous proteins and/or vitamins and minerals and/or fibre) suitable for different cultures. This ongoing research is being conducted on 2-4 different variants of each type of product: the starter (a soup of legumes), the main dish (diced chicken with culinary aids) and garnished (carrot puree), an apple-based dessert and fruit smoothies. For each product family, two products will be selected for each country: the preferred product (highest hedonic value of recipes enriched with leguminous proteins and/or vitamins and minerals) and the standard product without enrichment. Finally, at the end of this study, nine products will have been chosen: 2 soups, 2 culinary aids, 2 carrot purees, 2 desserts and 1 smoothie</brief_summary>
