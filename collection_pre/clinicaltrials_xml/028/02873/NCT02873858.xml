	<brief_summary>Malnutrition is a frequent problem in persons older than 65 years: the prevalence of malnutrition can reach 25 to 29% in persons living at home who require help, figures vary between 19 and 38% for those living in institutions, and finally, the prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized elderly patients can reach 30 to 90%. A few studies have attempted to explain modifications in attitudes, behaviour, the frequency of meals or nutritional status in the elderly by a fall in chemosensory sensitivity The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that perhaps it is not as much the capacity to perceive a smell or a taste that affects eating behaviour in the elderly as their ability to distinguish between smells or tastes on the one hand (perceptual processing), and their ability to correctly interpret a chemosensory signal on the other (cognitive processing).</brief_summary>
