History of postexercise susceptibility to infections (e.g. upper respiratory tract symptoms) and/or other health conditions (infections, stress complaints) after strenuous exercise (eg. marathon, halfmarathon, bicycle races, triathlons, heavy training loads) within the last 5 years (to be distinctly documented at screening) 6. Readiness to comply with all study procedures, in particular: Consumption of the investigational product (IP) during the entire treatment period of the study Maintaining the habitual diet, with the exception of consumption of maximal 2 garlic cloves per week Adapt premarathon training / physical activity to generally accepted proven or individually successful training plan Adapt postmarathon training / physical activity to generally accepted proven or individually successful recovery plan Filling in diaries and questionnaires 7. Readiness to ensure generally proven or individually successful optimal food intake and rehydration before, during, and after the marathon. 8. Nonsmoker / smoking cessation of last ≥12 months prior to screening 9. Regular sleeping pattern (no suspicion of sleep disorder) in the three months prior to screening 10. Stable concomitant, permitted medication (if any) for at least last 2 weeks prior to screening and during the study 11. Women of childbearing potential only: 1. negative pregnancy testing (Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (ßHCG) in urine) at screening 2. commitment to use reliable contraception methods during the entire study Participation is based upon written informed consent form (ICF) by the participant following written and oral information by the investigator regarding nature, purpose, consequences and possible risks of the clinical study. 1. Known sensitivity to any ingredients of the IP 2. Additional strenuous exercise/activity other than regular occupational load, completing training runs / exercises prior the marathon. Additional strenuous exercise/activity other than regular occupational load and recovery exercise loads after the marathon 3. History of severe cardiovascular disease or collapse during a running event (half marathon, marathon etc.) and/or training 4. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) 5. Any abnormality observed in screening exercise ECG pointing to an increased cardiovascular risk (alternatively: any abnormality in the results of an exercise ECG performed in the last 6 weeks prior to screening pointing to an increased cardiovascular risk) 6. Any chronic disease affecting the upper respiratory tract and the lungs, eg. asthma bronchial, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or earsnosethroat (ENT) infection 7. Acute infection of ENT or upper respiratory tract (URT) within the last month prior to screening 8. Any nasal abnormalities: 1. History of nasal reconstructive surgery 2. Severe nasal septum deviation or other condition that could cause nasal obstruction 3. Presence of nasal ulcers or nasal polyps 9. Active organ or systemic diseases including severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or liver disorder 10. Known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency disease (e.g. HIV infection) 11. Known bleeding disorders such as bleeding ulcers, or haemophilia 12. Vaccination against influenza within 3 months prior to screening; any vaccination planned during the study 13. Anticoagulants such as warfarin 14. Systemic analgesics (other than paracetamol up to 2000mg/day or ibuprofen up to max. 800 mg/day, or if medically indicated and prescribed by a physician), antibiotics (unless medically indicated and prescribed by a physician) or decongestant nose drops / spray (except for isotonic sea water, or if medically indicated and prescribed by a physician) during the study 15. Use of medications or supplements influencing immune function (e.g. antihistamines, systemic corticosteroids, immunesuppressants), and physical performance, as per investigator's judgement, during the study 16. Use of any doping substance as listed by the "World AntiDoping Agency" at present or in the past, unless prescribed by a physician under a '"therapeutic use exemption", per investigator's judgement 17. Any use of food supplements containing vitamins, minerals, or trace elements, as per investigator's judgement, during the study 18. Alcohol abuse (men: ≥21 units/week, women: ≥14 units/ week; 1 unit equals approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits) 19. Women of childbearing potential: pregnant or breastfeeding 20. Participation in other studies within the last month prior to screening and during study 21. Any other clinically significant condition which in the investigator's opinion could interfere with the results of the study or the safety of the subject</criteria>
