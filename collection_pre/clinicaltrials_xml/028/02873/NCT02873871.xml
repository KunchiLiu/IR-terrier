	<brief_summary>Randomized clinical trial to compare radial artery patency after transradial coronary catheterization using 2 different hemostasis techniques. Patients submitted to diagnostic or therapeutic coronary catheterization will be prospectively enrolled in this single-center trial and will be randomized to radial hemostasis with TerumoBand® or a standardized compressive dressing with gauze and elastic bandage.</brief_summary>
