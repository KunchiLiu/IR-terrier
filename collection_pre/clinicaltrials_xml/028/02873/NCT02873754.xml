	<detailed_description>This pilot project proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a mobile intervention to target smoking-cessation and physical activity among low-income persons. The intervention, named Smoking Treatment and Exercise Program for Underserved Populations (STEP UP), combines a smartphone-based contingency-management application (app), which provides monetary reinforcement for smoking abstinence and physical activity, 5 weeks of telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to prevent relapse, nicotine replacement pharmacotherapy, and text-messaging to support physical-activity goals. Participants are given a smartphone, a compact carbon-monoxide (CO) monitor, with which recency of smoking can by determined, and a Garmin Vivosmart wristband step-tracker. Twice a day at semi-random intervals, participants are prompted by the app to submit a video of themselves blowing into the CO monitor. Monetary reinforcement is then immediately provided contingent upon a below-threshold CO reading. The app also continuously syncs with the Garmin step-tracker, providing supportive messaging and bonus incentivesâ€”namely doubled reinforcement for smoking abstinence among participants who meet personalized daily step goals. The expected outcome of the project is to provide information to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative approach in preparation for a subsequent larger clinical trial that builds upon the capabilities of mHealth technology to reduce the prevalence of smoking among low income smokers.</detailed_description>
