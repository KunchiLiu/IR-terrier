	<brief_summary>The study objective was to evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of two iStent devices in eyes of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma, washed out of two anti-glaucoma medications (one a Prostaglandin) prior to stent implantation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design is as follows: - Prospective, single-arm study. - Subjects with open-angle glaucoma and medicated IOP &gt; 18 mmHg and ≤ 30 mmHg. - Subjects on two topical ocular hypotensive medications (one a prostaglandin). - Implantation of two iStent inject devices (if IOP is &lt; 6 mmHg, at any point during the postoperative follow-up, medication will not be prescribed or will be discontinued). - IOP will be measured by two (2) observers to minimize bias; observer 1 will look through the slit lamp and turn the dial with readings being masked, and observer 2 will document the IOP. - Follow-up through 60 months postoperative (or up to 61 months if subject needs to undergo terminal washout). - Descriptive statistics will be tabulated. - Medical therapy considered necessary for the subject's welfare can be implemented at any time during the study at the investigator's discretion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening Exam Phakic patients or pseudophakic patients with posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PCIOLs) Primary openangle glaucoma (including pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative) C/D ratio ≤ 0.9 Visual field defects, or nerve abnormality characteristic of glaucoma Two topical hypotensive medications at time of screening exam IOP &gt; 18 mmHg and ≤ 30 mmHg (medicated) at screening exam Study eye BCVA 20/100 or better Normal angle anatomy as determined by gonioscopy Absence of peripheral anterior synechia (PAS), rubeosis or other angle abnormalities that could impair proper placement of stent Baseline Exam Subject has completed appropriate medication washout Mean IOP &gt; 22 mmHg and ≤ 38 mmHg after antiglaucoma medication washout period A 3mmHg IOP increase over screening mean IOP Screening Exam Aphakic patients or pseudophakic patients with anterior chamber IOLs (ACIOLs) Prior stent implantations (study eye) Traumatic, uveitic, neovascular, or angleclosure glaucoma; or glaucoma associated with vascular disorders Functionally significant visual field loss, including severe nerve fiber bundle defects Prior incisional glaucoma surgery Prior SLT within 90 days prior to screening Prior ALT Iridectomy or laser iridotomy Ineligibility for ocular hypotensive medication washout period as determined by the investigator. Any active corneal inflammation or edema (e.g., keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratouveitis) Clinically significant corneal dystrophy (e.g., bullous keratopathy, Fuch's dystrophy); any guttata Corneal surgery (prior or anticipated) of any type (including LASIK, LASEK, PRK, etc.) that may interfere with IOP measurement reliability Corneal opacities that would inhibit visualization of the nasal angle Congenital or traumatic cataract Retinal or optic nerve disorders that are not associated with the existing glaucoma condition Elevated episcleral venous pressure such as associated with: active thyroid orbitopathy; cavernous sinus fistula; SturgeWeber syndrome; orbital tumors; orbital congestive disease Clinically significant sequelae from trauma Chronic ocular inflammatory disease or presence of active ocular inflammation Baseline Exam Subject did not complete medication washout Mean IOP &lt; 22 mmHg or &gt; 38 mmHg after antiglaucoma medication washout Subject does not have a 3mmHg IOP increase over screening mean diurnal</criteria>
