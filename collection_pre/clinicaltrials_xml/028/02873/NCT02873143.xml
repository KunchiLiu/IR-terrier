	<brief_summary>The prevalence of adolescent knee pain is 33%, and patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common diagnosis with a nontraumatic onset. The 5-year prognosis of adolescent PFP compared with other types of knee pain is unknown. In 2011, a cohort of 2200 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years answered an online questionnaire on musculoskeletal pain. Of these, 504 reported knee pain, and 153 of these were clinically diagnosed with PFP. Now, after 5 years, the 504 adolescents, as well as 252 randomly selected adolescents who did not report knee pain in 2011, will be contacted again to gain insights into their prognosis.</brief_summary>
