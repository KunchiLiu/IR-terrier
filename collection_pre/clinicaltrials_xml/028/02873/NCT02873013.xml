The registration period for this study will be three years followed by 7 years of follow-up study, and research will be implemented across a wider range of Asian countries, with new institutions participating for the purposes of this study. As this study will be an observational study the acquisition of data will be relatively simple, and as the content of the study will be almost identical to the study conducted by J-CaP in 2010, a system for research implementation is already established at J-CaP.</detailed_description>
