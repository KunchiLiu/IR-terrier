	<brief_summary>The concept of early rehabilitation (ERAS: enhanced after-surgery recovery) was introduced by Kehlet et al. in 1995, as part of the colon surgery. This program is a support for patients combining laparoscopic surgery, epidural analgesia, early refeeding and rapid mobilization of patients. This strategy targets multiple elements (20 items) to support pre-, intra- and postoperative patients. This reduces the pain and the different organ dysfunction induced by surgical stress significantly decreasing length of hospital stay, postoperative morbidity and costs. Furthermore, early mobilization of patients is fundamental to the ERAS method. Few studies have analyzed the influence of preoperative exercise on postoperative rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
