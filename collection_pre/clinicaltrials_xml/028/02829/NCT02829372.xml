	<criteria>1. Progressive HER2 positive solid tumours (immunohistochemistry [IHC] positive or equivocal) with no available standard or curative treatment. 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 02. 3. Subjects who will enter Cohort 1 or 2 need a preexisting, functioning, central venous access in place for the administration of the study drug. 1. Active infectious disease considered by the Investigator to be incompatible with the protocol. 2. Patients not recovered from any therapyrelated toxicities from previous therapies to at least CTCAE â‰¤ Grade 1 except in case of liver metastases or Gilbert's Syndrome or alopecia. 3. Brain metastases that are symptomatic or untreated or that require current therapy. 4. Previous treatment with immunotherapy within 8 weeks of starting study medication, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, moleculartargeted therapy, or biological therapies (including HER2 directed therapies) within 4 weeks of starting study medication, or hormone therapy within 2 weeks of starting study medication. 5. Use of any investigational drug within the past 4 weeks before start of study medication or concomitantly with this study except for investigational immunestimulatory therapy (e.g. checkpointregulator targeted treatment). The minimum washout period should be 8 weeks before starting the study medication. 6. Any history or evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular disease defined as at least one of following criteria: 1. Baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% or major wall dyskinesias via echocardiography (ECHO). 2. History or evidence of poorly controlled arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg). 3. Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy, except for betablockers, calcium antagonists and digoxin. 4. Clinically significant valvular heart disease. 5. Myocardial infarction or instable angina pectoris within the previous 6 months. 6. Documented history of congestive heart failure (CHF) of any New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria. 7. History of exposure to the cumulative doses of anthracyclines as follows: prior anthracycline cumulative exposure &gt; 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent. 7. Known allergy to any of the ingredients in the formulation or known allergy to any related class of compounds.</criteria>
