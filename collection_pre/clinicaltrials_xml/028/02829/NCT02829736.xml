	<brief_summary>Chest tubes are used routinely although preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and safety of intraoperative chest drain removal. Previous studies are however either retrospective or mainly concerning benign disease. Hypothesis: Participants treated without post-operative chest tube after thoracoscopic wedge resection have less pain, better pulmonary function and similar complication profile than participants treated with standard post-operative chest tube, and could possibly be discharged earlier.</brief_summary>
