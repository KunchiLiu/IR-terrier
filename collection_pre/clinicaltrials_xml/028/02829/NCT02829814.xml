	<brief_summary>The present trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets, taken daily at bedtime after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with fibromyalgia. The use of low-dose sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine (TNX-102 SL) dosed nightly for fibromyalgia is supported by the results of TNX-CY-F202 Phase 2b study -- the results provide strong evidence that TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg dosed nightly results in beneficial effects upon pain, sleep and other FM symptomatology.</brief_summary>
