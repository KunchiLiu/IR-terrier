	<brief_title>Precarious Elderly Patient Supported For Cancer Impact on Quality Of Life of a Domotic And Remote Assistance Approach for Elderly Patients Supported For Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer, Socially Isolated</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France, social isolation and prevalence of cancer increases with the population ageing: it is estimated that in 2050, 1 of 2 cancers will be diagnosed in patients over than 75 years old. Meanwhile, the share of isolated elderly increased from 16 to 24% between 2010 and 2013. It is shown that socially precarious elderly have an increased risk of dying from cancer. Among the areas of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), social assessment is crucial. It can be assessed by a self-administered 8 items questionnaire, derived from MOS-SS (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey) and validated in the elderly supported for cancer: m-MOS-SS (modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support). Once spotted, social isolation can be averted by appropriate measures, provided the intervention of a multidisciplinary team. In this area, the techniques of automation and remote assistance might have an interest. They already demonstrated their impact on falls prevention, addiction, feelings of social isolation and quality of life. However, little is known about the impact of social isolation in elderly patients supported for cancer. The objective of the PREDOMOS study is to evaluate the impact of establishing a Program of geriatric and Social intervention associated techniques of Domotic and Remote assistance (PS-DR) on the improvement of quality of life of elderly patients, isolated or at risk of isolation, treated for locally advanced or metastatic cancer.</detailed_description>
