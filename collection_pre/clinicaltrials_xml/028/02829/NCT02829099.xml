	<criteria>Part 1: advanced stage solid tumors; Part 2: nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer and cutaneous melanoma Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1 Adequate organ function as defined in the protocol A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [betahCG]) pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to the first dose of study drug During the study and for at least 120 days after receiving the last dose of study drug, in addition to the highly effective method of contraception, a man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (example [eg.], condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), or who is sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a condom Malignancy other than the disease under study within 2 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence) Symptomatic brain metastases; asymptomatic brain metastases are allowed provided that they have been treated, have been stable for greater than (&gt;) 6 weeks as documented by radiographic imaging, and do not require prolonged (&gt;14 days) systemic corticosteroid therapy Treatment with any local or systemic antineoplastic therapy or investigational anticancer agent within 14 days or 4 halflives, whichever is longer, up to a maximum washout period of 28 days prior to the initiation of study drug administration Toxicities from previous anticancer therapies have not resolved to baseline levels or to Grade 1 or less except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy Major surgery (eg., requiring general anesthesia) within 3 weeks before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the subject is expected to participate in the study</criteria>
