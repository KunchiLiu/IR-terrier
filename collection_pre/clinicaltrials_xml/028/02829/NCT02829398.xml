	<brief_summary>The risk of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with large cerebral artery vasospasm, but vasospasm is not a strong predictor for DCI. Assessment of cerebral autoregulation with transcranial Doppler (TCD) may improve the prediction of DCI. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the value of TCD-derived variables to be used alone or in combination for prediction of DCI</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Group 1 : â€¢ Patients who presented a ruptured aneurysm by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) older than 72 hours. Diagnosis of SAH was confirmed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or lumbar puncture as recommended symptomatic aneurysm treated with endovascular, Absence of achieving a lumbar puncture, Patients affiliated to a social security scheme, Patients who have given their free and informed consent and signed the consent or consent of the family. Group 2 : healthy volunteers with cerebrospinal fluid sample Patients with no readable acoustic temporal bone window Patients with previous disease that might impair cerebral autoregulation (e.g., carotid stenosis, history of stroke or head injury).</criteria>
