	<brief_summary>The animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is now considered a non-drug care and is often used in geriatrics. Many studies have shown a link between the presence of the animal and the psycho-behavioral symptoms decrease in dementia (PBSD) such as depression, anxiety or irritability that affects their quality of life and improved cognitive abilities. However, many methodological flaws in these researches exist. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of AAT on the well-being of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) at the stage of Major Neuro Cognitive Disorder (NCD) at short and medium term (before care, during care (at the beginning and end of each session), 1 week after, 2 weeks and 1 month after the last session) compared to a group receiving the same stimulation without the dog's response. Patients will be seen in groups of 4 to 6 people at 8 workshops. 2 groups will be formed: AAT group versus control group. The only difference between these two groups is the intervention of the dog at each workshop in the AAT group. Each workshop will consist of three identical times. It will begin with a 15 minute introductory activity, the first goal will be to establish a relationship with patients (patients-patients and patients-caregivers) and a 40 minute cognitive stimulation, identical in the 2 groups, will be proposed and finally 5 minutes will be devoted to the closing of the session This study should highlight a positive effect of animal assisted therapy on the well-being, PBSD, depression, anxiety and cognitive abilities and a long-term retention of these positive effects.</brief_summary>
