	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent painful crises with ischemia resulting from vascular occlusion. Adults with SCD have increased arterial stiffness and reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD), due to impaired release of substances such as nitric oxide. The present study assess the vascular properties of carotid and brachial arteries in children with SCD compared with a control group without cardiovascular risk factors.</brief_summary>
