	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation happens after liver resection for HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, particularly for those with positive serum HBV-DNA . The incidence rate and risk factors of HBV reactivation after hepatectomy for serum HBV-DNA negative HBV-related HCC are unclear.From July 2012 to December 2015, 174 consecutive patients with serum HBV-DNA negative HBV-related HCC underwent resection were prospectively enrolled in the studied. There are 66 patients received preoperative antiviral therapy (antiviral group) and 108 patients did not receive any antiviral therapy (non-antiviral group). The incidence of HBV reactivation, risk factors of liver function were analyzed in perioperative period. HBV reactivation developed in 30 patients (27.8%) in the non- antiviral group and 2 patients (3.0%) in the antiviral group, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that minor hepatectomy (HR, 4.695; 95% CI, 1.257-17.537, P = 0.021) and without antiviral therapy (HR, 8.164; 95% CI, 1.831-36.397, p =0.006) were risk factors attributed to HBV reactivation. Patients in antiviral group and non-antiviral group or reactivation group and without reactivation group have similar ALT, TBil, ALB, and PT in 7 days after resection. However, patients in antiviral group have significantly better ALT and ALB on day 30th after resection than those in control group. Moreover, similar phenomenon were observed when comparing those with or without HBV reactivation. Resection could lead to HBV reactivation during the perioperative period for serum HBV DNA negative HBV-related HCC, especially in patients who did not receive any antiviral therapy. Anti-HBV therapy can reduce the risk of reactivation, thus improving liver function after hepatectomy.</detailed_description>
