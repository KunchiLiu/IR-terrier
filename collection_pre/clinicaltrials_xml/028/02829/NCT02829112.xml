	<brief_summary>Shulman fasciitis or eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare inflammatory disease, usually benign but disabling, described by Shulman in 1974. The diagnosis is suggested by the clinic, confirmed by MRI and confirmed by histology, there really no published diagnostic criteria validated for this rare disease. The low number of cases reported in the literature reflects the difficulty of studying the epidemiology of this disease, to establish and evaluate therapeutic strategies and to assess prognosis. Work on this subject are few. To our knowledge, no study has previously used to estimate the incidence and prevalence of this disease. Therefore, the investigators want to determine the prevalence of FEs in Alsace in 2016 by a study "capture-recapture" using several independent sources of identification of cases in order to have recent epidemiological data and learn more about this disease.</brief_summary>
