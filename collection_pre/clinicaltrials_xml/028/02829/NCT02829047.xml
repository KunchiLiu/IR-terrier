	<brief_summary>The study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of the Vibrant Capsule in relieving constipation. One arm will be assessed: Vibrant Capsule administered with a sequence of one per day for 2 days, followed by one day without, one per day for 2 days followed by one day without, etc. (14 capsules in 3 weeks). The study will have one interim analysis. Patients will follow a 2 weeks baseline period and then take the Vibrant Capsule for a treatment period of 6 weeks. Data reporting will be done on an electronic Case Report Form and an eDiary. During the 2 weeks of baseline, patients will be asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement to relieve their constipation. After 14 days the patients will return and eligibility will be re-assessed. Patients will be trained on how to use the base unit. Patients will be instructed to complete a simple patient eDiary each day throughout the duration of the study. After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient will attend for evaluation and to receive new capsules. A final visit will take place at the end of the 6 week treatment period. Patients will receive phone calls up to twice per week and patient compliance will be monitored during the 8 weeks of the study.</brief_summary>
