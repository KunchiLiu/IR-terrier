	<brief_title>The Effect of Anesthetic Technique on VEGF-C and PGE2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyomas is the most common benign tumor of uterus, the most common tumor in women as well. Like many other forms of tumor, it requires an independent blood supply to enlarge. This process, angiogenesis, is mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Several studies have confirmed that VEGF-C has a high level in patients with uterine leiomyomas, which has also been demonstrated that it was related to occurrence and growth of uterine leiomyomas because it's capable of promoting angiogenesis, mitogenic, and vascular permeability-enhancing activities. Also, some researchers suggested that suppression of prostaglandin synthesis (including PGE2) via cyclooxygenase type-2 (COX-2) enzyme inhibition may reduce the incidence of some tumor. The aim of this study is to verify the effect of anesthetic technique on the change of postoperative serum VEGF-C and PGE2, and to explore the potential impact of the anesthetic technique on leiomyomas recurrence and growth after the surgery of abdominal myomectomy.</detailed_description>
