	<brief_summary>The peritoneum is the second most common site of recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer. Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy improve the prognosis of these patients and incorporates surgical removal of all visible disease followed by chemical destruction of microscopic disease through chemoperfusion. The most validated predictors of outcome are preoperative tumor burden measured in terms of the peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) and completeness of cytoreduction (CC score). Diagnostic laparoscopy prior to resection is widely used in hepatopancreaticobiliary and colorectal cancer and has been shown to be effective in excluding unnecessary laparotomy associated with higher morbidity.</brief_summary>
