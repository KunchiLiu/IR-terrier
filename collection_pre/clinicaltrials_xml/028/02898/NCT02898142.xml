	<brief_summary>Fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) depends on increased production of intestinal triglyceride rich lipoproteins in patients with isolated fasting hypertriglyceridemia. The objective of this study is to compare the serum apoB48 rate after a standardized load test, among patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and patients with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intestines and Liver Contribution to Fasting Postprandial Hypertriglyceridemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two major studies in 2007 showed that the occurrence of myocardial infarction and death was more frequent in subjects with the highest "non-fasting" triglycerides level. This is an important point that supports the hypothesis that the development of atheromatous lesions also depends on "remnant" of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) products such as chylomicrons in the intestine. The elevation of triglycerides in postprandial period depends on the intestinal production of TRL that can be excessively increased as has been shown in diabetes. Accordingly, it is necessary to distinguish between hepatic and intestinal production of TRL in hypertriglyceridemic patients particularly during postprandial period. TRL contain a single molecule of apolipoprotein B (apoB), apoB100 when produced by the liver or apoB-48 when they are produced by the gut. It is well known that apo B100 is the lipoprotein of the VLDL which is increased in hypertriglyceridemia. But preliminary works showed that fasting concentrations of apoB48 were correlated with triglycerides in some hypertriglyceridemic patients. These results suggest an intestinal part in fasting triglycerides levels. It therefore appears that the liver and intestine contribute to hypertriglyceridemia, but the intestinal part is not established particularly in isolated hypertriglyceridemia. The detection of abnormalities in the production of LRT would consider intestinal bowel as a target organ for the initiation of specific lipid-lowering therapy.</detailed_description>
