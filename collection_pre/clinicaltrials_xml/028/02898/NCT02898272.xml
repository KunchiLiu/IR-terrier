	<brief_summary>The SCCOR Minorities study will recruit minority participants from the COPDGene cohort, in whom the University of Pittsburgh has already obtained baseline and five year data, in order to enhance bone mineral density and vascular function data collection from minority smokers. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will be obtained to measure bone mineral density. Non-invasive vascular studies will be performed to measure endothelial function. Questionnaires regarding symptoms and activity levels will be administered and a blood sample will be obtained in participants in which blood samples are not already available from the COPDGene study visits.</brief_summary>
