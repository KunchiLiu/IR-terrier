	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to show that cardiovascular risk factors associated with the chronic elevation of arterial resistance may be associated with "false" profiles of intracranial hypertension during transcranial doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral arteries in intensive care unit patients. A "false" profile of intracranial hypertension is defined by a high pulsatility index without any intracranial pathology.</brief_summary>
