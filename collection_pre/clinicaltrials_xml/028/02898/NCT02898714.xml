	<brief_summary>On the first of July 2016, the Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitor (FGM) will be reimbursed in Belgium by means of a new diabetes reimbursement program for adults. For children, the Freestyle Libre FGM is also reimbursed by means of a new reimbursement program from the first of August 2016 onwards. Making this the only way to receive the device in Belgium. To understand the impact of this new FGM on diabetes patients in UZ Leuven and OLVZ Aalst, we want to study the use of the device by our patients by means of an observational study where patients complete questionnaires at regular time points in the first year of usage and after 24 months Clinical data will be gathered during the routine clinical visits as part of the reimbursement program.</brief_summary>
