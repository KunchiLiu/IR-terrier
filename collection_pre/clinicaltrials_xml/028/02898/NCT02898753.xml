	<brief_summary>Phase I/II study enrolling up to 16 patients in a three-month, Randomized, Parallel Active Control, Single and Repeat Dose, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD) and Preliminary Efficacy of VAL-1221 Delivered Intravenously (IV) in Ambulatory and Ventilator-free Patients with Late-Onset GSD-II (Pompe Disease) Study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VAL-1221 Delivered Intravenously in Ambulatory and Ventilator-free Patients With Late-Onset Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled in a consecutive manner and randomized to either treatment with VAL-1221 or positive control (rhGAA) in cohorts of patients each: Cohort 1: VAL-1221 1 mg/kg IV (n=3) every other week or control (n=1) Cohort 2: VAL-1221 3 mg/kg IV (n=3) every other week or control (n=1) Cohort 3: VAL-1221 10 mg/kg IV (n=3) every other week or control (n=1) Each patient randomized to VAL-1221 will receive 7 every other week IV infusions of VAL-1221 over 12 weeks. VAL-1221 cohorts will be enrolled in a sequential fashion. Patients randomized to rhGAA will be maintained on their current dose and regimen of Myozyme or Lumizyme. The first patient in each cohort to receive VAL-1221 will be followed for any safety concerns (including infusion related reactions) for a minimum of 48 hours before the remaining VAL-1221-treated patients in the cohort receive infusions. Once all patients in a cohort have been enrolled and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has reviewed at least one month of safety data in all patients, the next cohort may begin enrollment and treatment. A final assessment will occur approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of VAL-1221 to collect additional safety data. Safety will be assessed continuously throughout the study. All patients who complete the study, including those maintained on rhGAA, will be offered inclusion in an extension study once the optimal dose of VAL-1221 has been determined.</detailed_description>
