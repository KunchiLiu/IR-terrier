	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 when given together in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery or ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or triple-negative breast cancer that has come back. Olaparib and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Olaparib and Hsp90 Inhibitor AT13387 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Primary Peritoneal, or Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTDs) of olaparib and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 (AT13387) administered in combination in patients with advanced solid tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with olaparib and AT13387 administered in combination as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0. II. To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination of olaparib and AT13387. III. To determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of olaparib and AT13387. IV. To document anti-tumor activity of the combination of olaparib and AT13387 as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and progression free survival (PFS). OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 (course 0). Beginning in course 1, patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For the dose escalation cohort, patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective For the dose expansion cohort, participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of either: Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer of high grade serous histology which has recurred despite standard therapy; up to 3 prior lines in the platinum resistant setting (i.e. up to 3 lines after patients have become platinum resistant); patients may have received unlimited lines while platinum sensitive Triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) which has recurred despite standard therapy; recurrent TNBC needs to have metastatic disease and patients with an in breast recurrence are not eligible; up to 4 prior lines in the recurrent setting for patients with triplenegative breast cancer are allowed; for the ovarian cancer, there will be up to 3 For the dose escalation cohort, patients may have received any number of prior therapies and be eligible for this study For the dose expansion cohort, patients with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer must have platinum resistant disease defined as progression within 6 months after last platinum regimen; platinum refractory disease is allowed For the dose expansion cohort, patients with triplenegative breast cancer may not be BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers There must be availability of a formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tumor specimen Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;

450 ms Any clinically significant electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, should be corrected before treatment Prestudy evaluation must include an ophthalmologic exam by an ophthalmologist (not optometrist) and should minimally include visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, and funduscopic examination; follow up eyeexams will only be performed if subjects develop/report any visual impairment; visual impairment may include peripheral flashes (photopsia), blurred or double vision, floaters, color distortion and dimness, difficulties with light/dark accommodation, tunnel vision or other field defects, halos, apparent movement of stationary objects, and complex disturbances; follow up eyeexams will minimally include visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, and funduscopic examination; additional testing will be based on symptoms, what is observed and ophthalmologist recommendations For the expansion cohort only: measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 with at least one measurable target lesion Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of olaparib and/or AT13387 administration Patients must be able to swallow tablets and have no significant impairment in gastrointestinal absorption Three biopsies, one pretreatment, one after olaparib alone and one after one of the combinations of olaparib/AT13387 will be voluntary, but encouraged in the expansion and dose escalation cohorts Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier All acute, clinically significant treatmentrelated toxicity from prior therapy, except for alopecia, must have resolved to grade =&lt;

breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib or AT13387 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Known history of QT/QTc prolongation or Torsades de Pointes (TdP); patients who are currently receiving treatment with medication with a known risk to prolong the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drugs Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible</criteria>
