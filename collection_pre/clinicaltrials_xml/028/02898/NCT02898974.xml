	<brief_summary>Medical marijuana is commonly prescribed people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for symptom, e.g. spasticity and pain, management. Unfortunately not much is known about its effects outside the treatment for these 2 symptoms. Several previous studies have suggested people with MS using medical marijuana have lower levels of physical disability and improved walking abilities. A major limitation of these previous studies is that the investigators used subjective measures of motor function. In this proposed observational case-control study the investigators plan to objectively measure multiple domains of motor function, such as: fatigue, strength, and walking ability. No marijuana will be brought on to campus or given to participants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To investigate the effects of medical marijuana usage on physical function the investigators will employ an observational case-control design. Cases (MS medical marijuana users) will be compared to age, sex, and disease duration matched controls (MS non-cannabis users).</detailed_description>
