	<brief_summary>Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a therapeutic strategy for protecting organs or tissue against the detrimental effects of acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. It remains unknown whether this can be used in retinal vascular occlusive diseases. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether the autoregulation of retinal vessel diameters in normal persons change after remote ischemic conditioning.</brief_summary>
