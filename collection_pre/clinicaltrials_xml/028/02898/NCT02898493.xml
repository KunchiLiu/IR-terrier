	<brief_summary>The evaluation of quality of life in health is particularly important for measuring the impact of the chronic diseases. The scales of measure constitute the main measurement tool in clinical trials because of their psychometrics properties and of their ease of use. Among these scales, the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire ( EQ-5D) were widely validated in various populations, of which the population of the diabetics patients. Both scales have validated versions in French. In the Antilles and in Reunion Island, diabetes is a frequent pathology and is the subject of many clinical and epidemiological trials. One of the difficulties encountered during the implementation of these studies is the absence of measurement tools validated for these populations. Investigators thus suggest, within a common workgroup uniting Guadeloupe, Martinique and Reunion Island, adapting and validating these scales according to an identical procedure in Creole from Guadeloupe, from Martinique and from Reunion Island and validating the French versions of these scales in their populations of type II diabetics patients.</brief_summary>
