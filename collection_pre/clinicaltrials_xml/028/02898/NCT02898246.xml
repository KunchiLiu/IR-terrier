	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed Fear of Activity in Situations - Heart Failure (FActS-HF 15) scale. The FActS-HF 15 is a questionnaire assessing fear of physical activity (fear of movement) in patients with chronic heart failure. FActS-HF 15 assesses cognitions and emotions that can occur during physical activity, independent of avoidance behavior. Firstly, the study aims at evaluating the instrument's reliability and validity and to investigate associations of fear of physical activity with demographic, medical, and psychosocial patient characteristics. Secondly, the study aims at assessing everyday physical activity using accelerometric measures to test the hypothesis that fear of physical activity in patients with heart failure is related with lower actual physical activity.</brief_summary>
