	<brief_title>Telephone-linked Home-based Exercise Training in PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale: Nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are thought to be present from the early stages of disease and are often more disabling and resistant to treatment than motor symptoms. One of the most important and serious of these symptoms is depression. However, there is no consensus on best pharmacological treatment for depression in PD as efficacy is lacking and there is much concern about polypharmacy and safety of various antidepressant medications. Therefore, it is essential that the investigators characterize the effects of nonpharmacological interventions on depression in PD. A number of studies have shown significant benefits of exercise in reducing depressive symptoms. Emerging studies indicate similar benefits of exercise in the form of resistance training in limiting depression in older adults as well as in those with PD. Objective: The investigators hypothesize that a home-based exercise intervention will reduce depression in Veterans with depression in PD. Methods: The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial of a structured exercise intervention, evaluating effects on depression. Community-dwelling Veterans with depression in PD will be randomized to the exercise intervention or a health education control intervention. Participants will be male and female Veterans with a physician diagnosis of idiopathic, typical PD, with at least 2 of 3 cardinal signs of PD, response to dopaminergic medication, and depression. The interventions will last 6 months.</detailed_description>
