	<brief_summary>The research question is "Are the different types of house in Ho Chi Minh city equally contributing to chronic respiratory diseases?". According to this question, a cross-sectional and explorative study was set up to explore the differences in the environmental characteristics and prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases among common housing types in Ho Chi Minh city. Preliminary work was performed in 100 houses (20 houses per type, included tube houses, rental houses, rural houses, slum and apartment) from November 2013 to June 2015. It included measures by environmental devices, questionnaires and indoor activities diaries.
