	<brief_summary>Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery consists in nuclear lens fragmentation, followed by ultrasound phacoemulsification of nuclear lens, which is then removed. It can be assumed that fragmenting the nuclear lens in more pieces could facilitate the post-laser ultrasound phacoemulsification to extract the lens, with a lesser amount of ultrasonic energy. The decrease of ultrasonic energy delivered during cataract surgery is beneficial to the patient because it optimizes the vitality of corneal endothelial cells, which ensure corneal transparency.</brief_summary>
