	<brief_summary>Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations (Pah) Are Studied As An Indirect Measure Of Access To Primary Care And Of The Interface Between Primary And Secondary Care. A Previous Work Unveils Considerable Geographic Variation In The Rate Of Pah In France And Suggest That Primary Care Organization Might Play A Role In This Variation. However, A Limitation Of This Work Lies In The Lack Of Data On Actual Primary Care Utilization. The Aim Of This Study Is To Analyze The Role Of Primary Care In The Variation Of Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations At the Zip Code Level, In The French Region Languedoc-Roussillon-Midi-Pyrénées. The investigator will implement An Ecological Approach In Which The Geographic Variation In The Rate Of Pah Is Analyzed In The French Region Lrmp, Year 2014. Age- And Sex-Adjusted Rate Of Pah By Zip Codes (N=612) Is Modeled Using A Spatial Regression Model.</brief_summary>
