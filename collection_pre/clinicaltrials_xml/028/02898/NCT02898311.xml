	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the success rate, as the biological and prosthesis complications, of posterior single-unit implants immediately loaded with a chair side Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) composite crown, after a follow-up period of 6 months,1,2,3,4 and 5 years. Complementary ex vivo analyses will be performed to evaluate the wear of restorations. The time and cost benefit of the presented digital workflow, as patient centered outcomes will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
