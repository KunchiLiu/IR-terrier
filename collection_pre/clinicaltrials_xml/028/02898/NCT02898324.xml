	<brief_summary>Bullying is a major problem worldwide and, with no exception, in Chile. Bullying is defined as a systematic aggressive behavior against a victim who cannot defend himself or herself. Victims suffer many consequences such as social isolation, psychological maladjustment, and self-injury behavior. Additionally, bullies have a higher risk for conduct problems and substance use disorders. These problems appear to last in time, affecting mental health even years later since the experience of bullying. There are few studies in Chile aiming to determine the prevalence of bullying. In one of such studies, 47% of the students reported having been bullied during the last month before the application of the questionnaire. Even though there are many initiatives and guidelines in Chile supported by the government to help schools in order to deal with bullying, there is no any cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to assess the effectiveness of an anti-bullying program. KiVa anti-bullying prevention program contains universal and indicated actions. Main universal actions for 5 to 6 graders consist of 10 two-hours lessons given during a year and an online game, which have the aim to raise awareness of the role of the group in bullying, increase empathy and promote strategies to support victims. Indicated actions consist of a set of discussion groups with the victims and with the bullies with proper follow-up. The aims of this study are: 1) To develop a culturally appropriate version of the Kiva material, and 2) to test its effectiveness of KiVa program with and without the online game, to reduce bullying behavior among low-income primary schools in Santiago using a cluster RCT design with three arms: i) KiVa full program group, ii) KiVa without online game program group, and iii) Control group.</brief_summary>
