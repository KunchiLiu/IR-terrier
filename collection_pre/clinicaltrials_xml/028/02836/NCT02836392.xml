	<brief_summary>This is a translational, multicentre questionnaire study. The study design follows that of a cross sectional, quantitative research approach. Data collection will involve self-administered, paper-based questionnaires. The method of data collection allows for a large sample size without major expense. The questionnaires are comprised of several questions examining areas such as demographic details, cancer diagnosis, understanding of the term 'clinical trials', attitudes to personal participation in cancer clinical research and the experience of patients who previously participated in a cancer clinical trial. The study will be opened in all interested hospitals in Ireland following initiation of the study at each site. Questionnaire completion will be seen as implied informed consent and no formal consent will need to be signed by the patient. The paper-based questionnaire responses will be electronically and anonymously recorded in a computer database to facilitate analysis.</brief_summary>
