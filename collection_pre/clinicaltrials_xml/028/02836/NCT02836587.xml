	<brief_summary>Fall related injuries are major health problem which effect especially elderly population. After experiencing a fall, most of the elderly are unable to resume their previous mobility and the fear of future falls affects their daily life. Falls in elderly population are often related to balance or gait problems. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of balance training on postural and motor control of healthy elderly participants. The study is designed as a parallel interventional study with experimental and control group (allocation ratio 1:1). Participants' general health, balance abilities, fear of falling and gait stability and variability will be assessed on the baseline measurement, right after and 2 months after the completion of the training programme. Experimental group will undergo training focused on development of balance abilities and strength twice a week (60 minutes in length each) for 8 weeks. Participants will receive individualized exercises which will be focused on the main 4 types - stance exercises, gait and transition exercises and strength exercises especially focused on muscle strength of lower extremities.</brief_summary>
