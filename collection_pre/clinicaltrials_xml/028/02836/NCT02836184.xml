	<brief_title>Nicotinic Acid in Hemodialysis Patients With Hyperphosphatemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperphosphatemia is an important risk factor affecting long-term survival in patients with hemodialysis. Nicotinic acids, as well as its metabolites nicotinamide, were found to inhibit the sodium-phosphorus co-transporter on animal intestines. Several studies from other countries demonstrated that nicotinamide can reduce blood phosphorus levels in end-stage kidney disease patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nicotinic acids on hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients of ethnic Han live in China. The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Eligible patients will be randomized to 6 wk of nicotinic acids or calcium carbonate. After a 2-wk washout period, patients switched to 6 wk of the alternative therapy. The primary measurement is the change in serum phosphorus during the whole term of each arm. Statistical analysis will be performed using two-sample paired-group t test.The significance level of the analysis was set to 0.05. All other adverse reactions will be analysed and reported, if there.</detailed_description>
