	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate how much galcanezumab gets into the body after it is given as an injection just under the skin by two different devices. This study will measure how much galcanezumab reaches the blood stream and will test how it affects calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) in blood. Information about any side effects that may occur will be collected. The study will last about 20 weeks for each participant. Screening is required within 45 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
