	<brief_summary>New markers of viral activity are now under investigation. Aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of new antiretroviral drugs by monitoring HIV-DNA dynamics in HIV-positive population. In HIV/HCV coinfected population, the study of HIV reservoir dynamics and the analysis of the prevalence of HCV resistance-associated mutations will help clinicians to improve the management of coinfected patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>New markers of viral activity are now under investigation. Besides HIV-RNA and CD4 cells count, HIV-DNA is an emerging marker of viral reservoir, that seems to be associated with the risk of HIV-related diseases, especially in HCV coinfected patients. New antiretroviral drugs, particularly integrase inhibitors, are expected to decrease residual viremia and, consequently, viral reservoir. Monitoring of HIV-DNA dynamics during antiretroviral treatment could lead to a better management of HIV infected population. Also, the role of HCV in influencing HIV natural history requires careful monitoring. In particular, with a broader use of direct acting antiretroviral, the analysis of prevalence of HCV resistance associated mutation will be more and more important to manage patients with treatment failure.</detailed_description>
