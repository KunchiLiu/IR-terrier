Active malignancy Significant immunological illnesses/deficiencies Use of any immunomodulatory agents within 30 days prior to study enrollment. Recent active illness (2 months) History of tuberculosis, lung cancer, asthma and bronchiectasis COPD GOLD Stage 34 based on screening spirometry. Subjects who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria above will undergo spirometry. Aim 1: Only HIV smokers with no diagnosis of COPD; normal spirometry and FEV1/FVC &gt;0.7. Aim 2: HIV smokers with evidence of COPD GOLD Stage 12 (mildmoderate) can be enrolled. All screened participants with known COPD or spirometry diagnosis of GOLD Stage 34 will be excluded due to safety of bronchoscopy. A history of alcohol dependence within the 6 months prior to the screening visit. History of underlying medical condition for which antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive procedures is required. History of intolerance, sensitivity, allergy or anaphylaxis to benzodiazepines or other narcotics to be used during the procedure. History of intolerance, sensitivity, allergy or anaphylaxis to lidocaine or other amide anesthetics, as well as benzocaine or other ester type anesthetics. History of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator will compromise ability to participate in the study. Currently taking anticoagulants including but not limited to: heparin (HepLock, HepPak), HepPak CVC, Heparin Lock Flush), warfarin (Coumadin), tinzaparin (Innohep), enoxaparin (Lovenox), danaparoid (Orgaran), dalteparin (Fragmin), clopidogrel (Plavix), prophylactic aspirin, and regular NSAID use. Subject taking any of the following medications: systemic steroids (inhaled or nasal steroid therapy is permitted), interleukins, systemic interferons (e.g., local injection of interferon alpha for treatment of HPV is permitted) or systemic chemotherapy.
