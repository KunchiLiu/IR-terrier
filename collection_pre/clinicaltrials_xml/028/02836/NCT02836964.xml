	<brief_title>Early Loading of Dental Implants; A Prospective Study in the Mandibular First Molar Area.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human clinical trial will be designed as a longitudinal prospective study. A total of 24 titanium implants with a modified SLA surface (BLT SLActiveÂ®, Institute Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) will be placed in the mandibular first molar. 12 for the control group and for the 12 test group.</detailed_description>
