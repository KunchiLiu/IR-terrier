	<brief_summary>Among youth, the prevalence of mental health and addiction (MHA) disorders is roughly 20%, yet youth are challenged to access services in a timely fashion. To address MHA system gaps, this study will test the benefits of an Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCT) model for at-risk youth with MHA challenges. In partnership with community agencies, adolescent psychiatry hospital departments, and family health teams, investigators have developed an innovative model of service provision involving rapid access to MHA services. This model will be implemented and compared to the usual treatment youth receive in hospital-based, outpatient, mental health clinics in Toronto. A rapid, systematic, approach to MHA services geared to need in a youth-friendly environment is expected to result in better MHA outcomes for youth. Moreover, the ICCT approach is expected to decrease service wait-times, be more youth- and family-centred, and be more cost-effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Collaborative Care Teams for Youth With Mental Health and/or Addiction Challenges (YouthCan IMPACT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a pragmatic randomized control trial (RCT) with random allocation occurring within each hospital site to either treatment as usual (TAU) (4 out-patient hospital sites) or treatment at one of 3 community-based Integrated Collaborative Care Teams (ICCTs). A total of 500 youth aged 14-18 with mental health and/or addictions (MHA) concerns, referred for out-patient services at one of four local hospitals, will be randomized to receive ICCT care versus TAU. For each youth, a primary caregiver will also be recruited into the study, if available. With wide inclusion criteria and a design meant to emulate a "real world" setting, this study will rigorously evaluate a service delivery model composed of multiple interventions for youth presenting with a broad range of MHA problems. The ICCT is expected to result in better MHA outcomes, show better performance indicators, and be more cost-effective than TAU.</detailed_description>
