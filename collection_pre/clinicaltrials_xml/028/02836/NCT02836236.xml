	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tenofovir Alafenamide Versus Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate for Treatment of Hepatitis B e Antigen-Negative Hepatitis B (China)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study GS-US-320-0108 is an international study planned to enroll participants in global countries, including China. However, due to the review timeline difference in China, full enrollment was reached in the main study (NCT01940341) before China was able to participate. Therefore, this registration only includes the China cohorts as they will not be part of the main study analysis. Data for China cohorts will be analyzed separately at a later time.</detailed_description>
