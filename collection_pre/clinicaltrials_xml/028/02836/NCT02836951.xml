	<criteria>Patient is hospitalized because of a head trauma and suspected TBI. Age 18 or above. The subject (including the control subjects) must be an independent adult who is not under guardianship. The patient, or the next of kin in the case of an incompetent person, has signed the Informed consent. This concerns the control subjects, too. The samples can be collected during regular office hours. The patient needs lumbar puncture for treatment reasons. This is not a limiting criterion however. If it is difficult to find an adequate number of patients for lumbar puncture, CSF samples of some patients can be omitted after the study coordinator's consideration. The subject has been found positive for HIV or hepatitisB in the involved laboratory studies. The subject has a chronic mental disorder which is mentioned on the sickness insurance card.</criteria>
