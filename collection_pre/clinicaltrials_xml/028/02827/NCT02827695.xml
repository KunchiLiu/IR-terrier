	<brief_summary>Investigators will employ a 2-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design with the subject as the unit of randomization and analysis. Kidney transplant recipients having uncontrolled hypertension will be enrolled into a screening phase to measure medication non-adherence. Each subject will use an electronic pill tray for 1 month without any reminder functions activated. Non-adherent subjects who remain uncontrolled will be randomly assigned to SMASK or Standard Care (SC). SC will continue to use the pill tray with reminders turned off and will receive attention control texts with healthy lifestyle information. SMASK will have the reminder functions of the electronic pill tray activated and will receive a Bluetooth blood pressure monitor and an app to collect the data and send to researchers.</brief_summary>
