	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well durvalumab before surgery works in treating patients with oral cavity or oropharynx cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Oral Cavity or Oropharynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the effect of durvalumab on local and systemic immune activation by HPV status in patients with oral cavity and oropharynx head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). II. To examine the effects of durvalumab on systemic immune response to HPV and tumor associated antigens. III. To examine the effects of durvalumab on immune regulatory mechanisms. IV. To explore the association between levels of immune-regulatory micro-ribonucleic acid (miR) in plasma and saliva and immune response. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the effect of the treatment with durvalumab on the computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) scan response. II. Evaluate the safety of a short induction treatment with durvalumab. OUTLINE: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3-17 days after last dose administration of durvalumab, patients undergo surgery. Patients may receive an additional dose of durvalumab if time to surgery is longer than 30 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.</detailed_description>

OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry In accordance with National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient registration Written informed consent and any locallyrequired authorization (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] in the United States of American [USA], European Union [EU] Data Privacy Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 6 months (mo) Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including durvalumab Receipt of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) within the last 6 mo Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (corrected QT [QTc]) &gt;= 470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Fridericia's correction Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first dose of durvalumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid Any unresolved toxicity (&gt;
