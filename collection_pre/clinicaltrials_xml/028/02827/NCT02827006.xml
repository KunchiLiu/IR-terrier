	<brief_title>CaP Cement is Equivalent to Iliac Bone Graft in Filling of Large Metaphyseal Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: A bone graft from the iliac crest has long been the gold standard for filling voids in opening wedge osteotomies. CaP bone cement has been considered the possible alternative to bone graft. Methods: 20 adult patients with distal radius malunions and dorsal deformities were randomised intra-operatively to bone graft (10) or CaP bone cement (10). Dorsal titanium locking plates were used and the wrist was stabilised in a cast for 8 weeks. Follow-ups for 24 months included VAS on wrist and iliac crest, grip strength, ROM bilaterally, Quick-DASH and Gartland &amp; Werley`s functional scoring system. X-rays and CT scans were taken at 8 wks, 3-6-12-24 mths.</detailed_description>
