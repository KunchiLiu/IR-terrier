	<brief_title>Proteus Discover in Subjects With Uncontrolled Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"Cardiometabolic diseases" as defined in this protocol refer to diseases that increase risk for cardiovascular disease. Proteus® Digital Health is operationally defining cardiometabolic (CMB) conditions for this study as including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of metabolic diseases is growing. Factors contributing to this rise include the obesity epidemic and the aging population. In particular, because of the costs and risk of complications associated with diabetes and hypertension, many health systems and payers are increasing focus on interventions to reduce the burden of these diseases. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of a new digital health offering, Proteus Discover to lower blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The study enrolled subjects with uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes failing at least 2 antihypertensives and metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. Subjects were randomized to one of 3 arms: use of Proteus Discover for 4 weeks, use of Proteus Discover for 12 weeks, or usual care. Subjects randomized to the intervention arms, used a digital health offering to (1) provide automatic and passive electronic documentation of medication adherence and patterns of medication taking, (2) assist providers in distinguishing inadequate medication adherence or pharmacologic unresponsiveness as the root cause for uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and (3) inform management decisions (dose adjustment, medication addition or substitution, adherence counseling, referral to a hypertension specialist). Subjects randomized to usual care, received usual medical care such as medication changes, adherence counseling, and lifestyle coaching. Providers could also schedule additional visits without restrictions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults (18 to 75 years old) who are diagnosed with essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without hypercholesterolemia (defined as taking statin therapy). Both hypertension and diabetes are suboptimally controlled at Screening: 1. SBP is ≥ 140 mm Hg (and his/her BP goal is &lt; 140/90 mm Hg). 2. A1C is ≥ 7% and ≤ 11% at Screening (A1C is above goal by ≥ 0.5%). On a stable antihypertensive regimen (on current regimen for at least 30 days) with at least 2 antihypertensive medications Ability to manage the subject during the 12week study with antihypertensive medication(s) and dose forms (or same drug classes and comparable doses for Usual Care subjects) used within the study. Currently on metformin and/or glipizide for diabetes for at least the past 60 days prior to Screening. Subjects can be managed on other noninsulin diabetes medicines (including sulfonylureas other than glipizide) during the study. Subjects must have a Proteus test pill (IS used to test that the Proteus Patch is correctly placed on the body and paired with the mobile device) detected as part of onboarding on the Proteus device (during the Proteus Onboarding Visit). In the Investigator's opinion inadequate medication adherence is a potential factor in the subject's uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes. BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 as subjects may be more likely to have secondary reasons for out of control blood pressure (BP) and/or diabetes. History of skin sensitivity to adhesive medical tape or metals for subjects in the Intervention Arms. History of acute or chronic dermatitis for subjects in the Intervention Arms. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion could preclude safe participation in the study. Secondary cause for hypertension (eg, renal impairment or renal artery stenosis) or uncontrolled diabetes (eg, corticosteroid use). Mean SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, if associated with evidence of hypertensive emergency.. Current or recent (within past year) treatment with insulin or other injectables for diabetes.</criteria>
