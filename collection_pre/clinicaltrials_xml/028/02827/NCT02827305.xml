	<brief_title>Centella Asiatica (Gotukola) Mouthwash as an Adjunct to Mechanical Plaque Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical plaque control by tooth brushing is considered to be the ideal way of preventing plaque associated gingivitis. However due to various factors individuals fail to perform an adequate quality of self performed plaque control. Centella Asiatica (gotukola) possess wide range of biological activities like anti-inflammatory, anti-psoriatic, anti-ulcer, hepato-protective, anticonvulsant, immunostimulant, cardioprotective, antidiabetic, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, etc. So, it could be used as adjunctive to mechanical periodontal therapy.</detailed_description>
