	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerance, Food Effect, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single and Multiple Doses of Extended Release Formulations of Centanafadine (CTN) in Young Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be divided into three parts: A, B, C. Part A: Single Dose, extended release (XR) Formulation Selection. This part of the study is a single dose, open label, four-period crossover design in a group of 16 healthy participants. Part B: Multiple Ascending Dose. Part B has been designed to assess the effect of multiple doses of one formulation of XR CTN. This part of the study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Part C: Food Effect. Part C has been designed to determine the effect food has on XR CTN. The XR formulation and dose administered will be selected after review of Part B data. This part will be an open-label, two-period crossover design in a group of 16 healthy participants.</detailed_description>
