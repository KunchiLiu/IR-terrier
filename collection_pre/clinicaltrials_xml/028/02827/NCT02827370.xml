	<detailed_description>Primary objective: I To determine if dietary alternations designed to downregulate the dominate molecular drivers of an individuals' breast cancer will enhance the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and allow for an increase in the pathologic complete response rate. Secondary objectives I) Investigator measurable changes to molecular and patient characteristics from precision nutrition to determine a metric for evaluation this treatment in future studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically proven invasive breast cancer Planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy determined by the judgment of the medical oncologist The patient must be female Age ≥ 18 Nonmetastatic and noninflammatory breast cancer History/physical examination, including breast exam and documentation of weight and Karnofsky Performance Status of 80100% for at least 60 days prior to study entry. Women of childbearing potential must be nonpregnant and nonlactating and willing to use medically acceptable form of contraception during chemotherapy Patient must capable of and provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry BMI ≥21 Weight ≥120lbs No prior history of nonbreast malignancies in the past 1 year unless it was a non melanomatous skin lesion or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patient must not have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV positive based upon current CDC definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS or HIV from this protocol is necessary because antiretrovirals may alter patient metabolism.
