	<brief_summary>Reperfusion of renal graft in kidney transplantation can change the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) parameters of rocuronium. The immediate increase of urine output during surgery may change the PKPD parameters of the drugs, including elimination rate. The goal of this study is to characterize the PKPD model of rocuronium during kidney transplantation and establish a basis for adequate dosage of rocuronium in kidney transplantation. Through PKPD modeling, the changes during reperfusion of the renal graft will be evaluated. Furthermore, the factors related to the changes will be assessed. Adjusting the infusion rate according to the step of kidney transplantation will lead to stable muscle relaxation and fast recovery.</brief_summary>
