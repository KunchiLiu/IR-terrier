	<brief_summary>This project is designed to investigate the effects of combining tDCS and MT in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. This project is also designed to investigate the optimal application timing of tDCS in combination with MT in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. Patients with subacute and chronic stroke will be recruited and randomized into one of the 3 groups: sequentially apply tDCS and MT group (SEQ), apply tDCS concurrently with MT group (CON), and MT with sham tDCS group (SHAM). All participants will receive 40 minutes of MT followed by 30 minutes of functional task training. For the participants in the SEQ group, 20 minutes of tDCS will be applied prior to MT, while tDCS will be applied concurrently with MT for the first 20 minutes in the CON group. As for the SHAM group, tDCS electrodes will be placed on the scalp without actual current output. The interventions will be carried out 90 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Behavioral outcomes will be assessed by blinded evaluators before, after, and 3 months post intervention. To study the possible interaction of treatment group and time of outcome evaluations, group (SEQ vs. CON vs. SHAM groups) × time (pretest vs. posttest vs. follow-up) repeated measures ANOVA will be performed. Additionally, the partial eta square (η2) will be calculated to determine the effect size of interest.</brief_summary>
