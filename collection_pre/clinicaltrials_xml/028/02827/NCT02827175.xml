	<brief_summary>Annually about 10 to 15 million international travelers from Europe visit tropical countries. Returning from a journey, fever is the cardinal symptom of many infections. This is the second reason for consultation (23%) for return from a trip, after digestive disorders (42%). Urgent evaluation must always be proposed. Although that may be the manifestation of a benign disease, fever of return can also presage a rapidly progressive and lethal disease. In 50% of cases, patients return home, after treatment and disappearance of symptoms, though the microorganism responsible for the pathology is not able to be identified. The prescription of a series of systematic biological examinations in the form of a diagnostic kit has shown its relevance and its effectiveness in improving the etiological diagnosis of endocarditis and pericardites for optimal support. In this study we propose to assess the effectiveness of the systematic prescription of a diagnostic kit 'fever of the traveler' to all patients hospitalized with a fever after returning from a trip. "Ready to use" kit brings together in a single bag (i) instructions for use, (ii) the tubes, bottles and jars for the etiological diagnosis of fever of the traveler in the usual support (iii) an additional blood tube for research of pathogens emerging. Primary: To assess the effectiveness of a diagnostic kit for the etiological diagnosis of fevers of travelers on the return. Hypothesis: Improvement of at least 15% of the etiological diagnosis of fevers of travelers on the return through the development of a diagnostic kit.</brief_summary>
