	<brief_summary>Motherhood Our Lady of Good Help is from the 2006 merger of three hospitals, St. Joseph, Our Lady of Good Help and Saint-Michel. She was transferred to a new building in the heart of Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group website in March 2011. The premises of the birth room are spacious and nice. All delivery rooms are supposed to welcome the mother and child when the birth goes smoothly. There is a resuscitation room (called "Nursery") for newborns requiring medical care. But since the installation in the new building, we had the impression that a number of children born without pathology futures and with good adaptation at birth passed through this room for no apparent medical reason. We wanted to make an inventory of home practice healthy newborns in our maternity, evaluate the reasons for a possible separation and appreciate the feelings of mothers cope with this separation.</brief_summary>
