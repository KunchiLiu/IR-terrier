	<brief_summary>Stromal vascular fraction of cells (SVF) will be extracted from lipoaspirate by enzymatic digestion. SVF will be administered in a single dose intraarticularly 4 weeks after arthroscopic debridement. All patients will receive cell therapy.This is a single arm study with no control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergone arthroscopic debridement for knee osteoarthritis will be subjected to abdominal liposuction under local anaesthesia. Harvested adipose tissue will be processed according to patent pending technology based on enzymatic digestion, washing and concentration of cell pellet in 5 ml of Hartmann's solution. Isolated SVF will be administered in a single dose into anterior part of knee joint cavity 28 days after arthroscopy.</detailed_description>
