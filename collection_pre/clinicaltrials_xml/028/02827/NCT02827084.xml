	<brief_summary>The study aims to analyze the immediate effects and 72 hours after application of the Kinesio Taping (KT) in the electromyographic activity of the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and vastus lateralis (VL), the isokinetic performance of the quadriceps and referred pain of subjects with PFPS. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups and perform one of the protocols: control - remain at rest; KT - application of Kinesio Taping with tension in the VMO region; placebo - application of Kinesio Taping without tension, in the same region. All volunteers will be submitted to the evaluation of pain intensity, the electromyographic activity of the VMO and VL and dynamometric parameters in 3 times: before the application of KT, immediately after the application of KT and after 72h of application. Average effect estimates (differences between groups) for all variables will be calculated using the mixed model ANOVA with a significance level of 5% (p â‰¤ 0.05).</brief_summary>
