	<brief_summary>Therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is considered as a standard care. However, optimal candidates, optimal dose, duration, timing of initiation and rate of rewarming is still unknown. The objective of this project is to improve the outcomes for patients after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with therapeutic hypothermia established from the analysis of multicenter registry data.</brief_summary>
