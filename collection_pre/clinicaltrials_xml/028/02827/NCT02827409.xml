	<brief_title>Short-Delay Cord Clamping Compared to Extended- Delay Cord Clamping in Term Neonates That Require Resuscitation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will receive delayed cord clamping. One group (short-delay) will receive up to one minute of delayed cord clamping and then will be placed either on the mother's abdomen or the life-start trolley if extensive resuscitation is required. The second group will receive delayed cord clamping for at least 5 minutes and continue until the baby has established breathing without additional support or is stable on respiratory support (no longer received mask PPV for at least 1-2 minutes, i.e. stable on CPAP or intubated). The subject will initially be placed on the mother's abdomen or if the subject needs extensive resuscitation they will be moved to the LifeStart bed to receive resuscitation measures. In either group if the baby is deemed to be unstable (by medical team) to be on the life-start trolley the cord will be clamped and the baby will be moved to an adjacent warmer for resuscitation.</detailed_description>
