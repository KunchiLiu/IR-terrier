	<brief_summary>A semi-rigid cervical collar is recommended for immobilization of the cervical spine in patients with cervical spine injury. It has been suggested that a reduction in mouth opening is the major contributing factor to the deterioration in the glottic view obtained. Fiberoptic intubation is among the most versatile techniques for managing both the anticipated and the unanticipated difficult airway. Recently, combination of fiberoptic bronchoscope with videolaryngoscope has been suggested to permit visual control of the passage of the tube over the fibrescope into the laryngeal inlet. The aim of this study is to compare the intubation time and ease of intubation between fiberoptic bronchoscope alone and bronchoscope with pentax airwayscope.</brief_summary>
