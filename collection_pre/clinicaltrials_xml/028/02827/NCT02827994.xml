	<brief_title>Pain Neurophysiology Education and Exercise for Adolescents With Chronic Idiopathic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty three adolescents with chronic idiopathic neck pain were randomly allocated to receive pain neurophysiology education and shoulder/neck exercises (n=21) or no intervention (n=22). Data on pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), pain disability, neck flexor and extensor muscles endurance, scapulae stabilizers endurance, pain catastrophizing (Pain catastrophizing Scale), trait and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and knowledge of pain neurophysiology (Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire) were collected. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis were performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.</detailed_description>
