	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well copper Cu64-DOTA-trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) works in predicting response to treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab before surgery in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64 DOTA-trastuzumab PET, may help predict a patient's response to trastuzumab and pertuzumab before surgery in patients with locally advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Copper (Cu) 64-DOTA-Trastuzumab PET Imaging in Predicting Response to Treatment With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab Before Surgery in Patients With HER2 Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) in patients with previously untreated HER2+ breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate if the uptake of copper 64 Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab, a proposed indicator of responsiveness to HER2-directed therapy, correlates with serpin peptidase inhibitor alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin, member 1 gene (SERPINA1) expression, which has been shown to be associated with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/ HER2+ patient survival, both in the HER2+/ER+ patients and in all patients. II. To compare uptake of copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab in the patients with complete pathologic response (pCR) vs. non-pCR patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes immediately before receiving copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab IV on day 0. Patients undergo PET scans at 18-24 and 42-48 hours, on day 1 and 2. Within 3 days after completion of PET scans, patients then receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly or every 3 weeks and pertuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after 6 courses of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.</detailed_description>
