Blood pressure (BP) at screening: systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤ 90 mmHg 4. EndoPAT score: ≤ 2.00) at screening 5. Generally in good health, in particular an electrocardiogram (ECG) without pathological findings at screening 6. Readiness to comply with study procedures, in particular: Consumption of the investigational product (IP) / placebo according to investigator's advise Maintaining the same level of physical activity and usual diet during the entire study Accepting blood draws Able to undergo an EndoPAT assessment Complying with visits and all respective requirements for BP and EndoPAT measurements Filling in diaries/questionnaires 7. Nonsmoker since at least 6 months prior to screening and during the study 8. Stable body weight in the last 3 months prior to screening (&lt;3 kg selfreported change) and during the study 9. Concomitant medications must have been stable at least during the last 1 month prior to screening, if applicable 10. In women: postmenopausal for at least 12 months Participation is based upon written informed consent form (ICF) by the participant following written and oral information by the investigator regarding nature, purpose, consequences and possible risks of the clinical study. 1. Known sensitivity to any components of the IP 2. Known primary or secondary hypertension or whitecoat hypertension 3. Known impaired endothelial function as per investigator's judgement 4. Clinically significant disturbances in lipid metabolism e.g. known genetic hyperlipidemia 5. Known type1 / type2diabetes 6. Untreated or nonstabilized thyroid disorder 7. History and/or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular disease as per investigator's judgement: 1. Known congenital heart defects 2. Myocardial infarction, heart failure, angina pectoris, lifethreatening arrhythmia or stroke within the last 6 months prior to screening 3. Existing thrombosis or disposition to thrombosis 8. Any other known significant or serious condition / disease that renders subjects ineligible, e.g.: 1. History of malignancy within ≤5 years prior to screening 2. Bleeding disorder and/or need for anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents 3. Current psychiatric care and/or use of neuroleptics 4. Bariatric surgery in the last 12 months prior to screening 9. Any known metabolic disease, gastrointestinal disorder or other clinically significant disease/disorder which in the investigator's opinion could interfere with the results of the study or the safety of the subject 10. Known arm lymphedema (e.g. due to mastectomy) 11. Other clinically relevant excursions of safety parameters or any other clinically significant abnormality in hematology and/or biochemistry at the Investigator's judgement 12. Dietary habits and/or restrictions that may affect the study outcome 13. Eating disorder or participation in a weight loss program 14. Use of medications (e.g. statins, renin angiotensin system inhibitors, nevibolol, carvedilol, calcium channel blockers) or supplements that can influence vascular endothelial function and/or blood flow (e.g. garlic, cocoa) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study 15. Use of antiplatelet agents and / or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study 16. Use of medications or supplements that can influence SBP or DBP (e.g. ACE inhibitors, diuretics, calcium channel, α or ßblockers, grape seed extract, coenzyme Q10 etc.) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study 17. Use of lipid lowering medications (affecting lipid metabolism, platelet function or antioxidant status, etc.) and/or dietary supplements (e.g. omega3 fatty acids, green tea extract, calcium, red yeast rice, phytosterols (incl. enriched products such as e.g. Becel), niacin,, glucomannan or chitosan ) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study 18. Use of medications that can influence cholesterol levels significantly (e.g. corticosteroids, amiodarone, estrogen, anabolic steroids) according to investigator's judgement 19. Use of weight loss treatment 20. Alcohol abuse (men: ≥21 units/week, women: ≥14 units/ week; 1 unit equals approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits) 21. Drug abuse 22. Reported participation in night shift work 2 weeks prior to screening and/or during the study 23. Participation in another study or blood donation during the last 30 days prior to screening and during the study 24. Any other reason deemed suitable for exclusion per investigator's judgment, e.g. insufficient compliance with study procedures</criteria>
