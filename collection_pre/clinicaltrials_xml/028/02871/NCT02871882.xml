	<brief_summary>To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of ox bile extract on insulin sensitivity, postprandial glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying, body weight and fasting serum FGF-19 (fibroblast growth factor) levels in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects on therapy with DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) alone or in combination with metformin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single dose, randomized, controlled trial. Participants will receive 28 days (+/- 4 days) of treatment to study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release ox bile extract 500 mg BID (twice daily) on insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by scintigraphy) and weight loss I overweight and obese type 2 diabetic subjects. Participants will be receiving therapy with DPP4 inhibitors alone or in combination with metformin. Blood samples will be collected at defined times to measure glycemia, FGF-19 and incretins (GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide-1], OXM [oxyntomodulin], PYY 3-36 [peptide YY]) fasting levels and responses to the meal.</detailed_description>
