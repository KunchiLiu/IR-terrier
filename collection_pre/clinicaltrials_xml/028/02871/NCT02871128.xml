	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This is a randomized, double-blind trial. Subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a day for a total of 12 weeks, another group (n = 20) with the same dose of placebo, and the other group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement. We assess whether Natureheme-iron can promote iron absorption and antioxidant effects, and compare the effects with commercial iron supplement. When this study is completed, it will increase the value of Natureheme-iron, and can improve health of Taiwanese.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Natureheme-iron on Iron Absorption Effect and Anti-oxidation Functions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FAO / WHO noted that iron deficiency is still an important nutritional problem. Iron deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This study intends to use the products, Natureheme-iron, using blood of pig to concentration, separation and extracted, and then got natural and clean Natureheme-iron. Natureheme-iron is not just a good iron supplement, while also providing an excellent source of natural protein. This is a randomized, double-blind trial, subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a day for a total of 12 weeks (1000mg Fe / capsule), another group (n = 20) with the same dose of placebo, and the other group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement (100mg Fe). We assess whether Natureheme-iron can promote iron absorption and antioxidant effects, and compare the effects with commercial iron supplement. When this study is completed, it will increase the value of Natureheme-iron, and can improve health of Taiwanese.</detailed_description>
