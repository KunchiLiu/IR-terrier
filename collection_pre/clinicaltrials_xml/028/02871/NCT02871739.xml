	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Approaches to Shared Decision Making Skills Training for Clinicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is limited evidence on approaches to training clinicians to engage patients in shared decision making for common medical tests and treatments. The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of different approaches to shared decision making (SDM) skills training. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive two decision aids or a webinar to review. Participants will also be randomly assigned to receive feedback on standardized patient interaction rating their shared decision making skills and highlighting opportunities for improvement or not. Clinician participants will be assigned to one of four intervention groups using a 2x2 factorial design: Group 1: Decision aid viewing with feedback Group 2: Decision aid viewing and no feedback Group 3: webinar with feedback Group 4: webinar and no feedback The pilot study will provide evidence on the comparative effectiveness and feasibility on training formats to determine if: - Clinicians improved in SDM communication skills - Clinicians have an increased confidence to use SDM with their patients - The training is acceptable to clinicians</detailed_description>
