	<brief_title>Combined Resection vs. Separated Resection After Mobilization of Splenic Vein During Distal Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In distal pancreatectomy, it is customary to ligate and divide the splenic vein after isolating it from the pancreatic parenchyma. This is considered essential to prevent disruption of the stump of the splenic vein and the consequent intra-abdominal haemorrhage in the event of pancreatic fistula. This procedure can be technically demanding, especially when the vein is firmly embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma. The objective of this trial is to confirm the non-inferiority of resection of the splenic vein embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma compared with the conventional technique of isolating the splenic vein before resection during distal pancreatectomy using a mechanical stapler.</detailed_description>
