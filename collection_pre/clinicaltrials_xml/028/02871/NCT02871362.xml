	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of IQP-AS-118 on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and to explore the effects on parameters of lipid metabolism in subjects with elevated BP and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in a pilot study.</brief_summary>

Known whitecoat hypertension 6. Known type1diabetes 7. Uncontrolled or within the last 6 months prior to screening diagnosed type2diabetes 8. Untreated or nonstabilized thyroid disorder 9. History and/or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular disease as per investigator's judgement: 1. Known congenital heart defects 2. Myocardial infarction, heart failure, angina pectoris, lifethreatening arrhythmia or stroke within the last 6 months prior to screening 3. Existing thrombosis or disposition to thrombosis 10. Any other known significant or serious condition / disease that renders subjects ineligible, e.g.: 1. History of malignancy within the past 5 years prior to screening 2. Bleeding disorder and/or need for anticoagulants (antiplatelet agents are allowed) 3. Current psychiatric care and/or use of neuroleptics 4. Bariatric surgery in the last 12 months prior to screening 11. Any known metabolic disease, gastrointestinal disorder or other clinically significant disease/disorder which in the investigator's opinion could interfere with the results of the study or the safety of the subject 12. Known arm lymphedema (e.g. due to mastectomy) 13. Other clinically relevant excursions of safety parameters and/or deviations &gt; 2 x ULN (upper limit of normal) 14. Dietary habits that may interfere with the study objectives: 1. Eating disorder 2. Subjects with dietary restriction that may affect the study outcome 3. Participation in a weight loss program 15. Use of drugs or supplements that can influence SBP or DBP (e.g. ACE inhibitors, diuretics, calcium channel or ßblockers, grape seed extract, coenzyme Q10 etc.) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study 16. Use of lipid lowering drugs (affecting lipid metabolism, platelet function or antioxidant status, etc.) OR dietary or health supplements (e.g. omega3 fatty acids, green tea extract, calcium, red yeast rice, phytosterols (incl. enriched products such as e.g. Becel), oat fiber, niacin, soy protein, psyllium seed husk, glucomannan, chitosan or probiotics/prebiotics) within the last 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study 17.

Alcohol abuse (men: ≥21 units/week, women: ≥14 units/ week; 1 unit equals approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits) 21. Women of childbearing potential: pregnant or breastfeeding 22. Participation in another study or blood donation during the last 30 days prior to screening 23. Any other reason deemed suitable for exclusion as per investigator's judgment, e.g.: 1. Insufficient compliance with study procedures 2. Inability to communicate with the site study staff</criteria>
