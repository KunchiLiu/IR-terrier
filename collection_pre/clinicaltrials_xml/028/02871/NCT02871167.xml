	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to perform a French multicenter prospective interventional study in order to assess the feasibility and safety of ovarian hyperstimulation for oocyte / embryo cryopreservation in young women with breast cancer. The oncologic and reproductive benefit / risk ratio will be investigated in the oncology and reproductive area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk of Infertility Related to Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Early Breast Cancer: Oocyte/Embryo Cryopreservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical Oncology: - Information and collection of consent, - Imaging staging, - Inclusion - Physical examination - Contraception advise given Reproductive medicine center: - Ovarian reserve assessment: serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) measurement and antral follicle count (AFC) by ultrasound. - Serology syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). In case of embryo cryopreservation, same serology determination for the men. - Infertility risk and fertility preservation techniques information. - In case of agreement, this technique will be done during the time-interval between surgery and chemotherapy - Fertility preservation (COH stimulation, triggering and oocyte retrieval) Adjuvant chemotherapy: - The chemotherapy regimen is 3 FEC (fluorouracil epirubicin cyclophosphamide) 100 followed by 3 Docetaxel +/- Trastuzumab. Adjuvant chemotherapy may only begin after the oocyte retrieval. - Usual adjuvant chemotherapy is not changed During chemotherapy: - Clinical exam before each cycle of chemotherapy - AMH, AFC at cycle 6 After chemotherapy: - Usual patient monitoring in expert center : physical examination at Month 3 (M3), M6 M9 M12 M18 and M24 and mammography at M9 then annual - AMH at Month 3 (M3), M6 M9 M12 M18 and M24 - AFC at Month 12 (M12) and M24</detailed_description>
