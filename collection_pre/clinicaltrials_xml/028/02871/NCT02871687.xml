	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research protocol is to determine if the same effects are observed in vivo in humans through a randomized controlled study. Data regarding a novel mechanism of the widely used statin class of medications on the mineralocorticoid pathway would likely have significant clinical implications on the future management of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease given the known pleiotropy of aldosterone action.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Statin Use on Aldosterone Secretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to provide additional evidence regarding the effect of statin therapy on aldosterone levels, we propose the following randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled protocol in relatively healthy volunteers. We will evaluate aldosterone and cortisol production in response to an angiotensin II infusion under the following test conditions: 1) placebo, 2) simvastatin therapy (lipophilic statin), and 3) pravastatin therapy (hydrophilic statin). Measurements will be made to assess the effect of both acute (single dose) and chronic (3 months) therapy of the two statin medications.</detailed_description>
