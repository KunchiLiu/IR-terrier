	<brief_summary>The specific aims of this study will be to: 1. investigate the treatment efficacy of Action observation therapy (AOT), mirror therapy (MT) versus a control intervention on motor and functional outcomes of stroke patients. 2. compare the mechanisms and changes in cortical neural activity after AOT, MT, and control intervention by using magnetoencephalography (MEG). 3. determine the correlations between neural activation changes and clinical outcomes after AOT and MT. 4. identify who are the potential good responders to AOT and MT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Study of Action Observation Therapy and Mirror Therapy After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this 3-year study project, the investigators will design a comparative, randomized controlled trial to (1) investigate the treatment efficacy of AOT, MT versus a control intervention on motor and functional outcomes of stroke patients, (2) compare the mechanisms and changes in cortical neural activity after AOT, MT, and control intervention by using magnetoencephalography (MEG), (3) determine the correlations between neural activation changes and clinical outcomes after AOT and MT, and (4) identify who are the potential good responders to AOT and MT. An estimated total of 90 patients with subacute stroke will be recruited in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive AOT, MT, or control intervention for a 3-week training period (a total of 15 sessions). Outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 3 months follow-up. For the MEG study, the investigators anticipate to recruit 12 to 15 patients in each group. The patients can still participate in this study to receive treatments and clinical evaluations even if they do not meet the MEG eligibility criteria or are not willing to participate in the MEG study.</detailed_description>
