	<detailed_description>The goals of the proposed study are: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PRIME (Pharmacist Reconciliation to Improve Medication Management in the Elderly) to older patients with breast, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers; and (2) to estimate the effect size (i.e. the magnitude of the difference between groups) of PRIME for improving medication management (e.g. accurate medication list, less polypharmacy, fewer potentially inappropriate medications) and achieving up-to-date vaccinations.</detailed_description>
