	<brief_summary>Toraymyxin is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge containing Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column designed to reduce blood endotoxin levels in sepsis. Meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that polymyxin B hemoperfusion significantly reduced the mortality of severe sepsis; however, the evidence was mainly contributed by the studies of abdominal sepsis. The data about using polymyxin B hemoperfusion to treat non-abdominal sepsis remain very limited. Investigators designed a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on treating non-abdominal severe sepsis. The study hypothesis is that removal of endotoxin by polymyxin B hemoperfusion in patients with pneumonia or urinary tract infection (UTI)-related severe sepsis will attenuate sepsis associated microcirculation failure and result in early reversal of shock and less extent of end-organ damage.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with septic shock defined by the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock 2. Newly diagnosed pneumonia or urinary tract infection (UTI) defined as the following: 21. Pneumonia is defined by a new infiltrate on chest radiograph and the presence of one or several of the following signs or symptoms: cough, sputum production, dyspnea, core body temperature ≥ 38.0°C, auscultatory findings of abnormal breath sounds and rales and leukocyte count &gt; 10000 or &lt; 4000/L. 22. UTI is defined by at least one clinical symptom (core body temperature ≥38.0°C, urinary urgency, polyuria, dysuria, suprapubic pain, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea and vomiting) and one urinary criterion (pyuria &gt;20 leukocytes/μL). 3. Hyperlactatemia (&gt;2 mmol/L) 4. Endotoxin activity assay (EAA) ≥ 0.5 units. 1. Shock persisted &gt;12 hours before screening 2. Mechanical ventilation &gt;21 days 3. Uncontrolled hemorrhage 4. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 30,000 cells/mm3) 5. Leukopenia (leukocyte count &lt; 1500 cells/mm3) 6. Suspected allergy to polymyxin 7. Females with pregnancy 8. Terminal cancer or organ failure with life expectancy less than 30 days</criteria>
