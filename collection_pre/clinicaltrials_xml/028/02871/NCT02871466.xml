	<brief_summary>stem cells therapy may be a choice therapy for advanced heart failure patients refractory to medical therapy, internal cardiovertor with a defibrillator (ICD) recipients, and a previous history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery revascularization. These patients, without indication to receive a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), may have a worsening of heart failure, and symptoms of coronary artery disease. In this study we have evaluated in consecutive 30 selected patients the amelioration in failing heart NYHA class, hospitalization rate, echocardiographic left ventricle functionality, and associated to reduction of angina after a treatment with stem cells intra thoracic infusion.</brief_summary>
