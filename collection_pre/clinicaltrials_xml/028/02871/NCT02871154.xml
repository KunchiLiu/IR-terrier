	<brief_summary>Our and others experience suggest that in some cases delaying oocyte pick up (OPU) for more than 39 hours after hCG injection may be of benefit. We plan to apply this to 20 women in whom less than 20% of oocytes were found suitable for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The delay will be for up to an interval of 47 hours from hCG to OPU.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In IVF one encounters some women in whom a low percentage of oocytes are found in the metaphase II stage upon their retrieval. Following some incidents, in our experience as well as others', where women injected hCG too early but oocytes were still retrieved with high proportion of maturity, we decided to delay OPU intentionally in women who had low percentage oocyte maturity in previous cycles.</detailed_description>
