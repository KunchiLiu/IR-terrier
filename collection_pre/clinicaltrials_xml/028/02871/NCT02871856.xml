	<brief_summary>People who may be at increased risk of lung cancer due to age and smoking history will be invited to participate in this international study to determine the best way of using computed tomography (CT) of the chest to screen for early lung cancer. Overseas data show that CT screening (screening tests can find diseases early, when they're easier to treat) can reduce deaths from lung cancer and this study will help determine who is most likely benefit from screening.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women or men age from 55 to 80. Current or former smokers. A former smoker is defined as one who has stopped smoking for one or more years. An estimated 6year lung cancer risk of ≥1.51% based on the PLCOm2012 risk predictionmodel or ≥ 30 packyears smoking history (packyear is defined as number of pack of cigarettes smoked per day multiply by the number of years smoked. If a participant stopped smoking for 6 months or more and then restarted smoking again, the time will be subtracted from the total duration of smoking in 0.5 year increments) ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Capable of providing, informed consent for screening procedures (low dose spiral CT) Exclusion Criteria Clinical symptoms suspicious for lung cancer e.g. hemoptysis, chest pain, weight loss Any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, chronic congestive heart failure), acute or chronic respiratory failure, home oxygen therapy, bleeding disorder, that in the opinion of the investigator could jeopardize the subject's safety during participation in the study or unlikely to benefit from screening due to shortened lifeexpectancy from the comorbidities Have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer Have had other noncuratively treated cancer outside the lung. Pregnancy Pneumonia or bronchitis requiring antibiotic treatment within the last 12 weeks Unwilling to have a spiral chest CT Chest CT within 2 years Does not fit into CT scanner table due to gross obesity Cannot lie on CT scanning table on the back with arms over the head Received chemotherapy or cytotoxic drugs within the last 6 months Unwilling to sign a consent</criteria>
