	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Reuteri DSM 17938 in the Prevention of Antibiotic-associated Diarrhea in Children: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: Addition of some probiotics appears to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Effects of probiotics are strain specific, thus the efficacy and safety of each probiotic strain should be established separately. We aim to assess the effect of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 administration for the prevention of diarrhea and AAD in children. Methods and analysis: A total of 250 children younger than 18 years treated with antibiotics will be enrolled into a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which they will additionally receive L reuteri DSM 17938 at a dose 2 x 10^8 colony-forming units or an identically appearing placebo, orally, twice daily, for the entire duration of antibiotic treatment. The primary outcome measures will be the frequency of diarrhea and AAD. Diarrhea will be defined according to one of 3 definitions: (a) ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 48 hours during antibiotic treatment; (b) ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 24 hours during antibiotic treatment; (c) ≥2 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 24 hours during antibiotic treatment. AAD will be diagnosed in cases of diarrhea, defined clinically as above, caused by C. difficile or for otherwise unexplained diarrhea (i.e. negative laboratory stool tests for infectious agents).</detailed_description>
