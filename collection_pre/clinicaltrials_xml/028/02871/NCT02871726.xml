	<brief_summary>The commonly used diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer, a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy, has significant limitations. Freehand biopsy cores are often spatially clustered, rather than uniformly distributed, and do not accurately follow the recommended, sextant template. In addition, a freehand TRUS-guided biopsy does not allow precise mapping of the biopsy cores within the prostate. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to re-biopsy or target the exact cancer foci. As a result, most TRUS-guided prostate biopsies today are poorly targeted and their spatial mapping remains subjective.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposed feasibility and safety study of 5 patients attempts to improve TRUS-guided prostate biopsy by utilizing a novel robotic TRUS manipulator (TRUS Robot). A successful TRUS Robot guidance will provide crucial spatial information of the biopsy cores for improved prostate cancer detection, treatment, and monitoring. This proposed study is a proof of concept for a future protocol.</detailed_description>
