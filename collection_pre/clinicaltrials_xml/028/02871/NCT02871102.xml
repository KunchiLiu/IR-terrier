	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a widely prevalent and morbid disease for which the current standard treatment is supportive care and avoidance of complications with lung-protective ventilation. Lower-tidal volume ventilation has been largely accepted as a means of lung protective ventilation, but the mechanism for its effectiveness is not yet clear, and debate remains as to how best to choose positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Reduction in driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) has been suggested as a possible means to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. This protocol aims to identify the range of safe paired-settings of PEEP and tidal volume, with selection guided by driving pressure and the stress index, a tool to recognize potential lung hyperinflation during mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
