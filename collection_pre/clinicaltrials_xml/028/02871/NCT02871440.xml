	<brief_summary>Omega 3 (OM3) Tear is a new unit dose emulsion, containing flaxseed/castor oil, which is being developed by Allergan. It is desirable to understand the effect that this new emulsion has on tear film evaporation and tear lipid profile via interferometry, in patients with evaporative dry eye (EDE) and those without (non-EDE). It would also be valuable to evaluate the retention time of the lipid components of the new emulsion via tear collection and analysis in EDE and non-EDE patients</brief_summary>
