	<brief_summary>Pain after caesarean delivery (CD) can interfere with the moms' ability to look after her baby and may contribute to developing long term pain and disability. Women having a CD receive pain medication (morphine) as part of their spinal anesthetic to help with pain relief after surgery. Morphine works well however has several side effects such as nausea, vomiting and itching which may be severe enough to make it difficult to care for herself and her new baby. In some cases, morphine causes difficulty in passing urine within first 24-hours of the CD requiring catheterization and thus restricting mobilization. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a newer nerve block that uses local anaesthetic solution to numb the nerves carrying pain sensation from surgical incision site. QLB may be able to provide effective pain control without the side-effects associated with the spinal morphine. This study is to determine if women receiving QLB have as good pain control with fewer side effects than those who do receive the spinal morphine. Adequate pain control will be assessed by their pain scores and recovery in the 24 to 48 hours after CD. The side effect profile of the two techniques, quality of recovery and long term impact will also be compared during this study.</brief_summary>
