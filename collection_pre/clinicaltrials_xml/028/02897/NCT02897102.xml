	<brief_title>Effects of a Training Program Based on Abacus and Other Activities in Healthy Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive stimulating activities are often recommended for older adults; however, little is known regarding the effects of these activities on cognition, motivation and quality of life in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a structured program, which was based on abacus training associated with other activities, administered as weekly group classes over a 7 month period in older adults. Eighty-eight older adults were enrolled in an open-label controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of this training program on cognition, motivation and quality of life. Training had a significant effect over time; the training group maintained their level of performance on verbal learning and memory tasks, whereas the control group exhibited a significant decrease in performance from baseline to post-intervention. The subjects in the training group were more motivated to learn at study entry; however, the training had no significant effect on motivation or quality of life. Abacus training associated with other activities may benefit verbal learning and memory in older adults. Additional studies with longer follow-ups are necessary to determine whether the results of this training will have a positive effect on the lives of older adults.</detailed_description>
