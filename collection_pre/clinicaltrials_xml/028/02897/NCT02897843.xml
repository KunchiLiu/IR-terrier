	<brief_summary>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, despite continued advances in ECT technique, neurocognitive dysfunction continues to be a frequent adverse effect. Declarative memory and less so selective memory are often impaired after an ECT course. Immediate memory, however, is broadly preserved. It is hypothesized that memory impairments are due to ECT induced disruptions on long term potentiation as well as in cerebral flux and glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. Different pharmacological agents for the treatment of ECT induced cognitive dysfunction have been tried. Agents such as opioids, vasopressin, neuropeptides, cholinergic agents, thyroid hormone, and stimulants have been used with equivocal results, and no controlled studies showed clear efficacy. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation treatment that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain. Electrical currents are applied constantly at low intensities (1-2 mA) over a long period, usually in minutes (5-30 minutes), to achieve changes in cortical excitability by influencing spontaneous neural activity. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation acts to excite neuronal activity while cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity. Several studies demonstrated moderate to strong effect sizes of tDCS in various neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric settings. Majority of studies show positive effects of tDCS on cognitive functioning among healthy volunteers and subjects with neurological or psychiatric conditions. Beneficial effects of online stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been reported for working memory, attention and information processing in depressed patients. To the investigators' knowledge no studies have evaluated the potential efficacy of tDCS for the prevention of ECT induced cognitive adverse effects. In the current study, the investigators propose a double blind, randomized controlled trial to test the use of tDCS as a strategy to prevent or mitigate the memory impairments frequently associated with an ECT course.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Cognitive Side Effects of Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, random assignment, double blind, parallel group study with an adaptive design comparing the efficacy of tDCS performed during the course of ECT to that of sham tDCS in patients with a major depressive episode being treated with ECT. The investigators intend to recruit patients who are scheduled to receive an acute course of ECT. Patients who are able and willing to provide written informed consent, and who meet study criteria when screened, will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive a course of real tDCS or sham tDCS. Subjects will receive a standard acute course of bifrontal ECT (3X/week) and depressive symptomatology will be monitored with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) before each treatment. The primary outcome will be change in cognition from baseline to end of study. The investigators will monitor cognitive changes before and after each ECT treatment, at the end of the treatment course and two months after the last treatment. Secondary outcome will be the number of treatments needed to achieve remission. Remission is defined as two consecutive Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores &lt;= 10, and HRSD total score does not change &gt; 3 points or remains &lt; 6 at the last two consecutive treatments. In addition, the investigators will collect data on other treatment parameters such as seizure duration, electroencephalogram (EEG) morphology as well as hemodynamic changes.</detailed_description>
