	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin in AMI patients with DES. This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, active drug controlled multicenter clinical research and the study would enrolled a total of 380 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to one of two antithrombotic regimens: bivalirudin alone, or unfractionated heparin alone. All enrolled patients would be followed-up to 30 days.</brief_summary>
