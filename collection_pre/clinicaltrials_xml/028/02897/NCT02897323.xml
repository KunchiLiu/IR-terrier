	<brief_summary>The incidence of congenital heart disease is about 8 per thousand live births. Thanks to advances in cardiac surgery, 90% of children born with heart defects reach adolescence and adulthood. Congenital heart defects are the leading cause of heart disease in young adults and expectant mothers in Western countries. The number of patients increases continuously as life expectancy increases. An increasing number of patients with complex heart defects survive to adulthood. The medico-surgical management of this highly specialized growing number of patients is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary collaboration. In France, an estimated 200,000 patients the number of carrier patients with congenital heart disease. Half of them will require monitoring, medical procedures, catheterizations and/or surgical re-intervention. No objective demographic data are currently available on the French patients. So, the investigators decided to set up an epidemiological project to better understand this cohort of patients. The main objective of this project is to obtain accurate epidemiological data needed to adapt the supply of care.</brief_summary>
