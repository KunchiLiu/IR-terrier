	<brief_summary>Patients with mechanical ventilation are in risk of malnutrition, which could lead to worse outcome. According to guidelines released from authority organizations, enteral nutrition (EN) should be prior approach for critically ill patients. However, initiation and delivery of EN during the early period of ICU admission are frequently hampered, which results in underfeeding. The investigators speculate whether an intensive enteral nutrition strategy could reinforce the delivery of EN thereby improving outcomes. In this multi-center, prospective, randomized parallel clinical trial, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility, safety and outcomes of intensive enteral nutrition in mechanical-ventilated patients.</brief_summary>
