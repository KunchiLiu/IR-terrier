	<brief_summary>Women will be recruited from the EMPOWER clinic when they present for care; they may be given a flyer as part of their clinic entry paperwork, or approached by a study staff member in the waiting area of the clinic. Women who are clients of Sanctuary for Families may find out about the music workshops and the study through Sanctuary for Families staff, who will post flyers in their noticeboards or offices. This study will use a repeated measures survey design to evaluate the effect of a musical workshop intervention to aid in the management of mood, anxiety, and stress among women enrolled in the EMPOWER clinic for survivors of sex trafficking and sexual violence. Assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of this music intervention will be carried out on participants as they are taught to manage stress and emotions.</brief_summary>
