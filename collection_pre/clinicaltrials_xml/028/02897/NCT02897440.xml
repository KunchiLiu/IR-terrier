	<brief_summary>A prospective cohort study to compare full repairing and partial repairing of soft tissue surrounding the hip joint in anteriorolateral approaching arthroplasty concerning hip function. Patients admitted with a femoral neck fracture operated with a hip arthroplasty through an anteriorolateral approach were screened for inclusion. Patients with altered mental status SPMSQ &lt;7, pathological fractures, non-walkers were excluded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Full Versus Partial Repairing of Soft Tissue Surrounding the Hip in Arthroplasty for Femoral Neck Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and non of the exclusion criteria were followed 2 months postoperatively by clinical examination. Sample size were estimated to 15 patients in each group. Primary outcome variables were trendelenburg test, abductor strength measured with dynamometry. Secondary outcome variables were WOMAC, EQ-5D, and VAS scores.</detailed_description>
