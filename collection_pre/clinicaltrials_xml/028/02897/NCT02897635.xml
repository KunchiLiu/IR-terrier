	<brief_title>Integrative Approaches For Cancer Survivorship 2: Project 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer associated symptoms and impaired quality of life remain significant problems for patients despite advances in cancer treatment. Few effective treatment options exist for these symptoms. Integrative medicine is rising in popularity in the United States; however, few integrative medicine modalities have been rigorously studied. Ayurveda, a whole system of medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent, has its own system of diagnostics and therapeutics, and among its strengths are wellness and prevention. The investigators aim to perform a prospective single arm clinical study of a manualized Ayurvedic approach in breast cancer survivors with impaired quality of life. Specifically, the investigators aim to refine the manualized Ayurvedic intervention; to assess feasibility; and to determine whether clinically meaningful effects can be achieved with the intervention.</detailed_description>
