	<brief_summary>This study aims at assessing the effects of glucose and different types of breakfast on metabolic and neurofunctional responses in healthy individuals. Twelve healthy subjects, on a stable diet, in a randomized-crossover fashion, received either a 50 g glucose load (control) or one of these breakfast: B1: milk (125ml) and cereals (30g); B2: milk (220ml), apple (200g) and cream chocolate filled sponge cake (30g); B3: milk (125ml), bread (50g), apple (150g) and hazelnut cream chocolate (15g). Prior and upon completion of each tolerance test, an EEG was performed to measure frontal P300-evoked potentials.</brief_summary>
