	<brief_summary>There are 2 parts in this study: pre-screening and the "main" clinical research study. The goal of the pre-screening part of this study is to learn if participant has antibodies against human papillomavirus (HPV) . Antibodies are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or diseased cells, such as HPV. The goal of the main study is to learn about the relationship between HPV and cancer risk in men who test positive for HPV antibodies. Researchers want to look for early methods of screening for certain types of cancer. HPV infections can lead to oropharyngeal, anal, and/or penile cancer. The goal of the entire study is to learn if screening for HPV can help doctors learn which participants may be at a higher risk for developing these types of cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-Screening: If participant agrees to take part in the pre-screening part of this study, they will have the following tests and procedures at the Clinical Research Unit of the Texas Medical Center (CRU): - Participant will be interviewed by a member of the study staff and will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their cancer history, age, sex, race, income, smoking and alcohol drinking history, and sexual behavior. It should take around 15-20 minutes to complete. - Participant will also be asked to provide oral rinse samples to test for HPV. Participant will swish with a small amount of mouthwash for 15 seconds, gargle for another 15 seconds, and then spit the mouthwash into a cup. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for HPV antibodies. Because the test used in this study to check for HPV antibodies is not FDA approved, participant will not be told if they have the HPV antibodies or not. Up to 90 men who test positive for HPV antibodies and up to 90 men who test negative for HPV antibodies will be selected to take part in the main study. Participant will not be told if they are HPV-antibody positive or negative. If participant is selected to take part in the main study, they will be given a separate consent form to sign that explains the main study in more detail, including expected tests/procedures and their risks. If participant is not selected to be part of the main study, the study staff will contact them 1 time each year for up to 5 years to check their health status and ask about any diagnosis of cancer or other HPV-related diseases. Participant may be contacted by phone, mail, or email. If participant is called, it should last about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. Up to 3000 participants may take part in the pre-screening study. All will be enrolled at the CRU. Follow-up Cohort: Cancers Caused by HPV In Men Screening (CCHIMES): If participant is eligible to take part in this study, and they agree, they will be screened for cancer and/or dysplasia (a type of pre-cancerous lesion). These visits will be at MD Anderson. Participant may refuse taking part in any part of the screening procedures or stop taking part in this study at any time. Participant's first visit will be at the time they sign this consent form. Oropharyngeal Cancer Screening: During participant's first study visit and then every 6 months for up to 5 years, they will be screened for oropharyngeal cancer. At each screening: - Participant will have a head and neck exam. - Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test how participant's immune system responds to infections. - Participant will have an oropharyngeal exam to look for anything unusual in their throat. A member of the research team will use a narrow band imaging device to look at the back of participant's throat. A narrow band imaging device is an ultra-thin flexible probe with a video camera on the end of it that will pass through participant's nose and shine a light on the back of their throat. The video will be displayed on a color TV so the researchers can look for anything unusual, such as signs of cancer. - Participant's tonsils and the back of their tongue will be rubbed with a cotton swab to test for HPV. - Participant will have ultrasound scans of their throat and the lymph nodes in their neck to check for cancer and/or dysplasia. To do this, an ultrasound probe will be placed on the outside of the neck. Anal Cancer Screening: At participant's first study visit: - Participant will have an anal pap test to test for HPV. To perform this test, anal samples will be collected by gently swabbing the anal area with a cotton swab. - Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test how participant's immune system responds to infections. - Participant will have high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). HRA is an exam of the anal canal that is used to check for anal cancer and dysplasia. During the exam, a liquid solution of diluted acetic acid (normally found in vinegar) will be flushed into participant's anal canal to help pre-cancerous areas show up better during the exam. Then, a small tube with a camera on the end (called a colposcope) will be inserted into participant's anus and used to take pictures of possible pre-cancerous areas. This exam should take about 5-10 minutes. Participant will not be sedated for this procedure. Penile Cancer Screening: At participant's first study visit: - The doctor will examine participant's genital area to check for anything abnormal. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participant's penis will be rubbed with a cotton-like swab to test for HPV. If participant has an abnormal test result from any of the screening procedures, they will be referred to a doctor to discuss more testing and/or treatment options, as part of their standard care. Length of Study: Participation in this study will be over after participant's last oropharyngeal cancer screening (about 5 years after their first study visit). This is an investigational study. Up to 3000 men may be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
