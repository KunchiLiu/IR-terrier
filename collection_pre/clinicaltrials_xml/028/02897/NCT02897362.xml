	<brief_title>Sleep Dysfunction and Neurocognitive Outcomes in Adolescent ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will involve recruitment of 30 adolescents with ADHD and a control group of 30 healthy adolescents without psychiatric diagnoses. Participants will participate in 3 phases: Screening visit, Washout/In-Home Sleep Study, and Neurocognitive Assessment visit. To ensure consistency in sleep schedules, the three nights of the sleep study will occur on weeknights during the school year. The neurocognitive assessment will occur during the afternoon following the final night of sleep assessment. The 2-hour screening visit will be conducted at the Duke ADHD Clinic at 2608 Erwin Road, Pavilion East, Suite 300, Durham, NC 27705. During the screening visit, participants will undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will enter the 48-hour Washout (if applicable) and 3-night Sleep Study Phase (At Home). Subjects not taking stimulant medication will initiate 3 consecutive nights of ambulatory (in-home) PSG recording, beginning on the next Monday evening following the screening visit. Subjects will be instructed to maintain usual sleep routines/behaviors for all study nights. In addition, subjects will be asked to complete a "sleep diary" each morning. If subject is currently taking stimulant medication, they will be instructed to initiate a 48-hour washout period. Subjects will be instructed to discuss this option with their prescribing physician prior to initiating the study. Subjects will be asked to return for a three hour neurocognitive assessment on the afternoon directly following the final night of the sleep study. In order to reduce interference with school attendance, this visit will be scheduled in the afternoon. Subjects will be able to take breaks throughout the assessment as requested. Subjects will restart their ADHD medications on the morning following the neurocognitive assessment (if applicable).</detailed_description>
