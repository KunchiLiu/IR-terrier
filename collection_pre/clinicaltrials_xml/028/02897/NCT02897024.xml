	<brief_summary>The ACHIEVE study is a comparison of the effectiveness of 2 intensities of physical therapy treatment for children with Cerebral Palsy in an outpatient physical therapy setting. High intensity periodic is 2 hours of focused and high intense treatment per weekday for 4 weeks. In comparison, usual weekly is considered standard of care; although both dosing models are used clinically for children with CP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison: High Intense Periodic vs. Every Week Therapy in Children With Cerebral Palsy (ACHIEVE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of high intense periodic and usual weekly therapy in treating Cerebral Palsy (CP) in children 2-8 years of age for motor rehabilitation. In this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), 300 children ages 2 to 8 years of age with CP will be enrolled and assigned to one of 2 service delivery models: 1 hour per day, 1 x per week for 40 weeks (usual weekly); and 2 hours every weekday for two 10-consecutive-weekdays (total 4 weeks), for a repeated "periodic" bout (high intense periodic). All patients enrolled in ACHIEVE will also have 1 hour per month of Physical Therapy Consultation (PTC) during the treatment period of 40 weeks (9 months). PTCs provide monthly motor skill monitoring, consultation, and home therapy program progression. Outcome evaluations will be performed by blinded evaluators at baseline (month 0, before treatment), month 9 for all patients to assess short term effects, and at months 12 and 18 for patients to assess long term effects. Parent surveys will be collected at 0, 4.5, and 9 months only (PC-2). Short-term and long-term effects will be analyzed to determine individual differences in children's response to intensity.</detailed_description>
