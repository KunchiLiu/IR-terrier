	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to establish a database of people with varying levels of hepatic fibrosis and various etiologies of liver disease for use in future research protocols.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Liver Screening Using FibroScan Device for Liver Disease Patients for the Steatosis/Fibrosis Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Fibroscan device will determine liver stiffness as well as the amount of fat through another application on the machine called controlled attenuation parameter or Controlled Attenuation Parameters (CAP). The liver stiffness measurements are then translated into a score that tells how much liver fibrosis or fat is present. Patients identified with potential for fatty liver or specific liver-related diseases causing fibrosis would be approached for a voluntary FibroScan measurement. From these patients, the investigators will collect information related to demographics, disease history, medical comorbidities, social history, laboratory and radiologic parameters. This information, along with clinical data associated with the patient will be placed in a database for use in identifying potential subjects for future trials.</detailed_description>
