	<detailed_description>Post-treatment cancer survivorship is often associated with a void in care given the drop-off in support provided to survivors from the medical team as well as family and friends. The investigators aim to develop and test a Health Education intervention in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, the investigators aim to develop the manualized Health Education intervention; to assess feasibility; and to provide preliminary data on the effects of the intervention. The data from this pilot study will be used to inform future study.</detailed_description>
