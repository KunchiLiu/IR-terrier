	<brief_title>N-acetylcysteine in the Treatment of Depressive Symptoms in Bipolar Offspring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To conduct an 8-week, open label study of N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of depressive symptoms in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder, with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations at baseline and endpoint. This proposal is innovative because it investigates the efficacy and tolerability of a novel pharmacological treatment in youth offspring of bipolar disorder, and examines the neurophysiology of predictors of mood disorders in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. This study will obtain pilot data to propose a larger, neuroimaging-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of N-acetylcysteine in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. The expected outcome, that N-acetylcysteine will be efficacious in ameliorating depressive symptoms in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder, and that it will demonstrate improvement in functional connectivity within the left frontostriatal circuit associated with treatment response.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 15 years, 0 mos. 24 years, 11 mos.; For minor, at least one parent or stepparent/guardian with whom the subject lives is willing to participate in research sessions; For minor, the child and relative(s) are able and willing to give written informed assent/consent to participate, respectively; the youth meets criteria for highrisk: has at least one first degree relative with Bipolar I Disorder, as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM (SCID); the youth shows evidence of current significant depressive symptoms as determined by a current Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) greater or equal than 8. Inclusion of Youth with Depressive or Anxiety Disorders and Comorbid Disorders Although not formally required for study entry, many youth will meet criteria for a range of mood and anxiety disorders at study entry (except for major depressive disorder, bipolar I or II disorder, and psychotic disorders, which are exclusionary), which will formally be assessed with a structured diagnostic interview at baseline. If during the course of interviewing it becomes apparent that participants demonstrate symptomatology and/or rating scale scores consistent with a psychiatric disorder, youth and their families will be debriefed about these findings and a plan will be developed in collaboration with the patient's clinician on alternatives to study participation for the treatment of their disorder if indicated. Presence of current or lifetime history of mood episodes (major depressive episodes, mixed, manic, hypomanic), or psychotic disorders. a DSM5 diagnosis of autism, pervasive developmental disorder,obsessivecompulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, Tourette's disorder, or any psychotic disorder including schizophrenia; Drug or alcohol abuse or dependence disorders in the 3 months prior to study recruitment, although a lifetime history of substance or alcohol disorders can be present if the child has been abstinent for at least 3 months (see further discussion below); Pregnancy; participants will be encouraged but not mandated to discuss a positive pregnancy test with their guardians (if minors) and we will follow local laws History of major neurological disorders (such as epilepsy), or head trauma with &gt; 10 minutes loss of consciousness Evidence of mental retardation (IQ less than 70), as determined by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence any contraindication for MRI, including metal in the body related to an injury or surgery (e.g., surgical clips, metal fragments in the eyes), piercings that cannot be removed, braces, or permanent retainers.
