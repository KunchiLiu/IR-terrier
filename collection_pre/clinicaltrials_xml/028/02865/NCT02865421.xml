	<detailed_description>Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common form of hair loss in both men and women, characterized by progressive patterned loss of hair from the scalp. The prevalence of AGA increases significantly with age, 30% to 50% men are affected by the age of 30 and 50 years, respectively. 3 Further, women also suffer from different degrees of alopecia, 50% women are affected by the age of 60. AGA becomes a medical problem when the hair loss is subjectively considered as excessive, premature and distressing. Current treatment options for AGA include medications such as finasteride, dutasteride, spironolactone, flutamide, minoxidil etc. However, these medicines are suitable either for men or women only or they can only maintain existing hair but have no effect on hair regeneration. In addition treatment is expensive and requires prolonged usage of drugs, and if treatment is stopped any benefits gained will be lost. Therefore, a better solution is required that can stimulate the hair follicles to promote hair restoration in both sexes with long lasting effects. Recently, stem cell based therapies have revolutionized the field of regenerative medicine by providing treatment options for several diseases and disorders. The current study has been designed for restoration of hair in AGA by implanting a combination of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (derived from the adipose tissue) and human platelet rich plasma. The growth of human hair is an extremely complex process. Hair growth begins under the skin in structures called hair follicles. In AGA the size of hair follicles decreases due to loss of hair follicle stem or progenitor cells as a result hair follicles become inactive. Due to the inactivation of hair follicles large, pigmented terminal hairs are replaced by barely visible and de-pigmented vellus hairs. External factors can stimulate inactive hair follicles, as a result hair growth cycle can begin. other studies indicate that proteins and growth factors released by stem cells can play an important role in hair growth cycle. Considering these facts, current study has been designed as a possibility in the treatment of AGA by using a combination of autologous stem cells and platelet rich plasma. In the current study,Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) derived from adipose tissue will be applied to restore hair growth because they are highly proliferate, have multi-lineage differentiation potential, are immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive. Further, MSCs also secrete various growth factors and proteins which can perform several functions including hair follicle stimulation. Conventional approaches for hair refurbishment include medication and hair follicle transplantation surgery. However, these strategies are mostly ineffective in patients due to drawbacks including high cost, several side effects, unsatisfactory results, requirement for long lasting use of medicines and their efficacy is limited to either males or females. Therefore, contemporary therapies with promising results are required that should be effective in both sexes and outcomes should be long lasting. MSC based treatment for AGA can open a new avenue for the development of therapies for hair restoration. MSCs can have multiple effects on miniaturized hair follicles by homing to the hair follicles and by their paracrine effects. The study will not only help the patients with hair loss but will also promote stem cell based regenerative medicine research in Pakistan by providing promising results.</detailed_description>
