	<brief_summary>Vaginal exams are used routinely in labor to assess cervical dilation and position of the baby (facing anterior, facing to the right or left side, facing towards maternal spine). This technique has a widely variable accuracy rate (24.0-85.6%). Ultrasound has been used to help confirm or correct the vaginal assessment by obstetricians, but has not been used to assess the utility of immediate feedback to improve the accuracy of vaginal assessment by physicians in training. The investigators plan to use ultrasound assessment to determine if this education is effective in increasing accuracy in the resident population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Fetal Position in Active Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residents will be informed of the study through an education session (as a group) and then be consented individually. Each resident will complete 15 baseline exams, 20 exams with immediate ultrasound confirmation, and 15 exams for post-test baseline. Exams will take place periodically throughout the year. Both 3rd and 4th year residents will be assessed during the same time period by the MFM fellows. Ultrasounds will follow the vaginal exam as closely as possible to prepare for delivery. A picture of the fetal position (with no name or MRN) for documentation to be taken during the SOC ultrasound and kept in the research chart for the resident. In training feedback is not always standard. This teaching tool, consistent and standard feedback with regard to the correlation between vaginal exam and ultrasound, would allow the resident to learn to assess fetal position more accurately. Information from the maternal chart (history and delivery information) will be collected as de identified. Data will be recorded on the data collection sheet which is labeled with a code number linking the resident participant only. Data collected from the residents will be assigned a random Code numbers used to link the subject to their data. Code and identifiers will be kept separate. Paper copies will be kept in a locked cabinet, in a locked office, in a locked suite.</detailed_description>
