	<brief_summary>Breast MRI is performed in prone position which causes a number of questions. Indeed, the correlation with mammography and echography and the identification of preoperative lesions can be complex as echography and surgery are carried in supine position while mammography is performed in standing position. Moreover, the prone position is often considered as uncomfortable by the patients. However, there is few publications in the literature on breast MRI in decubitus position.</brief_summary>
