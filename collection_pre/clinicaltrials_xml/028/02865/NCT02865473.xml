	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to develop a measurement protocol for optimal imaging of the anterior segment of the eye, including anterior chamber angle, Schlemm's canal, filtering bleb and pseudoexfoliation deposits on the lens based on measurements in patients with glaucoma and PEX. In glaucoma the structures of the anterior chamber are important for classification, therapy, progression and prognosis and imaging of the angle between the iris and the cornea is the key for open angle and closed angle glaucoma differential diagnosis. For this purpose, a customized ultrahigh resolution Spectral Domain OCT will be used to validate whether the protocol can also be more widely applied in these patients. Based on the obtained measurement protocol, further studies investigating anatomy and pathophysiology of the anterior segment of the eye as well as surgical outcome in patients with glaucoma and PEX can be planned. The aim of the study is to develop a measurement protocol for OCT imaging and characterization of the anterior chamber in glaucoma patients.</brief_summary>
