	<brief_summary>Medication non-adherence is an economic problem and a major public health challenge. Factors influencing medication adherence can be modelled according to five dimensions: disease, medication, patient and its close relatives, demographic and socioeconomic factors and health care system. A tool is needed to qualify medication adherence in order to adapt tailored support for individual patients to promote and optimize adherence to therapy. The objective of this work is to present the preliminary results of QUILAM project which is divided into 3 phases: 1. Development of a tool to assess barriers to medication adherence in chronic patient (COPD, Heart failure, Type 2 diabetes) ; 2. Validation of the instrument (especially against clinical criteria) ; 3. Evaluation of the sensitivity of the tool during educational interventions.</brief_summary>
