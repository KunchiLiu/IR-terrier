	<brief_summary>To measure the resolution of diarrhea as well as the feasibility of administration and safety of MET-1 for the treatment of recurrent CDI in patients who have experienced at least two prior episodes of CDI and have developed recurrence after having completed standard-of care oral antibiotic therapy to treat CDI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MET-1 Clinical Pilot Study for Recurrent C. Difficile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is clinical resolution of diarrhea with no CDI relapse at 30 days following the last dose of MET-1, i.e., absence of recurrence of diarrheal symptoms (see definitions section) with laboratory-confirmed evidence of C. difficile after 30 days. The secondary endpoints are: i) safety and tolerability, including adverse events of grade 2 or above; ii) overall well-being including number of bowel movements and energy level, etc as based on standardized IBS questionnaire (see appendix); iii) presence of MET-1 bacteria in stool at 30 days, based on DNA sequencing; iv) mortality, at end of followup period - mortality attributable to CDI will also be determined, by performing a detailed clinical chart review on any patient who expires during the followup period. Open label, single center pilot study of 20 patients. Patients who have met the inclusion criteria will be given up to four doses administered within 12 days ± 5 days; the first two doses will be given by colonoscopy, and the third and fourth dose via enema only for patients that continue to have symptoms post treatment. Patients will be on vancomycin to control symptoms up until the time of the treatment. Patient must hold their po vancomycin for 24-48 hours prior to receiving the first dose. Patients will be followed up for 6 months post-treatment.</detailed_description>
