	<brief_summary>The sinus infiltration technique for sinus floor elevation has been used successfully when a reduced vertical height is available in the posterior maxilla. However, the effect of the different graft material on the volume and on the quality of new bone formed has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and histological effect of a test material, lyophilized equine bone (Bio-gen®), compared with control material, deproteinized bovine bone (Endobon®), in the sinus lift techniques with lateral approach.</brief_summary>
