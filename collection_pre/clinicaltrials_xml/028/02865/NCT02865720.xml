Meet the following minimum body weight criteria: Subjects 2 to 5 years of age must weigh at least 12.5 kg; and Subjects 6 years of age and above must weigh at least 25 kg. 4. Have a confirmed diagnosis of Type I or Type II HAE. NOTE: Diagnosis may be based on historical data including family history, clinical symptoms (characteristic attacks), or documentation of low level of C1 INH protein and/or C1 INH activity. 5. Have a history of at least one angioedema attack per month (on average) during the 3 consecutive months immediately before enrollment. 6. Agree to adhere to the protocoldefined schedule of assessments and procedures. 7. Agree to avoid his/her known angioedema attack triggers during the study to the best of his/her ability. 8. If a female of reproductive age, be postmenopausal (≥12 months following cessation of menstruation), surgically sterile, or following an acceptable method of birth control (and agree to continue its use through 1 month after the last dose of study drug): Nonhormonal methods (eg, abstinence, barrier control) for at least 1 complete menstrual cycle before the Screening Visit. Stable doses of estrogen and/or progestin containing products for at least 2 months before the Screening Visit. 9. If a male of reproductive age, be surgically sterile or agree to follow an acceptable method of birth control (eg, abstinence, barrier control) from the Screening Visit through 2 months after the last dose of study drug. 10. If an adult, be informed of the nature of the study and provide written informed consent before any studyspecific procedures are performed. OR If a child or minor (&lt;20 years of age), have a parent/legal guardian who is informed of the nature of the study provide written informed consent (ie, permission) for the child to participate in the study before any studyspecific procedures are performed. Assent will be obtained from children ≥14 years of age. 1. Have a history of hypercoagulability (abnormal blood clotting). 2. Have a diagnosis of acquired angioedema or be known to have C1 INH antibodies. 3. Have a history of allergic reaction to C1 INH products, including CINRYZE (or any of the components of CINRYZE) or other blood products. 4. Have received C1 INH therapy or any blood products within 3 days before the first dose of study drug. 5. Have had signs or symptoms of an angioedema attack within 2 days before the first dose of study drug. 6. Have any change (start, stop, or change in dose) in androgen therapy (eg, danazol, oxandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone), tranexamic acid, epsilonaminocaproic acid (EACA), or other antifibrinolytics within 14 days before the first dose of study drug. 7. If female, have started taking or changed the dose of any hormonal contraceptive regimen or hormone replacement therapy (eg, estrogen/progestin containing products) within 2 months before the first dose of study drug. 8. Be pregnant or breastfeeding. 9. Have received an investigational drug other than those required for prevention or treatment of angioedema attacks within 30 days before the first dose of study drug. 10. Have, as determined by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor's Medical Monitor, any surgical or medical condition that could interfere with the administration of study drug or interpretation of study results.</criteria>
