	<brief_summary>Post-thoracotomy pain is one of the most severe. The local analgesia allows its effective control and a reduction of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The gold standard for local analgesia is the thoracic epidural. However, this technique can be dangerous with severe complications. The paravertebral block showed comparable efficacy to the thoracic epidural for local analgesia . In addition, it has a better safety profile. There are several installation techniques. The difference in efficiency of these laying techniques is unknown.</brief_summary>
