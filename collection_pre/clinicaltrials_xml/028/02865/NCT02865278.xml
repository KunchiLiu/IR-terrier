	<brief_summary>Randomized placebo-controlled crossover study during which participants undergo two different experimental days. The participants consume a red grape based- drink (polyphenols: 300 mg/100 ml and sugar: 9.8g/100 ml) or a placebo (no polyphenols and sugar: 9.8g/100 ml). After 3 hours they consume a test meal (905 kcal, 15% protein, 46% fat, 39% CHO). Blood samples are taken at fasting, over 3 hours after drink consumption and over 5 hours after the test meal to evaluate metabolic response. Fasting and 48h-urine are collected to evaluate bioavailability.</brief_summary>
