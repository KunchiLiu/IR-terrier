	<detailed_description>Following a Screening/Wash-out Period of up to 12 weeks, an 8-week Lead-in Period (starting with a progestin challenge) will be used to better characterize the study population. A Treatment Period of 28 weeks' duration will follow the Lead-in Period. Then, an 8-week Follow-up Period (i.e., no study drug) will be used to assess the durability of effects of MLE4901. The study duration will be approximately 48 weeks (11 months) per subject</detailed_description>
