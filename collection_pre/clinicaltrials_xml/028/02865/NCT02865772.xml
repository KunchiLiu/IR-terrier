	<brief_title>Lamellar Body Counts on Gastric Aspirate in Healthy Term Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lamellar bodies represent the storage form of lung surfactant. Surfactant is produced in alveolar type II cells and transported to the alveolar surface as lamellar bodies. Lamellar bodies are present in the amniotic fluid and also gastric aspirate.It has become a preferred test for determine fetal lung maturity, because of the rapid, inexpensive, easily accessible and easily applicable method.</detailed_description>
