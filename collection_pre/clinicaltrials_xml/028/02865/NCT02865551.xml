	<brief_summary>The investigators intend to compare the rate of urinary retention among female patients after vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia, depending on bladder catheterization type, either by a foley catheter inserted adjacent to epidural anesthesia or intermittent catheterization applied every 4 hours during labor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Urinary Retention After Vaginal Delivery With Epidural Anesthesia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An explanation about the study will be delivered to each participant and each participant will sign a confirmed consent. Patients will be randomized between 2 groups of treatment: 1. intermittent catheterization applied every 4 hours during labor. 2. foley catheter inserted adjacent to epidural anesthesia. In patients with a foley catheter, the catheter will be removed soon after delivery. Participants will be followed by a clinician post labor. An abdominal US will be performed either 4 hours after delivery or after the participant urinates to check the bladder volume. Patient information including demographic information, information regarding the patient`s pregnancy and delivery will be collected from the patient`s electronic record.</detailed_description>
