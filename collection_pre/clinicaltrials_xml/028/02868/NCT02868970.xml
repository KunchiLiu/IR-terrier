	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Pharmacists as Immunizers to Improve Coverage and Provider/Recipient Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although there are many safe and effective vaccines for adults, the Public Health Agency of Canada has noted that public perception of vaccination is that it is primarily for infants and children. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends adults and adolescents receive the influenza vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), and meningococcal vaccine. While NACI makes recommendations, provinces and territories (P/Ts) determine if they will fund and implement vaccine programs. Unlike the childhood immunization programs which tend to be funded by P/Ts, many adult vaccines are unfunded, resulting in poor population uptake. In this project,the investigators propose to implement and compare new community pharmacy-based strategies for improving vaccine coverage. Patients are typically educated about preventative health care during face-to-face visits with physicians in office settings. The ability to educate and deliver preventative health care is limited by the available provider time during office visits - providers often focus on acute needs and current disease management. New delivery models and a means of extending preventative health care delivery outside of traditional face-to-face office visits are needed. Pharmacists are in a unique position of being among the most accessible of health professionals. Given their extended operating hours, accessibility, and established trust with patients, pharmacists are well-positioned to improve vaccination rates and health system efficacy through injection administration. Vaccine coverage rates will be measured using the following: 1. pharmacy database analysis, 2. public health vaccine reports by physicians, 3. number of vaccine doses delivered to pharmacies in all four regions, and 4. public survey within the study communities to determine immunization status. Intervention communities include Saint John, New Brunswick and New Glasgow/Pictou/Antigonish, Nova Scotia area, which include the smaller towns of Stellarton and Westville, Nova Scotia. Control communities include Moncton, New Brunswick and Kentville/New Minas/Wolfville, Nova Scotia, which include the smaller towns of Canning and Coldbrook, Nova Scotia.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: For the selection of the four communities include population size (approximately 30,000 adults &gt;18 years of age), stable population, service by a centralized regional hospital and local community hospitals, availability of community pharmacies, interest of community pharmacists (sufficient numbers of pharmacists qualified to provide vaccinations), and lack of substantial health care spill over to adjacent communities. Spill over is defined as a pattern of healthcare utilization where patients regularly receive care at different regional health centers. Intervention communities include Saint John, New Brunswick and New Glasgow/Pictou/Antigonish, Nova Scotia area, which include the smaller towns of Stellarton and Westville, Nova Scotia. Control communities include Moncton, New Brunswick and Kentville/New Minas/Wolfville, Nova Scotia, which include the smaller towns of Canning and Coldbrook, Nova Scotia.</criteria>
