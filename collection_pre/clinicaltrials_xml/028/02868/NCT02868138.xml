	<brief_title>Study of Hydroxyurea to Treat Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 34 pediatric (HbSS: n= 5; HbSβ0: n= 29) and 16 (HbSS: n=5; HbSβ0: n= 11) young adult adult patients with sickle cell disease receiving hydroxyurea for at least a year were participated. Upon receipt of Informed Consent Form, Case Report Form, Demographic Data Collection Form, Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form, Life Quality Survey Short Form-36, and Hydroxyurea Therapy Satisfaction Survey were used to obtain data for effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy and parameters that may affect compliance to treatment and life quality of the participants. Regarding the normal ranges, ferritin, hemoglobin A, A2, F, and S, platelet, mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte distribution width, basophil percentage, monocyte, monocyte percentage, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein values were higher while hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte values were lower in these patients. Our findings regarding quality of life and satisfaction with hydroxyurea therapy indicated that the patients with sickle cell disease had lower scores. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables as well as comorbid diseases and concomitant drug use when considered together, these findings suggest that the health quality and compliance of the pediatric and young adult patients to therapy might be low due to not sufficiently effective hydroxyurea therapy in addition to comorbidities, concomitant drug use, and side effects.</detailed_description>
