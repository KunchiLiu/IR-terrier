	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Pregabalin Sustained Release Tablet for Postherpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of pregabalin SR vs placebo in patients with PHN. The study is conducting at 27 study centers in China. Patients were randomized to receive pregabalin, starting at 165 mg/day and increasing to a maintenance dose of 330 or 660 mg/day, or placebo. The study includes a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period; a 2-week dose-escalation/optimization phase; a 12-week, fixed-dose treatment period; and a 1-week taper phase.</detailed_description>

At screening (V0) and enrollment (V1), patients must have a score of greater than or equal to 40 mm on the 100 mm pain visual analog scale； 5. Women were neither pregnant nor lactating, and those of childbearing age had a confirmed negative serum pregnancy test at baseline and practiced an appropriate method of contraception throughout the study. 1. Decrease of ≥30% on their pain VAS or ≥ 4 between any two pain diaries during the placebo runin period.( in order to remove potential placeboresponders)； 2.

Patients with a skin condition or severe nonPHN pain that might impair the self assessment of pain caused by PHN； 5. Patients with other Nervous system disorders which might impair completing the pain diaries or sleep interference diaries； 6. History of epilepsy and being treated by drug therapy； 7. Previous surgical therapy for PHN； 8. History of using effective therapies during 2 weeks before screening (V0),eg: acupuncture and moxibustion, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation； 9. Potentially retinal toxicity of drugs past or now； 10. Prohibited medications without appropriate washout； 11. Malignancy within the past 2 years； 12. Laboratory examination: WBC＜2.5×109/L；ANC＜1.5×109/L；PLT＜100×109/L；ALT/AST＞3ULN； 13. Creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min； 14.
