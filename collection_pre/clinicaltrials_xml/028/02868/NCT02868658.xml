	<brief_summary>Although clinical presentation of influenza is often symptomatic, asymptomatic cases also occur. The knowledge of the incidence of asymptomatic influenza among healthcare workers is very important because of the risk of cross-transmission to hospitalized patients. The principal objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza among healthcare workers in short-stay wards. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the burden of asymptomatic influenza among healthcare workers and might be used as an argument to increase influenza vaccine coverage among healthcare workers.</brief_summary>
