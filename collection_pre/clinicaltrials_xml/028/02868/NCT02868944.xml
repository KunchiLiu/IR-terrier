	<brief_summary>The addition of morphine to a local anesthetic when performing an epidural analgesia during labor analgesia has improved the efficiency and the action duration of analgesia. One limitation of this technique is the time of installation of the analgesic effect (about 30 minutes) when using the only epidural. Therefore, the technique of sequential combined spinal epidural was introduced. This is to shorten the installation time by direct injection into the cerebrospinal fluid. This allows a good efficiency in less than 10 minutes. It has been shown that low doses of sufentanil (strong opioid) in spinal anesthesia could potentiate the effect of the local anesthetic.</brief_summary>
