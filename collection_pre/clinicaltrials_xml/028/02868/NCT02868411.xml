	<brief_summary>A point-of-care laboratory (POC) was set at North Hospital, Marseille, France for the diagnosis in less than two hours of traveller's fever caused by known pathogens, close to the reception of Emergency service. In this instance 30% of patients have no etiological diagnosis after the POC traveller's fever tests . The objective of this study is to implement a new diagnosis strategy relying on the hypothesis that a rectal swab would improve the etiological diagnosis of traveller's fever of at least 10%.</brief_summary>
