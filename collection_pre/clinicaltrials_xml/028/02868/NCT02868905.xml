	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare average methylation of epigenetic markers on genomic DNA and some genes (APP, BACE, LRP, SorL1) involved in cerebral amyloid homeostasis: - Of obese young adults and healthy young adults - Of obese young adults and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) having been obese at young adult age (&lt;50 years old) or individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) having never been obese. The secondary purpose is to determine if there is an association between the frequency of these epigenetic markers and elements associated to the metabolic syndrome (lipidic and glycemic analysis, leptinemia, inflammation markers) and clinical ones (visceral fat mass, body mass index) in young adults.</brief_summary>
