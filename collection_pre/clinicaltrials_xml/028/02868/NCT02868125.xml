	<brief_summary>There is no standardized protocol regarding the post-operative radiographic follow up of patients that sustain pertrochanteric hip fractures and are treated with closed reduction and internal fixation. The policy in the investigator's institution as in other hospitals is to conduct a radiogram of the operated hip during the first days following operation after the patient bore weight on the fixated femur. The investigator's goal is to asses the added value of this policy and to offer recommendations regarding this specific followup component.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiography Protocol in the Acute Phase After Proximal Femur Internal Fixation- Self Assessment and Recommendations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is no consensus regarding the proper radiographic protocol following closed reduction and internal fixation of pertrochanteric femoral fractures. Despite its' questionable necessity and significant economic burden, many medical centers practice a policy of imaging internally fixated proximal femurs after the patients bore weight on them. The investigator's goal is to assess the added value of the postoperative imaging study described. Materials and methods: We will conduct a prospective study. All patients who will be treated with closed reduction and internal fixation of AO31A fractures will be enrolled. Two sets of imaging studies will be assessed- the intra-operative AP and axial fluoroscopy studies and the radiograms that are taken following bearing weight on the operated hip. Three decision steps will take place regarding weight bearing limitations and a necessity for re-operation- (1) Immediately after the operation; (2) A day after the operation; (3) Following weight bearing according to a new radiogram. Objective measurements will be taken for each hip on both imaging modalities- neck-shaft angle, neck length and tip-apex distance.</detailed_description>
