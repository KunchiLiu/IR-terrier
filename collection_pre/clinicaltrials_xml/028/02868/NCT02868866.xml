	<brief_summary>The USC PRC's applied research project will study the dissemination and implementation of an evidence-based program shown previously to significantly increase physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in churches in South Carolina (Faith, Activity, and Nutrition; FAN). Guided by two theoretical frameworks, the specific aims of the applied research project are to: 1) examine the adoption and reach of FAN in churches and organizational factors associated with adoption; 2) characterize implementation fidelity and multilevel factors associated with implementation; 3) describe organizational maintenance of FAN and factors associated with maintenance; and 4) study the effectiveness of FAN. In Phase 1, churches in a rural county with a high proportion of African American residents will be randomized to receive training in FAN from a community health advisor (n=40) or to be part of a delayed intervention control group (n=20). In Phase 2, a quasi-experimental study wil be done with a large religious denomination in SC (churches are not randomized).</brief_summary>
