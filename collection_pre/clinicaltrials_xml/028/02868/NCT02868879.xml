	<brief_summary>The different subtypes of Schizophrenia might have a disordered connectivity as their final common pathways. The investigators will use multimodal structural MRI to assess anatomical connectivity on the one side and its functional consequence on functional connectivity on the other side to assess two phenotypes of psychosis : periodic catatonia and cataphasia in comparison with control subjects. The coherence between structural and functional anomalies will be especially studied.</brief_summary>
