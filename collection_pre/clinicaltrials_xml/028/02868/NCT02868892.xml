	<brief_title>A Study of Pemetrexed in Recurrent Cervical Adenocarcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every three week. On initiation of pemetrexed, on day one of first chemotherapy cycle, patients will begin taking folic acid at a dose of 350 to 600 mcg daily as well as receive an intramuscular injection of 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, with subsequent vitamin B12 injections given every 9 weeks while on study.</detailed_description>
