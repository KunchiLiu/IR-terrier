	<brief_summary>This longitudinal cohort study aims to detect the topographical nature of the white matter microstructure and resting state functional connectivity patterns across the whole brain in the evolution of pathology as a function of time following mild TBI. All consecutively patients with the non-contrast head CT because of acute head trauma from the local emergency department (ED) formed the initial population of this study. Age, sex, education-level matched healthy controls will also be enrolled. The initial scan will performed within 7 days post-injury. Clinical assessment was performed within 24 hours of MR imaging and included a broad neuropsychological and symptom assessments. Follow-up examination will conduct at 1 month, 3 month, 6-12 months.</brief_summary>
