	<brief_summary>A point-of-care laboratory (POC) was set at North Hospital, Marseille, France for the diagnosis in less than two hours of sexually transmitted infections caused by known pathogens, close to the reception of Emergency service. In this instance 30% of patients have no etiological diagnosis after the POC sexually infection transmitted tests . Most sexually transmitted infections can be diagnosed from an anal swab which is not routinely performed. In this study, we suggest to test the hypothesis that anal swab in addition to the routine genital swab would increase by at least 5% the diagnosis capacity of sexually transmitted infections after the POC tests.</brief_summary>
