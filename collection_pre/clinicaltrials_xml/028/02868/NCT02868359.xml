	<brief_title>PROs in Chronic Cervical Pain Patients With Accompanying Upper Limb Radiating Pain Treated With Pregabalin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational and background: Cervical pain with upper limb radiating pain(neuropathic component), such as cervical spondylosis radiculopathy or cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is one of the typical and common neuropathic pain. However, in Japan, large number of those patients are treated with NSAIDs without adequately assessing the cause of pain, despite that α2δ ligand, SNRI (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors ), and TCA (Tricyclic Antidepressants) are recommended in the clinical guidelines for neuropathic pain. Therefore, treatment satisfaction of these patients is low. This is currently a major issue in treatment for cervical pain with neuropathic component in Japan. In fact, our previous study which assessed the effect of pregabalin in low back pain patients with radiculopathy suggested that the selection of appropriate analgesics according to the cause of pain improved pain related sleep interference, pain and function. However, there are a few reports with regard to effect of pregabalin in cervical pain patients with neuropathic component. Therefore, we propose to conduct an observational study in order to assess the effects of pregabalin in cervical radiculopathy, when added to routine clinical care. The present study can encourage an understanding of the necessary of assessing cause of the pain, and treating with appropriate analgesics. Research objectives : To evaluate the effect of pregabalin comparing with the conventional analgesic care in chronic cervical pain patients with accompanying upper limb radiating pain(neuropathic component) treated in primary care settings under routine clinical practice. Study design: This is an 8-week, multicenter prospective non-interventional observational study. Subjects who have chronic cervical radiating pain patients with accompanying upper limb radiating pain (with a neuropathic component) and meet all other entry criteria are enrolled at baseline in the duration of study. Study arms are pregabalin with or without usual care vs. usual care (mono/combo therapy). The usual care are assumed NSAIDs, Antidepressants, weak opioids, acetaminophen etc. The analgesic treatment is determined by the clinical judgment of the physician in charge of patient management. This therapeutic choice is not related to the decision to take part in the study. All enrolled subjects will be received with analgesic treatment. The study requires 3 visits at least, baseline/enrollment visit, Week 4 visit and Week 8 visit (or discontinuation).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject who received the enough study information and signed informed consent form. Subject who had chronic pain with accompanying radiating pain to the superior limb beyond the elbow. Subject is male or female patient ≧20 years old. Subject who reported neck pain with accompanying radiating pain to superior limb (12 weeks or greater in duration at Visit 0). Subject who is refractory to previous analgesics for 12 weeks and more. Subject who is able and willing to complete all study related assessment tools and complied with scheduled clinic visits and clinical study procedures. Subject whose pain NRS ≧5 and PRSIS ≧1 at baseline (based on recall over the past week). Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, was not likely to complete the trial for whatever reason. Subject who was treated with Pregabalin within the past 12 weeks (on baseline). Subject who has been regularly treated cervical pain with nerve blocks (such as stellate ganglion block, epidural block, radicular block and trigger point injection etc.).</criteria>
