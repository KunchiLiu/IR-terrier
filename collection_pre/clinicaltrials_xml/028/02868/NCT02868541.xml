	<brief_summary>The objective of this project is to study the prevalence of viruses and bacteria responsible for transmissible acute respiratory infections in the respiratory tract of pilgrims returning from the trip. The patients included, will be the consultant pilgrims to the traveler health center, and before leaving for Hajj. Based on the results obtained in previous studies, it is estimated that 200 pilgrims will be included each year, 600 in total (inclusion period of 3 years). Respiratory secretions are then collected by nasal swab and throat (swab) prior to departure for the hajj. In return, patients will be reconvened systematic consultation to record medical events potentially encountered during the trip, and it will again be performed the same nasal swabs and throat. It will then be performed on these samples' return from hajj "molecular detection (PCR and RT-PCR) of 35 viruses and bacteria respiratory tropism: influenza (3), RSV (2), metapneumovirus (1), Coronavirus (4), Parainfluenzavirus (4), enteroviruses (4), rhinovirus (1), adenovirus (6) bocavirus, polyomavirus (2), pneumococcus, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Coxiella burnetii. Samples "return of hajj" positive should be cultured for the isolation of the strain. For patients positive return, it will be done further research of these 35 viruses and bacteria on samples "start of hajj," the same method described above. In addition to this systematic consultation, and if symptoms return, the pilgrims will be seen in consultation for a diagnosis evaluation and therapeutic management. This study will shed light on the acquisition of microorganisms respiratory tropism during the stay and on the potential risks associated with the circulation of these pathogens after the trip.</brief_summary>
