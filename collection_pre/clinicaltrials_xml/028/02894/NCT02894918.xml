	<brief_summary>This study evaluates whether addition of Peginterferon alfa-2a to CHB Patients Treated with nucleoside analogues (NAs) can enhance the rate of HBsAg clearance at end of treatment. This study is a Randomized, open-label, multi-center study. The CHB patients with NAs treatment and have achieved HBV DNA &lt;15 IU/ml、HBeAg &lt;100 PEIU/ml、HBsAg positive and HBsAg&lt;1500 IU/ml will be randomized into 2 groups: Group 1 (Combination group): Maintain NAs treatment while add 48-week standard treatment by Peginterferon alfa 2a 180µg/week Group 2 (Mono NA group) : Maintain NAs treatment for 49 weeks. Note: NAs including: LAM, ADV, ETV, or TDF.</brief_summary>
