	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that alteplase given intra coronary after PCI reduce infarct size in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) and impaired microvascular function defined as a value of index of microvascular resistance (IMR) &gt;30.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Coronary Flow After PCI for Myocardial Infarction - a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After coronary stenting, index of microvascular resistance (IMR) will be measured invasively. Patients with IMR &gt;30 will be randomised to 20 mg alteplase or placebo (NaCl) administered in the culprit vessel through a microcatheter. Magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the myocardium will be performed early (2-6 days) and late (3 months) to estimate the primary endpoint (infarct size). 10 non-randomised patients, with IMR &lt;30, will undergo the same follow-up as the randomised patients. Clinical events for all randomised and non-randomised patients will be collected from Swedish national registries and by telephone at 3 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
