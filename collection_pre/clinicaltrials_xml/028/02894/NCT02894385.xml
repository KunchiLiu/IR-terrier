	<criteria>All subjects Male and white subjects between 45 and 79 years of age with a body mass index between 18 to 34 kg/m*2 (both inclusive). Patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Part 1) Patients with documented liver cirrhosis confirmed by histopathology, e.g., previous liver biopsy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, or fibroscan and with moderate hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh class B). Patients with severe renal impairment (Part 1) Patients with severe renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 1529 mL/min/1.73 m*2, who are not on dialysis and are not expected to start dialysis in the next 3 months (Stage 4). Healthy subjects Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring and with estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;90 mL/min (according to Modified Diet of Renal Disease equation). Patients with moderate renal impairment (Part 2) Patients with moderate renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 3059 mL/min/1.73 m*2 (Stage 3). Patients with mild renal impairment (Part 2) Patients with mild renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 6079 mL/min/1.73 m*2 (Stage 2). Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Part 2) Patients with documented liver cirrhosis confirmed by histopathology, e.g., previous liver biopsy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, or fibroscan. Patients with mild hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh class A). Severe cerebrovascular or cardiac disorders, e.g., myocardial infarction less than 6 months prior to dosing, congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade III or IV. Subjects with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft less than 6 months prior to study drug administration. Strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 28 days or 5 drug halflives (if drug halflife in patients is known), before start of study treatment. Known BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) and OATP (organic aniontransporting polypeptide) substrates not specifically mentioned in the protocol within 28 days or 5 drug halflives (if drug halflife in patients is known), before start of study treatment. Smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily.</criteria>
