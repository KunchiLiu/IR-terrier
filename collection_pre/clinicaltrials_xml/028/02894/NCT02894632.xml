	<brief_summary>A novel magnetic resonance (MR) compatible accelerometer for respiratory motion sensing (MARMOT) has been developed as a surrogate of the vendors' pneumatic belts. The aim is to model and correct respiratory motion for free-breathing thoracic-abdominal MR imaging and to simplify patient installation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MR Compatible Accelerometer for Respiratory MOTion Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory motion is a serious problem in the acquisition of high-quality thoracic/abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) images. Various methods have been proposed to compensate the motion-induced artefacts, including breathholding, respiratory gating and model-driven motion correction. Breath-holding is the simplest among the three. However this conventional clinical method induces various problem, including inefficient use of scanners, inconsistent organ position between each breath-hold, imaging an altered physiological status and patient inconvenience especially for those who suffer from respiration difficulties. Free-breathing MR acquisition has therefore become of great clinical interest recently. The investigators intend to examine the efficacy of the MARMOT sensors for: - modelling and predicting the respiratory motions in abdominal scans, - correcting for the respiratory motion in a cardiac cine scan, via a reconstruction-based method.</detailed_description>
