	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer is associated with an extremely poor prognosis, reflected by a 5-y survival probability of less than 5% when all stages are combined. At present, only approximately 10%-20% of patients are considered candidates for curative resection. The majority of patients (50%-60%) are present with metastatic disease, and substantial number of patients (approximately 30%-40%) are considered ''locally advanced'' at the time of diagnosis. Replication-competent Adenovirus-mediated Double Suicide Gene Therapy (Theragene®,Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP) showed an anti-cancer effect in patients with prostatic cancer in phase I study. From the experience of prostatic cancer, the safety of combination with standard chemotherapy with Theragene treatment is assessed in this study.</brief_summary>
