	<brief_summary>This is a randomized prospective monocentric study to evaluate the benefits of a 3D rotational acquisition (3DRA) to assess technical success after treatment of infra-renal aneurysm with bifurcated endograft. Patients will be randomized between the standard strategy (2D angiography at the end of the procedure and angioCT-scan before discharge) and the new strategy (3DRA at the end of the procedure). Expected findings are a reduction of radiation exposure and contrast medium used during the hospital stay, with a similar resolution between angioCT-scan and 3DRA to depict the main complications after EVAR (occlusion, kinking, endoleak). Furthermore, any complication depicted after 3DRA group could benefit from an additional procedure during the same operating time, and therefore avoid a second intervention for the patient.</brief_summary>
