	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Improves Outcome of Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains a major cause of neonatal death and long term disabilities. Data from animal studies have shown protective effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to impaired brain. Recently research priorities have moved from bench to bedside. Several studies have shown a trend for brain protection of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for HIE. Therefore,the investigators organized a multi-centered randomized controlled trial of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in HIE newborn infants.</detailed_description>
