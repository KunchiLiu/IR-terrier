	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between mindfulness and stress habituation. The investigators propose to measure the effect of mindfulness on stress habituation by randomly assigning participants to a 6-week mindfulness-based stress reduction group intervention, a cognitive-behavioral skills group comparison intervention, or a waitlist control condition followed by repeated acute psychosocial stress testing (2 laboratory sessions on 2 separate days). Saliva will be collected from participants throughout both laboratory testing sessions to measure HPA axis activation (an essential stress-responsive system), along with other measures of physiological and psychological stress (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, emotions). Mediators and moderators of treatment outcome will be examined. The cognitive-behavioral skills group condition is an appropriate comparison group due to the well-documented efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions on stress.</brief_summary>
