	<criteria>Cohorts 14: Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram (kg) divided by the square of height in meters) of 18 to 36 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg Participants must agree to follow all requirements that must be met during the study as noted in the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (eg, contraceptive requirements) Female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for a period of 30 days after study drug administration Male participant must agree not to donate sperm from enrollment (Day 1) in the study until at least 30 days after receiving the study drug Cohorts 13: Participant must have stable renal function Participant must be otherwise healthy except for the renal impairment and its underlying disease states and mild comorbidities and participant must be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening Participants must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than (&lt;) 90 milliLiter per minute per 1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73m^2). Mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to &lt;90 mL/min/1.73m^2); moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m^2); severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m^2 not requiring dialysis) Cohort 4: Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, 12lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening Participants must have an eGFR greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90 mL/min/1.73m^2 Cohorts 14: Participant has a history of any illness (unrelated to renal impairment or its underlying disease, as appropriate) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the participant. This may include but is not limited to history of relevant drug or food allergies, history of cardiovascular or central nervous system disease, history or presence of clinically significant pathology, chronic skin disease, or history of mental disease Participant who is on a vegetarian diet or who takes creatine supplements, and who has a nonstandard muscle mass, example (eg), amputation, malnutrition, muscle wasting, or extremely muscular (body building) Participant has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (anti HCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or antiHCV at screening Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for HIV at screening Participant who smokes more than 10 cigarettes or 2 cigars or 2 pipes per day from within 3 months before screening until the end of the study Participant is a woman who is pregnant, or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant from signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) onwards until 30 days after study drug administration Participant is a man who plans to father a child while enrolled in this study (Day 1) until 30 days after study drug administration. Cohorts 13: Participant requires dialysis Participant with imminent renal replacement therapy (ie, during the study period)</criteria>
