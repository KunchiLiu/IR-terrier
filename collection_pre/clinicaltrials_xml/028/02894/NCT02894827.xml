	<brief_summary>Polypathology in elderly subjects requires polypharmacy but even though the efficacy of a medication and digestive tolerance are ensured, the medication can be taken a long time from meals to reduce its side-effects. Despite numerous studies that have investigated links between medication and malnutrition, none have assessed the influence of the time the drug is taken on the evolution of the nutritional status of elderly hospitalized persons. So as to identify the best nutritional criterion in hospitalized persons, a retrospective pilot study will be conducted in about thirty patients. Their medication will be recorded and their nutritional status will be evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), albumin, prealbumin levels, weight and the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) short form. This preliminary study will allow us to choose the best nutritional criterion to compare the impact of two strategies for taking medication (post prandial versus pre-prandial) on improving the nutritional status of malnourished elderly hospitalized patients taking multiple drugs.</brief_summary>
