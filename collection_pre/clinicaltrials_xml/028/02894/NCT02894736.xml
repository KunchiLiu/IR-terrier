	<brief_summary>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation treatment that is effective with no significant side effects. It can potentially be self-administered by patients in their own homes with remote monitoring, substantially reducing treatment costs and increasing accessibility, including to remote areas. This study will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of home-administered tDCS treatment for depression.</brief_summary>
