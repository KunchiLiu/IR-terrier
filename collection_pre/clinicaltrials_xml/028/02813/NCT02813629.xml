	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is verify if the use of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) associated to peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) has an analgesic effect in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The association between tDCS and PES may have additive effects in pain control, and should be an alternative for pain control in patients with SCD. This technique is safe and inexpensive, being able to contribute to the control of symptoms and improve quality of life of these individuals. Its effects may decrease pain intensity and / or increase of the period between episodes of acute pain. It may also affect pain modulatory pathways in the brain interfering with thalamocortical dysthymia, a phenomenon associated with decreased modulation of the thalamus by the primary motor cortex.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS Associated With Peripheral Electrical Stimulation for Pain Control in Individuals With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell diseases are a group of inherited diseases whose cause is the presence of the S hemoglobin (HbS), that comes from a point mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the substitution of the amino Glutamic Acid for the Valine acid at the sixth position of the β chains. There are other mutant hemoglobins, such as C hemoglobin (HbC), D hemoglobin (HbD), E hemoglobin (HbE), among others, that associated with HbS (i.e. heterozygous for sickle cell and C hemoglobin (SC), heterozygous for sickle cell and D hemoglobin (SD), heterozygous for sickle cell and E hemoglobin (SE)) form a group called sickle cell diseases (SCD), but the sickle cell anemia (SS) is the most known. Pain, in its various manifestations, is the symptom most often associated to SCD, being responsible for over 90% of hospital admissions. Oftenly pain has a major impact on the patient's life and is associated with some degree of disability. Chronic pain may reflect the continuity of tissue injury and central nervous system maladaptive plasticity. They start with tissue injuries such as leg ulcers, avascular osteonecrosis, chronic osteomyelitis, arthropathy, or even continue after the repair process, by central nervous sensitization and / or peripheral. The lack of diagnosis in cases of chronic and neuropathic pain in patients with SCD is common, implying inappropriate use of therapeutic resources by the health services, resulting in increased suffering to the patient. The release of inflammatory mediators is related to the perception of pain, and may cause nociceptor sensitization. Even with all the huge pharmaceutical development, it is still extremely difficult to treat chronic pain of these individuals satisfactorily. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-pharmacological and non-invasive technique for pain control that can be an alternative for the treatment of patients with SCD. tDCS has the potential to change the neuronal membrane resting potential, this effect is dependent on the polarity, being that cathode produces hyperpolarization, whereas anode produces depolarization, in this way can induce an effect of inhibition and facilitation of neuronal firing, respectively. This effects can induces changes in cortical excitability. Although tDCS may modulate areas related to endogenous pain control, its effects seem to be diffuse, and focality would probably enhance its effects. Peripheral electrical stimulation (PES), in another way, may also modulate cortical excitability, depending mainly on its amplitude and frequency. PES modulation of cortical excitability is very focal, occurring only in the stimulated region. The easier and safer way of administering PES is trough transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a non-pharmacological conservative method widely used by health professionals aimed at relieving pain. The combination of two neuromodulatory techniques may have additive effects, one promoting a general effect (tDCS), and the other a more focal effect (TENS). However, if they are combined in a way they both have excitatory effects, the effects may be canceled trough metaplastic mechanisms. Combing an excitatory with an inhibitory technique may have additive effects. Although this additive effect has been demonstrated in some pathological conditions, it has not yet been shown in SCD, a disease with particular characteristics such as being present during all the lifespan of the individual, provoking many sources of tissue injury and presenting acute crisis during chronic phase. As a secondary outcome, the investigators are going to access the influence of the intervention on quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Growing evidence points out to different brain characteristics between individuals with chronic pain and healthy. qEEG has high temporal resolution and evaluates primary electrical effects of neural excitation, allowing identify possible patterns of brain functioning in individuals with chronic pain. qEEG allowed the identification of the thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) in patients with chronic pain characterized by an increased low frequency band power density theta (4 - 7Hz) and a decrease in high frequency bands alpha (8 -12Hz) and beta (13 - 30Hz). This dysrhythmic mechanism may occur from the periphery to the thalamus (bottom-up) or cortical dysregulation (top-down), disinhibition of the thalamus. This process results in hyperpolarization of thalamic neurons, leading to a preponderance of low frequency oscillations in qEEG. The persistence thalamic firing at low frequencies can lead to a collateral inhibition in cortical regions around, which could theoretically lead to a decrease in the higher frequencies. This increase occurs at low frequency regions involved in neuro matrix of pain. The mediators released by cells of the immune and inflammatory system can act directly on neurons sensitizing and enabling them (usually peripheral nociceptors or neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord). There are several mediators in a long and growing list that includes cytokines and neurotrophins.The major cytokines in an acute inflammation are the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and the interleukins (IL-1), IL-6 and IL-8, which are important mediators of acute and chronic inflammatory reactions, as well as processes of repair and resolution. High serum levels of IL-8 have been observed in patients in vase-occlusive crisis, important clinical aspect of the pathogenesis of SCD. The presence of the mutant allele A appears to influence the expression of the TNF-alpha, being the AA genotype considered a high producer. Neurotrophins are dimeric proteins that are essential for the normal development of the nervous system in vertebrates. This family includes the nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other neurotrophins (NT). Currently, it is recognized that certain neurotrophins, particularly the NGF and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF play a significant role in nociception, so that the NGF sensitizes nociceptors at the periphery, while the BDNF enhances the response ability of the dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord. The BDNF gene, which encodes the BDNF protein, located on chromosome 11 at the boundary of regions 11p13 and 11p14 of the human genome has been investigated in a wide range of areas related to neuroplasticity, including differences in brain morphology, learning and memory, interactions with brain stimulation protocols of plasticity induction and recovery after brain injury and has been associated with a wide variety of neurological disorders, including, for example, depression, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</detailed_description>
