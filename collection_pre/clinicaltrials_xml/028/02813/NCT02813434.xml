	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at examining the interest of amyloid radiotracer Florbetapir (18F-AV-45) for the etiological diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment and dementia. This study stems from two converging objectives: (1) the need to refine characteristics of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia (VD) in order to propose diagnosis criteria of VCI and of mixed dementia and to improve diagnosis criteria of VD and (2) the need to improve the etiological diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment and dementia. It will take advantage from the ongoing GRECOG-VASC study (which determines the cognitive status 6 months poststroke in consecutive patients according to a standardized international battery) coordinated by the Amiens University Hospital center, the opportunity to perform amyloid imaging in vivo using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Florbetapir (a production site is located in the city of Amiens) and the collaboration between neurology and imaging departments of Amiens University hospital.</brief_summary>
