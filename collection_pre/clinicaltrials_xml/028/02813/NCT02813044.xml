	<brief_summary>A number of studies have compared the effects of total intravenous anesthesia(TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia on perioperative period during transsphenoidal surgery. However, they have limitations especially for the phase of recovery after anesthesia: a fragmentary assessment. Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) questionnaire was multi-dimensionally designed to assess the degree of recovery, specially after anesthesia and surgery. In this study, the investigators aim to compare the quality of recovery after inhalational anesthesia and after TIVA through QoR-40 questionnaire in patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary tumor under general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
