	<brief_summary>Objective: Investigating the immediate effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on neuromuscular performance in healthy subjects after an induced muscle fatigue protocol. Methods: Eighty volunteers of both genders aged between 18 and 28 years underwent a preliminary evaluation using surface electromyography and isokinetic dynamometer of the flexor muscles of the elbow. The subjects were randomly allocated into 4 groups: G1 was control group; G2 placebo; G3 laser applied before fatigue protocol; and G4 immediately after. Muscular fatigue protocol consisted of 30 maximal concentric isokinetic contractions at 120Â°/s of the elbow flexor muscles. An 808 nm equipment was used for applying laser therapy, with a power of 100 mW and total energy of 20 J. Volunteers were reassessed after interventions.</brief_summary>
