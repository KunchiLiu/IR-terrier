	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the short-term effectiveness (2 and 6 weeks following the start of the rehabilitation program), in terms of symptoms and functional limitations, of a rehabilitation program centered on gradual reloading to a rehabilitation program centered on rest and cryotherapy in individuals with acute rotator cuff tendinopathy. The secondary objective is to explore the effects of these programs on shoulder control (acromiohumeral distance), subacromial structures (supraspinatus tendon thickness) and central pain modulation. The hypothesis is that the rehabilitation program centered on gradual reloading will lead to a faster improvement at week 2 and 6 when compared to the program centered on rest and cryotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Treatments for Acute Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>44 adults (aged between 18 and 65) with acute (&lt; 6 weeks) unilateral symptomatic RC tendinopathy will be recruited.This single-blind (assessor), parallel-group RCT will include three evaluation sessions over 6 weeks (baseline, week 2, week 6) and one meeting with the treating physiotherapist (right after the baseline evaluation). All participants will take part in the baseline evaluation. They will first complete a questionnaire on sociodemographic, symptomatology and comorbidity, as well as self-administered questionnaires that evaluate symptoms and functional limitations (DASH, WORC and BPI). Then, ultrasonographic (US) measurements of AHD and of the supraspinatus tendon and subacromial bursal thickness will be conducted. Thereafter, pain inhibitory control will be assessed using conditioned pain modulation. Finally, the corticospinal excitability of the infraspinatus muscle will be evaluated. Thereafter, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups, and then take part in their assigned home program. At week 2 and 6, the self-administered questionnaires will be re-administered (by phone for the week 6 evaluation). A global rating of change question (with % of change since baseline) will also be completed at week 2 and 6. US measurements, conditioned pain modulation and corticospinal excitability will only be revaluated at week 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of blinding, the assessor will complete a question related to his/her opinion of the allocation at week 2. The study will be carried out at the Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche en réadaptation et en intégration sociale (CIRRIS) by two different physiotherapists and in two different laboratories. Ethics approval will be obtained from Institutional Review Board of IRDPQ.</detailed_description>
