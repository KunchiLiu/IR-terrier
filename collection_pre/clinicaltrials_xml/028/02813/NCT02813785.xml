	<brief_summary>This Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. Treatment may continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
