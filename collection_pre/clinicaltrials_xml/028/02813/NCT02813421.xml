	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to learn more about blood glucose control when people with Type 1 Diabetes switch to an insulin pump. The investigators hope to learn whether using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) helps to create personalized insulin doses that may lead to stable blood glucoses and less frequent insulin pump dose changes during the transition to an insulin pump.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continue Glucose Monitoring Before Insulin Pump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. Participants will be asked to wear a Medtronic iPro2 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) 1-2 weeks prior to starting on insulin pump therapy. Depending on randomization groups, participants will either have CGM data used inform starting insulin pump doses (treatment group), or to standard of care for starting on insulin pump (control group). Participants will wear the CGM again during the first 5 days of pump start and at approximately 6 weeks after pump start, in order to collect blood glucose data. Each time the CGM is worn, blood glucoses must be checked 6-8 times daily, and a written log must be completed. Baseline medical information also will be collected at the start of participation. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at approximately 6 weeks after pump start. Participation in the study will be complete after a standard of care follow up visit approximately 3 months after pump start.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males and Females aged 224 years 2. Clinical diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus 3. Duration of diabetes: At least 6 months This will ensure some glycemic stability prior to study, and most children do not start on an insulin pump until about 6 months into their diagnosis. 4. Basal/bolus insulin regimen using longacting and rapidacting insulin This will provide a uniform method of insulin therapy. 5. Willingness to perform at least 68 capillary blood glucose tests per day while wearing the iPro速2 6. Willingness to wear the iPro速2 for 5 days continuously per insertion 7. Participant agrees to comply with the study protocol requirements 8. Informed Consent, Assent, HIPAA Authorization, and California Experimental Subject Bill of Rights signed by the participant and/or parent guardian 1. Comorbid conditions, including but not limited to cystic fibrosis, oncologic processes, other systemic diseases that may affect overall glycemic control 2. Glucocorticoid use within 2 weeks of study enrollment 3. Concurrent use of other medications that may affect glycemic control 4. Prior CGM use in the past 6 months 5. The participant has any skin abnormality (e.g. psoriasis, rash, staphylococcus infection) in the area of iPro速2 placement that has not been resolved at the time of enrollment and would inhibit the participant from wearing the iPro速2. 6. NonEnglish or nonSpanish speaking</criteria>
