	<brief_summary>In this study 30 men, with advanced metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) planned to have hormonal treatment, will undergo conventional imaging and functional imaging prior to treatment and post treatment to determine if changes in imaging results will be prognostic of outcome. Patients will have a clinical follow-up every 3 months post randomization for one year and followed for survival at Years 2 and 3.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study 30 men, with advanced metastatic CRPC intended to have abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide hormonal treatment will undergo conventional imaging including a 99mTc-Methyl diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan and Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, and functional imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT and 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) PET-CT one to four weeks prior to hormonal treatment and approximately 10 weeks post hormonal treatment. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) will also be obtained at baseline and every three months in the first year. Baseline imaging of disease and changes between baseline and follow-up imaging on 18F-FDG PET-CT and 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT will be compared with standard of care imaging (99mTc-MDP bone scan and CT of the abdomen/pelvis) as well as with clinical evaluation including response to therapy and progression of disease. This information could be used by clinicians to guide androgen receptor (AR) - targeted therapy. Patients will have a clinical follow-up every 3 months post randomization for one year and will be followed for survival at Years 2 and 3.</detailed_description>
