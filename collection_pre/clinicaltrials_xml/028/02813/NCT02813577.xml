	<brief_summary>The post approval study will enroll US female patients presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain and an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery. Subjects are treated per Instructions For Use (IFU) with the Lutonix Catheter. Subjects will have a Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) and clinical follow-up through two (2) years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon for Treatment of Femoropopliteal Arteries in United States Females (CONFIRM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Lutonix® 035 Drug Coated Balloon Percutaneous Transluminal angioplasty (PTA) Catheter (Lutonix® Catheter) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (P130024) for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, after pre-dilatation, of de novo or restenotic lesions up to 150mm in length in native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries with reference vessel diameters of 4-6mm.The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Lutonix Catheter for treatment of stenosis or occlusion of the femoral and popliteal arteries in the United States (US) female population. This study will enroll 160 female patients at a minimum of 10 US centers and a maximum of 25.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Nonpregnant female ≥18 years of age; 2. Rutherford Clinical Category 24; 3. Patient is willing to provide informed consent, is geographically stable, comply with the required follow up visits and testing schedule; Angiographic Criteria 4. De novo or nonstented restenotic lesion(s) in native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries; 5. Lesion length ≤150 mm; Note: Lesion location starts ≥1 cm below the common femoral bifurcation and terminates distally ≤2 cm below the tibial plateau AND ≥1 cm above the origin of the tibialperoneal trunk: 6. Lesion ≥70% stenosis by visual estimate; 7. Target reference vessel diameter of 46mm 8. Lesion(s) is located at least 3cm from any stent, if target vessel was previously stented; Note: Successful inflow artery treatment is defined as attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular complication. 10. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%) stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized (treatment of outflow disease is NOT permitted during the index procedure); 11. Successful antegrade wire crossing and predilatation of the target lesion; Note: Successful predilatation defined by residual stenosis ≤30% Lesion is not appropriate for stenting due to proximity to the knee joint. 12. No other prior vascular interventions within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30 days after the protocol treatment except for remote common femoral patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the lesion(s). 1. Life expectancy of &lt;1 years 2. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study or previously enrolled in this study; Note: Enrollment in another investigational drug or device study during the follow up period is not allowed 3. History of stroke within 3 months; 4. History of Myocardial Infarction (MI), thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of index procedure; 5. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/L within 30 days of index procedure or treated with dialysis; 6. Sudden symptom onset, acute vessel occlusion, or acute or subacute thrombus in target vessel; 7. Use of adjunctive primary treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, cutting balloon, etc.)</criteria>
