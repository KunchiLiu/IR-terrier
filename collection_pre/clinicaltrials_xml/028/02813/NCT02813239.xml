	<brief_summary>In in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, even after adequate triggering, some patients present a high rate of immature oocytes retrieved after controlled ovarian stimulation. In vitro oocyte maturation is still an experimental technique, with poorer results than conventional IVF. For that reason improve in in vivo maturation could have a better impact on reproductive outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Triggering in Patients With a High Immature Oocyte Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators performed an observational study analyzing the difference in the percentage of mature oocytes retrieved in patients with more than 50% immature oocytes in a previous IVF cycle triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG) compared to the rate of mature oocytes retrieved in subsequent cycles, triggered with both gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and (hCG). The main outcome measure was the number and percentage of mature oocytes retrieved.</detailed_description>
