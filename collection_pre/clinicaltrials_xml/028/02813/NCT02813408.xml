	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) participants is to explore whether or not there are differences between participants treated with abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), Fatigue, Pain, Cognitive function and medical resource use (MRU).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male 18 years of age or older Participant with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate Participant with documented metastatic prostate cancer Participant with documented castration resistance with progression of prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) Participant who will be initiated on either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (per physician's evaluation) after failure of ADT at the time of treatment initiation Participants who signed a participation agreement or Informed consent form (ICF) per local regulations The treatment decision (abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) by the treating physician must have been taken before enrollment into the study Baseline patientreported outcomes (PROs) must be captured before the first administration of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.
