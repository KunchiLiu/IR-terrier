	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to study cardiac output, stroke volume, and fluid responsiveness on young adult pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery with the use of the NICOM, a non-invasive monitor. The NICOM method is non-invasive and provides reliable trending of cardiac output and stroke volume. Measuring cardiac output in conjunction with routine monitoring will provide a better assessment of intra-operative status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will involve measurements of cardiac output, stroke volume, and fluid responsiveness (change in stroke volume of â‰¥ 10%) obtained via passive leg raise (PLR) before and after anesthesia induction.</detailed_description>
