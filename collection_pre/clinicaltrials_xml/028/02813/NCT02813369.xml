	<brief_summary>This post-authorization observational safety study (PASS) monitors clinically important identified and potential risks within a cohort of patients treated with naloxegol, including the occurrence of bowel perforation, acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascular (CV)-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity. This study is part of a broader post-marketing commitment to augment routine evaluation of the safety profile of naloxegol in clinical practice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the safety of naloxegol in the indicated population and within at-risk vulnerable populations identified in the naloxegol risk management plan (RMP) by describing type and frequency of identified and potential risks (including bowel perforation, acute MI, stroke, CV-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity) in patients ≥18 years of age diagnosed with non-cancer pain who were treated with opioids chronically and subsequently treated with naloxegol in routine post-authorization use. The primary objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of bowel perforation, acute MI, stroke, all-cause mortality, and hypertension in patients treated with naloxegol (Naloxegol Inception Cohort, (NIC)), a Concurrent Reference Cohort (CRC), and by pre-specified sub-populations that include patients aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with concurrent use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors/inducer or P-glycoprotein (Pgp) modulators. An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of CV-specific mortality, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity in patients treated with naloxegol (NIC), a CRC, and by pre-specified sub-populations that include patients aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors/inducer or Pgp modulators.</detailed_description>
