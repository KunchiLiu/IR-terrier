	<brief_summary>The investigators believe epilepsy alters the way the body controls blood pressure, heart rate and breathing, and these changes increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in patients with epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP-7 is a risk scoring tool which may correlate with these changes to the heart and blood vessels. This research study measures those differences which may help identify new markers to help predict those patients at greatest risk in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Circulatory Control and SUDEP Risk.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators overall goals are to determine whether measures of neural-circulatory control during the interictal waking and sleep states, as well as during the ictal/peri-ictal periods, are associated with SUDEP-7 score risk profiles in refractory epilepsy patients, and to translate these measures into tools for risk-stratification and preventative strategies for SUDEP.</detailed_description>
