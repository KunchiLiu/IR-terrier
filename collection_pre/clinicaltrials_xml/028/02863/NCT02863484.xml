	<brief_summary>The blood loss will be compared in middle fossa meningiomas which will receive pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and those which will not revive pealing before the dura is opened</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cavernous Sinus Dissection and Bleeding in Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cases with middle fossa meningiomas will be randomised to one of two surgical techniques. The first technique will involve pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus before the dura is opened and the tumour attacked, and the second group of cases will be operated by a standard technique, where the tumour will be directly attacked with out pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Blood loss will be monitored in each case by calculating the amount of blood in the suction container and subtracting it from the amount of fluids used for irrigation during surgery. The number of cotton patties and dressings will be also counted with each case as well as the number of gauzes used. The pre-operative complete blood picture will be documented particularly the haemoglobin , hematocrits and others. The same lab data will be also monitored after surgery. The amount of blood transfusion required will also be calculated in each case.</detailed_description>
