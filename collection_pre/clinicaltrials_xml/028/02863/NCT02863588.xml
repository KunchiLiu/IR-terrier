	<brief_summary>Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) is a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. OT is responsible for 30 to 50% of posterior uveitis. It is characterized by dormant infections that may reactivate without known reasons, causing severe irreversible visual loss. The overall recurrence rate of OT in Europe is greater than 80% for patients and may range from one episode to 11 episodes (1% of OT) in the most extreme cases. Current treatments do not reduce the risk of recurrences and the risk of toxoplasmosis recurrence cannot be predicted in these immunocompetent patients. These clinical and biological expression changes might be related to an individual genetic susceptibility of each patient. The advanced analysis of the entire genome now possible to consider the project.</brief_summary>
