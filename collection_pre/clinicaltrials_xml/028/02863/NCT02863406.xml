	<brief_summary>Comparison of dusting rate of bronchoalveolar lavage in healthy volunteers and patients suffering from sarcoidosis. Blind analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage with Optical Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy and MicroAnalysis. For patients, comparison of bronchoalveolar lavage, pathological examination of biopsies (Optical Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy and MicroAnalysis) and specific Professional and environmental questionnary. Healthy volunteers matched with patients regarding to age (every 10 years), sex and tobacco consumption (non-smoking, smoking less than 5 pack-year, smoking between 5 and 10 pack-year, smoking more than 10 pack-year)</brief_summary>
