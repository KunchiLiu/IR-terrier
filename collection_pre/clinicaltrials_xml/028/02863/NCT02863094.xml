	<brief_title>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Treatment for Schizophrenia Patients With Auditory Hallucinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine laboratory studies before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to rTMS group and the sham group. There are about 20 patients in each group. For the first 20 patients, allocation was by coin toss. For the subsequent 20 patients, allocation was according to computer generated random numbers. The decision to enroll a patient was always made prior to randomization. Patients were studied using a double-blind design. Study participants, clinical raters, and all personnel responsible for the clinical care of the patient remained masked to allocated condition and allocation parameters. Only rTMS administrators had access to the randomization list; they had minimal contact with the patients, and no role in assessing AVH. Each patient would be treated for continuous 15 days by rTMS Before the rTMS treatment, the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained by a trained investigator to assess baseline severity of auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) and other symptoms. The patients had receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and electroencephalography (EEG) record. After the last treatment, the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained, as well as the Global Index of Safety to assess adverse events of the treatment. Patients were instructed to focus their answers on the past 15 days. The patients had also receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record. A month after the last treatment, participants were interviewed to obtain the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale, Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale, the Positive, and Negative Syndrome Scale. They were instructed to focus their answers on the past week. Additionally, they were also asked to assess the battery of neuropsychological tests, and have magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and EEG record. Afterwards, they were unblinded by the study coordinator.</detailed_description>
