	<brief_title>Nintedanib as Switch Maintenance Treatment of Pleural Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, prospective, double blinded, randomized, two-arm phase II trial aiming to evaluate nintedanib treatment as switch maintenance in patients with unresectable MPM. After signing of the informed consent and upon confirmation of all eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized 1:1 to: - Arm A: twice daily nintedanib at a dose of 200 mg until progression or unacceptable toxicities. - Arm B: matched placebo. Response evaluation will be performed through CT scans every 8 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of unresectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM); Response or Stable disease according to modified RECIST criteria [48] after first line platinumpemetrexed chemotherapy for 46 cycles; Last platinum chemotherapy dose administered within 60 days (i.e. randomization must occur within 60 days from the last dose of the last cycle of platinumpemetrexed chemotherapy); Age &gt;18 years; ECOG performance status (PS) 02; Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the opinion of the investigator; Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to start of first dose prior systemic anticancer therapy including cytotoxic therapy or immunecheckpoint inhibitor, for MPM, other than first line platinumbased doublet chemotherapy; previous extrapleural pneumonectomy (other forms of previous surgery eg pleurectomy are acceptable); previous Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors (eg bevacizumab, sorafenib, etc); treatment with other investigational drugs or treatment in another clinical interventional trial within the past 4 weeks before start of therapy or concomitantly with the trial; patients that, in the opinion of the investigator, have reduced performance status by 2 ECOG levels (e.g. PS 0 to 2 or PS 1 to 3) from beginning to completion of 1st line chemotherapy; radiotherapy (with the exception of palliative radiotherapy) during study or within 4 weeks of start of study drug; known brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with suspicious neurological symptoms should undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasisNo active brain metastases (e.g. stable for &lt; 4 weeks;, no adequate previous treatment with radiotherapy;, symptomatic, requiring treatment with anticonvulsants; dexamethasone therapy will be allowed if administered as stable dose for at least one month before randomization); patients with suspicious neurological symptoms should undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to assess brain metastasis; leptomeningeal metastases; significant weight loss (&gt; 10 %) within the past 6 weeks prior to treatment in the present trial; preexisting clinically significant ascites and/or clinically significant pleural effusion; active or history of bleeding complications that would prevent antiangiogenic therapy centrally located tumors with radiographic evidence (CT or MRI) of local invasion of major blood vessels; typical mediastinal pleural involvement with mesothelioma remains eligible; clinically active cancer other than mesothelioma within 5 years prior to start of study treatment; radiographic evidence of cavitatory or necrotic tumors; unstoppable use of therapeutic anticoagulation (except low dose heparin and/or heparin flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device) or antiplatelet therapy (except for chronic lowdose therapy with acetylsalicylic acid =325mg per day); clinically significant cardiovascular diseases (i.e. hypertension not controlled by medical therapy, unstable angina, history of myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, congestive New York Heart Association (NYHA) II, serious cardiac arrhythmia, clinically significant pericardial effusion)</criteria>
