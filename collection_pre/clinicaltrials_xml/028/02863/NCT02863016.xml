	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect and timing of action on the inflammatory state of a acetate-free containing citrate concentrate (Cit-, 1 mM Citrate) in online postidultion HDF with high volumes compared to traditional concentrated (Ac-, 3 mM of acetate ) in the medium term. In addition, the study will evaluate other parameters of efficiency dialysis, cardiovascular stability, the safety of the concentrate with regard to bone metabolism and vessel calcification in the medium term.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate if a hemodiafiltration with concentrated citrate (Cit-HDF) in 3 months can reduce the inflammation markers, evaluated by a Predialytic value of Beta2-microglobulin (B2m), CRP and IL6 compared to traditional concentrated acetic acid (Ac-HDF). The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate if Cit-HDF, compared to Ac-HDF, can have an effect in a period of 3 months on the following aspects: - the change weekly pre-dialysis values of other markers of oxidative stress (TAC, NF-kB); - the technical parameters of HDF treatment, such as convective volumes, and blood pressure in the circuit in the filter (TMP, pressure pre-filter); - the cardiovascular stability through blood pressure and heart rate before and after dialysis (SBP, DBP, HR) and number of intradialytic hypotension; - the parameters of safety as the variation of the values of the mobility Predialytic bone (PTH, alkaline phosphatase, fetuin-A), the variation of the values intradialytic biochemical impacted by citrate (total and ionized calcium, bicarbonate) and clotting time (aPTT); - the variation of calcifications observed by: - the expression of molecules that express the ability of calcification of muscle cells and endothelial cells in culture with plasma taken at the beginning of treatment - a measure of carotid intimal thickness and pulse vawe velocity by Eco Color Doppler (optional); - dialysis efficiency by varying pre-and post-dialysis (RR%) and Clearance average molecular weight solutes with small and medium (Phosphorus, Beta2 Micro, Myoglobin) and indices of dialysis adequacy of small molecules such as EKT / V based on the dialysance ion formula Watson (calculated automatically by the monitor to dialysis);</detailed_description>
