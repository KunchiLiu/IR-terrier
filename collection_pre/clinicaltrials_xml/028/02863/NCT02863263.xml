	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of MedifoamⓇ and BetafoamⓇ in Pressure Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the primary objective, the percentage of completely healed patients and the time to complete healing will be assessed after applying the study device, MedifoamⓇ or BetafoamⓇ, for 12 weeks to pressure ulcer patients. In addition, the pressure ulcer size reduction rate over 12 weeks will be evaluated. Patients will make once weekly site visits. There are 14 visits in total, including a screening visit 14 days (maximum) before the baseline visit.</detailed_description>
