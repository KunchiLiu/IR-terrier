	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-masked, vehicle-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of corneal collagen cross-linking the keratoprosthesis carrier tissue in subjects who are candidates for high-risk keratoprosthesis implantation but because of a history of corneal melts or autoimmune diseases are not candidate for a traditional corneal transplant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is a multi-center, parallel, randomized, double-blinded study with subsequent follow-up period of two years. Eight-four subjects across twelve sites will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a corneal tissue that have been cross-linked or not cross-linked (No UVA light source). Cross-linking is a term that refers to the linking of polymers (long chain) molecules by chemical bonds. It is believed that cross-linking the cornea will make the cornea stronger and more resistant to degradation. Tissue Bank International (Orlando site) will supply the donor tissue and Avedro Inc (Waltham MA) will supply the riboflavin and the UV light source. Staff at Tissue Bank International will administer the riboflavin with dextran solution and perform the cross-linking procedure according to one of randomization groups before shipping the masked donor cornea to study sites for Boston Keratoprosthesis (B-KPro) implantation.</detailed_description>
