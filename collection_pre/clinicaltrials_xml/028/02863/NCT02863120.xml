	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing total knee replacement with two different methods of local pain control:shots of liposomal bupivacaine, a long acting anesthetic, directly into the knee during surgery or anesthetic delivered continuously to the adductor canal to provide long term pain relief. The goal is to try to find a standard protocol that provides the greatest pain relief for patients undergoing total knee replacement.</brief_summary>
