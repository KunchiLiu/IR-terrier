	<brief_title>COMRADE: Collaborative Care Management for Distress and Depression in Rural Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to implement and evaluate, using a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial, a unique collaborative, stepped-care intervention for patients with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes and co-morbid distress and/or depression. The investigators approach will combine practice-based medical and cognitive behavioral treatment with strong community-based support to immediately place the patient at the right level of intervention based on disease and severity and to step-up treatment intensity and follow-up if the initial response is inadequate. The practice-based component will use a care manager linked to medical, pharmacologic, and behavioral colleagues. The community based component will utilize community health workers to provide support and facilitate access to resources. Goals include: 1) implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention; 2) examining the impact of this approach on psychological mediators of improved glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c); and 3) building, sustaining, and disseminating a cost-effective care model.</detailed_description>
