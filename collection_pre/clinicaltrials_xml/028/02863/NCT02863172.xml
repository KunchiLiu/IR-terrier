	<brief_summary>Objectives: 1. To examine the variations in clinical features, survival outcomes, family history, and health behavior among proband patients who are known or suspected to have a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome 2. To compare the clinical features, survival outcomes, and health behavior of the proband vs. his/her family members who may or may not be affected by the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome 3. To explore for correlations between germline genetic variations in both the probands and family members with observed variations in the overall disease phenotype across probands and kindreds, within a given syndrome. Disease phenotype is defined to include: (1) clinicopathologic features including patient demographics and oncologic outcomes; (2) clinical manifestations of disease including the timing, spectrum and severity of CRC and extracolonic cancers. Genetic variations may include the specific codon mutated, the type of mutation and sequence alteration, chromosomal/gene copy number changes, and gene polymorphisms. 4. To explore for correlations between germline genetic variations in both the probands and family members with observed variations in somatic CRC tumor biology, including tumor pathology and other tumor molecular markers</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants: Questionnaires: If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will fill out a some questionnaires about their work, family history, medical history, and health habits. If participant has already answered these questionnaires when they were registered as a patient at MD Anderson, the study staff will give participant a copy and review their answers with them for any updates or if they have any questions. It should take about 20 minutes to complete the questionnaires. Participant will also complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire, which contains 20 questions for men and 22 questions for women. This questionnaire should take about 10 minutes to complete. The questionnaires will either be given to participant by the research staff at their MD Anderson visit. If participant is not at MD Anderson, the questionnaires will be mailed to them with a pre-paid envelope to return the questionnaires to the study staff. Blood or Saliva Sample: Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn. If possible, the blood will be drawn during an already scheduled blood draw to avoid additional needle sticks. If participant is unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, they may give a saliva sample instead. If participant is at MD Anderson, a saliva kit will be given to them. If participant is not at MD Anderson, the kit will be mailed to them with instructions for collecting the saliva sample and a prepaid envelope will be included to return the sample to the study staff. The blood or saliva sample will be sent to the research laboratory of the study chairs at MD Anderson for testing. Follow-Up Questionnaires: Participant will also fill out a follow-up questionnaire at least 1 time in 5 years to update your medical, cancer, and family history. Each questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Withdrawing from the Study: Participant may withdraw from participation in this study at any time. If participant decides they want to stop taking part in this study, data collected about them and data taken from the blood or saliva samples they have provided up to the time they withdraw will remain in study database and will be used for the purposes of the study. Length of Study: Patient's active participation on this study will be over after the blood or saliva samples have been collected and they have completed all of the questionnaires. This is an investigational study. Up to 2,000 patients and/or family members will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Family Members: Questionnaire: Participant will complete a health questionnaire, which will collect information about their personal medical history, demographics (age, race, sex, and so on), and questions about your alcohol and tobacco use. This questionnaire should take about 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire will either be given to participant by the research staff at their MD Anderson visit, or they will be mailed to participant's home with a prepaid envelope to return the questionnaire to the study staff. Blood or Saliva Sample: If participant agrees to take part in this study and they are able to come to MD Anderson, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn. If participant is unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, they may give a saliva sample instead. If participant is at MD Anderson, a saliva kit will be given to them. If participant is not at MD Anderson, the kit will be mailed to them with instructions for collecting the saliva sample and a prepaid envelope will be included to return the sample to the study staff. The blood or saliva sample will be sent to the research laboratory of the study chairs at MD Anderson for testing. Follow-Up Questionnaires: Participant will also fill out a follow-up questionnaire at least 1 time in 5 years to update their medical, cancer, and family history. Each questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Withdrawing from the Study: Participant may withdraw from participation in this study at any time. If participant decides they want to stop taking part in this study, data collected about them and data taken from the blood or saliva samples they have provided up to the time they withdraw will remain in study database and will be used for the purposes of the study.

This is an investigational study. Up to 2,000 patients and/or family members will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
