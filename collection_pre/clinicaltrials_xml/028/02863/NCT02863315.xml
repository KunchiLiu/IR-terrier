	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) applied on spinal cord in patients with spinal cord injury who have chronic neuropathic pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Anodal tsDCS on Chronic Neuropathic Pain After SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tsDCS (2 mA) over tenth thoracic vertebra for 20 min (reference electrodes on the head vertex). Treatment order was randomly assigned. A evaluator rated the pain using the visual analogue scale for pain, Patient Global Assessment and Present Pain Intensity.</detailed_description>
