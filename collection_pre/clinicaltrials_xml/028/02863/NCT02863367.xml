	<brief_title>A One-Arm Exploratory Clinical Trial of Apatinib Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This test is a single center, one-armed exploratory clinical research, aimed at the evaluation the efficacy and safety of Apatinib with Gemcitabine in the patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer. This study plan in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital.From launched in July 2016, this research intends to recruit the end time about as of December 2017, is expected to the end of the test time is in December 2017. If do not have the appearance of the following circumstances, such as the subjects out of informed consent, drug toxicity tolerance or the researchers think that do not fit for further test, each subject research and treatment time is expected until imaging of tumor progression.</detailed_description>
