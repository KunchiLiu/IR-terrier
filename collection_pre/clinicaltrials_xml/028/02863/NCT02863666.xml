	<brief_title>Verification of Prediction Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel algorithm for determining risk of acute cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, for patients presenting to the ED has recently been reported. Unlike prior risk stratification tools that relied on basic vital sign data, this algorithm utilizes advanced computing of ECG data to solve the risk classification problem. Data will be collected on patients presenting to the emergency department with a primary complaint that is determined to be cardiopulmonary of origin by a clinician. Verification of the results of the previous studies using this algorithm in a more diverse patient cohorts is required. As such, the proposed study will investigate the accuracy of the algorithm.</detailed_description>
