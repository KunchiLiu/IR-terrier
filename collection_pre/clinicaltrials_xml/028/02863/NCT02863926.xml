	<brief_title>Use of Autologous Concentrated Bone Marrow Aspirate in Preventing Wound Complications in Below Knee Amputation (BKA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for BKA will receive bone marrow cells concentrated via the MarrowStim device (cBMA) injected IM at 25 sites in the leg proximal to the BKA in the index limb to prevent ischemic wound complications after surgery. cBMA or control (0.9% NaCl) will be injected into the ATM below the point of amputation at 4 selected sites for analytical purposes. Patients will be scheduled for amputation at Days 7, 14, or 21 post injection. Safety will be evaluated by review of treatment related adverse events (AE) during the 12-month follow-up period. The investigator will compare rates of wound complications and conversion from BKA to AKA to historical controls at the institution to assess trends in therapeutic efficacy. Patients will undergo BKA and injection sites will be harvested at that time. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) will determine capillary density and local host immune responses. Angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines will be quantified using a multiplex array system and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be ≥ 40 and ≤80 years of age. 2. Patients requiring below knee amputation, as determined by an independent vascular specialist, for rest pain, nonsuppurative gangrene, or ulceration due to limb ischemia. 3. Resting Ankle Brachial Index &lt; 0.55 or TBI &lt; 0.40. 4. Ulceration or gangrene distal to malleoli (to allow adequate length of ATM for 4 injections 4 cm. apart) 5. Subjects with bilirubin in the range 0.3 1.9 mg/dL 6. BKA can safely be performed up to 30 days after screening, as determined by an independent vascular or orthopedic surgeon. This information will be documented in subjects' case report forms (CRFs). 7. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use one form of birth control for the duration of the study. Female participants must undergo a blood or urine pregnancy test at screening. 1. Evidence of infection. Suppurative gangrene: purulence emanating from gangrenous areas, with or without compression. Spreading cellulitis: proximal progression of erythema from wound within 24 hours. Systemic manifestations of infection: WBC &gt; 11.5k (with antibiotic therapy &gt; 24 hours), increasing oxygen requirements or pulmonary failure, pressor support , change in creatinine &gt; 50% from baseline 2. Patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant in the next 12 months, or lactating. 3. Significant hepatic dysfunction (ALT or AST greater than 2 times normal). 4. CHF hospitalization within the last 1 month prior to enrollment.* 5. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the last 1 month prior to enrollment.* 6. HIV positive, active HBV or HCV. 7. History of cancer within the last 5 years, except basal cell skin carcinoma 8. Any bleeding diathesis defined as an INR ≥ 2.0 (off anticoagulation therapy) or history of platelet count less than 70,000 or hemophilia. 9. Inability to provide written informed consent due to cognitive or language barriers (interpreter permitted). 10. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical investigative trial. 11. Any condition requiring immunosuppressant medications (e.g., for treatment of organ transplants, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, alopecia areata). 12. Presence of any clinical condition that in the opinion of the PI or the sponsor makes the patient not suitable to participate in the trial. As defined by the standard definitions of CHF and ACS by the American Heart Association.</criteria>
