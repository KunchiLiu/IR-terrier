	<brief_summary>The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing and associated with obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia in recent years. Aerobic exercise indeed reduces adipose, hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic fat. However, diaphragmatic breathing improves cardiopulmonary function, the oxygen content of the body and therefore reduces inflammation of cells. The aim of this study is to ameliorate hepatic inflammation by using diaphragmatic breathing exercises instead of aerobic exercise to reduce the fat in liver inflammation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing and associated with obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia in recent years. Aerobic exercise indeed reduces adipose, hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic fat. However, diaphragmatic breathing improves cardiopulmonary function, the oxygen content of the body and therefore reduces inflammation of cells. The aim of this study is to ameliorate hepatic inflammation by using diaphragmatic breathing exercises instead of aerobic exercise to reduce the fat in liver inflammation. The project intends to be accomplished within three years because of the ideal exercise leaves an uncertain question for curing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hence, with the literature and empirical data analysis to review and identify the strength of patients' motion and duration, carry out a pilot observational study by including 20 patients, then teach diaphragmatic breathing exercises in the first year of the project. Observe the initial correlation measurement, the variables of the following one month and three months. For the second year, develop the training of diaphragmatic breathing process with assisting device (Diaphragmatic breathing-facilitated exercise device). Use diaphragmatic breathing exercise assisting device in a 12-week program of diaphragmatic breathing on randomized clinical trial, verifying the impact of this item interventions on patients' metabolism indicators in the final year.The project includes people who are over 20 years old without the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Taking liver function, body mass index, the thickness of subcutaneous fat, heart rate variability, metabolism indicators are mainly study measured variables. Regression Analysis helps understand the correlation between breathing exercise and indicators related to the disease. With the intervention of diaphragmatic breathing assist device, the program extensions to the two-factor analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) as the results of verification. The study results can provide a reference for clinicians, thereby improving the prognosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease people.</detailed_description>
