	<brief_title>Neuraxial Labor Analgesia and the Incidence of Postpartum Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 15% of women during the first year after giving birth, and is common across cultures. In postpartum Chinese women, the reported incidence ranged from 6.5% to 29.5%. The etiology of postpartum depression is not totally clear. Identified risk factors include previous maternal blues, unplanned pregnancy, lack of marital or social support, and previous psychiatric illnesses. Furthermore, the severe pain experienced during childbirth was reported to be associated with the occurrence of postpartum depression. A recent study of the investigators found that use of epidural analgesia during labor was associated with decreased risk of postpartum depression. However, several limitations existed in that study and further evidence is needed to reconfirm the finding. The purpose of the present study is to reevaluate whether use of neuraxial labor analgesia can reduce the incidence of postpartum depression.</detailed_description>
