	<detailed_description>The proposed randomized controlled evaluation (N=960) of the Tweet2Quit intervention will biochemically verify abstinence out to 6-months follow-up and will test the personalized benefit for women of a women-only versus co-ed Tweet2Quit group. In a 3-arm design, the investigators will compare: 1) usual care, 2) Tweet2Quit-coed, and 3) Tweet2Quit-Women only. Each Tweet2Quit group will include buddy pairs based on similarity in demographics. Also automated pattern detection will identify dips in tweeting and trigger automated alerts and engagement strategies. The primary aims tests Hypothesis 1: Relative to usual care (n=240), Tweet2Quit-coed groups (n=480) will achieve significantly greater bioconfirmed sustained abstinence out to 6-months follow-up, and Hypothesis 2: Women in Tweet2Quit will achieve significantly greater bioconfirmed 6-months abstinence in woman-only groups (n=240) vs. coed groups (n=240 women). Our secondary aims are to test the same hypotheses based on 3-month (end of treatment) sustained abstinence and 7-day point prevalence at 1, 3, and 6 months with biochemical verification at 3 and 6 months. Exploratory aims will study the Tweet2Quit groups' social network structures with a focus on the identification of buddy pairs and social brokers and test if these relationships are stronger for women in women-only groups versus women in coed groups of Tweet2Quit. *Prior to the start of the RCT, the investigators will run one coed pilot group (N=20). Total size of the study (including the pilot group) will be N=980.</detailed_description>
