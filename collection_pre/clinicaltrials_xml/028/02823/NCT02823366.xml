	<brief_summary>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been the only treatment for PBC approved by US and European drug administrations. Long-term use of UDCA(13â€”15 mg/kg/day) in patients with PBC improves serum liver biochemistries and survival free of liver transplantation However, about 40% of patients do not respond to UDCA optimally as assessed by known criteria for biochemical response. Those patients represent the group in need for additional therapies, having increased risk of disease progression and decreased survival free of liver transplantation. Both lab research and some clinical studies suggest that fenofibrate could improve cholestasis in multiple ways including reduce of bile acid synthesis, increase of biliary secretion and anti-inflammation effect. Here we start a random, open and parallel clinical research to explore the effect of fenofibrate in the PBC treatment.</brief_summary>
