	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to look at retinal abnormalities in outpatient renal dialysis patients using the FDA approved RetinaVue 100 hand-held (non-mydriatic) camera.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Retinal Screening Using the RetinaVue 100 Camera in Outpatient Dialysis Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are no studies evaluating (diabetic or non-diabetic) retinopathy in the renal dialysis patient population (~300,000 Americans). Approximately 50% of this population has End-stage Retinal Disease (ESRD) due to diabetes. Dialysis patients are among the most debilitated patients, and thus, have even more barriers to receiving their recommended annual retinal evaluation. The advent of the RetiaVue hand-held retinal camera holds great promise in this population, as dialysis patients access medical care 3 times a week, for several hours at a time at their dialysis clinic.</detailed_description>
