	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : persons who have provided written consent Patients with national health insurance cover Patients with malignant hemopathy who have been treated with chemotherapy able to induce profound neutropenia (PN &lt; 500 / mm3) lasting more than 10 days. Patients with malignant hemopathy who have received an autologous bone marrow graft Patients with severe idiopathic medullar aplasia (PN &lt; 500 / mm3) who need to be hospitalized for at least 10 consecutive days (with or without treatment with immunosuppressants) Patients who have received an bone marrow PSC allograft (as such patients have a risk of aspergillosis, which appears in most cases after medullar recovery; they will not be included in the study). Patients who have received an autologous PSC graf (as the duration of neutropenia is in most cases less than 10 days). Patients whose neutropenia, retrospectively assessed, lasted less than 10 days.</criteria>
