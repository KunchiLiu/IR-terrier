	<brief_title>Endobronchial Valve in Patients With Heterogeneous Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, one-way crossover study is to assess and compare the efficacy of the Zephyr endobronchial valves vs. Standard of Care (SoC) in patients suffering from COPD with Heterogeneous Emphysema. Patients will be followed up for 6 months after randomization. Patients in the SoC arm will crossover to the EBV treatment arm after the 6-month visit and will be followed up for 6 additional months.The primary objective is the variation of FEV1 between baseline and 3-month follow-up visit. The secondary objectives will evaluate quality of life, exercise capacity, dyspnea (including BODE index) changes, target lobe volume reduction, as well as safety outcomes.</detailed_description>
