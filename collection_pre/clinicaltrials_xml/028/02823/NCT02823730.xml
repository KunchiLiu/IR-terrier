	<brief_title>Registry Experience at the Washington Hospital Center With Drug Eluting Stents - Synergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this observational, real-world single-center registry is to compare the incidence of major adverse cardiac events among a series of patients receiving the Synergy drug-eluting stent with bioabsorbable polymer to historical controls who have received the Promus Premier drug-eluting stent with durable polymer. The investigators hypothesize that the long-term incidence (each year following implantation, up to 4 years) of major adverse cardiovascular events, after propensity matching for stent type, will be similar between Synergy and Xience V.</detailed_description>
