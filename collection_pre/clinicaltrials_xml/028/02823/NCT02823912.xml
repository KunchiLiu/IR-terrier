	<brief_summary>The increased mortality from cardiovascular disease has a significant impact on the population, and the prevalence of these diseases it become one of the major problems, since it is the leading cause of mortality and 1 in 3 Mexicans suffer from cardiovascular disease according ENSANUT; the above is attributed to the increase of diseases associated with an inflammatory process accelerated as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension (SAH) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The cholesterol is a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, and in turn increases the chances of death; however, the treatment of choice is based on changes in lifestyle, which for most people are difficult to maintain long-term. As for the drug therapy treated with drugs many people do not achieve their therapeutic goals, and therefore the inflammatory condition that underlies this disease remains. Recent studies have focused on the possible role of capsaicin in the inflammatory state through the agonistic effect it has on TRPV1. It has demonstrated the antiinflammatory activity of capsaicin to enhance inflammation by free fatty acids (FFA) and reducing the expression of certain genes involved in this process induced. Capsaicin is a natural choice and well tolerated with few side effects limited to the gastrointestinal tract such as dyspepsia and intestinal irregularity, for the above is of interest to evaluate the effect of capsaicin on the profile of inflammatory cytokines in individuals with dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It will conduct a clinicala trial, double - blind, randomized and placebo control group. Female and male patients, with dyslipidemia. Two groups will be formed with 17 patients each (capsaicin 150 mg per day or Magnesia calcinada). At the beginning and end of the intervention clinical and laboratory determination. The data obteined were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 22. It was considered statistically significant at p &lt;0.05</detailed_description>
