	<brief_summary>The overarching objective of this proposal is to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the Individual Well-Being Navigator (Iwin) mobile application, a substance abuse prevention and well-being enhancement program designed specifically for military personnel. Iwin provides an innovative, tailored mobile application using best practices in behavior change science and innovative technology to assist military personnel in preventing substance abuse and enhancing well-being by providing them with the most appropriate intervention content at the right time. It integrates Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change based tailoring, in app messaging, stage of change matched activities, and engaging game-like features in a cutting edge multiple behavior change program. The efficacy of the Iwin program will be determined by tests of statistical significance indicating that participants in the Treatment condition had lower scores on an index of substance use and other behavioral risks. The overall design is a 2 group (treatment and control group) by 3 Occasions with repeated measures across occasions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarching objective of this project is to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the Individual Well-Being Navigator (Iwin) mobile application, a substance abuse prevention and well-being enhancement program designed specifically for military personnel. Military personnel recruited will be asked to complete a series of screening questions on their personal mobile devices. An estimated 1624 Personnel will need to be screened to arrive at an eligible sample of 812. Randomization of the eligible sample will occur within the online baseline assessment at the individual level as soon as a participant completes the Informed Consent form. Those randomized to the Control Group (n=406) will complete assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months. Those randomized to the Intervention Group (n=406) will complete the same schedule of assessments as the control group and in addition will have access to the Iwin application (app) in between the baseline and 6 month assessments. The assessments include a variety of questions on health, wellness, substance use and well-being. Personnel randomized into the treatment group will be able to download the Iwin app for free onto their personal device. The Pro‐Change Iwin application has been built using the IMS Health AppNucleus™ Platform. AppNucleus is a patented, federally certified (FIPS 140‐2, DIACAP MAC II Sensitive), secure application platform that enables Pro‐Change to rapidly deploy secure mHealth solutions to users via web portal and commercial mobile technologies (such as iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry). The application provides an innovative, tailored program using best practices in behavior change science and innovative technology to assist military personnel in preventing substance abuse and enhancing well‐being by providing them with the most appropriate intervention content at the right time for their individual needs. It delivers assessments and tailored feedback immediately on eleven different risk behaviors as well as mobile interactive staged matched activities, engaging game‐like features and in‐app notifications on each behavior they are at risk for over the course of 6 months. The app will provide reminders for users to return to the program as set time points. Both treatment and control participants will receive e-mail reminders to complete follow-up assessments at 6 and 9 months.</detailed_description>
