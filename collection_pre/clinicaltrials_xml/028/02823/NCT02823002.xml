	<brief_summary>This study will collect data from multiple academic institutions. The primary objective for part A of this study is to determine the impact of anesthetic injection rate and temperature on pain perception during dermatologic procedures, and the objective for the part B of this study is to determine if buffering of the anesthetic solution alters pain perception. This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.</brief_summary>
