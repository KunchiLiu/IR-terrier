	<brief_summary>This is a Pilot, One-arm, Open-label, Prospective Study to evaluate Safety of Lanreotide 120 mg ATG in combination with Metformin in patients with advanced progressive GI or lung carcinoids. The patient population will include patients with a histologically documented diagnosis of Well differentiated NET, G1-G2 according to the last WHO Classification criteria for GI and lung NET carcinoids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The MetNET-2 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is strategically positioned in the medical treatment safety and efficacy context, that is Lanreotide can be safely and effectively used in combination with other agents, like Metformin. Aim of this study is to verify the safety of a concomitant administration of Lanreotide 120 mg ATG with Metformin in advanced, progressing gastro-intestinal or lung carcinoids patients, by accurately monitor patients from a tolerability point of view during all study long.</detailed_description>
