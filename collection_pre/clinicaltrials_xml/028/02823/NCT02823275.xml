	<brief_summary>Rationale: Ankle fractures are common traumatic lesions. In order to restore the anatomical situation of the ankle joint to prevent posttraumatic arthritis, these fractures often need surgical treatment. Both cast immobilisation and functional treatment have proved to be reliable postoperative treatment regimes. Insight into the quality of life and the level of pain is necessary to determine if these treatments can be related to higher patient satisfaction and earlier resumption of daily activities and work. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine two postoperative treatments for surgically corrected ankle fractures. Postoperative, direct functional mobilisation is compared to short term plaster cast fixation. The focus of this study is on quality of life, pain and the use of pain medication, and resumption of work and daily activities. Main study parameters/endpoints: Quality of life, Function, pain, swelling, daily activities and work, disabilities (pain disability index), complications</brief_summary>
