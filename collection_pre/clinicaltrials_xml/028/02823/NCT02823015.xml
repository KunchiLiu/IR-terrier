	<brief_summary>Persistent pain after breast cancer surgery (PPBCS) is a significant clinical problem, affecting between 25 and 50% of patients. Several factors are associated with the development of PPBCS, including acute postoperative pain. The analysis of pain trajectories through mixed model modeling is an alternative to static pain measures, improving precision and providing information on the time course of pain resolution. Our aim was to investigate if the characteristics of pain trajectories during the first postoperative week are correlated with the persistence of pain 3 months after breast cancer surgery.</brief_summary>
