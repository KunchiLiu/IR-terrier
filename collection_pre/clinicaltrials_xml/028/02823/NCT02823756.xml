	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to examine the impact that physical therapy (PT) interventions, including manipulations, have on physical activity levels outside of the clinical environment in persons with low back pain (LBP) as measured both objectively with an accelerometer and subjectively with questionnaires. The secondary purpose is to determine if a relationship exists between objective physical activity, self-perceived disability pain catastrophizing thoughts, BMI, age, six-minute walk distance, lower extremity muscle endurance. The tertiary purpose is to assess the predictive value that a standing manual lumbar unloading technique has for relief of pain following manipulation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At session 1: Participants are screened for eligibility. Baseline outcome measures are conducted (self-report questionnaires and physical performance tests). Accelerometer which is an instrument to measure physical activity is issued. At session 2 (To occur at least one-week later): Accelerometer data is retrieved and downloaded to a computer. Participant numerically rates low back pain level at rest and in most painful position. Participant receives a manual distraction procedure. Participant rates pain level again. Participant starts the physical therapy intervention (manipulation of the spine, muscular strengthening and cardiovascular exercise, education). Accelerometer is reissued again. At session 3 (At least one-week later): Accelerometer is collected and data is retrieved. Participant continues with the intervention (manipulation, exercise, education).</detailed_description>
