In maternity wards of the hospital Saint Joseph Paris and Cochin-Port Royal group, patients with a diagnosis of severe perineal tear was made are taken following load with common rules, both for the immediate repair for the remote monitoring. Patients of both sites are indeed encouraged to consult in proctology consultation in Saint Joseph 4-6 months of birth. The same support on both sites allows to consider the creation of a relatively homogeneous cohort in terms of support and consider an important recruitment.
