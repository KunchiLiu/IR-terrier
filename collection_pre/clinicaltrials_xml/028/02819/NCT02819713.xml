	<detailed_description>Urologist within Rijnstate use both Instillagel and ultrasound gel during prostate biopsy. According to the protocol, the ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy must be performed using ultrasound gel. Some urologists departed from the protocols because they think that Instillagel will give a pain reduction.

Immediately after the prostate biopsy. And five to thirty minutes after the prostate biopsy, when the patient is dressed and before the patient goes home. Primary endpoint Pain measured by the Numeric Rating Scale Secondary endpoints - Age of patient - Previous prostate biopsy - The number of biopsies taken - Presence of prostate cancer - Other complications as after prostate biopsy The prostate biopsy will be performed by a urologist working at the outpatient clinic of Rijnstate. The ultrasound equipment that will be used during prostate biopsy is Aloka ProSound SSD-3500 or Aloka ProSound SSD or SV-3500 SX.</detailed_description>
