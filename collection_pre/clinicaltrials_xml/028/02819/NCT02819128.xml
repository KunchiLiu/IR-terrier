	<detailed_description>In Marseilles, the population of homeless is estimated at 1500 individuals, including 800 usually sleeping in the street, 600 in foster homes and a hundred in the structures of care. The precarious living conditions of homeless persons promote the emergence or re-emergence of many communicable infectious diseases homeless people whose symptoms are often overlooked by the subject and rarely established etiologic diagnosis. Among these diseases, frequently described in the literature are infestation by lice and infectious diseases that they transmit (Bartonella quintana), skin infections, hepatitis E and C and finally the infection with Tropheryma Whipplei. In this study we propose to systematically in homeless subject an etiological diagnosis of pathogens at the origin of these diseases (i) to improve knowledge (ii) to improve their management, (iii) to limit the contagion.</detailed_description>
