	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Contraceptive Counseling Intervention in Deprived Neighborhoods: SIRIAN Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effects of a community-based counseling intervention to improve contraception among residents in deprived neighborhoods a randomized controlled trial is performed. Women aged 14-49 years and men aged 14-39 years from two low income neighborhoods in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) who had not undergone an irreversible contraceptive method and aren't planning a pregnancy have been recruited in 2011-13. The intervention consists of a culturally developed and theoretically-based brief counseling in community settings. The primary outcome is the consistent use of very effective contraceptive methods (optimal use). Secondary outcomes analyzed are the incorrect use of very effective contraceptive methods and use of less effective methods stratified by sex and migrant status. Differences within subgroups from baseline to 3 months - follow up are analyzed and intervention effects are assessed with adjusted robust Poisson regressions.</detailed_description>
