	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether Texting for Relapse Prevention (T4RP), a text messaging-based early warming for relapse prevention in people who have schizophrenia/SAD, is associated with fewer relapse symptoms compared to a treatment-as-usual control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Texting for Relapse Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is among the 20 most debilitating illnesses worldwide, responsible for 1% of the global burden of disease. Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) affects an additional 0.2% to 1.1% of adults. As many as four out of five people who have schizophrenia or SAD relapse within 5 years of recovery from their initial episode. Interventions aimed at early intervention to prevent relapse would impact public health. The Texting for Relapse Prevention (T4RP) is an innovative service delivery program delivered via text messaging designed for people who have schizophrenia/SAD. The intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial against a treatment-as-usual control group which, for most, involved meeting with their therapist every 2 to 4 weeks and meeting with their psychiatrist at least once every 90 days or more frequently as clinically indicated. A total of 40 people with schizophrenia and 5-15 provider participants (depending on the patient distribution across the providers) in the pilot RTC. The study is being conducted by researchers at the Center for Innovative Public Health Research and Johns Hopkins Community Psychiatry Program (JHCPP). The investigators posit that T4RP will reduce psychiatric morbidity and institutionalization rates and promote recovery by facilitating improved patient-provider communication, promoting medication adherence, helping people self-monitor their early warning signs, and promoting self-management of symptoms. If T4RP is effective, this cost-effective and easily scalable intervention will make a significant public health impact and reduction in relapse-related costs for people with schizophrenia/SAD.</detailed_description>
