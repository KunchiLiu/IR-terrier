	<brief_summary>Obesity and its adverse cardiometabolic consequences are major public health problems. Several features of obesity contribute to the associated cardiovascular risk and are potential targets for intervention. These include insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction, reduced metabolic rate, and impaired aerobic capacity.The purpose of this study is to examine if the phosphodiesterase type 5A inhibitor tadalafil improves cardiometabolic health in individuals who are obese and insulin resistant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PDE5 Inhibition for Obesity-Related Cardiometabolic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is a risk factor for nearly all cardiovascular (CV) disease including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Increased CV risk in obese individuals appears to depend largely on the degree of metabolic dysregulation and metabolic risk factors (glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, etc.). Notably, interventions that improve insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness can reduce CV risk in obese individuals, even in the absence of weight loss. The cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway (cGMP) is involved in energy homeostasis and systemic metabolism. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that increasing cGMP activity is beneficial from a metabolic standpoint. Tadalafil is a clinically-available drug that inhibits the enzyme that breaks down cGMP. The study investigators hypothesize that chronic PDE5 inhibition in obese, insulin-resistant adults will improve cardiometabolic health. Aim 1: To examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on energy expenditure. Aim 2: To examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on insulin sensitivity and secretion. Aim 3: To examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP tone and circulating mediators of cardiometabolic risk.</detailed_description>
