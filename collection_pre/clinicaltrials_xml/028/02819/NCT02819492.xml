	<brief_summary>Adenoma detection in the main goal of screening colonoscopy. In order to detect adenomas it is mandatory to spend a long enough time investigating the colonic mucosa. A minimum observation time of 6 minutes has been proposed as a quality criterion for screening colonoscopy. However, different locations of the colon (proximal, distal) may require specific observation time periods. The colon can be divided into a proximal (right) and distal (left) part. Until now, it is unclear whether observation time has a significant impact on adenoma detection in both parts of the colon. The aim of this study therefore is to conduct a trial in which side-specific observation times and adenoma detection rates are measured in order to investigate this correlation in particular for the right colon.</brief_summary>
