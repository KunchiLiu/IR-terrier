	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years with histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed, extensivestage, chemotherapynaïve SCLC DLL3expressing SCLC based on central immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment. Positive is defined as staining in ≥50% of tumor cells. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Minimum life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Recovery to Grade 1 of any clinically significant toxicity (excluding alopecia) prior to initiation of study drug. Satisfactory laboratory parameters within defined parameters (ANC, platelet count, Hb, total bilirubin, ALT, AST and GFR) Subjects with a history of CNS metastases must have completed definitive treatment prior to first dose of study treatment, off or on a stable dose of corticosteroids Use of effective contraception method during and for 1 year following study drug dosing if female of childbearing potential or sexually active male Prior systemic chemotherapy, small molecule inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, other monoclonal antibodies, antibodydrug conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates, Tcell or other cellbased or biologic therapies, or any other anticancer therapy for the treatment of (limited or extensive) SCLC. Any significant medical condition, that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, may place the subject at undue risk from the study. Documented history of a cerebral vascular, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIIV within 6 months prior to their first dose of study drug. Recent or ongoing serious infection. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. History of another invasive malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3 years. Exceptions: nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer, and cervical cancer in situ on biopsy or squamous intraepithelial lesion on PAP smear. Prior exposure to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)based drug, or known hypersensitivity to rovalpituzumab tesirine or excipient contained in the drug formulation</criteria>
