	<brief_summary>Purpose: Central serous retinopathy (CSCR) is characterized by macular detachment due to thickened choroid mostly affecting young men under perceived stress. While most previous studies in CSCR have been retrospective and have focused on a single facet of the patient's personality, the investigators conducted a prospective intercontinental controlled study to analyze the multifaceted personality profile in CSCR. Design: Prospective interview. Participants and Controls: Subjects with CSCR consented to participate in a questionnaire. Controls not having retinal disease were recruited from the same clinic. Main Outcome Measures: The main parameters registered were presence of stress, daily number of cups caffeine intake, personality traits (Type A; obsessive-compulsive; aggressive). Methods: The interview consisted of a 60-item questionnaire. Recruitment of participants was from January 2015 to February 2016. Controls were matched for age, gender and race. Statistical analyses were done using univariate and multivariate analysis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) characterized by serous macular detachment is the fourth most common retinal disease after age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. In a population-based retrospective cohort and case control study in Olmsted county, Minnesota, USA, Kitzmann et al4 reported a mean age-adjusted incidence of 9.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.4-12.4) per 100, 000 in men, and 1.7 (95% CI 0.7-2.7) in women. The mean age of onset of CSCR appears between 41 and 45 years5. The disease affects various racial groups5-8 and occasionally can be familial9. The pathogenesis remains poorly understood and currently the exudation is thought to result from hyper-permeable choroid secondary to venous stasis, ischemia, or inflammation2. Because of lack of proper animal models and lack of definite cure, clinical research has focused on risk factors such as stress, corticosteroid intake, and type A personality. Different hospital-based studies yielded different risk factors. Epidemiologic studies failed to ascertain many of these risk factors. Due to different methodology (retrospective vs. prospective case-control studies; selection of controls; questionnaire vs. interview by physician assistant vs. interview by physician) and focus on single risk factors in the literature, the investigators designed a study that targets a vast number of known or potential risk factors in various collaborative centers and compare it to results reported in the literature.</detailed_description>
