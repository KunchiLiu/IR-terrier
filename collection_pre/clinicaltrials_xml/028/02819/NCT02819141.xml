	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for the self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) in a sample of critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilator support. The investigators hypothesis is that self-management of sedative therapy by mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), tailored to their individual needs will be more efficacious than nurse-administered sedative therapy in reducing anxiety, which may reduce duration of mechanical ventilator support and occurrence of delirium.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy for conducting a future, pragmatic effectiveness trial to test whether self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) is superior to nurse-administered sedative therapy in day-to-day intensive care unit (ICU) practice. This efficacy trial is powered for the investigators primary, clinically relevant endpoints (anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and delirium presence), and examines patient outcomes adversely affected by sedative administration practices, such as prolonged ICU stays, altered mental status, and diminished post-ICU quality of life. This randomized clinical trial with a total of 190 mechanically ventilated patients enrolled and maintained on protocol will address the following Specific Aims. The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of SMST compared to nurse-administered sedative therapy on anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and presence of delirium in mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs). The secondary aim is to compare level of arousal and sedative exposure in mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs) randomized to SMST to those MVPs receiving nurse-administered sedative therapy. The investigators hypothesize that SMST patients will be easily arousable, more alert, and exposed to less sedation than those who receive nurse-administered sedative therapy. An exploratory aim is to compare post-ICU outcomes (physical/functional status, psychological well-being, and health-related quality of life) between MVPs randomized to SMST and those receiving nurse-administered sedative therapy.</detailed_description>
