	<criteria>Man or woman ≥ 18 years old Life expectancy &gt; 4 months Histopathologically confirmed melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma or other solid tumor malignancy Cutaneous subcutaneous soft tissue, or superficial lymphatic metastasis not suitable for surgical resection Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2 Cutaneous subcutaneous soft tissue, or superficial lymphatic metastasis that is amenable to injection and irradiation and &gt; 10 mm in longest dimension ° Cutaneous metastasis in a region of previous radiation therapy is amenable to radiation therapy as part of this protocol if at least 6 months has elapsed since prior radiotherapy and the dose of radiotherapy previously administered did not exceed an equivalent dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy equivalent fractions at the skin surface (using linearquadratic modeling with alpha/beta=11.5) Metastasis that is &gt; 10 mm in longest dimensionor exhibits radiotracer uptake consistent with metastasis on PET/CT Adequate coagulation function (platelet count &gt;50 k/mcL, international normalized ratio of &lt; 1.5) Completion of other cancer therapy (targeted therapy, chemotherapy, investigational therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) 14 days prior to first dose of protocol therapy For patients with breast cancer only: May continue ongoing antiestrogen therapy (for example, aromatase inhibitor) May continue ongoing Her2 directed therapy (for example, trastuzumab) Resolution or stabilization of clinically significant adverse events from prior therapy (completed at least 14 days prior to first dose of TVEC) Able to provide valid written informed consent Active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of HSV1 infection (such as herpetic keratitis, herpetic encephalitis) Receipt of a therapeutic anticoagulant Receipt of live vaccine within 28 days of planned first dose of TVEC History of symptomatic autoimmune disease (such as lupus, scleroderma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) requiring systemic treatment (for example corticosteroids or immunosuppressants); replacement therapy (for example, thyroxine, insulin) is not considered a systemic treatment History of high grade (CTCAE ≥ Grade 3) immune mediated adverse event from prior cancer immunotherapy History of CTCAE ≥ Grade 2 immune mediated endocrinopathy from prior cancer immunotherapy Intermittent or chronic use of oral or intravenous antiherpetic drug (such as acyclovir) Serologic evidence of prior hepatitis B or C infection Previously infected, but immune (HBsAg negative/antiHBc positive/antiHBs positive) Acutely infected (HBsAg positive/antiHBc positive/antiHBc IgM positive/antiHBs negative) Chronically infected (HBsAg positive/antiHBc positive/antiHBc IgM negative/antiHBs negative) Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Known leukemia or lymphoma Common variable immunodeficiency Patients requiring chronic high dose immunosuppressants including steroids (prednisone daily equivalent of ≥ 10 mg) Known severe congenital or acquired cellular or humoral immunodeficient or immunocompromised patients High likelihood of protocol noncompliance (in opinion of investigator) Woman of childbearing potential unwilling to use effective contraception during protocol treatment and for 3 months after last dose of Talimogene Laherparepvec Woman of childbearing potential that is pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during protocol treatment and for 3 months after last dose of Talimogene Laherparepvec</criteria>
