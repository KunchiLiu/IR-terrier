	<brief_title>Effects of ElevATP on Body Composition and Athletic Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a double-blind, placebo, diet, and training controlled design, 57 subjects will participate in an eight week, resistance and high intensity interval training study to assess the ergogenic potential of elevATP with and without caffeine plus vitamins in comparison to a visually identical, equal volume placebo within a periodized training program (described below). Prior to testing or training, subjects will report to the laboratory for screening and familiarization with testing protocols. The following week, subjects will complete baseline testing for all measurements including a 3 day food log. During the next eight weeks, subjects will participate in a periodized resistance training program which alters the repetition and loading schemes daily and weekly. During the entirety of the training protocol, subjects will supplement daily with either 1 serving of elevATP, 1 serving of Dropz (elevATP + caffeine), or 1 serving of an equal volume, visually identical placebo. Measurements will be repeated at the end of weeks 4 and 8, 10, and 12. Variables collected: - Dual Emissions X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) determined (weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, 12): - Body fat - Lean body mass - Body fat percentage - Bioelectric Impedance Analysis and Spectroscopy (BIA/BIS) determined (weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, 12): - Body fat - Lean body mass - Body fat percentage - Ultrasonography determined cross-sectional area (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - 1-repetition maximum (1RM) strength of the squat (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - 1RM strength of the bench press (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - 1RM strength of the deadlift (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - Vertical jump height and power (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - Bench press power (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - Anaerobic peak and average power output (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - Blood count, metabolic, and lipid safety panels (weeks 0, 8, and 12) - Anthropometrics (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - Vital Signs (weeks 0, 4, 8 , 10, 12) - Myokines and biomarkers of regeneration panels (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12): Analysis to be performed by VDF FutureCeuticals, Inc. MusclePharm to ship frozen serum samples (1-2ml) from all subjects to VDF FutureCeuticals, care of Zbigniew Pietrzkowski, 16259 Laguna Canyon Rd, Irvine, CA 92618 Resistance training protocol Will consist of a daily undulating periodization design with high volume, high velocity, and high intensity workouts. Exercises performed will be the back squat, bench press, deadlift, leg press, bent row, shoulder press, pulldown, dips, bicep curl, tricep extension, single-arm row, hammer strength chest press, lateral raise, incline bench press, power squat, leg extension, and leg curl. Exercises will be performed for 1-15 repetitions, 3-5 sets, and with 0.5-5 minutes rest between sets. Diet Each subject will receive a personalized diet to suit their individual needs. Total calories will be calculated based on the Mifflin St. Jeor equation. One half of total calories will be derived from carbohydrates, while fats and proteins will equally compose the remaining one half of total calories.</detailed_description>
