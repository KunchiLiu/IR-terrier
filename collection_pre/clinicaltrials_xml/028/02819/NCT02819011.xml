	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a randomized control trial to evaluate long term effects and effectiveness of Ankle foot orthoses (AFO) in reducing risk of falling in older adults. Primary Endpoints • Characterize the impact of AFO on balance, gait, risk of falling, frailty status, and adverse events Secondary Endpoints • Characterize the Impact of AFO on spontaneous daily physical activities • Characterize the feasibility of the AFO device on patient adherence, acceptability, user-friendliness, and perception of benefit for daily usage</brief_summary>
