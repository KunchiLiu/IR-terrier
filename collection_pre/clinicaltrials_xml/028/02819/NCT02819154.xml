	<brief_summary>Patients are admitted to intensive care for serious diseases (sepsis, ARDS ...) burdened with a high mortality rate. Invasive methods of resuscitation and the diseases treated can lead to serious sequelae. Follow-up studies of patients at hospital discharge report most often the quality of life using validated quantitative scales. A recent consensus of the American Society of resuscitation an update on the physical, cognitive and psychological sequelae of ICU hospitalization for the family and the patient, grouped under the term "post-intensive care syndrome." Social changes, emotional and professional are little studied and are not part of the information provided by the quality of life questionnaires. The investigators hypothesize that intensive care stay entails a profound effect on the lives of patients. This study will add additional data on a little known aspect of post resuscitation.</brief_summary>
