	<brief_title>The Combination Effect of Statin Plus Metformin on Relapse-free</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study revealed the population-based cohort study investigated the protective effect of statin and metformin against cancer events in patients with HBV infection. The study demonstrated that either statin or metformin served as independent chemopreventive agents with a dose-response effect in reducing the incidence of cancer with a dose-response effect of the agents and an additive or synergistic effect of combining statin and metformin use in reducing the incidence of many cancers.1 And based on our data in animal models, administration of metformin and statin might enhance the therapeutic effect of local tumor through apoptotic and antiangiogenesis pathways. These results also seemed as the synergistic effect of statin and metformin combined use in tumor control.2 The aim of this study is to clarify the potential protective benefit of these drugs on the combination effect of Statin plus Metformin on relapse-free survival of HCC patients after local treatments in patients with HBV.</detailed_description>
