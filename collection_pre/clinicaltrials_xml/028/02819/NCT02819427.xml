	<brief_summary>This study, conducted in children with typical or atypical "absence" epilepsy, will consist of noninvasive recording of the metabolic activity of the brain concomitantly with electroencephalographic recording during seizures without the need for any additional examination. This examination will be performed by combining near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) optical imaging and Electroencephalography (EEG) in a simultaneous High-Resolution (HR) recording. Surface electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable tool to assess neuronal dysfunction from a functional point of view and is used in the routine follow-up of epileptic children. Optical imaging is a recent and promising medical imaging technique, which uses near-infrared light. This rapid, noninvasive and harmless quantitative technique can be easily used at the child's bedside or in the ward and provides metabolic information on brain functioning.</brief_summary>
