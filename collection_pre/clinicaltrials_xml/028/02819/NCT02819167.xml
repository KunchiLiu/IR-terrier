	<brief_summary>Ischemic strokes are one of the leading causes of handicap and death in elderly people in France. Cognitive reserve (CR) is an active model, defined as a function of lifetime intellectual activities and other environmental factors that explain differential susceptibility to functional impairment in the presence of pathology or other neurological insult. CR is estimated using variables for cognitive activity: years of education, professional status, socioeconomic status… Furthermore, brain reverse (BR) is a passive and quantitative model that depend on brain size and other quantitative aspects of the brain that explain differential susceptibility to functional impairment in the presence of pathology. Firstly, volume and localization of ischemic strokes have a great impact on CR and BR due to brain injury. On the other hand, CR influences the severity and the expression of cognitive diseases. The investigators realize a prospective study in order to assess the impact of CR and BR on cognitive prognosis after a right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke in elderly patients.</brief_summary>
