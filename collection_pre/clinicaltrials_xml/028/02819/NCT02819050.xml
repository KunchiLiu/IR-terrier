	<brief_summary>Though Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) is a commonly used form of non-invasive neonatal respiratory support, the optimal method of weaning off NCPAP is not well established. In this prospective, two-center randomized control trial we hypothesize that gradually increasing time off NCPAP (sprinting) increases the success of weaning NCPAP off in infants born between 23 0/7-30 6/7 weeks of gestational age.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible infants admitted to two Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) were randomized to a sprinting (SP) vs. a non-sprinting (NSP) protocol, both over 4 days. Infants assigned to the SP group sprinted twice daily for 3h (day 1), 6h (day 2), 9h (day 3) &amp; then 24h back on NCPAP (day 4) before switching to nasal cannula (NC) on day 5. Infants in the NSP group were maintained on NCPAP of 5 cm of water for the first 4 days before switching to NC on day 5, similar to the SP group. Infants in both groups were observed for the next 3 days (day 5-7) to ensure stability off CPAP</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Born between 23 0/7 30 6/7 weeks GA At least 26 0/7 weeks corrected GA. On NCPAP for at least 24 hours Stable on ≤0.3 FiO2 for at least 24 hours Initiation of study protocol, i.e., weaning from NCPAP, was started when infant met all of the following criteria for at least 24 hours: Requiring NCPAP of 46 cm of H2O and FiO2 ≤0.3. All babies &lt; 32 weeks corrected GA should have been loaded or already on maintenance caffeine (caffeine citrate 20 mg/kg as the loading and 510 mg/kg as the maintenance dose). Stable respiratory system assessment (respiratory rate of &lt; 70/min, no significant chest retractions (sternal/ diaphragmatic), and baseline oxygen saturation &gt; 86%) and otherwise deemed clinically stable for weaning off noninvasive ventilation by medical team If postsurgery, infant must be at least 2 weeks postoperative and off antibiotics with no concern or need for repeat surgery. A documented hemoglobin of more than 8 g/dl within 7 days of initiation of the study. Meeting "stability criteria" defined below: The infant had to be tolerating a flow of no more than 2 liters NC on a FiO2 of 0.30 or less to keep oxygen saturations above 85% (should match what you wrote below in failure criteria)%. Have a respiratory rate of less than 70 on average over 24 hours for more than 24 hours The infant could have no significant chest recession (sternal/diaphragmatic) Evidence of a hemodynamically or clinically significant (worsening respiratory status or pulmonary edema on chest xray) Patent ductus arteriosus, diagnosed either clinically or echocardiographically. Any significant congenital abnormality (abnormalities affecting a major organ system, airway, or musculoskeletal system). Hemodynamic/respiratory instability or currently being treated for suspected or proven sepsis (positive blood culture) Grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage Inability to obtain informed parental consent</criteria>
