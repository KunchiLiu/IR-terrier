	<brief_summary>This study comprises three sub-studies. The objective of sub-study 1 is to characterize the dose-response, efficacy, and safety of ABT-494 compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission in order to identify the induction dose of ABT-494 for further evaluation in sub-study 2. The objective of sub-study 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-494 compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission in participants. The objective of sub-study 3 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-494 compared to placebo in achieving clinical remission in participants who had a response following induction with ABT-494.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for 90 days or greater prior to Baseline, confirmed by colonoscopy during the Screening Period, with exclusion of current infection, colonic dysplasia and/or malignancy. Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the Investigator, must be available. Active ulcerative colitis with an Adapted Mayo score of 5 to 9 points and endoscopic sub score of 2 to 3 (confirmed by central reader). Demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or biologic therapies. If female, participant must meet the criteria for Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at the Baseline Visit. Male participants must agree to follow protocolspecified pregnancy avoidance measures, including refraining from donating sperm, for up to 90 days post last dose of study drug. Participant with current diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or diagnosis of indeterminate colitis (IC). Current diagnosis of fulminant colitis and/or toxic megacolon. Participant with disease limited to the rectum (ulcerative proctitis) during the Screening endoscopy. Received cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil within 30 days prior to Baseline. Participant on azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine within 10 days of baseline. Received intravenous corticosteroids within 14 days prior to Screening or during the Screening Period. Participant with previous exposure to JAK inhibitor (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib). Screening laboratory and other analyses show any abnormal results.</criteria>
