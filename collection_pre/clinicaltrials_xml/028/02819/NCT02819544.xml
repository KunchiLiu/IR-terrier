	<brief_summary>Known to reduce analgesics and length of hospitalization in conventional surgery, laparoscopy is characterized by frequent post-operative pain and can decrease the patient's quality of immediate postoperative life and sometimes the results of decision ambulatory care. In order to reduce these postoperative pain, various methods have been evaluated in numerous studies to determine their analgesic role. As part of abdominal surgery, local anesthetics (Naropin (Ropivacaine)) are generally administered in the end of surgery to reduce postoperative pain and promote recovery of the patient. In addition, it is also possible to instill the anesthetic directly into the abdominal cavity reducing pain transmitted by nociceptor viscera. In recent years, new methods have been proposed such as lung recruitment maneuvers and the instillation of saline solution to reduce postoperative pain. However, no recommendation is on the use of intraperitoneal saline under the management of postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in ambulatory care.</brief_summary>
