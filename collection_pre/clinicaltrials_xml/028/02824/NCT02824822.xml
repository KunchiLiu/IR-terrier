	<brief_summary>Epilepsy is a common condition which affects over 3 million people in the US. Patients with uncontrolled epilepsy have a lifetime risk of sudden unexpected death (SUDEP) of 35%, which is greatest in those under 40 years of age. The exact mechanisms and causes are not understood but can be due to underlying conditions which affect the heart and brain, which may lead to dangerous heart rhythms and death. Some of these conditions which affect heart and brain have an identifiable genetic cause. This study aims to identify known genetic causes of heart rhythm and sudden death related disorders in patients with epilepsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Markers of Cardiovascular Disease in Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goals are to determine whether patients with epilepsy who have the highest risk of SUDEP have an underlying genetic cardiovascular disorder. The investigators are seeking patients with epilepsy who have a high risk of SUDEP identified by using a risk scoring tool called SUDEP-7 or have blood-relatives with a history of epilepsy, seizure, cardiac arrest, sudden deth, drowning, syncope or heart rhythm disorder. The investigators may also include blood-relatives of patients with epilepsy and invite them to participate by providing a blood sample for genetic testing.</detailed_description>
