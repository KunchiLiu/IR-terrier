	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of simeprevir (SMV), odalasvir (ODV) and AL-335 (and its metabolites ALS-022399 and ALS 022227), when these drugs are co-administered in healthy Japanese participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant must be a Japanese participant who has resided outside Japan for no more than 5 years and whose parents and grandparents are Japanese as determined by participant's verbal report Participant must have a body mass index (BMI: weight in kilogram (kg) divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the Investigator Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 milligram of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted Female participant must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of assisted reproduction during the study and for a period of 60 days after last study drug administration or until the last followup visit, whichever occurs later Participant has a history of liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 80 milliliters per minute [mL/min]); significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances Participant with a past history of heart arrhythmias (example extra systolic beats or tachycardia at rest); risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as hypokalemia or family history of short/long QT syndrome or sudden unexplained death (including sudden infant death syndrome) in a first degree relative [example sibling, offspring, or biological parent]) Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to simeprevir (SMV), odalasvir (ODV), AL335 or their excipients Participant is a woman who is pregnant, or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant from signing of Informed Consent Form (ICF) until 60 days after last study drug administration or until the last followup visit, whichever occurs later</criteria>
