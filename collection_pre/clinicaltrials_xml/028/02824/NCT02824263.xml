	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by unknown mechanisms. The investigators hypothesize that sleep apnea changes glucose and lipid metabolism during sleep, which over time could lead to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study examines metabolic changes during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Patients accustomed to CPAP therapy are enrolled to undergo sleep studies, either on CPAP therapy or after withdrawing from CPAP for 3 nights. During sleep, blood samples are obtained so that metabolic function can be compared between sleep apnea and CPAP nights.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants with a history of moderate severe sleep apnea (AHI&gt;20) will be enrolled if they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. They will report to the sleep laboratory on two nights, (1) after continuing their CPAP or (2) after discontinuing CPAP for 3 nights. The order of observation will be randomized. A standard research dinner is provided before each study. IV's are placed so that blood can be sampled at frequent (20 min) intervals throughout the night. In the morning after each study, a glucose tolerance test and endothelial function study (endoPAT) are performed. Serum samples will be analyzed for glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, hormones, and other metabolic biomarkers.</detailed_description>
