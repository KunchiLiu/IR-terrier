	<brief_title>Exploratory Study of the Effect of Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters (TAK-085) on Vascular Endothelial Function in Patients With Hyperlipidemia by Flow Mediated Dilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, collaborative, randomized, open-label study designed to explore the effects of administration of omega-3-acid ethyl esters (TAK-085) [2 g (2 g PO QD) or 4 g (2 g PO BID) for 8 weeks] on vascular endothelial function, as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), in patients receiving a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor and have concurrent hypertriglyceridemia (hereinafter referred to as TG). Considering the potential bias by factors that affect FMD between treatment groups, stratified allocation will be performed with fasting TG level as a factor.</detailed_description>
