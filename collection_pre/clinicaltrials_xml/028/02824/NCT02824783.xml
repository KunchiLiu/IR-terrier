	<brief_title>Quality of Life After Enhanced Recovery Protocol for Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since October 1st 2015, our center has been labelled reference center for colorectal surgery using Enhanced Recovery Protocol (ERP) by GRACE (Groupe francophone de Rehabilitation après ChirurgiE; a francophone counterpart of ERAS® society). In case of ERP, the quality of life when the patient is at home is not well known. Some argue that patient might experience discomfort and lack of autonomy, particularly elderly patient if discharged home too quickly. In this study, the investigators will call our patients introduced in the database of GRACE to assess the quality of life and patient satisfaction concerning our ERP. Eight domains will be investigated: information, stress, feelings when discharged home, pain, fatigue, autonomy, feeding problems, and satisfaction. When analyzing the results the investigators will pay a particular attention to elderly patients (age &gt; 70 yo) to determine whether these experience more difficulties as compared to younger patients.</detailed_description>
