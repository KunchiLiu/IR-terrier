	<criteria>Subjects must have histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic solid cancers of the following histological types: 1. predominantly epithelial (≥50% tumor component) pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma 2. epithelial ovarian cancer (fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers are eligible) 3. adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 4. triplenegative adenocarcinoma of the breast 5. nonsmallcell adenocarcinoma of the lung 6. gastric cancer (including gastroesophageal junction) 7. colon cancer 8. cholangiocarcinoma 9. Thymic carcinoma Subjects must have no standard therapy available, or have actively refused standard therapy or, in the investigator's opinion, treatment in this study is clinically and ethically acceptable for the subject. Subjects must provide samples of archival tumor tissue collected and submitted anytime during the study Subjects must have positive mesothelin expression in the archival tumor tissue, defined as the membrane intensity score of 1+, 2+ or 3+ (on the 03 scale) expressed on the membrane of ≥5% of tumor cells combined Subjects must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Subjects must have ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0 or 1 Subjects must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function and coagulation Subjects must have normal or clinically insignificant ECG at screening Women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test obtained within 1 day before the start of anetumab ravtansine Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to consistently use adequate contraception / birth control between signing of the informed consent and 60 days after the last administration of the last study drug. Female partners of childbearing potential from male subjects have to use adequate contraception / birth control between signing of the informed consent and 60 days after the last administration of the last study drug if the male is not sterilized. Previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the cancer being evaluated in this study, except cervical carcinoma in situ, treated basal cell carcinoma, superficial noninvasive bladder tumors or any previous cancer curatively treated &lt;3 years before the start of anetumab ravtansine New or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases Corneal epitheliopathy or any eye disorder that may predispose the subjects to druginduced corneal epitheliopathy, or may interfere with diagnosis of treatmentemergent corneal epitheliopathy at the ophthalmologist's or the investigator's discretion History or current evidence of biliary cirrhosis malignant biliary obstruction unless the bile flow to the gastrointestinal tract is maintained by a fully operational biliary stent CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade ≥2 bleeding disorder within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension Long QT Syndrome HIV infection Hepatitis B or C infection Had a major surgery or significant trauma within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine Had solid organ or bone marrow transplantation Have LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) &lt;50% at screening Have QTc &gt;450 ms or heart rate ≥100 bpm or ≤45 bpm at screening Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers based on the screening test for genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 metabolizing capacity</criteria>
