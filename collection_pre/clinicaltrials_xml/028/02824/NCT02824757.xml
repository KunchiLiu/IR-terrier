	<brief_summary>This study is aimed at exploring the effects of glucocorticoids on glucose metabolism in patients with interstitial lung disease. Patients with interstitial lung disease who is on the medication of 15mg prednisolone and 7.5mg prednisolone conduct the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The data attained from the CGM are used to define the glycemic characteristics in patients using glucocorticoids and the difference of glucose features due to different doses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Glucocorticoids on Glucose Metabolism in Patients With Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed of interstitial lung disease and treating with glucocorticoids could be enrolled in this clinical trial. Those who is in an acute inflammatory phase and diagnosed with hemorrhagic disease should are excluded, so are those unwilling to carry the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device. When the dose of prednisolone is applied 15mg per day steadily and is going to be decreased, the CGM is conducted. At the same time, blood tests evaluating the glucose metabolism are measured, including HbA1c, GA, fasting insulin and fasting glucose. After taking 7.5mg prednisolone per day for 3 months, participants do the CGM and blood tests again to evaluate the glucose metabolism during this period. The CGM data could be used for the glucose evaluation, which can manifest the glucose characteristics in the circumstances of glucocorticoid use. By comparing the CGM data and the blood tests, the investigators hope to find the different features of the glucose metabolism due to different doses.</detailed_description>
