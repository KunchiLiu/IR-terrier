	<brief_summary>Laugh is more than visual and vocal behave, is always followed by a series of physiological changes, including contractions of musculoskeletal system, increase of cardiac frequency by catecholamine release and hyperventilation that promoves the increase of maximum breathing and oxygen saturation. Laugh therapy may be an alternative therapy, simple, and improve the quality of life of individuals can influence physiological and biochemical parameters of the human body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Laugh Therapy Associated to Cardiopulmonary Rehab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Randomized clinical trial with patients from outpatient ischemic heart disease of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre , patients of both sexes in all regular monitoring. All patients will perform 30 minutes of stretching before film sessions. The exercises will be mild to moderate (modified Borg scale between 3 and 6).</detailed_description>
