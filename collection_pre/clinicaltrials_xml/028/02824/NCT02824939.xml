	<brief_summary>This is a randomised controlled trial which will compare the Quadratus Lumborum (QL) Block with the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block in terms of analgesic efficacy, ease of performance and safety when administered postoperatively in patients who undergo laparoscopic nephrectomy. To fulfill this purpose, three groups of patients each with 32 patients, will be formed. Patients in the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) group and Quadratus Lumborum (QL) group will each receive the respective blocks with 0.4 ml/kg of 0.25% Bupivacaine, after completion of surgery. The third (Control group) will not receive any blocks. After shifting patients to recovery all three groups will be put into intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCA) Morphine as rescue analgesic regimen as per a set protocol. Morphine consumption over the first postoperative 24 hours, ease of performance of individual blocks and associated adverse events, adverse events associated with opioid use, patient recovery and satisfaction will be noted.</brief_summary>
