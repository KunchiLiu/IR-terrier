	<brief_summary>This phase II trial evaluates how effective 560 mg of ibrutinib taken by mouth daily is in the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma which recurs or does not respond to initial treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, by altering the environment around the tumor or by affecting the immune system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the antitumor efficacy of single agent ibrutinib as measured by the overall response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed or not responded to chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess duration of tumor control including duration of response (DOR) II. To assess progression free survival (PFS). III. To assess the safety and tolerability of 560mg of ibrutinib in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the mechanism(s) by which ibrutinib may be active in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) by the correlation of potential biomarkers with clinical outcomes. OUTLINE: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then every 9 weeks for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with relapsed or refractory classical HL who have previously received ASCT OR prior treatment with at least 2 lines of therapy for HL including brentuximab vedotin and who are ineligible for ASCT due to: Inability to achieve a CR or partial response (PR) prior to transplant Age or comorbid conditions Inability to collect stem cells Patients must have received prior ASCT at least 12 weeks (3 months) before the first dose of ibrutinib and completed any prior treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, biologics, and/or other investigational agents at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of ibrutinib.
