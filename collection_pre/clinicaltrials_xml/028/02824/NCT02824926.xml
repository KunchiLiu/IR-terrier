	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing BL123 Versus Ketoconazole in Patients With Tinea Pedis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study sample consists of male and female subjects aged between 18 and 60 years-old, either with single or multiple Tinea Pedis lesion(s). Sixty (60) patients will be enrolled, but each foot with lesion(s) will be considered as one (1) sample. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral lesions, one foot will be allocated to investigational product (Dapaconazole) and the other foot will be allocated to active control (Ketoconazole). Randomization will determine which foot (right or left) will be treated with Dapaconazole or Ketoconazole.</detailed_description>
