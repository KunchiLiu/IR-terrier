	<brief_title>Vibration Stimuli in Stroke Patients With Contraversive Pusher Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>12 post-stroke subjects will be recruited from neurological rehabilitation department at Loewenstein rehabilitation hospital, Raanana, Israel. The patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Experimental group. 2) Control group. The 2 weeks intervention (10 sessions) in each group will include vibration stimuli (frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of 20 mm) for 20 minutes and structured standard physiotherapy for 45 minutes. The vibration stimuli in the experimental group will be done to the contralesional neck muscles, whereas the vibration stimuli in the control group will be done in the contralesional hand. Different assessments will be done before the intervention, after the first day of intervention, after two weeks of intervention and one months post-intervention. The tests will include: Clinical Scale for Contraversive Pushing, Lateropulsion Scale, Subjective Straight Ahead, Postural Assesment Scale for Stroke Patients, Anterior and Lateral Functional Reach Test, Posturography, Behavioral Inattention Test, Mesulam Cancellation Test, Line Bisection Test, Dynamic Starry Night and sensation. Differences between groups will be calculated using t-tests or Mann-Whitney, depending on distribution of normality with corrections for multiple comparisons. Smallest Real Difference (SRD) will be calculated for detecting the minimal detectable change.</detailed_description>
