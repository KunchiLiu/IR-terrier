	<brief_title>Experimental Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Treatment of Chronic Autoimmune Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic urticaria is a distressful disease, which negatively affects the quality of life. Pathogenesis isn't exactly clear, treatment is relatively palliative and results are usually suboptimal. 30-40% of the patients have autoimmune origin. Patients are forced to use immunosuppressive treatments which have systemic effects. Some of the treatments have effects as severe as the disease itself. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most common used cells in clinical trials. These cells can provide efficient immunosuppression in severe conditions like immunosuppressive resistant Graft versus Host Disease. With this study at the first time and quite a different approach from conventional treatment, it will be tried an experimental treatment that used in the MSCs for the chronic autoimmune urticaria patients without of definitive treatment.</detailed_description>
