	<brief_title>Therapeutic Alliance is it Associated With Better Compliance Amongst Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The therapeutic alliance is the agreement that is being built between doctor and patient during the construction process of care. So active collaboration based on a shared assessment of issues and agreement on possible solutions. Initially described in psychiatry, this analytical concept has been extended to several chronic diseases in particular requiring more often a strong link between doctor and patient. His measure is important since it has been demonstrated by several previous studies that the therapeutic alliance is predictive of the therapeutic effects of treatment. This alliance, however, was little studied in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, its connection with the observance or the quality of life has never been evaluated. The chronic nature of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) requires a strong ability of the child to follow his treatment, where the role of parents going to be important and where the relationship built with the caregiver is also essential. Adherence is a complex concept for which there is no ideal measure. Direct evaluation criteria such as bioassays prove still incomplete and difficult to implement in observational studies. Indirect measures have been developed through self-administered questionnaires and literature showed their relatively good correlation with actual catches. The innovative hypothesis of this research is that a better therapeutic alliance is associated with better adherence child in JIA.</detailed_description>
