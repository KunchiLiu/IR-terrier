	<brief_summary>Nalmefene is the first drug to obtain Marketing Authorisation in France for reduction of alcohol consumption. It appears to be significantly more effective in the group of heavy drinkers, while the mean alcohol consumption in studies conducted in cirrhotic patients is greater than 120 g/day. No data are available concerning nalmefene in alcohol-dependent patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, nalmefene could represent an attractive alternative to reduce heavy drinking in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, with potential improvement of liver function. No comparator is available for nalmefene, as all other molecules require abstinence prior to starting treatment.</brief_summary>
