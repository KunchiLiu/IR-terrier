	<brief_summary>Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition in which the parathyroid glands fail to produce sufficient amount of parathyroid hormone or the parathyroid hormone produced lacks biologic activity. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands due to neck surgery for another condition. Hypoparathyroidism can also be caused by an autoimmune process. In rare cases, hypoparathyroidism may occur as a genetic disorder inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive trait. The autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is mainly caused by heterozygous activating mutations in the CASR gene encoding CaSR). ADH differs from other cause of hypoparathyroidism by the increased risk to develop hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. The purpose of the study is to compare two therapeutic approaches in ADH in order to limit the risk of nephrocalcinosis and renal failure when attempting to correct hypocalcemia: rhPTH(1-34) vs association of active vitamin D and hydrochlorothiazide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human rhPTH(1-34) VS Association Alfacalcidol/Hydrochlorothiazide in Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design consists in a five-periods, two-treatments, open-label, randomized, crossover study with blind end-point evaluation. Patients will come for an inclusion visit and will receive treatment with 0.5 µg/day alfacalcidol for 4 weeks (28±3 days, run-in). They will be instructed to maintain dietary calcium intakes (1 g/day) for the duration of the study and will be supplemented throughout the study with native vitamin D in order to maintain the concentration of 25OH vitamin D ≥ 40 ng/L. Magnesium supplementation (100 mg/day) will be maintained throughout the study. At inclusion, patients will be randomly assigned to receive at the end of run-in period, in cross-over either an association hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (ESIDREX®) + amiloride 5 mg/day (MODAMIDE®) + 0.5 µg/day alfacalcidol (ALFACALCIDOL®) or 40 µg/day rhPTH(1-34) (teriparatide or FORSTEO® 20 µg twice daily) over 7 to 8 weeks (52±3 days). After a washout period of 28±3 days under 0.5 µg alfacalcidol /day, the patients will follow the second period of treatment. The study will end with a final period of 28±3 days under 0.5 µg alfacalcidol /day. Patients will ambulatory monitor serum calcium, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels at days 15 of run in and run out periods and at day 7 and day 28 of each treatment period.</detailed_description>
