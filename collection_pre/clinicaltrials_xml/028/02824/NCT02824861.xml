	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a technology based intervention (physical activity tracker, text messages, health coach, global positioning system enabled location based feedback on physical activity) to support physical activity in cancer survivors after completing oncology rehabilitation. In Phase 1 all participants received the full intervention. In phase II participants are randomly assigned to receive the full intervention or a fitbit only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bemobile Intervention to Support Physical Activity in Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention, offered to participants after completing oncology rehabilitation, integrates known preferences and determinants of physical activity participation in women and breast cancers survivors including social support, professional guidance, self-efficacy, goal setting, self-regulation, and environmental awareness delivered through accessible technology. For the iteration phase, the investigators will conduct an initial, abbreviated intervention wave lasting 4 weeks; the investigators will then incorporate participant input and feedback on the specific components to refine the intervention prior to a pilot trial. Means of delivering the components include communication and support through tailored text messaging, health coaching phone calls, self-monitoring of physical activity through a wearable sensor, and environmental assessment of community physical activity options (e.g., parks, fitness centers, trails) based on global positioning system information.</detailed_description>
