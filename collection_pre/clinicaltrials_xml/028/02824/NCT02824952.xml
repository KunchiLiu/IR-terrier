	<brief_summary>Patients will receive AZD9291 at a dose of 80 mg once daily. Systemic evaluation will be done by PET-CT scan after 6 weeks. In responding patients AZD9291 will be given orally 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Non-responding patients will receive AZD9291 for the period of 6 or 12 weeks (according to the results of response assessment at each time-point).</brief_summary>
