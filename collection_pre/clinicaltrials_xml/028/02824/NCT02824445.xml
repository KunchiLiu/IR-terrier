	<brief_summary>After 13 years of war, PTSD has become pervasive in service members. Traditionally it is evaluated by PTSD Checklist Military Version (PCL-M) and treated with cognitive processing therapy, prolonged exposure therapy and medication management with limited success. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has shown efficacy for improving individual cognitive function in the past decades, both in healthy population and in patients with depression. TMS has been approved by the FDA in treatment of major depressive disorder and migraine headaches. Magnetic EEG guided Resonant Treatment (MeRT) is a form of individualized TMS based on member's EEG/ECG input. Investigators propose to use MeRT to treat veterans with war-related PTSD, a syndrome that includes depressive and anxious symptoms; it is likely that MeRT (namely TMS) will be beneficial and comparable to or better than the current FDA approved methods for treating PTSD.</brief_summary>
