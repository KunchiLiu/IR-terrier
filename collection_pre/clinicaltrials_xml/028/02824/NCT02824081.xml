	<brief_summary>Suicide is a major health problem that causes annually a million death worlwide. In the stress-vulnerability model, suicidal behavior (SB) results from the interaction between an individual's predisposition (personality, family history of SBâ€¦) and stressful conditions (early life adversity). Studies show that suicide ideations could favour inflammation and that depression is associated with an elevated inflammation. Recent evidences also suggest that inflammatory mediators play a critical role in SB. The aim of the study is to evaluate the inflammatory markers rate on depressed patients with or without personal history of SB. In the second part of the study, the relations between the rates of inflammatory markers and characteristics of SB, impulsivity, psychological pain, childhood abuse and gene expression of 5HT2B receptor will be investigated.</brief_summary>
