	<brief_summary>Due to its specific pathophysiology and impact on health outcomes, the Institute of Medicine has described chronic pain as a complex chronic disease and a "national public health crisis." The unique neurobiological basis and psychosocial context of chronic pain in HIV-infected patients underscores the importance of developing and testing a behavioral intervention specifically tailored to this population. This study will pilot test a newly-developed behavioral intervention for chronic pain tailored to individuals with HIV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Testing of a Behavioral Intervention for Chronic Pain in Individuals With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain is a chronic condition with a unique neurobiologic basis, which has a substantial impact on physical and emotional function. Chronic pain in HIV-infected patients is common, and associated with serious health consequences, including up to 10 times greater odds of impaired physical function. Many pharmacologic therapies, including opioids, often do not lead to improved pain and function, and carry significant risk. Evidence-based behavioral interventions are among the most effective and safe non-pharmacologic chronic pain treatments investigated in the general medical population. Therefore, behavioral interventions to improve pain, physical, and emotional function in HIV-infected patients are needed. There is much to be learned from existing interventions. However, the success of a behavioral intervention is heavily influenced by how well it is tailored to the target population's biological, psychological, and social environment. Therefore, in this study investigators will conduct a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of a recently-developed behavioral intervention compared to routine HIV and pain care, to determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact.</detailed_description>
