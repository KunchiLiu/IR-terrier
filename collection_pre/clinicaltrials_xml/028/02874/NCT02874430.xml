	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well metformin hydrochloride works together with doxycycline in treating patients with localized breast or uterine cancer. Metformin hydrochloride may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Doxycycline may stop the growth of bacteria by keeping them from making proteins and minimized the toxic side effects of anti-cancer therapy. It is not yet known whether giving metformin hydrochloride together with doxycycline may be a better way in treating patients with localized breast or uterine cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride and Doxycycline in Treating Patients With Localized Breast or Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if treatment with a combination of metformin hydrochloride (metformin) and doxycycline can increase the percentage of cells that express caveolin-1 in the cancer associated fibroblasts of patients with breast or uterine cancers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of metformin and doxycycline treatment on the percentage of cells that express monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4 in cancer associated fibroblasts and MCT1 and transporter of outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM)20 in the cancer cells of breast and uterine cancer patients. II. To assess safety and tolerability of metformin and doxycycline treatment in subjects with breast and uterine cancer. III. To determine the relationship of the percentage of stromal cells expressing caveolin (CAV)1 or MCT4 and tumor cells that express MCT1 and TOMM20 at baseline and after treatment with metformin and doxycycline with the percentage of cells expressing estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) for breast and uterine samples and human epidermal growth factor (HER)2 in breast cancer samples. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on the metabolic profile of cancer cells and stroma using mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI) on paired samples, comparing metabolite profiles in the pre-metformin and post-metformin tumor sample. II. To assess the impact of a patient's nutritional status, estimated using 3-day dietary recall versus caloric needs as calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation on the baseline and net change in CAV1. III. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on oncomiR micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) (miR-21) after intervention. IV. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on adipokines and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1/insulin signaling pathways through assessment of serum triglycerides, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein (BP)3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), adiponectin, leptin, IGF-1 receptor (R), exosome evaluation, metabolomics profile, and microRNA expression profile.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with a diagnosis of localized breast or uterine cancer that is either biopsy proven or suspected based on history, physical, and or radiographic findings, and who are planned for definitive resection of the tumor without the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH) are eligible to participate Subjects must be newly diagnosed or suspected to have breast or uterine cancer (endometrial cancer with histologies including endometrioid, serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma) No prior cancer therapy is permitted for the breast or uterine cancer that is being resected, including progesterone therapy for endometrial cancer patients; patients may have had prior therapy for other contralateral breast cancer Patient must be able to swallow pills Patients with plasma creatinine levels less than 1.5 mg/dL All subjects must be able to comprehend and sign a written informed consent document Subjects who are pregnant or may become pregnant during metformin and doxycycline administration Subjects on metformin or doxycycline for any reason during the preceding 4 weeks Diabetic subjects are eligible if they are not taking metformin or insulin Subjects who have received iodinated contrast dye less than 48 hours prior to screening meet a temporary exclusion criteria to receive metformin; these patients cannot start investigational metformin until 48 hours have elapsed from contrast administration; subjects who are scheduled for iodinated contrast dye administration within 48 hours of definitive surgery are excluded Patients with plasma creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dL Patients with plasma bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/L or history of lactic or any other metabolic acidosis Patients with history of congestive heart failure stage III or greater Patients scheduled for definitive cancer surgical resection less than 7 days from enrollment or greater than 6 weeks from enrollment Patients with history of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease and abnormal liver function tests defined aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline (Alk) phosphatase (Phos), and or total bilirubin greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal; patients who have a history of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease and normal liver function tests will be eligible to participate Patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake which is defined in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions as more than 1 drink per day for women and more than 2 drinks per day for men.; this definition is referring to the amount consumed on any single day and is not intended as an average over several days; a standard drink is equal to 13.7 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol; generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in 12ounces of beer, 8ounces of malt liquor, 5ounces of wine, 1.5ounces or a "shot" of 80proof distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey) Prior allergic reaction to metformin, doxycycline, or any other tetracycline antibiotic in the past All medications are permitted except those that are contraindicated with metformin or doxycycline under current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations; it is important to note that the medications that are contraindicated with metformin or doxycycline are contraindicated due to concern for theoretical interactions; the following is a list of medications identified as class C (monitor therapy) and class D (consider therapy modification) when treatment with metformin or doxycycline is considered Class C Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Cephalexin Corticosteroids (orally inhaled) Corticosteroids (systemic) Dalfampridine Dofetilide Glycopyrrolate Lamotrigine Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone analogs Pegvisomant Penicillin Trospium Class D Bismuth Subsalicylate Cimetidine Iodinated contrast agents Somatropin</criteria>
