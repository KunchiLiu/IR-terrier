	<brief_title>Exercise for Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a supervised and indvidualized 8-week exercise program compared to treatment-as-usual in subjects with a moderate or severe depressive episode in the context of unipolar depression or bipolar affective disorders. Numerous previous studies suggest that exercise may help to improve the symptoms of depression. Moreover, exercise was shown to enhance neuroplasticity in adults whereas depression results in decreased neuroplasticity. Here, we aim at elucidating whether a newly developed supervised, Internet-based, individualized exercise program of the Institute of Sports Science and the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University Mainz is more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than treatment-as-usual. Furthermore, this study will clarify if severely depressed subjects are able to adhere to an internet-based exercise therapy.</detailed_description>
