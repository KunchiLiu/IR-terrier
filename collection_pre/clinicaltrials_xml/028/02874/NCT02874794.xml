	<brief_summary>To determine whether treatment with sacubitril/valsartan provides a superior effect on aortic characteristic impedance compared to enalapril in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] â‰¤ 40%) after 12 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint is the change in aortic characteristic impedance (Zc = dP/dQ in early systole) between baseline and Week 12.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>History of HTN and one of the following at BOTH screening and prerandomization: 1. SBP &gt;105 mm Hg on antihypertensive medication. 2. SBP &gt;/= 140 mm Hg and NOT on antihypertensive medication. NYHA class IIII heart failure and with reduced ejection fraction &lt;/= 40%. On stable doses of treatment with guidelinedirected therapy, other than ACEis and ARBs prior to randomization. 1. If the patient is currently taking an ACEi, a 36hour washout is required prior to randomization (Visit 2). 2. If the patient is currently taking an ARB, they must discontinue the ARB before initiation of study treatment however washout is not required. On an optimal medical regiment of diuretics and background medications to effectively treat comorbidities such as HTN, DM, and coronary artery disease. Key History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drigs, including history of hypersensitivity to drugs of similar chemical classes, or allergy to ACEis, ARBs, or NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to the study drugs. Previous history of intolerance to sacubitril and valsartan, ACEi or ARB standard of care doses despite appropriate and gradual uptitration. History of angioedema, drugrelated or otherwise. Requirement of treatment with both ACE inhibitor and ARB. Current or prior treatment with sacubitril and valsartan.</criteria>
