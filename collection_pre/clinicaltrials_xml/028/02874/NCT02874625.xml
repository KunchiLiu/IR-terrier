	<brief_summary>In this randomized clinical trial, the bio-compatibility of 2 materials used for dental restorations will be compared: glass-ionomer vs resin-based composites. Urine and saliva samples will be taken for determination of bisphenol A levels at several time points, and for analysis of the estrogenic activity using ERE-CALUX. Also buccal cells will be taken. Next, DNA extraction will be done with a commercial kit. Global alterations in DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation levels will be determined using UPLC-MS/MS.</brief_summary>
