	<brief_summary>Whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA) is a new, non-invasive, and promising therapy for a diverse and growing list of disorders including cardiovascular disease. During WBPA, patients lie in the supine position on a bed that is capable of translating back and forth parallel to the ground, along the head-to-foot axis of the patient. Thus, this treatment is best described as a form of "passive exercise." The frequency of the translation (up to 180 cycles/minute; cpm) as well as the distance traveled (2-24mm) by the bed can be adjusted by the patient or health care professional. The science behind the therapeutic effects of WBPA still remains largely unknown. We are observing how WBPA may impact on sleep and activity in individuals with PD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with PD. Whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA) is a new, non-invasive, and promising therapy for a diverse and growing list of disorders. During WBPA, patients lie in the supine position on a bed that is capable of translating back and forth parallel to the ground, along the head-to-foot axis of the patient. Thus, this treatment is best described as a form of "passive exercise." WBPA has been shown in previous studies to increase nitric oxide. Increased levels of nitric oxide have been shown to improve sleep patterns in other populations. The current pilot study will investigate how WBPA will impact upon sleep disturbances in subjects with PD who suffer from abnormal sleep patterns. We will record sleep patterns and activity levels using a Jawbone U3Â® activity monitor.</detailed_description>
