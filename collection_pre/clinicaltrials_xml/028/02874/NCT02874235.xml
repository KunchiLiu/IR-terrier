	<brief_summary>This study compares music therapy with verbal psychotherapy (treatment as usual) in an outpatient psychiatric clinic for traumatized refugees. Based on positive results from a pilot study, the randomized clinical trial are a non-inferiority design to detect whether music therapy is not less effective than verbal therapy carried out by psychologists, and can serve as a complementary treatment modality (n=70). The participants are adult Arabic or Danish speaking refugees suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The patients are referred to outpatient treatment by their medical doctor. Data collection takes place in three clinics in Region Zealand, Denmark. The music therapy method used are Guided Imagery and Music (GIM). Primary outcome is pre and post measures of HTQ (Harvard Trauma Questionaire) and secondary outcomes are pre and post measures of Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHO-5), Tension Dissociation Scale (DSS), Somatoform Dissociation Questionaire (SDQ) , Revised Adult Attachment Scale (RAAS) and physiological measures (salivary oxytocin, betaendorphin and Substance P).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects are randomized to 16 session of trauma modified GIM or 16 sessions of verbal psychotherapy (standard treatment). N (70) is based on a power calculation using HTQ measures from similar refugee studies, with an estimated effect size in the range 0.6-0.8. Primary outcome measure: the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (part 4) is a 5 point Likert scale measuring the load of trauma symptoms corresponding to DSM IV PTSD diagnosis. The choice of secondary measures of attachment (RAAS) and dissociation (DSS &amp; SDQ20). The primary measure (HTQ) is scored by the therapists.The secondary measures are self-report questionnaires scored by the patients with the help of an educated translator who is blinded with regards to the treatment group. 0.5 ml salivary samples are collected in plastic tubes and stored at -20 degrees C, The concentration of tree hormones (oxytocin, betaendorphin, substance P) are analyzed in a multiplex solution. Intervention The intervention is a phased trauma-oriented modification (tmGIM) of the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM), where music listening and spontaneous imagery in an altered state of consciousness is used within a psychotherapeutic session to promote inner transformation and growth. The method was adapted by certain constraints: Using only a limited selection of music with musical parameters, that fully support the trauma-oriented therapeutic goals and do not provoke flashbacks. Using short music listening periods (2-10 minutes). Listening in an upright position. Inclusion of music from Middle-Eastern cultures. Inclusion of psychoeducation and introductory mindfulness based exercises such as mindful breathing and body awareness. Initial focus on inner resources such as positive memories, imagining a safe place and the use of the music breathing technics.</detailed_description>
