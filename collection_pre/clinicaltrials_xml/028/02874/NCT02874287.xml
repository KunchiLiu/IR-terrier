	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Hydroxychloroquine to Treat High-risk Coronary Artery Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind, placebo, randomized controlled cross-over trial is going to assess if hydroxychloroquine could improve the high sensitivity C-reaction protein, blood lipid, blood glucose and blood pressure, also whether hydroxychloroquine could affect the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and the M1/M2 phenotype polarization of macrophages in patients with high-risk coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
