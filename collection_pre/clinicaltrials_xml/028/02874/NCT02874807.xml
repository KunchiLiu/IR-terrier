	<brief_summary>Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIADH) is characterized by an imbalance of antidiuretic vasopressin (AVP) secretion. The impaired AVP regulation leads to water retention and secondary natriuresis and is a common cause for hyponatremia. The therapeutic options, aside from treating the underlying disease, depend upon the onset and severity of the symptoms and involve usually fluid restriction or hypertonic saline infusion. Alternative therapeutic options are loop diuretics, administration of oral urea or vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans). Despite those options, there are a considerable number of patients which do not sufficiently respond, making additional therapy necessary. Empagliflozin (Jardiance)® is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-inhibitor, which is a new treatment option developed for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal tubule and reabsorbs approximately 90 percent of the filtered glucose. The inhibition of SGLT2 results in renal excretion of glucose with subsequent osmotic diuresis. This mechanism could result in a therapeutic effect in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia as in SIADH. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether empagliflozin (Jardiance)® has an effect on the serum sodium levels of patients with SIADH.</brief_summary>
