	<brief_title>FM-SRP and Tooth Extraction Improve Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a randomize, prospective study 200 patients from the endocrinology department of "Peja's Regional Hospital" and Dental Polyclinic at city of Peja, will be assessed and examined for eligibility. Personal interviews will be used to collect the baseline data from each participant using a pre structured questionnaire. After clinical examination, 160 patients aged 30-70 years will be selected for the study. These will be further divided in four groups: type 2 diabetes mellitus group (with or without initial periodontal therapy) and non-diabetic group (with or without initial periodontal therapy). All the patients will be with periodontal disease and at least one tooth extraction will perform. Previous to surgery procedures, in particular in the two groups with an adjunctive non surgical periodontal treatment such as full mouth tooth cleaning will be included: full-mouth scaling and root planing (FM-SRP) with ultrasonic device (UDS-J Ultrasonic Scaler, Guilin Woodpecker Medical Instrument) and periodontal curets for mechanical debridement of the supra- and sub-gingival plaque and calculus. Post operative rinsing will be followed with antiseptic solution Listerine® (ethanol 21.6%, methyl salicylate 0.06%, menthol 0.042%, thymol 0.064% and eucalyptol 0.092%) as a mouthwash thrice a day for 3 weeks.</detailed_description>
