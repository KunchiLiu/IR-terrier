	<brief_summary>In this study, investigators plan to test two potential mechanisms contributing to diastolic dysfunction among asymptomatic persons with HIV who are on cART. The first proposed mechanism is that heightened systemic immune activation/inflammation in HIV contributes to myocardial inflammation, which in turn promotes myocardial fibrosis. The second mechanism is that ectopic fat deposition (increased visceral adiposity) in HIV relates to increased intramyocardial lipid content, which in turn contributes to diastolic dysfunction. Both HIV positive and HIV-negative participants will undergo cardiac MRI/ MRS imaging studies for evaluation of myocardial fibrosis, myocardial inflammation, and intramyocardial lipid content. Traditional markers of CVD risk, inflammatory markers/immune, hormonal markers, and markers of myocardial stretch/injury will be assessed in relation to cardiac MRI/MRS outcomes.</brief_summary>
