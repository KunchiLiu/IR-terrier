	<brief_summary>This phase IIa trial studies the side effects and how well TGR-1202 and ibrutinib work in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. TGR-1202 and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TGR-1202 and Ibrutinib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3K) delta inhibitor TGR-1202 (TGR-1202) and ibrutinib in relapsed and refractory (rel/ref) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as the sum of complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR). II. To determine the event-free survival (EFS), time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DOR) in patients with rel/ref DLBCL. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate molecular profiling of patient samples (optional lymph node biopsies) obtained at days 0 (pre-treatment; core biopsy), day 8 (fine needle aspiration) and end of treatment (progressive disease or end of study treatment—1 year; core biopsy). II. To evaluate the baseline characteristics and dynamic shifts in mutational Landscape, transcriptional signatures and intracellular signaling cascades in primary tumor cells. III. To define the mutational status of 384 genes that mutated in DLBCL, including cluster of differentiation (CD)79B, caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11), and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88). IV. To evaluate signatures of B-cell receptor signaling and the back-up pathway of oxidative phosphorylation. V. To measure the basal and induced level of activation of components within parallel signaling pathways downstream of the B-cell receptor. VI. To perform quantitative response evaluation by peripheral blood cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing at enrollment, day 8, 1 month, at every response assessment time point compared to standard radiographic response evaluation by positron emission tomography (PET)/ computed tomography (CT) or CT and end of treatment (progressive disease or end of study treatment—1 year). VII. To evaluate the genetic profiling for drug resistance mutations. VIII. To evaluate DLBCL subtype analysis by immunohistochemistry compared to Nanostring assessment. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups. GROUP A: Patients receive PI3K delta inhibitor TGR-1202 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and ibrutinib PO QD on days 9-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP B: Patients receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28 and PI3K delta inhibitor TGR-1202 PO QD and days 9-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP C: Patients then receive PI3K delta inhibitor TGR-1202 PO QD and ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and after 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) or transformed DLBCL Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain and immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides or a representative formalinfixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue block along with the pathology report from initial diagnosis, (as well as, an optional 8 unstained slides of 4 micron thickness to store for future IHC and DNA specified research use), should be sent to be reviewed, and the diagnosis confirmed by University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) (retrospective diagnostic review: treatment may commence prior to the UNMC review); please NOTE: the diagnostic H&amp;E slide and IHC slides will be returned after review; only the optional 8 unstained slides will be retained and stored for future unspecified research use Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL that has relapsed posttransplant or that has been determined to be ineligible or unsuitable for transplant; patients must have to have received at least one prior systemic therapy Patients must have measurable (&gt;= 1.5 cm) or evaluable disease; baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 6 weeks of registration to the study; abnormal PET scans will not constitute evaluable disease, unless verified by CT scan or other appropriate imaging; measurable disease must have at least one objective measurable disease parameter; a clearly defined, bidimensionally measurable defect or mass measuring at least 1.5 cm in diameter on a CT scan will constitute measurable disease; proof of lymphoma in the liver is required by a confirmation biopsy; skin lesions can be used as measurable disease provided bidimensional measurements are possible Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L By automated or manual review, whichever is greatest Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L: Unless due to bone marrow infiltration then eligible if platelets &gt;
