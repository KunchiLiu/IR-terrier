	<brief_summary>This study will enroll patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) that have residual Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA after curative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The purpose is to evaluate the survival in these patients treated with apatinib (YN968D1), an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (phase IIa) and to compare the survival in these patients treated with apatinib versus placebo (phase IIb).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADjuVant Apatinib in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients With Residual Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA Following Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study has two parts. In the single arm phase IIa part, we will enroll 25 patients that have residual Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA after curative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. All patients will receive apatinib. The purpose is to evaluate the disease free-survival (DFS) in these patients treated with apatinib. In the phase IIb part, patients will be randomized to apatinib or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. The estimated sample size is 78 in phase IIb. However, the final sample size in phase IIb will be determined based on results of the phase IIa part.</detailed_description>
