	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (RVd) will increase the proportion of subjects achieving stringent complete response (sCR), as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, by the time of completion of post autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) consolidation treatment, compared with RVd alone.</brief_summary>
