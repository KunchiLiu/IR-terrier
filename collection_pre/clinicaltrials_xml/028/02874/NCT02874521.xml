	<brief_title>Low-frequency Electrical Muscle Stimulation vs Cycle Training During Haemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End stage renal disease is associated with reduced functional capacity. Dynamic exercise training i.e. cycling, performed between dialysis sessions or during dialysis (intra-dialytic) can be effective in improving functional capacity and quality of life. However, many patients are unable to engage in intra-dialytic cycling due to limiting comorbidities. Other exercise modalities should be considered. Low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation of the quadriceps is well tolerated and may improve functional capacity in clinical populations. The trial is a longitudinal, randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomly allocated to 10 weeks of 1) intra-dialytic low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation, 2) intra-dialytic cycling, or 3) usual care haemodialysis without exercise training. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 10 weeks by assessors blinded to group allocation.</detailed_description>
