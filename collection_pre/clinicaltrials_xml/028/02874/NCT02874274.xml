	<brief_summary>This is a study to see whether participation in the Edmond J. Safra Interdisciplinary Home Visit Program for Advanced Parkinson's (HVP) increases the rate of age-appropriate vaccinations in people with advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) and related disorders. This study will evaluate the impact of the HVP on the rate of common illnesses such as flu and pneumonia in patients with advanced PD and related disorders over the course of one year. As there is currently no data available on the baseline rate of vaccinations in either homebound or less disabled PD populations, investigators will seek to establish the baseline rate of vaccinations, barriers to getting vaccinated, and baseline healthcare utilization in these populations by piloting (Phase 1) and then implementing (Phase 2) a survey via telephone interviews. Investigators will then test feasibility of offering influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, as appropriate, to the homebound individuals in our HVP cohort (Phase 3), and will compare their pre- and post-intervention rates of both outpatient and acute healthcare utilization and self-reported illness.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Phase 1: Diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (a chronic, slowlyprogressive neurological disorder), or related disorders including Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, or Corticobasal Syndrome. Phase 2: Subjects will be those diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (a chronic, slowlyprogressive neurological disorder), or related disorders including Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, or Corticobasal Syndrome. Each subject must either 1) be willing and able to provide verbal, informed consent for the study, and for whom capacity to consent will be assessed using the questions below, or 2) if unable to provide informed consent due to lack of capacity, a caregiver is able to provide informed consent and the subject provides assent to participation. Phase 3: Diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (a chronic, slowlyprogressive neurological disorder), or related disorders including Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, or Corticobasal Syndrome. Each subject must either 1) be willing and able to provide written, informed consent for the study, and for whom capacity to consent will be assessed using the questions below, or 2) if unable to provide informed consent due to lack of capacity, a caregiver is able to provide informed consent and the subject provides assent to participation. Subjects have one or more of the following criteria: Fluctuation Multimorbidity Mismanages medication Cognitive impairment High risk for rehospitalization High risk for nursing facility admission Suspected elder abuse Recent history of increased falls in home Caregiver burnout suspected Ability to participate in the research study as deemed by the Principal Investigator. Diagnosis of another neurodegenerative disease or other major central nervous system disorder. Subjects with severe hearing impairment or speech dysfunction that would preclude pa Subjects with active psychosis or exhibiting symptoms of a severe psychiatric disorder.</criteria>
