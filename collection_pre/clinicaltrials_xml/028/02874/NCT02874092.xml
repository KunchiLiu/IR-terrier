	<brief_summary>This is an open label study to assess the improvement in the Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts (DAS28) with ticagrelor given at 90 mg twice daily in patients with RA who have active disease despite MTX therapy (as defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria). There will also be a cross sectional analysis of baseline platelet activity in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Subjects in the OA cohort will not receive any study medication, and will only have one study visit. Patients will receive 90 mg ticagrelor orally bid. The patients will receive drug for 30-days. Methotrexate dose will remain stable throughout the study duration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The two main goals of this study are to demonstrate the heightened cardiovascular risk in RA by comparing platelet activity, inflammation and endothelial function in baseline rheumatoid arthritis versus age- and sex-matched patients with osteoarthritis; and 2) to demonstrate the effect of ticagrelor in rheumatoid arthritis by the pre- and post- measures of clinical RA severity, platelet activity, inflammation and endothelial function in rheumatoid arthritis before and after ticagrelor therapy.</detailed_description>
