	<detailed_description>Community Health Workers (CHWs) using patient stories to support hypertension (HTN) management is a CHW-delivered culturally appropriate storytelling intervention for patients diagnosed with HTN. We will develop and test interactive videos presenting stories of patients who have successfully made changes enhancing blood pressure control; and integrate this new tool with a CHW approach to management of hypertension. This two site, two-armed randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 252 english and spanish speaking patients with uncontrolled HTN. All participants are randomized to receive five visits (two in-person and 3 telephone calls) with CHWs either immediately (intervention condition (I)) or 6 months after enrollment (delayed intervention (DI)). Intervention participants receive the intervention immediately and DI participants receive print materials at enrollment and are telephoned 4-6 months after enrollment to schedule an in-person visit at the health enter to begin receiving the intervention protocol.</detailed_description>
