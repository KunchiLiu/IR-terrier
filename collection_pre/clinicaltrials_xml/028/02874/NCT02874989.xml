	<criteria>1. Men between ages 50 and above, at the time of signing the informed consent. 2. Postmenopausal women ages 50 and above, at the time of signing the informed consent. Note: Postmenopausal is defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea determined by selfreport. 3. A clinical diagnosis of IPF and characteristic chest HRCT scan (determined by panel of pulmonary radiologists) OR biopsy showing usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). 4. Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 19 35 kg/ m2 (inclusive), where BMI = (weight in kg) / (height in meters)2 . 5. Subjects participating in an exercise program must be willing to maintain their current activity level for the duration of the study period. 6. Patients on stable therapy with nintedanib (Ofev) or pirfenidone (Esbriet) over the past 3 months.ORPatients not taking nintedanib (Ofev) or pirfenidone (Esbriet) may be enrolled if they have previously not tolerated one of those medications or if those medications have not yet been prescribed or used by the patient. 7. Giving signed informed consent. 8. No plans to travel over the next 6 weeks. 1. More than two moderate/severe IPF exacerbations within the past year Exacerbation is defined as worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms: dyspnea, sputum volume, sputum purulence OR worsening of any one major symptom together with at least one of the following additional symptoms: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion), fever &gt; 37.5 Â° C without any explained cause, increased cough, increase wheeze. A moderate exacerbation is defined as an event that is associated with a new prescription for antibiotics and/or oral steroids. A severe exacerbation is defined as an event that is associated with hospitalization or emergency room visit. 2. Any moderate/severe IPF exacerbation within the past 4 weeks. 3. History of a lung transplant. 4. Use of antiarrhythmic medications known to cause QTc prolongation. 5. Pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale confirmed by echocardiography or heart catheterization. 6. Myocardial infarction, angina, hospitalization for cardiac aetiology, stroke or transient ischemic attack in the past 6 months. 7. Chronic heart failure. 8. Neurologic, musculoskeletal, or other condition that in the opinion of the study physician limits subject's ability to complete study physical assessments. 9. Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 7.5% or the current use of insulin). 10. Subjects with values outside the specified ranges for the following Key Clinical Laboratory Tests must be excluded from the study: Renal function: Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;30 (mL/min/1.73 m2) using formulae provided in the Study Reference Manual (SRM). Note: Subjects receiving dialysis are excluded from this study. ALT &gt;2xULN and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). 11. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). 12. QTcB or QTcF &gt; 450 msec or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block based on a single ECG. 13. Subjects with a history of malignancy that is not in complete remission for at least 2 years or 1 year for nonmelanoma skin carcinoma. 14. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to participation in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). 15. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 5 years prior to randomization. 16. Use of Coumadin or other antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication. The use of aspirin is permitted. 17. Current use of quinolone antibiotics. 18. Low CBC. 19. Cognitive Impairment (MoCA score less than 21) 20. Other medical or behavioral factors that in the judgment of the principal investigator may interfere with study participation or the ability to follow the intervention</criteria>
