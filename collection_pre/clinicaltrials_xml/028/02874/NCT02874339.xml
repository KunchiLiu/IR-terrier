	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy is non inferior to non invasive ventilation (NIV) in the immediate treatment of patients with acute hypercapnic cardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with respiratory failure in the emergency department.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal Oxygen Versus VNI in Acute Hypercapnic Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective multicenter study including ED patients with a suspected diagnosis of acute hypercapnic pulmonary edema with respiratory failure who require NIV according to the joint recommendations from the French society of anaesthesia and intensive care and the French society for intensive care. Patients will be randomly assigned to NIV or high flow nasal oxygen therapy, with stratification on center and severity of hypercania. Assigned Treatment will be administered during at least one session of 1hr and resumed as needed based on the patient's signs of respiratory distress and blood gas results Repeat evaluation of arterial blood gases, clinical parameters and dyspnea will be performed before and after the first and second hour of treatment according to current recommendation from the French society of anesthesia and intensive care medicine (SFAR).</detailed_description>
