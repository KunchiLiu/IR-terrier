	<brief_summary>The objective is to compare women's platelet answer in the last month of pregnancy to women old enough to procreate, no pregnancy and without hormonal treatment. The hypothesis of research is that the decrease of platelet answer in pregnant women could not only limit the occurence of embolic accidents but also explain the lowest incidence of the arterial thrombosis in comparison with the venous thrombosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Platelet Function During the Last Month of Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a monocentric study comparing a group of pregnant women and a group of "no pregnancy" women. The goal of the present study is to determine the impact of pregnancy on platelet function. For this, the study propose to explore, in women in the last month of pregnancy, the ability of platelets to aggregate after activation by strong agonists but also their ability to adhere to a matrix and form thrombies. The study will include 30 pregnant and 30 "no pregnancy" control women, of childbearing age and not taking hormone therapy. From a blood sample, two types of examination will be implemented: A) In whole blood, we will evaluate the percentage of platelet adhesion to collagen matrix or fibrinogen and the volume of thrombies formed. B) In washed platelets and whole blood, we shall determine the percentage of aggregation after activation by different agonists and the amount of certain membrane markers of platelet activation. Furthermore, an assay of estradiol plasma will be made.</detailed_description>
