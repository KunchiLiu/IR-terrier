	<brief_title>Comparison Between Injections of Steroids and Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma in the Oral Erosions of Pemphigus Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten (Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients will be enrolled in this study. The clinical disease score of the patients will be assessed using the pemphigus disease area index (PDAI). Three milliliters of blood will be withdrawn from each patient. The blood will be centrifuged and the platelet rich plasma (PRP) will be extracted. Patients will receive autologous PRP injections for one side of buccal mucosa and triamcinolone acetonide 10mg/ml at the other buccal mucosa at biweekly intervals for 3 months. The degree of pain and clinical improvement of each buccal mucosa will be assessed by an investigator who does not know the nature of injection in each buccal mucosa. Therefore the investigation doing the injection will not be blind but the other investigator assessing the results will be blind also the patients will be blind.</detailed_description>
