	<brief_summary>The direct objective of this study is to determine whether an experienced provider can more adequately and/or easily ventilate an anesthetized patient with the NuMask device as compared to traditional bag-valve-mask ventilation. The researchers believe that mean tidal volumes obtained by experienced providers when manually ventilating anesthetized patients with the NuMask device will be larger than when using the traditional bag-valve-mask.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The researchers will identify potential patients for this study from preoperative nurse screening in one of the clinics at the John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah Surgical Center or the Huntsman Center. These patients will be identified for acceptability by ascertaining their BMI, facial hair status or dental status. Once identified as a possible candidate, the patient will be evaluated for suitability by the researchers. If criteria are met the patient will be consented for the study. The signature on the consent document will be obtained when consent is taken or on the day of surgery. This will be a prospective, randomized, crossover study. At the time of the pre-operative assessment, the difficulty to ventilate each patient will be predicted based on presence of a beard, BMI &gt; 35, history of snoring/OSA, age greater than 55, and/or edentulous state as easy, moderate, or difficult. After induction of anesthesia, both devices will be used to ventilate each enrolled patient. After induction of anesthesia, tracheal intubation will occur in approximately 2-3 minutes. A computer-generated randomization schedule will determine which device is used first during the provider's first encounter, and the opposite order will be employed during the provider's second encounter. Randomization will occur within each strata listed above. Opaque, sealed envelopes will be prepared and opened just prior to ventilation of the patients. The experienced provider will hold the device in position and the ventilator in the anesthesia machine will be used to ventilate the patients. For patient safety in avoidance of gastric insufflation increasing the risk of aspiration, inspiratory pressures during ventilation will be limited to 20 cm H2O by using the pressure control option on the ventilator in the anesthesia machine. An NM3 respiratory profile monitor (Philips Medical, Carlsbad, CA) will be used to measure mean expired tidal volumes and peak airway pressures during 10 consecutive breaths with each device. Hemodynamic monitoring including blood pressure, heart rate, and telemetry as well as pulse oximetry will be monitored during this time for patient safety, but not collected as study data. Presence of ventilation will be clinically assessed as chest rise and fall, and presence of end tidal CO2, in addition to measured oxygen saturation levels remaining above 90%. If, at any point during the study ventilation becomes inadequate (i.e. loss of chest rise, loss of end tidal CO2, oxygen saturation &lt; 90%), the attending anesthesiologist will take control of the airway to regain adequate ventilation if a resident is involved. At the conclusion of each encounter the experienced provider will be asked to grade the difficulty or ease of ventilation with each device using a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 to 5, which will be immediately recorded. Once all patients have been enrolled in the study and the study is complete, the researchers will begin data analysis with the help of our statistician. Once the researchers are satisfied with the adequacy of the data, the study will be closed.</detailed_description>
