	<brief_summary>MedJ-01 Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is a single use device/drug combination product comprising: - A mounted Cobalt Chromium (CoCr) alloy based stent - A Rapid Exchange (RX) Coronary System Delivery System - A Poly n-butyl methacrylate (PBMA) and CarboSil®Polymer matrix coating - Ridaforolimus drug - CAS Registry Number: 572924-54-0 MedJ-01 is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic heart disease due to lesions in vessels with reference diameters of 2.5 mm to 4.25 mm, including complex lesions. JNIR01 is aimed at assessing TLF at one year with the MedJ-01 stent in a Japanese patient population to show equivalence to the results of the BIONICS Trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MedJ-01 Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System Trial (JNIR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to evaluate MedJ-01 safety and efficacy for de novo or restenosis lesion with target vessel diameter of 2.5mm to 4.25, for subjects undergoing coronary artery stent implantation. The target population is subjects undergoing PCI for angina (stable or unstable), silent ischemia (in absence of symptoms a visually estimated target lesion diameter stenosis of ≥70%, a positive non-invasive stress test, or FFR ≤0.80 must be present), NSTEMI, and recent subacute STEMI (&gt;72 hours from initial presentation and stable). Complex lesions are allowed. A maximum of two target vessels and two lesions per vessel may be treated (two lesions separated by up to 10 mm that can be covered by a single stent are considered as one lesion); the total planned study stenting in the coronary tree cannot exceed 100 mm.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient with indication for PCI including angina (stable/unstable), silent ischemia (in absence of symptoms a visually estimated target lesion diameter stenosis of ≥70%, a positive noninvasive stress test, or FFR ≤0.80 must be present), NSTEMI, or recent subacute STEMI. For subacute STEMI the time of presentation to the first treating hospital, whether a transfer facility or the study hospital, must be &gt;72 hours prior to enrollment and enzyme levels (CKMB or Troponin) demonstrating that either or both enzyme levels have peaked. 2. Nontarget vessel PCI are allowed prior to enrollment depending on the time interval and conditions as follows: During Baseline Procedure: PCI of nontarget vessels performed during the baseline procedure itself immediately prior to enrollment if successful and uncomplicated defined as: &lt;50% visually estimated residual diameter stenosis, TIMI Grade 3 flow, no dissection ≥ NHLBI type C, no perforation, no persistent ST segment changes, no prolonged chest pain, no TIMI major or BARC type 3 bleeding. Less than 24 hours prior to Baseline Procedure: Not allowed (see exclusion criterion #2). 24 hours30 days prior to Baseline Procedure: PCI of nontarget vessels 24 hours to 30 days prior to enrollment if successful and uncomplicated as defined above. In addition, in cases where nontarget vessel PCI has occurred 2472 hours prior to the baseline procedure, at least 2 sets of cardiac biomarkers must be drawn at least 6 and 12 hours after the nontarget vessel PCI. If cardiac biomarkers are initially elevated above the local laboratory upper limit of normal, serial measurements must demonstrate that the biomarkers are falling. Over 30 days prior to Baseline Procedure: PCI of nontarget vessels performed greater than 30 days prior to procedure whether or not successful and uncomplicated. 3. Patient is willing and able to provide informed written consent and comply with followup visits and testing schedule. Angiographic inclusion criteria (visual estimate): 4. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated diameter of ≥2.5 mm to ≤4.25 mm. 5. Complex lesions are allowed including calcified lesions (lesion preparation with scoring/cutting and rotational atherectomy are allowed), presence of thrombus that is nonocclusive and does not require thrombectomy, CTO, bifurcationlesions (except planned dual stent implantation), ostial RCA lesions, tortuous lesions, bare metal stent restenotic lesions, protected left main lesions. 6. Overlapping stents are allowed with the investigational device (MedJ01). 1. STEMI within 72 hours (subacute) of initial time of presentation to the first treating hospital, whether at a transfer facility or the study hospital or in whom enzyme levels (either CKMB or Troponin) have not peaked. 2. PCI within the 24 hours preceding the baseline procedure. 3. Nontarget lesion PCI in the target vessel within 12 months of the baseline procedure. 4. History of stent thrombosis. 5. Cardiogenic shock (defined as persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm/Hg for more than 30 minutes) or requiring pressors or hemodynamic support, including IABP. 6. Subject is intubated. 7. Known LVEF &lt;30%. 8. Relative or absolute contraindication to DAPT for 12 months (including planned surgeries that cannot be delayed) 9. Subject has an indication for chronic oral anticoagulant treatment (with either vitamin K antagonists or novel anticoagulants NOACs) 10. Calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min using CockcroftGault equation. 11. Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL. 12. Platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3. 13. White blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3,000 cells/mm3. 14. Clinically significant liver disease. 15. Active peptic ulcer or active bleeding from any site. 16. Bleeding from any site within the prior 8 weeks requiring active medical or surgical attention. 17.

Known allergy to the study stent components e.g. cobalt, nickel, chromium, Carbosil®, PBMA, or limus drugs (ridaforolimus, zotarolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, or similar drugs or any other analogue or derivative or similar compounds). 21. Known allergy to protocolrequired concomitant medications such as aspirin, or DAPT (Drugs that inhibit P2Y12 such as clopidogrel and prasugrel), or heparin, or iodinated contrast that cannot be adequately premedicated. 22.

Patient is participating in any other investigational drug or device clinical trial that has not reached its primary endpoint, or plans to participate in any clinical trial. 24. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding (women of childbearing potential, defined as females of childbearing potential if they have not undergone a permanent contraceptive operation or they are not postmenopausal, must have a negative pregnancy test within one week before treatment. Permanent contraceptive operation is defined as: hysterectomy, hysterosalpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy. The status of a female should be considered as postmenopausal when she has not had a period for 12 consecutive months without an alternative medical cause). 25.

Angiographic Exclusion Criteria (visual estimate): 29. Target lesions in more than two (2) major coronary arteries (i.e., two of LAD, LCX, RCA) and their respective branches (the Ramus Intermedius is defined as a branch of the LCX). 30. More than two target lesions per target vessel are planned (two lesions separated by less than 10 mm that can be covered by a single stent are considered as one lesion). 31.
