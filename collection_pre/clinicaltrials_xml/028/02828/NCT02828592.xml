	<brief_summary>Severe aplastic anemia is a rare and serious form of bone marrow failure related to an immune-mediated mechanism that results in severe pancytopenia and high risk for infections and bleeding. Patients with matched sibling donors for transplantation have a 80-90% chance of survival; however, a response rate with just immunosuppression for those patients lacking suitable HLA-matched related siblings is only 60%. With immunosuppression, only 1/3 of patients are cured, 1/3 are dependent on long term immunosuppression, and the other 1/3 relapse or develop a clonal disorder. Recent studies have shown that using a haploidentical donor for transplantation has good response rates and significantly lower rates of acute and chronic GVHD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplant With Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mismatched haploidentical donors will be identified for patients with severe aplastic anemia. These patients will undergo a preparative regimen of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide/TBI followed by haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide will be administered on Days 3 &amp; 4. Immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and MMF will begin on Day +5; MMF will be discontinued on Day +35 while Tacrolimus continues until Day +180. Investigators hypothesize that haploidentical transplantation with the above-mentioned preparative regimen will have a &lt;30% graft failure rate. The one-sided exact Binomial test at 5% significance level will be used to test this hypothesis. The size of 20 patients provides the power of 92.5% for confirming the 30-day graft failure rate &lt;30%.</detailed_description>
