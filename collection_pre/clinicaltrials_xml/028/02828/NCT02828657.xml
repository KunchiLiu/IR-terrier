	<brief_summary>A prospective, multicenter, open-label, post-approval study of the safety and effectiveness of ORBERA™ as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ORBERA™ Post-Approval Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FDA post-approval study designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of ORBERA™ as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2. Behavioral modification program in conjunction with endoscopic placement of a single ORBERA™ Intragastric Balloon, filled with saline to an inflation volume between 400cc and 700cc, for 26 weeks followed by endoscopic ORBERA™ removal. Outcomes include the mean percent Total Body Weight Loss (%TBWL), changes in weight, device and procedure-related AEs and SAEs: gastric ulcers, esophageal injury, placement and removal related SAEs, early device removals, and balloon deflations.</detailed_description>
