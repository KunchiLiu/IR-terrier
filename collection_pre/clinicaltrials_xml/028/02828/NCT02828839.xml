	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to assess the design features of a modified stainless steel access needle (single use disposable) in a clinical setting and a disposable, single use, custom-made, polymer needle guide used in conjunction with a rectal ultrasound probe. The disposable stainless steel access needle may be used with or without the disposable needle guide, but will always be used with ultrasound image guidance and a biopsy gun. The primary purpose of the single-use disposable access needle is to guide the use of a biopsy gun to obtain a tissue sample from the patient's prostate gland through a percutaneous puncture of the perineum. The primary purpose of the disposable needle guide is to stabilize the needle biopsy and better approximate the most direct path to the prostate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to assess the design features of a modified stainless steel access needle (single use disposable) in a clinical setting with and a disposable, single use, custom-made, polymer needle guide used in conjunction with a rectal ultrasound probe. The disposable stainless steel access needle may be used with or without the disposable needle guide, but will always be used with ultrasound image guidance and a biopsy gun. The primary purpose of the single-use disposable access needle is to guide the use of a biopsy gun to obtain a tissue sample from the patient's prostate gland through a percutaneous puncture of the perineum. The primary purpose of the disposable needle guide is to stabilize the needle biopsy and better approximate the most direct path to the prostate. For some subjects, the study will assess the fit and functionality of the stainless steel access needle when used in conjunction with the disposable needle guide as well as multiple handling aspects of the access needle and disposable needle guide when utilized in a prostate biopsy procedure. The study will also assess the ability of trans-rectal ultrasound to appropriately image the stainless steel access needle and biopsy gun needle at, near, and within the prostate tissue.</detailed_description>
