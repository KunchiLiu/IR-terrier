	<brief_title>Prevention of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic ApoGraft Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ApoGraft product is a mobilized peripheral blood cell product of a matched Related donor, collected via apheresis, which is exposed to the apoptotic mediator Fas Ligand (CD95L) prior to transplantation. The study is designed to address the aspects of engraftment and Prevention of Acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD) rate and/or severity in 12 Patients STUDY DESIGN: open label, linear with four-cohorts each consisting of 3 patients. The study consists of a screening phase (subject and donor clinical assessment and screening tests), transplantation of ApoGraft, and a follow-up period of 180 days during and after hospitalization. Cohorts' differentiation is by the escalating concentration of the apoptotic mediator Fas Ligand to which the transplant is exposed during incubation prior to transplantation, ranging from 10 ng/ml in the first cohort to 100 ng/ml in the fourth cohort. The study will progress from one cohort to the next based on a DSMB analysis of the safety data.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult male or female subjects, 1870 years of age. 2. Subjects are eligible for allogeneic HLAmatched related HSCT for any hematological malignancies for which transplantation is appropriate with corresponding related donor. 3. The donor and recipient must have full match at the HLA A, B, C, DR and DQ loci. 4. Life expectancy of at least 6 months at the time of the baseline visit. 5. ECOG performance status score 01 at time of the screening visit. 6. Cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40% in adults within 4 weeks of initiation of conditioning. 7. Pulmonary function test with DLCO, FEV1 and FVC of ≥ 50%. 8. Oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air. 9. Subjects must have adequate organ function as defined below: AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum creatinine &lt;2.5 mg/dL. Serum bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL. 10. Signed written informed consent to participate in the study independently by subject. Subjects requiring a guardian to sign informed consent will not be included. 11. Donor criteria according to standard WMDA criteria for donor selection. Signed written informed consent by donor including consent for 2nd donation if ApoGraft fails. 12. Ability to comply with the requirements of the study. 13. If female of childbearing potential, agree to use an acceptable method of birth control or be surgically sterile, and have a negative pregnancy test. 1. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of the screening visit. 2. Progressive or poorly controlled malignancies. 3. Tcell depleted allograft. 4. Use of nonmyeloabletive conditioning. 5. Uncontrolled infections including sepsis, pneumonia with hypoxemia, persistent bacteremia, or meningitis within two weeks of the screening visit. 6. Current known acute or chronic infection with HBV or HCV. 7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS. 8. Subjects with severe or symptomatic restrictive or obstructive lung disease or respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. 9. Subjects with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition, which could compromise participation in the study (i.e. active infection, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive cardiac failure, unstable angina, ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within six months and chronic liver or renal disease. 10. Any form of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse), psychiatric disorder or any chronic condition susceptible, in the opinion of the investigator, of interfering with the conduct of the study. 11. Organ allograft or previous history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 12. Pregnancy or lactation.</criteria>
