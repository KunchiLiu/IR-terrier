	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the environmental simulation of daytime and night time alternation as well as by the nutrition protocol corresponding to the daily rhythm are beneficially affect the recovery of patients treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) requiring mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proof of Concept Trial to Confirm That the Recovery of Patients Treated in the Intensive Care Unit Requiring Mechanical Ventilation is Beneficially Affected by the Environmental Simulation of Daytime and Night Time Alternation as Well as by the Nutrition Protocol Corresponding to the Daily Rhythm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The homeostasis of human body is significantly disturbed when organs' work-relax periods are not harmonized. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient's circadian rhythm is almost inevitably upset as a result of their disease and/or medical intervention. There are numerous animal studies prove that circadian rhythm and periodic dynamics are directly related to healing time and hence, mortality rate. Although, one of the main messengers of circadian synchronization is melatonin, it is overridden by temperature, and a number of other factors from e.g. the digestive tract. If the circadian rhythm is disturbed, the function of different organ systems becomes desynchronized and chaotic. ICU environment and patient-care activities brings major drawbacks as well mainly by necessary presence of noise and light. It has been shown that ICU settings have an impact on patients' sleep, which can easily lead to delirium and circadian disruption. There are significant data showing strong correlation between delirium and ICU length of stay/ mortality. The focus of this study is the environmental modulation at the ICU with controlled light, noise and nutrition conditions. Controlled light conditions are created with artificial light during daytime and sleeping mask during night time. Earplugs are used during night time for controlled noise conditions. Nutrition is carried out only during daytime both in case of enteral and parenteral feeding.</detailed_description>
