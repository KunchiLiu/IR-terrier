	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the TCD-10023 (Ultimaster) sirolimus eluting stent in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), by proving superiority with respect to in-stent late loss at 6 months to the Kaname bare metal stent and non-inferiority with respect to Target Vessel Failure (TVF) at 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of TCD-10023 (Ultimaster) Drug-eluting Stent in STEMI Patients - MASTER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MASTER is prospective, randomized (3:1), single blind, controlled, superiority (efficacy) and non-inferiority (safety and efficacy), multi center, two-arm trial of TCD-10023 (Ultimaster) drug eluting stent (test) and Kaname bare metal stent (comparator). Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, and 12 months post-procedure and annually for 3 years. 500 patients with clinical follow up will be randomized in 3:1 ratio (375 in TCD-10023 arm and 125 in Kaname arm). Among them, 100 patients will be randomized in the same, 3:1 ratio, to angiographic follow up at 6 months in preselected hospitals (75 in TCD-10023 and 25 in Kaname arm)</detailed_description>
