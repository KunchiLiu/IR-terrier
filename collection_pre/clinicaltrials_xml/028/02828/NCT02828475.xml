	<brief_title>CALYPSO Pilot Study: Machine Learning Based Predictions of Surgical Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CALYPSO is a software platform that uses machine learning techniques to create personalized risk predictions for postoperative complications. Individual risk factors are then linked to best-practice interventions tailored to the individual patient. The investigator aims to test the hypothesis that using CALYPSO-augmented postoperative care will reduce complication rates in patients undergoing elective general surgery. Subjects undergoing surgery will be assigned to the CALYPSO intervention in the postoperative period.</detailed_description>
