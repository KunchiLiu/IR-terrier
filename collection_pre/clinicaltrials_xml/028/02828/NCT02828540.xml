	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy and to Evaluate Safety of HT047 in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study is designed to initiate treatment with high or low dose HT047 or placebo in subjects with acute ischemic stroke within 2 weeks of onset of the disease and evaluate neurological function recovery in these subjects as measured by the extent of motor function recovery at Week 12 of treatment. Subjects must have had a recent onset of acute ischemic stroke as confirmed by brain imaging. In terms of symptoms of ischemic stroke, patients who have motor function impairment with FMA motor score ≤ 55 as well as neurological function impairment with K-NIHSS score ≥ 4 and ≤ 15 are eligible for study participation. A subject who is considered by the investigator to be appropriate for study participation and provides informed consent will participate in this study. At baseline, subjects will be randomized to HT047 high dose group (2250 mg/day), HT047 low dose group (1500 mg/day), or placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio in a double blind fashion and be treated with the investigational product for 12 weeks starting from the next morning of baseline with a three times a day dosing schedule, 3 tablets per dose. Since this is a first-in-human trial for HT047, subjects will have a study visit at Week 1 (Day 7) of participation for laboratory tests, ECG, and chest x-ray. A one-month portion of the investigational product will be supplied. During study treatment, subjects will visit the hospital at Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. During the Week 1 visit, the above tests will be performed and the subject's physical status will be checked before he/she is sent home. In the subsequent visits, neurological function assessment and drug exchange will be carried out. At each visit, the study staff should carefully check the subject's medication compliance and verify the accurate number of remaining doses to be countered. After 12 weeks of study conduct as shown in the above figure, at Week 12, laboratory tests performed at Week 1 will be repeated and overall change in the subject's status will be confirmed before all study procedures are ended.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult at the age of ≥ 19 to ≤ 80 2. Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke by brain imaging within 14 days of screening 3. FMA motor score ≤ 55 with arm or leg weakness at screening 4. KNIHSS score ≥ 4 and ≤ 15 at screening 5. Able to communicate 6. Voluntary written informed consent to study participation 1. Presence of motor function impairment, which is caused by previous stroke except acute ischemic stroke occurring within 14 days of screening (A subject with previous history of stroke may participate if he/she showed no motor function impairment and the KmRS score was ≤1 (01)) 2. Diagnosis of and current treatment for degenerative neurological diseases, e.g., Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease 3. Current treatment with amphetamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or antipsychotics 4. Presence of brain diseases, such as brain tumor, traumatic brain damage, arteriovenous malformation, or moyamoya disease, or ischemic stroke caused by these diseases 5. Impaired ability to walk upright due to other illness prior to screening 6. Unstable vital signs at screening based on the judgment of the investigator e.g., systolic blood pressure ≥ 170mmHg despite antihypertensive treatment or other symptoms such as hyperthermia, tachycardia, or hyperventilation 7. Diagnosis of liver diseases prior to screening, such as hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, or current treatment for these diseases 8. Continuous treatment with potentially hepatotoxic drugs e.g., current treatment with propylthiouracil, ketoconazole, isoniazid, valproic acid, phenytoin, etc. that may induce acute hepatotoxicity 9. Severe, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or higher heart failure at screening [NYHA Classes of heart failure] Class I: patients with no limitation of activities; they suffer no symptoms from ordinary activities. Class II: patients with slight, mild limitation of activity; they are comfortable with rest or with mild exertion. Class III: patients with marked limitation of activity; they are comfortable only at rest. Class IV: patients who should be at complete rest, confined to bed or chair; any physical activity brings on. 10. Diagnosis of or treatment for cancer within 6 months of screening or presence of recurrent or metastatic cancer 11. Treatment with or intake of traditional oriental medicine (herbal medicine) or health functional foods containing potentially hepatotoxic plants, such as Germander (Teucrium chamaedrys, Teucrium polium), toothed clubmoss (Lycopodium serratum), or celandine (Chelidonium majus), within 4 weeks prior to study participation 12. Treatment with or intake of traditional Korean medicine containing pueraria root and/or scutellaria root or other drugs or health functional foods containing their respective index components, i.e. puerarin and baicalin, within 4 weeks prior to study participation 13. Hematologic findings as follows ① Increased serum aspartate or alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels ≥ 1.5 x site specific upper limit of normal in laboratory test ② Decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level (Hb&lt; 10 g/dl), decreased platelet (PLT) level (PLT&lt; 100,000/mm3), or hematocrit (Hct) level &lt; 25% in whole blood count test. ③ Increased serum creatinine (Cr) level (Cr &gt; 2.0 mg/dl) in laboratory test or patient on dialysis 14. Pregnant or lactating women A woman of childbearing potential can participate in the study only if nonpregnancy is confirmed. Subjects must use a double barrier method or must have been surgically sterilized. 15. Previous participation in a clinical study for another drug within 3 months of screening. A subject who participated in an observational study that did not involve drug treatment may participate in this study. 16. Individuals who are considered by the investigator to be inadequate for study participation due to other reasons.</criteria>
