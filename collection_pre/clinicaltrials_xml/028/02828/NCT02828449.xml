	<brief_summary>Therapeutic education is an effective way to support the prescription of oral chemotherapy in oncology. It aims to increase adherence to treatment, to better control the side effects and reduce unplanned readmissions. The three major oncology institutions in the Rhône-Alpes region (Hospices Civils de Lyon, the Centre Léon Bérard Cancer Institute and Lucien Neuwirth) decided to collaborate on a project to implement an adapted Therapeutic Education Program context of each of these institutions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of the intervention in the 3 participating centers, over 1 year: 1. Assess the achievement of the target population 2. Evaluate the adaptation of intervention in context 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention (impact): effectiveness in real life, identification of interactions with the environment linked to the center, identification of unintended effects of the intervention. 4. Assessing the sustainability of the intervention</brief_summary>
