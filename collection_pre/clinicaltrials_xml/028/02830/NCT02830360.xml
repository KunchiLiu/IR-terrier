	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a larger scale multicenter trial comparing first line catheter ablation to antiarrhythmic drug therapy for patients with prior MI, an ICD and VT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiarrhythmics or Ablation for Ventricular Tachycardia Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multicentre, parallel group, two arm, unblinded vanguard pilot randomized clinical trial. A vanguard pilot study design is chosen in order to prove feasibility without committing to the full trial until feasibility is demonstrated. Implantable Defibrillators (ICDs) reduce sudden death and can terminate some VT without shocks, but they don't prevent VT; the most appropriate strategy to suppress VT remains unknown. The widespread use of ICDs means patients who formerly would have suffered sudden death now survive, and may experience recurrent VT and ICD therapy. Therapeutic options for VT are limited. Appropriate ICD programming reduces unnecessary shocks, but VT may still recur and require therapy. VANISH 2 will assess the outcomes of patients with prior MI and VT randomized to catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prior Myocardial Infarction and One of the following VT events while not being treated with amiodarone, sotalol, or another class I or class III antiarrhythmic drug) within the last 6 months: Sustained monomorphic VT documented on 12lead ECG or rhythm strip terminated by pharmacologic means or DC cardioversion ≥3 episodes of VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP), at least one of which should be symptomatic ≥ 5 episodes of VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP) regardless of symptoms ≥1 appropriate ICD shocks, ≥3 VT episodes within 24 hours Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent. Active ischemia (acute thrombus diagnosed by coronary angiography, or dynamic ST segment changes demonstrated on ECG) or another reversible cause of VT (e.g. druginduced arrhythmia), had recent acute coronary syndrome within 30 days, coronary revascularization (&lt;90 days bypass surgery, &lt;30 days percutaneous coronary intervention), or have CCS functional class IV angina. Note that biomarker level elevation alone after ventricular arrhythmias does not denote acute coronary syndrome or active ischemia. Are ineligible for both sotalol (based upon the criteria listed in section 3.2.1 or known intolerance/allergy), and amiodarone (e.g. due to active hepatitis, current hyperthyroidism, pulmonary fibrosis, known allergy). Are known to have protruding left ventricular thrombus or mechanical aortic and mitral valves Have had a prior catheter ablation procedure for VT Are in renal failure (Creatinine clearance &lt;15 mL/min), have NYHA Functional class IV heart failure, or a systemic illness likely to limit survival to &lt;1 year Have had recent ST elevation myocardial infarction or nonST elevation MI (&lt; 30 days); note that biomarker elevation alone after ventricular arrhythmias does not denote MI. Are pregnant.</criteria>
