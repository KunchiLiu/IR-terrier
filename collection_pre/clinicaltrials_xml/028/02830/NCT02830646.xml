	<brief_summary>Obesity promotes chronic kidney disease and is accelerating its shift to the stage of renal replacement. Bariatric surgery is a treatment for severe or morbid obesity whose renal benefit is currently unknown. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best parameter to define the kidney function. It can be estimated using formulas by assaying endogenous markers (creatinine, cystatin C) or measured with an exogenous tracer glomerular filtration (51 Cr-EDTA). Bariatric surgery alters the production of endogenous markers and the extracellular volume (VEC) with 2 important consequences on the assessment of GFR: the formula to estimate GFR is not possible to compare renal function before and after surgery because of the variation in production of endogenous glomerular filtration markers in the same subject; decreasing VEC predicted decreased GFR after surgery, since these parameters are in part proportional to each other. Our working hypothesis is that bariatric surgery protects the kidneys of patients with chronic kidney disease. To demonstrate this, investigators propose to compare the ratio DFG / VEC before and after gastric bypass. Goals The main objective is to measure the effect of gastric bypass on the report DFG / VEC. Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of gastric bypass on the albumin / urine creatinine and evaluate the performance of the main GFR estimating formulas in people with severe or morbid obesity.</brief_summary>
