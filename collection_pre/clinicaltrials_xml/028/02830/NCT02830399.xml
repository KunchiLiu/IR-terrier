	<brief_summary>It's a prospective, multicentric, randomized, controlled study concerning 84 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The aim of the study is to evaluate the augmentation of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) by repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). The primary outcome will be the depressive symptoms intensity measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale For Depression (HAMD-21 items) after 5 ECT. The secondary outcome is to evaluate the safety and most particularly the cognitive effects of this association.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Included patients are adults, aged between 18 and 70 years, with major depression (Hamilton Rating scale for Depression, HAMD ≥ 15). Patients don't have any experience concerning repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were assigned to two treatment groups in addition to their current pharmacotherapy regimen : one group received 5 active-rTMS before Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and the other one received sham-rTMS before ECT. The depressive symptoms and the cognitive functions are evaluated before rTMS, after 5 rTMS and after 5 ECT.</detailed_description>
