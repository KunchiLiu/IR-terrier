	<brief_summary>Transcranial Doppler ultasonography is usually used in the evaluation and management of patients with cerebrovascular disease. This noninvasive method measures local blood flow velocity and direction in the proximal portions of large intracranial arteries. The operator requires a short training and experience to perfom. The third ventricle diameter measurement by transcranial duplex flow sonography was performed in healthy volunteers . This studies show similar results in those obtained with the MRI or Computer Tomography (CT). Currently the third ventricle diameter measurements by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was not validated for neuro-intensive care unit patients. The investigators propose to used recent ultrasound system to validate the third ventricle diameter measurements in comparaison with the standard method (CT).</brief_summary>
