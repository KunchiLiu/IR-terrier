	<brief_summary>The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disease in the pediatric population, where classical medical treatment does not always prove effective. This clinical entity has an impact on the individual physiological balance particularly on the autonomic regulation. Studies concerning adults with irritable bowel syndrome, showed significant changes in heart rate variability indices (HRV: heart rate variability). The study of time and frequency domain analysis of HRV allows noninvasive and reproducible assessment of the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. The investigators hypothesize that the sympathovagal balance could be altered in children in case of prolonged nociceptive stress as the investigators find it in IBS. In recent years, the control of pediatric pain experienced considerable growth through hypnosis techniques and several studies have shown analgesic efficacy with a beneficial effect in terms of quality of life in children. Our study aims to assess the impact of the hypno-analgesia treatment of IBS on sympathovagal balance. The investigators propose to realize in 7 to 18 years old children with IBS a single center prospective study to highlight after a standardized hypnosis program, changes in the time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability and clinical or quality of life parameters. The primary endpoint will be the high frequency HF indice. Secondary endpoints will be the other indices of HRV (Ptot, VLF, LF, ratio LF / HF, SDNN, SDANN, pNN50, RMSSD), the Quality of Life Questionnaire values (PedsQL â„¢ 4.0) a pain scale and the composite score of Francis.</brief_summary>
