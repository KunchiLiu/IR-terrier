	<brief_summary>Background: There are many endocrine and metabolic-related conditions. Two well-known disorders include diabetes and thyroid disease. Some of these diseases are caused by a change in genes. Researchers want to identify the genes involved in these disorders. They hope this will help them learn more about these diseases. Objectives: To learn more about conditions that affect the hormone-secreting glands (endocrine glands) in adults. To train doctors to diagnose and treat people with endocrine or metabolic conditions. Eligibility: Adults age 18 years and older with a known or suspected endocrine disorder. Relatives ages 18 years and older. Doctors will review all requests and available medical records to determine final eligibility for the protocol. Design: Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Most participants will have 1 visit, and may have follow up visits if necessary. They may have tests, surgery, or other procedures to help diagnose or treat their condition. These could include: - Blood, urine, and saliva tests - Imaging tests. These may include X-ray, ultrasound, or scans. - Sleep study - Medical photographs - Visits with other specialists at NIH Participants will provide blood, urine, saliva, or tissue samples. Some of these samples may be stored in the freezer for future studies. Participants may be asked to participate in genetic testing. They will give a blood or saliva sample for this.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Adults With Endocrine and Metabolic-Related Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol is designed to allow endocrine -related evaluations of adults with known or suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders. Adults with endocrine or metabolic-related condition(s) who may or may not be eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance the clinical skills of physicians participating in the Inter-Institute Internal Medicine Endocrine Fellowship Program (IIME) clinical research and training programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the adult participant may receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) according to current clinical practice. The overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to support our clinical training and research missions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants with known or suspected endocrine disorder age 18 years and older are eligible for this protocol. Protocol investigators will make the actual selection of patients most appropriate for clinical training. Relatives ages 18 years and older may be enrolled if clinically indicated for the diagnosis of a proband. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Anyone under the age of 18 years old Any medical, physical, psychiatric, or social conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in the best interest of the patient, will exclude participation. Patients who are critically ill, unstable, or with severe organ failure that may affect/limit the endocrine evaluation and place unsustainable demands on Clinical Center or NICHD resources will be excluded.</criteria>
