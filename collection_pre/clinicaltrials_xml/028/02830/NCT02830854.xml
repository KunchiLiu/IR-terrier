	<brief_summary>A variety of non-pharmacological interventions have been used in the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and similar cognitive disorders in elderly, yet no therapeutic modality has demonstrated conclusive positive results in terms of effectiveness. Although it is still unknown what triggers AD, recent studies have shown that AD is associated with brain energy depletion, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Since supplemental molecular hydrogen (H2) supports cell energy production and acts as a highly bioavailable mitochondria-related antioxidant, it may provide an ideal agent to facilitate treatment and perhaps prevention of AD and similar cognitive disorders in elderly. The overall hypothesis to be evaluated in this project is that administration of H2 will positively affect patient-reported outcomes and clinical biomarkers in men and women suffering from AD.</brief_summary>
