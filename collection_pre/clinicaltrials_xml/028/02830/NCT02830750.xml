	<brief_summary>Prospective data collection of patients undergoing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Fluoroscopy Afib Ablation Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinicians who have experience using low dose fluoroscopy including use of Carto Mapping system will consent patients to allow data collection and a 12 month f/up visit to track adverse events. Clinicians will follow a protocol which will be similar to their standard of care for ablations.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient meets accepted AHA/ACC/HRS guideline indications for catheter ablation of paroxysmal or persistent AF First or subsequent ablation procedures may be included Age 1875 Known venous malformations or implanted instrumentation (IVC filter) Known PV stenosis Unable to provide consent H/O mechanical mitral valve replacement (unable to rely on EA mapping only) Documented left atrial thrombus Prior ASD repair Pregnancy NYHA &gt;=3 EF less than 35% CHF within 90 daysRecent MI or coronary revascularization within 90 days NOTE: H/O implanted pacemaker or ICD with transvenous leads will NOT be an exclusion criteria, but we will track patients treated with preexisting transvenous leads with the hypothesis that although fluoroscopy use will be higher in these patients compared to those without leads, but still lower than conventionally treated patients. Patients who are undergoing non standard of care ablations ie, Cyro or FIRM ablations</criteria>
