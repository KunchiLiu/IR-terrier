	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with prostate cancer that is likely to come back or spread (high-risk) undergoing surgery. SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body. Delivering radiotherapy before prostatectomy by SBRT is more convenient, conformal, and may spare normal tissues better than delivering radiotherapy after prostatectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess feasibility of pre-operative stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in prostate cancer patients at high risk for recurrence after prostatectomy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety and acute toxicity of SBRT followed by prostatectomy. This will be based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and patient reported quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] and International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] questionnaires). II. Correlative biomarker and molecular analyses using the primary tumor specimen and serial blood draws before and after treatment. OUTLINE: Patients undergo 3 fractions of SBRT over 1-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy. After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed primary nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate Patient desires and is medically fit to undergo prostatectomy Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 70 Patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are allowed For confirmation of high risk local failure status, patients will have any one of the following: Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) or extraprostatic extension (EPE) within 1 year of enrollment into the study Prebiopsy prostatespecific antigen (PSA) &gt;= 20 Gleason score 710 (Gleason 7 must be 4+3), presence of any Gleason 5 (even if a tertiary score) as determined at diagnostic biopsy Gleason score 7 and &gt; 50% of biopsy cores positive for prostate cancer Clinical stage &gt;= T3 (staging by imaging acceptable) An imageguided biopsy (via Artemis Ultrasound with MRI coregistration) is encouraged but not required if not performed as standard of care biopsy Distant metastases, based upon: CT scan or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis within 120 days prior to registration and Bone scan within 120 days prior to registration; if the bone scan is suspicious, a plain xray and/or MRI must be obtained to rule out metastasis prior to registration Patient is unable or unwilling to sign consent Patient is considered lowrisk and would not have received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) outside of this study</criteria>
