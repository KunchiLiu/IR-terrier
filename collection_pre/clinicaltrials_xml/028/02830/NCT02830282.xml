	<criteria>Enrollment on the treatment phase of the ISPY 2 TRIAL Completed a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or assigned treatment on ISPY 2 and planning definitive surgical resection. Participants who have discontinued assigned treatment on ISPY 2, switched to standard of care, and have completed a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen are still considered eligible. Presurgical imaging or clinical examination demonstrating residual disease in the breast. Participants with any extent of enhancement attributable to tumor on the presurgical MRI are eligible. No minimum extent of palpable tumor presurgery is required. Willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood specimen collection per protocol specifications No clinical evidence of distant metastatic disease. Prechemotherapy staging scans are sufficient in the absence of any symptoms or subsequent clinical evidence suggesting distant metastases Age 18 or over and are able to give informed consent Individuals under the age of 18 Individuals who cannot understand and give informed consent. We will not be assessing decisional capacity; determination of ability to give informed consent will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Pregnancy. Participants in the parent ISPY 2 TRIAL are screened for pregnancy at enrollment and pregnancy is an exclusion criteria. No additional screening for pregnancy is required for participants enrolling on SURMOUNT. However if a study participant does become pregnant while on study or during the course of the 10 year followup, the study participant will remain on the study protocol and will not be withdrawn. Because this is an observational study and does not have a therapeutic component, there will be no increased risk to following a study participant through annual blood draws and medical information abstraction from the medical chart who may or may not become pregnant during the course of the followup period.</criteria>
