	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if using anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC or fluciclovine) PET scan will be useful in determining if participants are responding to chemotherapy treatment. Investigators will enroll participants whose cancer has been treated with hormone therapy and now the cancer is not responding to the treatment (Castration -resistant), and so therefore will be started on chemotherapy. Investigators will enroll thirty (30) participants in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FACBC Prostate Therapy Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the investigation is to examine therapeutic monitoring of chemotherapy in castrate resistant prostate carcinoma with anti-3-[18F]FACBC in prostate carcinoma to determine if anti-3-[18F]FACBC amino acid imaging can serve as an accurate and efficient imaging biomarker. Investigators will perform a baseline anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT of the whole body. All participants will also undergo conventional staging including 99mTc MDP bone scanning and cat scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of the abdomen and pelvis which are standard of care at the enrolling institution. This study will not interfere with standard patient evaluation or delay therapy. All 30 participants will receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Participants will undergo a repeat anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT after 1 and 4 cycles and also repeat conventional imaging including bone scanning CT or MR of the abdomen and pelvis after 4 cycles. At the end of the study, the study team will then record the response (or lack thereof) on anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT and correlate that response with response per standard clinical criteria including bone scan uptake for skeletal lesions, CT or MR for soft tissue and skeletal lesions, PSA progression or regression, and other clinical parameters such as declining performance status.</detailed_description>
