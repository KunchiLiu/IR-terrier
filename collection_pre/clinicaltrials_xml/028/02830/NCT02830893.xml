	<brief_summary>This study will test the effectiveness of a new lever drive wheelchair, LARA - Lever Actuated Resonance Assistance. LARA facilitates patients in performing a high amount of practice using their moderate to severely impaired upper extremity after stroke. Investigators will recruit 44 subjects with subacute strokes to participate in the study through the acute rehabilitation unit of the UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. Study participants will be randomized into 2 groups: LARA therapy group or standard therapy group. The LARA therapy group will use LARA to propel themselves to therapy appointments in the unit and to play video games with the affected upper extremity for 30 mins / day. The standard therapy group will use a standard wheelchair to propel themselves using their unaffected upper and lower extremities. They will be asked to perform a matched duration of standard arm exercises for 30 mins/ day. This program of standard arm exercises was developed by an OT at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago which consists of graded-difficulty table-supported exercises. This study will have 3 assessment visits: baseline, 3 weeks after therapy or upon discharge from the acute rehabilitation unit if sooner, and a 3-month follow up.</brief_summary>
