	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and palliative radiation therapy works in treating patients with esophagus, stomach, or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Palliative radiation therapy, such as external beam radiation therapy, uses high energy beams to treat symptoms that are caused by tumors. Giving pembrolizumab together with palliative radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with esophagus, stomach, or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Palliative Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Esophagus, Stomach, or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To establish that the combination of pembrolizumab and traditional external beam multifractionated radiation therapy (RT) to the primary tumor or a single target metastatic site of patients with metastatic gastric, esophageal, and/or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers will lead to an increase in tumor infiltrating cytotoxic T-cells and circulating cytotoxic T cells and a reduction in immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in metastatic sites. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish that the combination of pembrolizumab and RT is feasible in the patient population and evaluate toxicities per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (ver.) 4.03. II. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune related (ir)RECIST in this treatment population and correlate with tumor T-cell response. III. To evaluate progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this treatment population. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure changes in whole genome serum micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) signature before and after protocol therapy and correlate with tumor/immune/stromal cell miRNA expression profiling determined by deep sequencing. OUTLINE: INITIAL TREATMENT: Patients undergo palliative external beam RT daily. On day 1, patients undergo the first RT fraction and then receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SECOND PHASE: Patients who achieve a complete response, stop study treatment, and then experience radiographic disease progression may be eligible for the second phase at the discretion of the investigator if no cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab and trial eligibility safety parameters are met. Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for 1 year, and then every 9 and 12 weeks for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
