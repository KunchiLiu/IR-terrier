	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the effects of hazelnuts, cocoa, and the combination of both on vascular reactivity and metabolic profile. Participants, divided in six groups, will receive one of these breakfast integrations for 14 days: group 1) 30 g peeled hazelnuts; group 2) 30 g unpeeled hazelnuts; group 3) snack with 30 g peeled hazelnuts; group 4) snack with 2.5 g cocoa powder; group 5) snack with 30 g peeled hazelnuts and 2.5 g cocoa; group 6) empty snack, control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Hazelnuts and Cocoa on Metabolic Parameters and Vascular Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last few years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased in all age groups. The European Food Safety Authority stated "cocoa flavanols help maintain endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which contributes to normal blood flow". Several studies reported that a daily consumption of hazelnuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate a beneficial effect of hazelnut and cocoa diet integrations on vascular reactivity and endocrine-metabolic parameters.</detailed_description>
