	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the post cystectomy CD8+ tumor response of patients receiving Nivolumab plus Urelumab versus Nivolumab alone. Half the patients will receive Nivolumab plus Urelumab, while the other half will receive Nivolumab alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Nivolumab With and Without Urelumab in Patients With Cisplatin-Ineligible Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is phase II clinical trial design randomizing patients with cisplatin-ineligible MIBC (stages T2-T4, N0-1, M0) to one of two treatment arms: Arm A - Nivolumab in combination with Urelumab or Arm B - Nivolumab monotherapy. The study population will include male and female patients over the age of 18 with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (MIBC) who are not suitable for cisplatin-based chemotherapy, but are fit to undergo surgical resection of their cancer by cystectomy. Patients with resectable clinical node positive disease within the true pelvis (N1) are eligible.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ineligible to receive cisplatinbased neoadjuvant chemotherapy based upon at least one of the following criteria: Creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min ECOG status =2 Grade &gt; 2 hearing loss Grade &gt; 2 neuropathy New York Heart Association Class III heart failure Age ≥ 18 years old at time of consent Patients must have the following laboratory values: a) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 (must be stable off any growth factor within 4 weeks of first study drug administration) b) Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3 (transfusion to achieve this level is not permitted within 2 weeks of first study drug administration) c) Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL d) Serum total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x ULN e) ALT and AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN f) Serum creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min using the CockcroftGault equation, see formula below: CrCl = [140age (years)] x weight (kg) / [72 x serum Cr (mg/dL)] (if patient is female multiply the above by 0.85) Patients who give a written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines Patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma as assessed on baseline radiographic imaging obtained within 28 days prior to study registration. The required radiographic imaging includes: a) Abdomen/Pelvis CT scan b) Chest chest xray or CT scan Patients with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) invasive urothelial carcinoma. Patients with another active second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers and biochemical relapsed prostate cancer Patients who have received the last administration of an anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy Patients who have received prior therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiLAG3, antiCTLA4) or immune costimulatory molecules (e.g. antiCD137, antiOX40, antiGITR) directed agents. Patients who have had radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from radiotherapy toxicities Patients who have undergone major surgery (e.g. intrathoracic, intraabdominal or intrapelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had minor procedures (i.e. TURBT), percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury Patients with history of alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), autoimmune hepatitis, or previous grade 34 drugrelated hepatitis. Patient with history of prior solid organ or allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Patients with any of the following concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study: 1. Clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of the following: i. History or presence of serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias ii.Clinically significant resting bradycardia iii.Any of the following within 3 months prior to starting study drug: myocardial infarction (MI), severe/unstable angina, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), Pulmonary Embolism (PE) iv.Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg, with or without antihypertensive medication(s) b) Cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis c) Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV testing is not mandatory) d) Known diagnosis of any condition (i.e. posthematopoietic or organ transplant, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Usage of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDS) for the treatment of osteoarthritis and uric acid synthesis inhibitors for the treatment of gout are permitted. For questions, please consult the study chair. e) Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g. active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol Pregnant or breastfeeding women Women of childbearing potential, who are biologically able to conceive, and not employing two forms of highly effective contraception. Highly effective contraception must be used throughout the trial and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug (e.g. male condom with spermicidal; diaphragm with spermicide; intrauterine device). Women of childbearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 days prior to starting study drug Fertile males not willing to use contraception, as stated above Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol</criteria>
