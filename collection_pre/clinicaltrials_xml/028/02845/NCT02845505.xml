	<brief_summary>The aims of this study are 1) to identify IVUS determinants of the CAMS-derived myocardial territories subtended to the diseased vessels, 2) to find IVUS determinant for the extent of CAMS-derived myocardial size, and 3) to develop the mathematical model that integrates the IVUS information about myocardial territory and stenosis severity and predicts the extent of CAMS-derived myocardial size.</brief_summary>
