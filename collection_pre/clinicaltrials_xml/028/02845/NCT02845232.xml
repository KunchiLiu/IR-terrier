	<brief_summary>Blood transfusion requirement represents one of the most significant cost driver associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition to an increase prevalence of co morbidities in older patients, AML in older patients is more often associated with adverse features than in younger adults. Physicians might therefore decide to offer palliative or supportive care rather than intensive chemotherapy. An alternative treatment could be low-intensity therapy, such as LD-AraC or hypomethylating agents, which demonstrated better results than only Best Supportive care (BSC). Blood transfusion requirement represents one of the most significant cost driver associated with AML. The present study assesses the cost-effectiveness of intensive chemotherapy versus Best Supportive Care (BSC) versus alternative therapies (hypomethylating agents, low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LD-AraC), or other investigational drugs) in elderly patients aged 70 years or older regarding blood product transfusions from a French payer perspective. Intensive chemotherapy and BSC were the comparators in this analysis, since they continue to represent the most commonly used treatment for elderly AML according to the defined status of patients considered as 'fit' or 'unfit' for intensive chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
