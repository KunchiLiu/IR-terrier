	<brief_title>Study of Fecal Bacteria in Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gut microbiota is closely related to human gut neoplasm. According to recent statistics, the abundance of FN (Fusobacterium Nucleatum) is connected with the development and progression of CRCs (colorectal cancers). Subsequent research shows identifying multiple microbial-specific genes in human feces using qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) may help diagnosis of early stage colorectal cancer. Currently little is known about the relationship between single abundance of specific gut microbiota and colorectal cancer in different stage. Moreover, finding early-stage CRCs is still of great challenge partially due to precancerous diseases like colorectal adenoma which remain difficult to differentiate from early-stage CRC under endoscope. Conventional clinic methods predicting CRCs largely depend on serum CEA (serum Carcino Embryonic Antigen) and OB(fecal occult blood test), which lack of adequate sensitivity and specificity especially in early stage CRCs. The investigators' work focuses on the abundance of gut microbiota in feces from people with colon neoplasm and its comparison with classical indicators such as CEA and OB, aiming to reveal and testify its potential role on assisting diagnosis of CRCs in different stage as a none-invasive cost-effective method.</detailed_description>
