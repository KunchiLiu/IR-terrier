	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this study is to test the effect of academic detailing (i.e. provider-level educational intervention focused on evidence-based smoking cessation treatment for those with psychiatric illness), alone or in combination with practical support from a community health worker, on the provision and utilization of standard of care smoking cessation treatment to those with serious mental illness (SMI). Further, this study will determine if these interventions improve smoking cessation rates for adults with SMI who smoke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Smoking Cessation Treatment for Smokers With Serious Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators aim to test whether a provider-level educational intervention in the form of targeted, practical, action-oriented education to primary care physicians and nurses on safety and effectiveness of and how to use evidence-based smoking cessation treatment for those with psychiatric illness, termed academic detailing (AD), alone or in combination with practical support offered to the primary care physician / primary care team and the smoker with SMI in the form of a community health worker (CHW) will improve recommendation and utilization of standard of care smoking cessation treatments to and by those with SMI and, if so, whether the intervention improves smoking cessation rates for adults with SMI who smoke. To do so, the investigators will randomize primary care clinics that serve approximately 1300 adult smokers with SMI who receive psychiatric rehabilitation services, Community Based Flexible Support (CBFS) or Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)), from the two largest providers of these services in the Boston area to either receive AD for their prescribers or not in a cluster randomized design. Half of the smokers with SMI in the study who receive primary care at the clinics assigned to the AD intervention to providers will be randomly assigned to be offered CHW support in addition to their ongoing psychiatric rehabilitation (CBFS or ACT) services.</detailed_description>
