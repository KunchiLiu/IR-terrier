	<brief_summary>The investigators' research is aimed at developing more effective, finite approaches for managing individual patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This prospective clinical and basic scientific study exclusively focuses on patients with the early antigen negative form of disease, which in developed countries is treated indefinitely with antiviral drugs. The investigators' study "BeNEG-DO," directly offers patients who are already taking standard oral Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 192 weeks the option to stop or continue treatment. Drawing on data from pilot studies, including the investigators' own University of California, San Francisco and Sutter Institutional Review Board-approved study, the investigators will examine a finite HBV treatment strategy on clinical outcome and safety. In conjunction, the investigators will study immunologic mechanisms and gene expression profiles that correlate with and predict the post-treatment clinical course. The BeNEG-DO study could seriously question, and potentially change, the current treatment paradigm for millions of patients with CHB and also lead to new disease-terminating antiviral therapeutics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The "HBV eAg- Disease-Directly Offers" Study: Treatment Withdrawal in Patients With Early-Antigen Negative Chronic HBV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective case-control study of safety and clinical outcomes, and of innate and adaptive immune responses and their genetic predictors, in adult human subjects with HBeAg-CHB who either continue or stop nucleoside or nucleotide analog (NA) antiviral therapy. Immune responses will be studied using liver tissue and serial peripheral blood samples. The immunological factors selected have been chosen based on preliminary and inferential evidence. Immunologic findings will be correlated with different serologic, virologic and biochemical outcomes. Genetic predictors of the type of response and respective clinical outcomes will also be sought.</detailed_description>
