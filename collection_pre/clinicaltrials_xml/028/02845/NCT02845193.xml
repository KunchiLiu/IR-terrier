	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to figure out the efficiency of modified Grayson NAM on parents' satisfaction, nasal esthetics, interlabial gap and maxillary arch changes. NAM might improve and facilitate the surgical procedure after lip closure. This might decrease the need of further interventions to improve esthetics and function of CLP patients. This trial will help the patients and practitioners in taking the decision of inclusion of NAM in the CLP treatment protocol as a mandatory step or skip a useless procedure with all of its burden.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency of Novel Nasoalveolar Molding Method on Parents' Satisfaction in Unilateral Cleft Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized trial, 3 groups will be included. The first group will receive a modified nasoalveolar molding appliance in addition to taping. In the second group, the patient will receive tape only, while the third group will remain untreated. the follow-up period will be 3 months till surgical lip closure. the assessment will be through a questionnaire for the parents' satisfaction outcome, photographs for nasal esthetics and interlabial gap outcome and maxillary models for the maxillary dimension change outcome.</detailed_description>
