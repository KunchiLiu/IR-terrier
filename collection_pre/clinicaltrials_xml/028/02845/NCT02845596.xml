	<brief_title>Unrelated Donor Transplant Versus Immune Therapy in Pediatric Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major challenge in treating pediatric Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) is the determination of best primary therapy for patients who lack a fully matched related donor for HSCT. Good survival outcomes have been seen with IST, but initial and late failures, CSA dependence, persistent cytopenias and secondary Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) / Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in a portion of patients leave considerable room for improvement. MUD HSCT survival in SAA has markedly improved, but a direct comparison of this approach with IST is necessary to determine whether this approach is feasible and will lead to better Event Free Survival. This trial will address the feasibility of randomization, test whether patients can be evaluated in a timely fashion and safely begin therapy with MUD HSCT or IST, and give a preliminary assessment of the safety of up-front MUD HSCT. If successful, this trial will lead to a future prospective trial comparing directly IST to MUD HSCT in this disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic SAA, defined as: Bone marrow cellularity &lt;25%, or &lt;30% hematopoietic cells and central pathology review consistent with SAA (see laboratory manual of procedures). Two out of three of the following (in peripheral blood): neutrophils &lt;0.5 x109/L, platelets &lt;20 x109/L, reticulocyte count &lt;60 x109/L with hemoglobin &lt;8g/dL. 2. Age ≤25 years old. 3. No suitable fully matched related donor available (minimum 6/6 match for Human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) A and B at intermediate or high resolution and DRB1 at high resolution using DNA based typing). 4. Unrelated donor or donors noted on National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) search who are well matched (9/10 or 10/10 for HLAA, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 using high resolution). See section 2.5.1 for details on central confirmation of the availability of donors required. 5. Signed informed consent for the randomized trial by patient and/or legal guardian. 6. Adequate organ function defined as in the judgment of the investigator, there is not irreversible organ damage that would preclude the patient from meeting the organ function inclusion criteria for HSCT listed in section 2.3.4 by the intended time of HSCT (68 weeks after randomization) or preclude patients from receiving horse ATG. 1. Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). The diagnosis of Fanconi anemia must be excluded by diepoxybutane (DEB) or equivalent testing on peripheral blood or marrow. Dyskeratosis congenita must be excluded by testing of telomere length,Shwachman Diamond syndrome must be excluded by testing serum trypsinogen in patients age &lt;3 or or isoamylase for children ≥3 (see section 4.2.3.1 for details of the required evaluations to exclude IBMFS). 2. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities or fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) pattern consistent with premyelodysplastic syndrome (preMDS) or MDS on marrow examination (see section 4.2.3.1 for details of the required MDS FISH panel). 3. Known severe allergy to horse ATG. 4. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. 5. Prior solid organ transplant. 6. Seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 7. Active Hepatitis B or C determined by serology and/or NAT. 8. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 9. Prior malignancies except resected basal cell carcinoma or treated cervical carcinoma in situ.</criteria>
