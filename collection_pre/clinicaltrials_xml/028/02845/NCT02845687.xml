	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to conduct an observational assessment of natural outcomes within the DSCP, "Quit at Duke." This is an observational study (n=3000) on patients being treated at the DSCP. No interventions are conducted, and data analyzed is collected in the course of clinical care at clinic visits to the Duke Smoking Cessation Program (DSCP). Phone calls are also conducted to determine response to medications and abstinence status up to 12 months following a quit attempt. Outcomes of variables including: demographic variables, evaluation responses, feasibility data, and abstinence rates will be analyzed using general regression models using an ANOVA-based design.
