	<brief_summary>The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study of patients undergoing CPR for cardiac arrest in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of 12 academic teaching hospitals in Iran from August 1, 2016 to February 31, 2017. The intervention and control groups were labeled group 1 and 2 respectively. The assessment tool was scored by the principle investigator and an ICU nurse. The data analyzer was blinded to group randomization and was not present during CPR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardio First Angle Device Effect on the CPR Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective chest compression remains the cornerstone of successful CPR and is vital for survival and good neurological recovery. Proper compression force and depth is important to minimize CPR-associated injuries. A number of CPR-adjunct devices have been developed to improve the consistency and quality of manual chest compression. The investigators sought to determine if the addition of a CPR feedback device to routine manual CPR would impact the quality and consistency of CPR and patient survival. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard manual CPR or CPR using the Cardio First Angel TM CPR feedback device. Recorded variables included return of spontaneous circulation, adherence to CPR guidelines and quality of CPR, nurse satisfaction and CPR associated morbidity.</detailed_description>
