With at least 12 consecutive months since the last spontaneous menstrual bleeding (if there was any uncertainty of the time of the last spontaneous bleeding, the postmenopausal status is to be confirmed with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 40 mIU/mL) Body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 29.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) Considered to be generally healthy based on the medical history, physical examination, and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests performed during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator Smoker (defined as a subject who is smoking at least one cigarette or the equivalent per day). A subject smoking less than one cigarette or the equivalent per day must be able or willing to refrain from smoking and use of nicotine substitute products during the trial Any blood draw in excess of 25 mL in the past 30 days, or donation of blood or plasma in excess of 400 mL within the 90 days preceding screening Sitting blood pressure at screening (after resting for at least 5 minutes) outside the range of 90139 mmHg for systolic or 5089 mmHg for diastolic. If whitecoat hypertension is suspected a single repeat measurement is allowed, last measurement being conclusive History of major surgical procedures involving the stomach potentially affecting absorption of trial product (e.g. subtotal and total gastrectomy, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery)</criteria>
