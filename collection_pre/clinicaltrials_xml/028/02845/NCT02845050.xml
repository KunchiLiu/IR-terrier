	<criteria>1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years with legal capacity 2. Signed written informed consent 3. Histologically confirmed muscleinvasive urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder (MIBC) with clinical T2T4a (N0/Nx, M0) assessed by primary PDDguided TURB and by the screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 4. Confirmed adequate complete resection of all visible tumor during TURB according to current treatment guidelines before registration; the latest TURB must have been done ≤ 8 weeks before registration 5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 6. Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions as evidenced by the following: Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 2,000 mm3 and ≤ 7,500 mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL for the safety phase of the study; if the study treatment proved to be adequate tolerated during this safety phase, the threshold can be lowered to ≥ 10 g/dL according to the decision of the study steering committee Platelet count ≥ 100,000 mm3 Serum albumin within normal range Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Transaminases (ALT, AST) ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min, calculated based on a 24hmeasured creatinine clearance Serum Urea &lt; 25 mg/100 ml 7. Absence of psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; these conditions should be assessed with the patient before registration 8. Electrocardiogram (ECG) without modifications that suggest a high risk of occurrence of an acute clinical event (such as signs of angina pectoris or highrisk arrhythmia, etc.); cardiologist consultation is required, if relevant abnormalities are observed in the screening ECGassessment 1. Prior systemic chemotherapy for any kind of malignancy; prior intravesical chemotherapy or treatment with BCG is allowed 2. Prior radiation of the pelvis or any prior radiation to ≥ 30 % of the bone marrow 3. Evidence of lymph node (N+) or distant metastasis (M1) in the screening MRI assessment, including known brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement (however, brainMRIscans are not required to rule out CNSinvolvement, unless there is clinical suspicion of central nervous system (CNS) disease) 4. Other malignancies except adequately treated basal carcinoma of the skin, localized prostate cancer Gleason ≤ 6, insitu cervix carcinoma or any other tumor with a disease free interval ≥ 5 years 5. Peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥ 2 NCI CTCAE v4.03 or hearing impairment Grade ≥ 2 NCI CTCAE v.4.03 6. Any concurrent chronic system immune therapy or previous organ allograft 7. Weight loss &gt; 5 % within the last 3 months before registration 8. Any other serious illness or medical condition including: Infection requiring systemic antiinfective therapy within the last 2 weeks before registration History of cardiovascular disease that might compromise the safe administration of cisplatin Dehydration requiring IV fluid substitution Any medical condition that might not be controlled, e.g. patients with unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months before registration or uncontrolled diabetes, congestive cardiac failure &gt; NYHA grade I 9. Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs or to drugs with similar chemical structures 10. Treatment with any potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or inductor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, rifampicine) or phenytoine; replacement of such treatment with alternative treatment options before start of study treatment is acceptable, if medically feasible and ethically acceptable 11. Treatment with hexamethylmelamin, pyridoxine, penicillamine or any other drug with known potential to affect the efficacy of cisplatin 12. Treatment with any other investigational or anticancer therapy ≤ 30 days before registration 13. Pregnant or lactating female patients or female patients of childbearing potential with positive pregnancy test at screening 14. Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 6 months after the study 15. Sexually active fertile men not using effective birth control during the study and up to 6 months after the study if their partners are women of childbearing potential</criteria>
