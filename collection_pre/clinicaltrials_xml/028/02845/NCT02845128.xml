This is a second part of the initial study PF(AG)101/2011 where the investigators created the ROX index to predict the need of failure with HFNC treatment in patients with ARF secondary to pneumonia, and the investigators want to validate ROX index with this second prospective cohort results.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a second part of the initial study PF(AG)101/2011 where the investigators created the ROX index to predict the need of failure with HFNC treatment in patients with ARF secondary to pneumonia, and the investigators want to validate ROX index with this second prospective cohort results. The investigators are now recruiting a second cohort of patients prospectively in order to analyse results and validate ROX index.</detailed_description>
