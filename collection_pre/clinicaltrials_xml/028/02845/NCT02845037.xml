	<detailed_description>Single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses in 10 sequential groups of 8 healthy young male volunteers. Within each group (n=8), 6 volunteers were randomised to receive BIA 5-453 and the remaining 2 volunteers were randomised to receive placebo. A volunteer participated only in a single period.</detailed_description>
