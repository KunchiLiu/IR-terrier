	<brief_summary>Measurements of dysphagia severity are important when making management decisions and in the objective evaluation of swallowing impairments. The Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) is a validated self-report inventory using a visual analogue scale. This questionnaire permits a quantitative, sensitive, specific, repeatable and easily responsive evaluation of dysphagia in different pathology. Opposed to largely used videofluoroscopy swallowing study and endoscopy examinations, the SSQ is noninvasive, less expensive, avoids radiation exposure and enables a readily available assessment. Validated French version is not yet available. In the first phase of the study the investigators will validated this translation in dysphagic patients and control. Secondly, the investigators will validate the SSQ in Neuromuscular patients.</brief_summary>
