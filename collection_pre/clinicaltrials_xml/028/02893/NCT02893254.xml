	<brief_summary>Study of the efficacy and safety of IBI303 compared with adalimumab in adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to or who are intolerant to one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of IBI303 in Adult Patients With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adults patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) or IBI303, given subcutaneously (SC), in the 24-week double-blind (DB) phase. Randomized participants received one SC injection of the appropriate DB study medication (adalimumab 40 mg or IBI303) at Week 0 and then eow until Week 22. A follow-up visit occurred 70 days(Week 32) after the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any ongoing or new adverse events (AEs).</detailed_description>
