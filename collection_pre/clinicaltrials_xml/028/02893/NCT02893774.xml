	<brief_summary>Generally, French studies concerned with the quality of life of cancer patients focus on the period of treatment (up to 2 years post diagnosis). However, studies about quality of life "after" cancer are relatively rare (= long-term quality of life, or from 5 years post diagnosis). These studies mainly concern the most common cancers (breast and prostate). Or changes in quality of life after treatment could be different depending on the type of cancer. In addition, there is a significant influence of sociodemographic variables on the quality of life in remission. Similarly using remote diagnostics, quality of life questionnaires related to health, must be reassessed because too often developed for situations in process. Based on these findings, "ELCCA II" study proposes to study for five years, the evolution of the impacts of two types of cancer (breast and melanoma) on quality of life (overall and related to the subjective health), socioeconomic status, and behavioral and emotional dimensions (post-traumatic development, coping, anxiety-depression) of those treated.</brief_summary>
