	<brief_summary>Prospective study aiming to measure central ablation depth during excimer laser surgery in myopic patients operated with femtosecond laser assisted LASIK with intraoperative OCP, before and after laser ablation. This measurement will be compared with pre and 1 month postoperative topography differential pachymetric measurements.</brief_summary>
