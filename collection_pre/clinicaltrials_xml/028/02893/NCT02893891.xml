	<brief_summary>Literature data clearly demonstrate that treatment of obese patients is very expensive, long and achieve weight loss may not be permanent, and regardless of whether the treatment dominated diet therapy, physical activity, or pharmacotherapy. Experience of the last decade has shown that after surgical interventional treatment of obesity occurs not only long-term (10 years and over) weight loss of 35-40%, but also an important endocrine changes. In recent years, it was discovered a number of signaling molecules produced by adipose tissue, whose physiological significance beyond the general metabolic aspects organism. The fat is therefore currently understood as an endocrine organ whose hormones modulate the function of many systems, including the skeleton. These hormones include the adipokines that modulate metabolism skeleton as at tissue level (Leptin, Adiponectin) and indirectly - by activation of neurohumoral hypothalamic centers - Leptin. Studying endocrine interactions between adipose tissue and bone is a highly topical issue. This mutual communication is a homeostatic feedback system in which adipokines and molecules secreted by osteoblasts and osteoclasts are the connecting link active axes fat - bone tissue. However, the mechanisms of this axis remain largely unknown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Changes After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is an important medical problem. The number of obese individuals is increasing continuously in response to various environmental and genetic factors. For some morbidly obese patients, surgery is the only effective type of therapy. Despite bariatric surgery having good outcomes in terms of weight loss, it is associated with some adverse effects: several studies have reported subsequent alterations in bone metabolism. Of the surgical techniques available (laparoscopic gastric banding, Roux-en-Y bypass, biliopancreatic diversion), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the technique of choice. Because restrictive procedures such as LSG do not involve bypassing segments of small bowel where micronutrient absorption takes place, fewer metabolic disturbances are expected than with other surgical techniques. The observed changes in bone metabolism and status in post-bariatric surgery patients potentially involve several mechanisms, including reduced absorption of essential nutrients, diminished calcium absorption leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism, poor vitamin D absorption and restricted energy delivery. In addition, body weight protects against osteoporosis via the bone-strengthening effects of long-term weight bearing. However, long-term decreases in bone mineral density in patients who have undergone successful bariatric surgery are an unexpected, negative effect of this type of therapy. In the study, parameters of fat and bone tissue and body composition changes are assessed in groups of bariatric patients after LSG, gastric plication and intragastric balloon treatment. Other anticipated benefits of the study treatment include improving the quality of life of. lt will also lead to the introduction of new processes, materials and methods. lt is also possible to expect shortening of the hospital stay, decrease in postoperative morbidity, and the possibility to perform the procedure on an outpatient basis. The study has been designed as a prospective study, which is in conformity with the principles and guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, good clinical practice and has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava. The patients enrolled in the study are followed for the period of twelve months. Timetable of the study procedures and controls: Preoperative examination: - Demographic data on age, sex, weight, height, smoking - Assessment of body composition and sampling of blood - Questionnaires for quality of Life Examination 3 months postoperatively - Assessment of body composition and sampling of blood - Questionnaires for quality of Life Examination 6 months after surgery - Assessment of body composition and sampling of blood - Questionnaires for quality of Life Examination 12 months after surgery - Assessment of body composition and sampling of blood - Questionnaires for quality of Life Statistical data processing for statistical evaluation descriptive statistics are used (arithmetical average, standard deflection, frequency tables), X2 test, Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), calculating of the OR (odds ratio) with 95 % confidence intervals, and logistic regression. Statistical tests are evaluated at the significance level of 5%. Statistical analysis is performed in the "Stata 10" programme. Program EpiData is used for data collection.</detailed_description>
