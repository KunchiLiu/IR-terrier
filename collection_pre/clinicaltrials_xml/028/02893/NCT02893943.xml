	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential of probiotics on weight management. It is hypothesized that the consumption of 1 capsule of probiotics daily will modulate the intestinal gut microbiota thereby reducing body weight and fat compared to those who do not consume probiotics. In addition, a diet supplemented with probiotics can be expected to be more beneficial than a diet without probiotic supplementation in impacting biomarkers of obesity-associated disorders including diabetes, hypertension and CVD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Probiotics on Weight Control and Body Composition in Overweight and Obese Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight, obese men and women volunteers aged between 18-65 yrs with BMI greater than or equal to 25 will be recruited from the Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) area to participate in a two arm crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, free-living intervention study for 60 days per study period following obtainment of informed consent. Participants will be informed to maintain their usual diets as well as their physical activity level. After obtaining consent, participants will be randomized to receive either 1 capsule containing probiotics, or 1 capsule of placebo daily for 60 days. Compared with the probiotic capsules, the placebo contains the same carrier material and is similar in size, shape and taste.</detailed_description>
