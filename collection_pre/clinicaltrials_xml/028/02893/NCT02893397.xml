	<brief_title>Pre-Surgical Supervised Exercise for Bone Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups If they agree to take part in this study, they will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on their availability and if they live within 25 miles of MD Anderson: - If they are in Group 1, they will take part in a supervised exercise program. - If they are in Group 2, they will not take part in the exercise program. Length of Study Participation No matter which group they are in, their participation in this study will be over after they complete their chemotherapy and before surgery. Study Visits For All Participants: At the Beginning of the Study: They will have an MRI to check the status of the disease. They will have a physical test. Depending on their health, they will have a 6-minute walk test or a 6-minute arm test. If they will do the 6-minute walk test, they will be timed for 6 minutes to see how far they can walk on a course that is set up near or in the clinic. If they will do the 6-minute arm test, they will exercise their arms for 6 minutes using an upper body ergometer (UBE) which is much like pedaling a bike. After their First Round of Chemotherapy: They will have the same physical test as before. After 5-6 Weeks into Chemotherapy: They will have an MRI to check the status of the disease. Right Before Surgery: They will have an MRI to check the status of the disease. They will have the same physical test as before. For Group 1 Only: They will be asked to exercise with a physical therapist at least 3 times a week throughout their chemotherapy (10-12 weeks). They will be offered the chance to exercise up to 5 times a week. They will take part in each exercise session for 40 minutes unless they are unable to complete it. What they will do at each session will be based on their abilities and the physical therapist may give them a few physical tests to see what is best for them. During each session, they will use either a stationary bicycle or a UBE for up to 20 minutes. Following a brief rest break, they will be asked to perform 10 minutes of upper and/or lower body stretching and strengthening exercises. Finally, they will have 10 minutes of an activity based exercise session, such as using a Nintendo Wii, dribbling a basketball, shooting a basketball into a hoop, a bean bag toss, or other light physical activities. They or the physical therapist may stop the exercises at any time if they have severe pain or symptoms. While they are exercising, they will wear a small device called a portal pulse oximeter. This will measure their blood pressure, their heart rate, and how much oxygen is in their blood. They will also be asked questions about any pain they may be having and how tired they are. It should take about 10-15 minutes to complete the questionnaire. For Group 2 Only: They will be asked to keep a log of their weekly activity, including how often they were active and for how long. Physical activity includes any activity that works their muscles and requires more energy than resting (such as house chores, walking, biking, and outdoor play).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must be equal to or greater than 5 years of age and less than 31 years of age at the time of enrollment 2. Patients must have a new diagnosis of Osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma of bone. 3. Both male and female patients are eligible 4. Patients who are receiving treatment according to Children Oncology Group (COG) studies will be enrolled. 1. Patients who are not receiving their primary cancer care and chemotherapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center 2. Patients who have a cognitive disorder which impacts the ability to follow directions or adhere to safety rules. This will be determined by the physical therapist by assessing whether a neurological disorder or musculoskeletal disorder would prevent the patient from safely exercising. 3. Patients who have a neurological or structural disorder which would impact use of exercise equipment. This will be determined by the physical therapist by assessing whether a neurological disorder or musculoskeletal disorder would prevent the patient from safely exercising. 4. Any patient who, in the opinion of the investigators, will be unable to comply with a supervised exercise regimen based on their developmental stage 5. Any concurrent comorbid illness and/or infection which in the opinion of the investigators could make the patient an inappropriate subject for the above trial</criteria>
