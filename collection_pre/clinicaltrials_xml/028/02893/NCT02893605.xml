	<brief_summary>This is a case-control study performed on a biological collection. The polymorphisms present on a pre-defined list of genes will be studied for 400 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (sporadic type) DNA samples and 400 control DNA samples.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The primary inclusion criterium is the same for that of the parent biological collection, i.e. the patients fulfill requirements for probable or definite Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis as defined by revised international criteria (Brooks et al 2000). Additionally, included patients were followedup by doctors at the University Hospital of Montpellier, thus enabling verification of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis criteria over time. The patient has a familial form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (autosomic dominant or recessive types) with or without a mutation of one of the 3 genes known to be responsible for familial forms (SOD1, TARDBP, FUS). See Bender (1998).</criteria>
