	<detailed_description>A mixed method approach (qualitative approach and quantitative approach) will be used to investigate surgeons, as well as gastroenterologists and radiologists who perform invasive procedures and gastroenterologists and radiologists who do not perform invasive procedures. The qualitative approach will rely on face-to face interviews with purposively sampled physicians of the 5 groups and will be continued until saturation. The quantitative approach will rely on a questionnaire that will be sent to physicians of the 5 groups.</detailed_description>
