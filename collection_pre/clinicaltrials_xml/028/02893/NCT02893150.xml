	<brief_summary>Mindfulness has been applied in the United States and Europe to improve both physical and psychological health, however, it is still poorly studied in Brazil. Mindfulness, or its lack, may also have particular relevance to obesity and eating disorders, reducing the episodes of "binge eating", which are partly responsible for weight regain for many people, and improving the eating behavior in order to promote awareness of emotional states which distort the physiological signals generated by the process. The hypothesis is that Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBI) as well as specific programmes focused on conscious eating, as Mindfulness Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-EAT) can, in short time, and in a sustainable fashion, improve biochemical, psychometric and anthropometric parameters in primary care patients with overweight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness Intervention for Overweight Primary Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized-controlled trial will be conducted to compare treatment-as-usual (TAU) in Primary Care combined a generic MBI (with 8 sessions) developed by our research group, called "Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion" (MBHP) program versus TAU plus MB-EAT. It will be included women aged ≥18 and &lt; 60, literate , with a BMI (body mass index) ≥ 25 kg/m2. The primary outcome is the improvement of the eating behaviour measured by DEBQ. Secondary outcomes are: It is expected improvement of nutritional status (reduction of body weight by at least 5% of the weight) along the intervention, as well as maintenance of this (without weight regain) which could lead to the prevention of multiple morbidities related to excess body weight. Will be assessed the levels of Mindfulness, stress, anxiety (psychometric scale and serum cortisol) and self-compassion. There will be performed basal (baseline), at post-intervention, 3 and 6 months follow-up measurements. The control group will receive the intervention that has been shown to be more effective at the end of the study (MBHP or MB-EAT).</detailed_description>
