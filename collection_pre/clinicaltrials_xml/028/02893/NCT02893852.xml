	<brief_title>Effects of CO-OP Approach on Activity and Participation of Brazilian Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children with difficulty performing activities that reflect negatively on participation can meet the criteria for Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), which might impact their lives, leading to social isolation, depression and anxiety. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of different intervention approaches, including process-oriented approaches that focus on enhancing body functions and structures to improve performance on functional tasks. Although pediatric occupational therapists have traditionally used such approaches, evidence strongly suggests effectiveness for task-oriented interventions that focus on the performance of tasks that the child finds difficult to do. Among these, CO-OP Approach showed strong treatment effects. In CO-OP Approach, therapists use mediational techniques to teach cognitive strategies to improve occupational performance in goals chosen by the children. There is a need to examine systematic intervention alternatives for Brazilian children with DCD, and only one study examined occupational therapy intervention strategies for children with DCD. The main purpose of the study is to examine the effects of two intervention models based on CO-OP Approach. The investigators will examine if a boosting on parent's engagement in CO-OP can improve skill acquisition, generalization and transfer in children with DCD. A pre-post design will be used and two groups will be included in this study (1) one receiving standard CO-OP Approach, (2) one receiving standard CO-OP Approach and an addition of coaching sessions in groups for parents. Follow-up data will be collected 3 months later.</detailed_description>
