	<brief_summary>This is a single center, randomized controlled trial which will include women with ischemic heart disease to receive either a self-directed stress reduction program delivered through a smart-phone application or activity tracking only for the first month ("early SR intervention" and "delayed SR intervention", respectively). Patients will be monitored for 1 month for application use and step counts via telephone or email interview and/or collection of screen-captured data. Baseline questionnaires will be repeated at the end of one month to assess for all primary and secondary measures, at which time the control group (activity tracking only) will be introduced to the intervention program. The early SR intervention group will not receive a new intervention but will be encouraged to continue using the app. Data will be collected for an additional 2 months with all participants in both groups. After the three-month study period, the study will close with the collection of final questionnaire data.</brief_summary>
