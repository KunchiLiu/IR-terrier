	<brief_summary>Eligible patients will receive escalating doses of 4G7-CARD T-cells paralleling clinical standard of care with unmanipulated donor lymphocytes. There are 3 intra-patient dose levels planned. Patients will be followed up regularly during the interventional phase of the study until 12 months post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion. Thereafter patients will be followed up annually for years 2 and 3.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will receive escalating doses of 4G7-CARD T-cells without pre-conditioning, paralleling clinical standard of care with unmanipulated donor lymphocytes. Intra-patient dose escalation will proceed at intervals of not less than 8 weeks, dependent on development of toxicity or evidence of efficacy and confirmation by the Trial Management Group. Three dose cohorts levels are planned, and dosing will be according to total CD3+ T- cell dose as this correlates with toxicity in the unmanipualated donor lymphocyte setting: - Dose Level 1: 1x10^6 CD3+ T-cells/kg (starting dose for all patients) - Dose Level 2: 3x10^6 CD3+ T-cells/kg - Dose Level 3: 1x10^7 CD3+ T-cells/kg The inter-patient dosing for the first 3 patients will be at least 28 days, following TMG confirmation. After the first 3 patients have received dose level 1 the Independent Data Management Committee will advise whether the inter-patient dosing interval for subsequent patients can be shortened. Patients will be followed up regularly during the interventional phase of the study until 12 months post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion. During the long term follow up phase of the study (years 2-3 post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion) patients will be followed-up annually for overall survival, disease status and safety. All patients will enter long term follow up until 3 years post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion.</detailed_description>
