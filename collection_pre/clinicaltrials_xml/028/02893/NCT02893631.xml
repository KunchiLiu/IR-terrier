	<brief_summary>Stroke treatment includes thrombolysis, thrombectomy for patients with proximal artery occlusion and sometimes neurosurgery. It rises questions regarding hemostasis: thrombolysis induces fibrinolysis but its effects on coagulation, fibrinogen and platelets and duration of these effects are unknown. Thus management of antithrombotics and hemostasis during thrombectomy and surgery is an issue. Objectives : to describe thrombolysis-induced hemostatic disorders (fibrinolysis, coagulation, fibrinogen, platelets) in patients requiring thrombectomy for stroke and to evaluate the time required for the normalization of these disorders. Methods : Observational monocentric study including rtPA-treated patients requiring endovascular treatment for stroke. Blood sampling within the first 48 hours after rtPA administration to assess of fibrinolysis, coagulation and platelet functions with point of care devices and specific laboratory tests. Record of clinical and biological data.</brief_summary>
