	<brief_title>Cost-utility Evaluation of Two Strategies of Perineal Reconstruction After Abdominoperineal Resection for Anorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is required for the treatment of malignant tumours invading the anal external sphincter and / or pelvic floor muscles. APR is indicated for adenocarcinomas of the distal rectum and anal canal epidermoid carcinomas. Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is the standard treatment for both types of tumours before surgical resection. Yet, radiotherapy is the major factor of delayed or impaired healing of the perineum. Conventional APR in rectal cancer is associated with high rates of positive margins, tumor perforation and is independent risk factor for local recurrence. Therefore, a new approach, the extralevator APR (eAPR) that entails en bloc resection of the rectum, sphincter complex and levator muscles has emerged as a new standard of care. The current standard reconstruction technique is primary closure of perineum by absorbable sutures. Extralevator APR has enhanced perineal morbidity to rates of 40 to 60 % after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Morbidity induces secondary surgical procedures, delayed hospital discharge, and prolonged perineal nursing up to 6 months. Besides human and financial requirements, perineal morbidity may also delay adjuvant chemotherapy. This resulted in a continuing debate on how to close the perineal defect after eAPR. Alternative techniques to primary closure of the perineum are immediate reconstruction by means of musculocutaneous flaps, and, recently, reconstruction using biologic meshes (dermal porcine acellular collagen matrix). Flaps are demanding techniques that require specific surgical skills; lengthen procedures and induce specific morbidity at the donor site. Moreover, flaps have their own rate of failure. Biological meshes are currently used as parietal reinforcement for abdominal wall hernias chest wall reconstruction or breast reconstruction after mastectomy. As expensive devices whose indications are expanding, biological meshes are subjected to cautious evaluation. Their use in pelvic reconstruction after APR has recently been described in retrospective studies. The technique is simple as opposed to musculocutaneous flaps and seems to offer the same morbidity of the perineal wound and a lower cost per patient than rectus abdominal flap. The originality of the GRECCAR project is to propose a holistic approach of the evaluation combining the paradigms of surgical efficacy, costs, quality of life and oncological adequacy, reflecting real life.</detailed_description>
