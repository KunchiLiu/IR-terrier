	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how consuming healthy cookies every day for two weeks will affect different types of fat in the blood. Specifically, the overall goal of this study is to find out if the healthy cookies can increase a polyunsaturated fat called linoleic acid in plasma, red blood cells and white blood cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Healthy Cookie Study: Understanding How Healthy Cookies Affect Fat in the Blood,</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall, linoleic acid has many health benefits including altering body composition and energy metabolism, possibly through its impact on cardiolipin. It is therefore imperative to develop foods products that allow for Americans to easily increase their intake of linoleic acid. It's also important to understand the mechanism in which linoleic acid exerts these positive health effects, particularly in states of muscle mass and quality loss associated with mitochondria dysfunction. The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this research by pursuing the following three specific aims Aim 1: To determine the extent to which cookies, made with grapeseed oil , increase linoleic acid in plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) fraction of blood after two weeks consumption Aim 2: To determine the extent to which cookies, made with grapeseed oil, increase cardiolipin and linoleic acid content of cardiolipin in PBMCs after two weeks of consumption Aim 3: To determine and compare the acceptability of consuming cookies made with grapeseed oil or high oleic safflower oil every day for two weeks</detailed_description>
