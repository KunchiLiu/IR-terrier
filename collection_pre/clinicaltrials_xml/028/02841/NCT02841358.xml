	<brief_summary>Niemann-Pick disease, Type C is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a failing in intracellular cholesterol transport, inducing an accumulation of sphingolipids in the brain. Neurological signs are at the forefront of the disease. There are also psychiatric signs of psychotic kind among 28 to 45 % of patients according to studies, and a thirty cases were published. These signs can be concomitant with neurological signs or precede them. Is is likely that psychotic disorders are the first signs of a Niemann-Pick disease not yet non encore diagnosed for some patients. Yet, no prevalence study for this disease in a psychiatric population of patients currently exists. In response to this problem this study proposes to search patients whose disease could be of organic origin or patients whose disease is suspected, based on clinical data. The diagnosis will be confirmed certified with a genetic and/or biochemical test.</brief_summary>
