	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for ESRD. However, the life expectancy of kidney transplant patients is lower than that of the general population. Deaths recipients are due mainly to cardiovascular diseases related to a chronic inflammatory state. In addition, renal transplant patients frequently have anemia, identified as an independent cardiovascular risk factor that can be corrected by blood transfusion. But the relationship between transfusion and inflammatory condition are bidirectional. The patient's inflammatory condition will sound on the effectiveness of transfusion and transfusion could trigger an inflammatory condition. This has been reported with the said blood components "aged", especially with packed red cells in patients hospitalized in intensive care after heavy heart surgery.The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of early transfusions on the evolution of renal transplantation (ie death, anti-HLA immunization, acute rejection, graft loss, delayed graft function, cardiovascular events ) taking into account in the analysis: patient age at the time of transplantation, the number of incompatibility (s) (HLA class I and / or II) between the graft and the patient and sex of the recipient. This is a multicenter retrospective observational study (descriptive epidemiological study).The impact of early transfusions is determined retrospectively over a period of 6 years from 01 January 2002 to 31 December 2008, in renal transplant patients of all centers of France met the criteria for inclusion. This cohort represents about 12 000-14 000 patients</brief_summary>
