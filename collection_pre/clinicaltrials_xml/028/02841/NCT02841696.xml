	<brief_summary>Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor. Heart failure is one of its main complications but the factors that influence its development are still insufficiently known. The primary objective is to determine associated factors to the occurrence of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction assessed by an alteration of the Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) after more than the years of hypertension. The secondary objective is to estimate the prevalence of LV systolic dysfunction in a cohort of hypertensive people followed for over 10 years and formulate pathophysiological hypotheses on the development of this heart disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some of the hypertensive patients will develop a post hypertensive heart disease. This hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is now essentially defined by the association of LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. Investigators believe this hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is also characterized by early impairment of systolic function but mainly in its longitudinal component (assessed by measuring the GLS) and therefore exposed to cardiovascular events. The work is based on an existing cohort of hypertensive patients included more than 10 years ago before any initiation of antihypertensive therapy in the hypertension unit of the Bordeaux University Hospital, France. Patients will be contacted for further consultation with a cardiologist to identify patients with a LV systolic dysfunction. The primary end-point is a decrease of the longitudinal systolic function with a GLS&lt;-17% for men and &lt;-19% for women. A sufficient number of patients will be contacted in order to collect data of at least 400 patients after more than 10-year of follow-up.</detailed_description>
