	<brief_summary>The goal of this field trial is to tailor and test a web-based intervention in adults 65 years of age or older. Two versions of the web-based intervention have been created and will be tested--one with an online social network and one without an online social network. The purpose of this study is to: pilot a novel intervention, examine methods to improve adherence to web-based interventions (e.g., peer network); collect data on feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an web-based intervention for late life depression; and ultimately, to overcome the numerous barriers to treating depression in later life.</brief_summary>
