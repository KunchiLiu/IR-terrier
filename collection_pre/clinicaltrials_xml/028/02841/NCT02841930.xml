	<detailed_description>The ActionHealthNYC program is a year-long demonstration program to improve access to high quality health care for NYC resident immigrants who do not qualify for public insurance with incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Our goal in piloting the program and conducting the research study is to understand the following questions: - For clients participating in the ActionHealthNYC program, do they report having easier access to health care? - What are the differences in health care utilization for participants in the ActionHealthNYC program and those not in the program? - Do the participants in the ActionHealthNYC program report fewer barriers to needed care when compared to those not in the program? - Are the participants in the ActionHealthNYC program more likely to have received preventive services according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) or recommended services for those with a qualifying condition through their medical home? - How does the likelihood of receiving a new diagnosis compare between the ActionHealthNYC member group and the study group? - How does emergency department and hospital use compare between the ActionHealthNYC member group and the study group? We will be conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we will be enrolling 2,400 people that meet the eligibility criteria and randomizing half into the ActionHealth NYC program. We will be employing a mixed methods approach to address differences between participants randomized to receive enhanced services through ActionHealthNYC (AHNYC) and those receiving usual care, utilizing surveys, secondary data analysis, key informant interviews and participant focus groups.</detailed_description>
