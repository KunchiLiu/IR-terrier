	<brief_summary>Meningitis are serious infections. Evidenced by high rates of mortality and sequelae. However, these diseases have a relatively small impact. Also physician services Home Emergencies they must be vigilant, alert, for clinical signs to be suspected meningitis. Indeed, it is only after this essential clinical milestone that will be carried out a lumbar puncture which will confirm the diagnosis and to quickly begin treatment. Unfortunately, if recent studies can improve the therapeutic management of patients with meningitis, no study was interested in yet fundamental step of diagnosis. It seems therefore necessary to achieve a prospective clinical study to reassess the adequacy of the clinical signs in the diagnosis of meningitis. The ideal would be to achieve a predictive clinical score of the presence or absence of meningitis.</brief_summary>
