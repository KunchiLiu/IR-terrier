	<brief_summary>In the case of psychotic disorders such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, attention dysfunction contribute, according to the theories of neuroscience, the development of mood disorders following disturbances in the interaction-care emotion. In this context, the general objective of this research project is to refine our understanding of the similarities and distinctions between bipolar and schizophrenic patients in the basic emotional information processing. Specifically, these are: 1) to better understand what level of basic emotional information processing both conditions differ or are comparable and in what sense and 2) estimate, in both pathologies, the specific influence of the nature of the task of processing emotional information. To answer these questions, the investigators have developed a protocol to specifically target different information processing channels playing on the nature of the spatial frequency content of emotional natural scenes. To estimate in both pathologies, the specific influence of the nature of the task on emotional processing, 3 types of tasks are proposed: 1) a simple task perception and 2) -3) two tasks whose categorization one focused on the emotional feelings of the individual and the other on the tendency to action. Both tasks categorization should involve more specifically the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (CPFVM) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) respectively. All patient data will be compared with data from healthy control participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization of Emotional Processing of Information in Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main goals This research project generally aims to refine our understanding of the similarities and distinctions between bipolar and schizophrenic patients in emotional information processing. Specifically, these are: 1. better understand what level of emotional information processing both conditions differ or are comparable and in what direction 2. assess specifically in both pathologies, emotional regulation deficits through the realization of different cognitive tasks when processing emotional information. To answer these questions, the investigators developed an original protocol imaging functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to specifically target different information processing channels playing on the nature of the spatial frequency content of emotional natural scenes (see Methods). emotional regulation deficits in both disorders will be addressed in part through here 3 types of tasks: 1) a simple task perception and 2) -3) two tasks categorization of which centered on the emotional feelings of the individual (task affective) and the tendency to action (motivational task). Both tasks categorization should involve more specifically the Prefrontal Cortex-Ventro Median (CPFVM) and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex-Dorso (DLPFC), respectively, distinguishing between the two categories of patients. All patient data will be compared to healthy control participants. This project will also allow us to improve our knowledge in bipolar and schizophrenic patients compared with control subjects, i) on the brain structures of networks involved in emotional information processing and emotional regulation, ii) functional relationships still unclear between neural structures involved in both processes and iii) the nature of the information passing through these networks.</detailed_description>
