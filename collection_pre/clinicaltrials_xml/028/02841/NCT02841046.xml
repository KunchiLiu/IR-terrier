Fifty patients (ASA Ⅰ-Ⅱ, 26-55 years old, cardiac functional gradingⅠ) scheduled for gastrointestinal tumor surgery were divided into two groups randomly: group C with CI as the primary judgment and group S with the combination of SVV and CI as the primary judgment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate the application of fluid-infusion therapy with the combination of stroke volume variation (SVV) and cardiac index (CI) as the primary judgment in non-severe patients underwent resection of gastrointestinal tumor. Methods: Fifty patients (ASA Ⅰ-Ⅱ, 18-55 years old, cardiac functional gradingⅠ) scheduled for gastrointestinal tumor surgery were divided into two groups randomly: group C with CI as the primary judgment and group S with the combination of SVV and CI as the primary judgment. Patients in group C received a therapy with the goal of CI was no less than 2.5L•min-1•m-2 while SVV was less than 12% and CI was no less than 2.5L•min-1•m-2 in group S. Indexes including MAP、HR、CVP、CI、SVV were recorded at the moment after anaesthetized (T1), when skin was incised (T2), when the intestina was anastomosed (T3) and after the abdomen was closed (T4). SaO2、ScvO2 and plasma lactic were determined at T1 and T4 and DO2,VO2 and ERO2 during the surgery were calculated .The volume of fluid, vasoactive drugs use, the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events, the convalescence of intestinal peristalsis, hospital stay and postoperative complications were recorded.</detailed_description>
