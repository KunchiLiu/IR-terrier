	<brief_summary>The geko™ device is indicated for the prevention and treatment of oedema. The aim of this study is to show that recruiting, and performing study assessments in ankle fracture patients requiring surgery to fix their ankle attending the James Cook Hospital is feasible, and to obtain data to support the powering of a larger study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the geko™ device at reducing length of stay for this population of patients. This study will also allow us to assess the acceptability, tolerability and compliance of treatment with the geko device.</brief_summary>
