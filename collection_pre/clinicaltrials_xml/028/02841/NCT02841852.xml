	<brief_summary>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs in the world and the most effective drugs available to reduce gastric acid secretion. However, studies have shown that PPIs are not always prescribed with a clear indication. Indeed, between 25% and 86% of older individuals taking a PPI have been overprescribed these medications. In older patients, overprescribing of a PPI is associated with increases in morbidity, adverse drug events, hospitalization, and mortality. The hypothesis is that overprescription of PPIs is associated with the individual multimorbidities in older patients evaluated using the multimorbidities group criteria included in the CIRS. The aim of the present study was to establish a relationship between overprescribing of PPIs and multimorbidities in older patients.</brief_summary>
