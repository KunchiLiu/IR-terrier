	<brief_summary>The intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a safe, reliable, long-acting and reversible contraceptive method. It is also sound safe and cheap contraceptive methods available and is nearly maintenance free for up to 10 years. The fear and the pain associated with IUDs insertion consider barriers to using this contraception method, this is because that the mucosal lining of female genital tract is highly sensitive to touch and pain. However; most of small procedures done in this sensitive area are performed without analgesia. The pain during IUDs insertion is due to application of the tenaculum , traction of the cervical canal, passing the uterine sound, insertion of the IUDs through the cervix, and irritation of the endometrial lining by the IUDs.</brief_summary>
