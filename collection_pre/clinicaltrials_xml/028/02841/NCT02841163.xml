	<brief_title>Disc Resorption in Lumbar and Cervical Disc Herniation Patients Receiving Integrative Korean Medicine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervertebral disc herniation treatment can be largely divided into conservative and surgical approaches, and the greater majority of patients show relief of symptoms and resorption of herniated disc through non-surgical, conservative management. Despite concerns that early surgical interventions in intervertebral disc herniation without allowing for sufficient conservative treatment may indicate overtreatment, awareness and understanding in the general public is found somewhat lacking. The objective of this study is to measure herniated disc resorption and assess satisfaction regarding post-treatment state and integrative Korean medicine treatment through phone interview in 500 patients with MRI follow-up results before and after receiving conservative treatment for lumbar and cervical disc herniation at Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine.</detailed_description>
