	<brief_summary>There are two main aims in this study. The first objective is to evaluate whether a particular telehealth solution, in addition to standard treatment and care, lead to a significant decrease in the mortality and an increase in health related quality of life for patients suffering from Heart Failure that may benefit from telehealth compared with only standard treatment and care. The second objective is to examine the additional costs of the telehealth solution and assess whether this solution is a cost-effective way to care for patients with Heart Failure across patients and municipality districts. It is hypothesized that telehealth care will increase patients quality adjusted life years compared to usual practice, since no difference in mortality and a higher health related quality of life is expected. Furthermore, it is hoped that there will be a 30% reduction in the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals and a 30% reduction in the number of outpatient visits resulting in fewer costs for hospitals. However, it is uncertain as to whether these savings are offset by other costs such as more visits to general practitioners, community care or the implementation costs.</brief_summary>
