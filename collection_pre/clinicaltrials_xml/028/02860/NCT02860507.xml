	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Sugammadex in rapidly reversing deep neuromuscular blockaded (induced by rocuronium)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Determine if Administration of Sugammadex Impacts Hospital Efficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants in the study group will receive a single bolus of Sugammadex (4.0mg/kg) prior to extubation. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), a blinded safety-assessor will use the visual analog scale to clinically assess post-operative pain. Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) will be assessed using a PONV rating scale every 30 minutes until PACU discharge. All patients will be monitored with continuous pulse-oximetry.</detailed_description>
