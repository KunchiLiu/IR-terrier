	<brief_summary>FRACTal study is the first exploration of detection of FSHR as a blood biomarker for the diagnosis of cancer. A first cohort will explore several common (e.g. breast, prostate) or rare (e.g. uveal melanoma) cancers, that are frequently treated at Institut Curie. This first cohort will include n=10 patients per histological type except for breast cancer (n=50). 100 patients are expected in this cohort. A second cohort will explore the more promising histological type (if any) in term of incidence of detection. 100 patients are expected for this second cohort.</brief_summary>
