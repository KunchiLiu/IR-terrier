	<brief_summary>The clinical trail of Cinobufacini injection combined with Oxaliplatin regimen on gastrointestine carcinoma.This trail is randomized controled.Patients are diagnosed gastrointestinal cancer based on pathology or cell biology.They are randomized into 2 groups:both groups receive Oxaliplatin regimen.The treatment group receives Cinobufotalin 20ml mixed with 5% Glucose injection 500ml from the first day of chemotherapy until seven days in addition to the chemotherapy.The control group only receive the same chemotherapy with the treatment group.Both group have the same adjuvant therapy.Mainly to study of oxaliplatin into Cinobufacini injection leads to the influence of the peripheral nerve toxicity.Clinical evaluation includes neural electrophysiological test,chemotherapy drug toxicities,quality of life(QOL),etc.Blood biochemistry tests mainly include inflammatory cytokines,peroxidase reaction,immune cell number ratio and stress hormone,etc.</brief_summary>
