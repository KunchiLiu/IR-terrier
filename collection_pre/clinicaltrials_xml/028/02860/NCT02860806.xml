	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) of single escalating intravenous (IV) doses of JNJ-63623872 administered as a continuous infusion; to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single escalating IV doses of JNJ-63623872 administered as a continuous infusion; to characterize the single-dose PK of JNJ-63623872 of one selected dose administered as a continuous IV infusion at various durations and to characterize the single- and repeat-dose PK of JNJ-63623872 administered as a continuous infusion.</brief_summary>
