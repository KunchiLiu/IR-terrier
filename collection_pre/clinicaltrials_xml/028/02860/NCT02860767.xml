	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the concentrations of antibiotics (daptomycin, vancomycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime) in serum and periprosthetic tissues(bone and synovial joint) used as empirical treatment during reimplantation of infected hip and knee prostheses (1-stage or 2-stage management).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patients (aged of 18 years or more) who undergo reimplantation surgery for infected hip or knee prosthesis (performed in 1 or 2stage(s)), and for whom referral physicians plans to use an empirical antibiotic therapy including cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, daptomycin, or vancomycin. Patients with multiple prosthetic joint infections, or with curative antibiotic therapy ongoing within two weeks or less prior to surgery, or for whom an antibiotic prophylaxis is decided by referral for the reimplantation surgery, or for whom an antibioticloaded cement containing the same antibiotic chosen for empirical therapy after reimplantation was used in case of 2stage exchange</criteria>
