	<brief_summary>This is a Comparison Effectiveness Research (CER) study in a population of 13 to 40 year-old individuals with persistent asthma comparing differing levels of texting interventions with each other and with a usual care group. The two texting interventions include 1) texting only the individual with asthma and 2) texting the individual with asthma and an important person in that individual's life such as a parent or spouse. These two texting groups will be compared to a group receiving usual asthma care at Denver Health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is Phase 2 of a two-phase pilot project to build and study a texting program for patients at Denver Health who have persistent asthma. The overall goal of the program is to provide educational support for asthma care between clinic visits and to survey for evidence of poorly controlled asthma, which would prompt clinic recall. Phase 1 used a focus group/interview methodology to inform Phase 2 and allow Phase 2 to be more patient-centered. Based on results of focus groups/interviews, the investigators will conduct a three-arm trial among 13- to 19-year-olds and a two-arm trial among 20- to 40-year-olds. For the 13- to 19-year-old group, a 'usual care' group will be compared to two intervention groups: 1) a subject group receiving text messages about asthma care and 2) a group of subjects and their 'significant other', such as a parent, who will also receive the text messages. Overall, Phase 1 findings suggested the 20- to 40-year-old group was more reluctant to involve a significant other and therefore for this group a 'usual care' arm will be compared to an arm where only the patient receives the text messages, but not a significant other. Other features built into Phase 2 upon recommendation from the focus group/interview phase include a midpoint survey and tailoring the amount of texting a patient receives based on the level of asthma control elicited by administration of the validated tool, the Asthma Control Test (ACT).</detailed_description>
