	<brief_summary>The overall goal for the study is to test the efficacy of a smartphone app which includes an alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for National Guard members in the State of Ohio who meet criteria for at-risk drinking in the previous 3 months. The main hypothesis is that those in the SP-BI group with have reduced frequency and intensity of at-risk drinking and fewer binge drinking episodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project Guard: Reducing Alcohol Misuse/Abuse in the National Guard</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project is a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of a smartphone app which includes an alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for National Guard members in the State of Ohio, who are already participating in the OHARNGMHI study, titled "Resilience and Risk Factors Associated with Deployment Related Posttraumatic Psychopathology", who meet criteria for at-risk drinking in the previous 3 months. After tailoring the content of the SP-BI intervention for NG soldiers, the study will screen ~ 3,100 individuals over the three year enrollment period as part of the larger ongoing longitudinal assessment of ONG members in the OHARNG MHI, to identify 750 participants with at-risk drinking. These ONG members will be randomized to either the SP-BI or the EUC condition and followed for one year. Participants who are randomized to the SP-BI condition will receive an informational brochure with resources available to members of the military related to mental health and alcohol use and will download a free app on to their smartphones. The app will be developed to be used on both Android and iPhone platforms and will be used over 12 weeks to deliver the study intervention. Those assigned to the EUC condition will receive the informational brochure only. All subjects will be contacted to complete 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up assessments. The specific aims of the study are to compare SP-BI and EUC in: 1) Reducing the frequency and intensity of at-risk drinking at 3 -, 6- and 12-months; 2) Decreasing binge drinking at 3-, 6- and 12 months. The secondary aims are to: 1) Compare the SP-BI and EUC conditions in reducing the frequency of illicit drug use and depressive symptoms at 3-, 6- and 12-months; 2) Examine if deployment status moderates the effect of intervention assignment (SP-BI or EUC) on post-intervention drinking, depressed feelings, and other substance use.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have a past 3month AUDITC score of 5 or more for men and 4 or more for women indicating that they meet criteria for atrisk drinking, AND Do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. Must still be a current member of the Ohio National Guard (i.e. they have not retired or separated from the ONG). Those who do not have access to a smart phone with either Android or iOS operating system Those in active treatment for substance use disorders (i.e., report addictions treatment in past 3 months) will be excluded because the proposed SBIRT intervention is focused on early brief intervention for those with atrisk drinking and on referral to treatment for those with more serious problems</criteria>
