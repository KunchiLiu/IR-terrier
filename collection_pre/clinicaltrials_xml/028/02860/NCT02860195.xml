	<brief_summary>A non invasive transdermal sensor device was developed by the Im2Np laboratory to determine the presence of vapor of alcohol in insensible perspiration. One of possible application would be a continuous and non invasive monitoring of drinking behavior. To investigate the validity of this method, it's necessary to compare Transdermal Alcohol Concentrations results obtained by this new device with Blood Alcohol Concentrations and breath Alcohol Concentrations provided by reference methods. The purpose of this study is to identify the kinetic of alcohol concentration in blood, exhaled air and sweat after alcohol ingestion.</brief_summary>
