	<brief_summary>Background and significance: Though the problem of bullying among adolescents is evidently increasing and of a serious social concern, it is often undetected until serious outcomes have surfaced. In recent years, along with the rapid expansion of the Internet, social network services (SNS) and smart phones, "cyber-bullying" has been growing. Compared to the traditional bullying, cyberbullying is unique in nature and potentially more hazardous in terms of invisibility, lack of control, where it enables communication with a broad range of people at any time and place. To explore deeper understanding of the magnitude and the impact of the bullying among adolescents in Taiwan to inform public policy and future health intervention programs may be beneficial not only to Taiwan but also to Asia as a whole. Many Asian countries now suffer the similar problems of bullying among adolescents, since these countries share similar characteristics of development (spread of internet, SNSs and smart phones). Goal and objectives: This study aims to explore Taiwanese adolescents' experiences, perceptions, opinions and mental health regarding cyberbullying and traditional bullying to inform the development of questionnaire in the quantitative phase of mixed methods study. Study design: A qualitative study design with in depth interviews will be adopted. Target population and study setting: Senior high school students will be recruited from Taipei city, Taiwan. Sample size and sampling method: Participants will be sampled by convenience sampling until thematic saturation is attained, probably around 50 students. Data collection: Face-to-face in-depth interview with semi-structured questionnaire will be used. Data analysis: All interviews will be voice-recorded, transcribed, analyzed by thematic analysis procedure. Analysis process will include familiarization, coding, searching for themes, reviewing the themes, defining, naming themes and writing up or weaving the analytic narrative. Triangulation and supervision will also ensure credibility and balance in the process.</brief_summary>
