	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to show for the first time that treatment with intravenous fibrinolysis using rt-PA in patients with recent ischemic stroke is accompanied by increases in circulating levels of BDNF, which may reflect an increase in BDNF synthesis in the brain. The analysis of the recovery of functional and cognitive abilities as well as mood at 3 months will allow us to study the impact of BDNF on these parameters. Thus, depending on the results obtained, circulating BDNF could serve as an early marker of these.</brief_summary>
