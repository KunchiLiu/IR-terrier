	<brief_summary>This hypothalamic obesity is associated with serious metabolic and psychosocial consequences. The purpose of the study is to compare the change of body weight after 6 months treatment with a lifestyle intervention + exenatide compare to the one after the same lifestyle intervention+ placebo in adults patients suffering from a hypothalamic obesity due to treatment of craniopharyngioma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The development of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues might be a solution since native GLP-1 suppresses appetite and energy intake in both normal weight and obese individuals as well as in people with type 2 diabetes and delays gastric emptying. The underlying mechanisms that mediate the effects of weight involve not only central regions like the hypothalamus and the solitary tractus nucleus and area postrema but also peripheral regions as the gastrointestinal tract. These extra hypothalamic effects are of particular interest in the cases of obesity due to hypothalamic lesions. Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with a high structural homology to human GLP-1, a gut derived incretin hormone. Since exenatide causes a dose-dependent weight loss, decreasing concentration of glycosylated haemoglobin as well as improving ß-cell function and systolic blood pressure, it could be an attractive treatment for both type 2 diabetes and obesity. In a double-blind placebo-controlled 24-week trial, it has been recently shown that non diabetic obese patients maintained on exenatide 10µg x 2/j lost significantly more weight than did those on placebo (5.1 kg versus 1.6).</detailed_description>

They are under the age of 18 years or over the age of 65 yrs. They are maintained on medical treatment against obesity. They are receiving supraphysiologic hydrocortisone therapy (upper than 30 mg/jour). Their GH status change during the course of the study. Exenatide is contraindicated. Psychological and/or medical problems that would create difficulties for the patient to comply with the study protocol are present.</criteria>
