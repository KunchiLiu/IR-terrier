	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of GX-I7 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subjects who are adequately eligible to attend this clinical trial via screening will be hospitalized one day prior to the injection (Day -1), administered a single dose of GX-I7 solution for subcutaneous injection, and then discharged on Day 3. After completing all scheduled tests at the visit 8 (Day 28), safety-related data of each cohort will be evaluated by Independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). Dose escalation will proceed under the principal investigator, medical monitor, and the sponsor's mutual approval, referring to SMC's evaluation.</detailed_description>
