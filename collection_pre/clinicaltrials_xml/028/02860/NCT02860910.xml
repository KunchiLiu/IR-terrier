	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy for the Management of Menopause Symptoms in Mood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory study proposes to expand the knowledge in the menopausal literature and evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) in reducing problematic vasomotor symptoms, reducing daily interference and improving quality of life. The study will include two homogenous peri- or post-menopausal cohorts (African-American and Caucasian) with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. The intervention will be delivered in groups of 6 to 10 participants per group of both race/ethnicities in an outpatient setting during a 6-week time period. The participants will be assessed on the degree of hot flash problem rating, hot flash related daily interference, and menopause quality of life at screening, baseline, and post-treatment. Participants will also be assessed using the following predictor variables at the same time points: body mass index (BMI), level of perceived stress, severity of depression, severity of anxiety level of pleasure, severity of mania, hot flash beliefs and severity of couple's conflict.</detailed_description>
