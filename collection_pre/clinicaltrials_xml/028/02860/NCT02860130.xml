	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine if an investigational new drug solution called Prismocitrate 18 lengthens extracorporeal circuit life in patients treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Patients who receive CRRT treatment with Prismocitrate 18 as the anticoagulant will be compared to patients who receive CRRT treatment with no anticoagulation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient must be receiving medical care in an intensive care unit (ICU) (e.g., medical ICU, surgical ICU, cardiothoracic ICU, Trauma ICU, Mixed ICU, other). 2. Adult patients with AKI or other serious conditions who require treatment with CRRT. 3. Patients are expected to remain in the ICU and on CRRT for at least 72 hours after randomization. 4. Patients already receiving standardofcare CRRT must be randomized within 24 hours of initiation of their standardofcare CRRT. 1. Patients requiring systemic anticoagulation with antithrombotic agents for reasons other than CRRT. The exception is patients receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis according to institutional practice or patients on aspirin may be enrolled. 2. Patients in whom citrate anticoagulation is contraindicated such as patients with a known allergy to citrate or who have experienced adverse events associated with citrate products including patients with a prior history of citrate toxicity or patients with uncorrected severe hypocalcemia (whether in the context of current citrate administration or due to the underlying disease state). 3. Patients who are not candidates for CRRT. 4. Patients who are receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. 5. Patients with severe coagulopathy [i.e., platelets &lt; 30,000/mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; 50 seconds] including severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 30,000/mm3), HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia), ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura), and TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura) should not be enrolled in the trial. 6. Patients with fulminant acute liver failure or acute on chronic liver failure as documented by a ChildPugh Liver Failure Score &gt; 10. 7. Patients with refractory shock associated persistent, worsening with lactic acidosis (lactate &gt; 4 mmol/L). However, patients with improving subsequent serum lactate levels may be enrolled. 8. Patients unlikely to survive at least 72 hours. 9. Female patients who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study period. 10. Patients who are currently participating in another interventional clinical study. 11. Patients with a medical condition that may interfere with the study objectives.</criteria>
