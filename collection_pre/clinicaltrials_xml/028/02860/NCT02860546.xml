	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating TAS-102 Plus Nivolumab in Patients With MSS CRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, single arm, safety lead-in, Phase 2 study, using Simon's 2 stage design evaluating the safety and efficacy of TAS-102 plus nivolumab in patients with Microsatellite-stable refractory metastatic colorectal cancer Stage 1: Patients will be enrolled and after Cycle 1 treatment, they will be evaluated for the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Assuming a tolerated dose is confirmed additional patients evaluable for response will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 6 months and there will be an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy to determine whether the second stage will open for enrollment. Stage 2: Additional patients evaluable for response assessment will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 6 months.</detailed_description>
