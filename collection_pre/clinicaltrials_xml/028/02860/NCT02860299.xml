	<brief_summary>In the VERROUREA study, there were two cases of an abnormal increase in TCA. In theory no leakage of the lock into the bloodstream should have been seen. Lock leakage could have particularly serious, and especially clinical, repercussions in these patients who already have a high risk of haemorrhage given the numerous associated comorbidities. The aim of this study is to investigate the leakage of locks into the bloodstream by measuring, before and after injection of the lock, the evolution of haemostasis tests and calcaemia. The findings will complete safety data already collected in the VERROU REA study.</brief_summary>
