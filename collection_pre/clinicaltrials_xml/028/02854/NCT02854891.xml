	<brief_summary>Myopia, the most common human eye disorder, is a phenomenon characterized by an unconstrained elongation of the eye globe There are number of theories concerning the environmental effect on the emmetropization process, most are related to childhood exposure to outdoor activity, near work and sleep with night light. Studies in lab animals found an association between intensity of ambient lighting and myopia development. In this study, the investigators will examine the ambient light in kindergarten and schools and their relation to refractive error. Diurnal luminance in kindergarten and school class room will be measured and correlated to biometric measures such as refraction, axial length and keratometry.</brief_summary>
