	<brief_summary>Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder. Epidemiological studies have documented its high prevalence and high socio-economic and personal impacts. Migraine affects more than 20% of the French population. However, the physiopathology of migraine is always partially known. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the widely accepted as the electrophysiologic substrate of migraine aura. CSD is a slowly propagating wave of transient neuronal and glial depolarization. The near death experience (NDE) is a rare, but well known phenomenon. NDE are profound psychic experiences commonly occuring in life-threatening conditions. Among the neurological hypotheses, epilepsy, temporal lobe disorders , REM-sleep intrusion have been discussed. However, the role of DCE has never been discussed. The goals of this study are : to see if there is an epidemiological link between NDE and migraine/ to specify if NDE was followed by a migrainous headache.</brief_summary>
