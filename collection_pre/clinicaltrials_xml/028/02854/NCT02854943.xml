	<brief_title>The Prognostic and Diagnostic Value of Ferritin in Critically Ill Patients With Special Focus on Underlying Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a retrospective register study of critically ill patients from Charit√© - University Medicine Berlin during 2000 and 2016 that had at least one measurement of plasma ferritin. Outcome, underlying diagnoses and HLH-2004 criteria (Henter JI et al. 2007) will be analysed and the HScore of these patients will be calculated (Fardet L et al. 2014). All recorded data of the specific admission term in ICU will be used for the analysis. No follow-up of the patients after discharge will be performed in this study. The study does not involve any randomization or any drug testing.</detailed_description>
