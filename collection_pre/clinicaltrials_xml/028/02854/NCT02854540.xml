	<brief_summary>This small feasibility study will evaluate the use of hydrogel electrode pads (rather than tap water baths) to deliver iontophoresis treatment using a traditional iontophoresis device. Participants will treat one hand with the hydrogel-based iontophoresis device and leave the other hand untreated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management of Palmar Hyperhidrosis With Hydrogel-based Iontophoresis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palmar hyperhidrosis affects 4.3 million Americans and results in substantial quality of life impairment. Treatment options for palmar hyperhidrosis include antiperspirants, systemic anticholinergic agents, botulinum toxin injections, and iontophoresis. Standard iontophoresis involves submerging the hands in tap water through which current is applied to the palms for 30 minutes per day up to 3 times per week. While effective, treatment adherence rates are low. This is a small feasibility study to evaluate the use of hydrogel electrode pads (rather than tap water baths) to deliver iontophoresis treatment using a traditional iontophoresis device. Hydrogel electrode pads permit improved mobility and hand functionality during iontophoresis treatment sessions.</detailed_description>
