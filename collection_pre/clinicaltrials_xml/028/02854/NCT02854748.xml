	<brief_title>Evaluate the Drug-drugs Interaction Between Lobeglitazone and Empagliflozin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To healthy male subjects of 30, following treatments are administered dosing in each 3 period(Lobeglitazone or Empagliflozin or Lobe.+Empa.) and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days. Test Drug 1: Lobeglitazone 0.5mg 1T Test Drug 2: Empagliflozin 25mg 1T Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected up to 24hrs.
