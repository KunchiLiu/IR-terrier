	<brief_summary>A multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study with clinical, quality of life, and economic evaluation to ascertain the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by patients with ischemic heart disease revascularized with Absorb in standard clinical practice in Spain. A before-after comparative analysis will be performed, so that each patient will act as his/her own control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Economical evaluation study of the efficiency of Absorb in a cohort of patients with ischemic heart disease who have undergone revascularization with Absorb based on the criteria established according to standard clinical practice. A comparison group without Absorb cannot be used for ethical reasons. Thus, each patient will act as his/her own control, and a before-after comparison will be done. This is therefore a prospective, observational cohort study with concurrent data collection. Primary objective: - To assess utility (QALYs gained) in patients implanted Absorb in standard clinical practice conditions. Secondary objectives: - To assess effectiveness (clinical outcomes) in patients who undergo coronary revascularization with Absorb implantation. - To assess costs (direct and indirect) derived from coronary revascularization with Absorb implantation. - To assess efficiency in terms of cost/utility (cost per QALY gained) and cost/effectiveness (cost per MACE -major cardiac adverse events- free patient).</detailed_description>
