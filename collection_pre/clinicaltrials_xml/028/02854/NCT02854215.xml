	<brief_title>Cost Utility of Radical Surgery in Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, comparative and non-randomized study designed to investigate the medico-economic impact of adherence to INCa guidelines in ovarian cancer surgery by assessment of outcome in cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY). A cost-utility study will be performed. It will primarily aim to assess the Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) at 3 years of the two treatment strategies of ovarian cancer surgery: adherence to INCa quality indicators versus non-adherence to INCa quality indicators. Consecutive patients with stage IIIC and IV ovarian, tubal, and primary peritoneal malignancies will be recruited in different health care institutions, including comprehensive cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Evaluation of adherence to quality indicators will be assessed retrospectively (once patients have completed the treatment) by two independent experts. 200 patients will be included over a period of 2 years and will be followed for a 3 years period after treatment (every 4 months the first two years and then every 6 months).</detailed_description>
