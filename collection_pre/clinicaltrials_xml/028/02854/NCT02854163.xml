	<brief_summary>The investigators propose an open label pragmatic clinical and laboratory study designed to investigate, in detail, the clinical and molecular effects of Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and inhibition of IL-17 with secukinumab, on neutrophil function in vitro and ex vivo. As secondary, exploratory objectives, the investigators will utilise the fact that secukinumab is to be administering to 20 patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and investigate whether there is any relationship between vitamin D status and response to secukinumab, with respect to efficacy and adverse events. The results of this secondary exploratory analysis will inform the design of a larger, definitive study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Secukinumab in the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP) Sample Size: 25 patients plus 10 healthy controls are to be enrolled in total. Study Population: Patient treatment group: 25 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (fulfilling Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR] criteria) affecting ≥2 peripheral joints (swollen and tender) that have not responded to at least two standard Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Healthy control group: 10 healthy control blood samples (matched for gender to the patients and within 5 years of mean age within each gender subgroup). Number of Sites: 1 - Rheumatology clinic at Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool Study Duration: 24 months in total with 12 months of therapy, and 12 months for staggered enrolment and laboratory investigations Description of Agent/Intervention Secukinumab 150mg/300mg subcutaneous injection once weekly for the first 4 weeks then 150mg subcutaneous injection 4 weekly for up to 11 months. Primary Aim: The primary aim is to determine the molecular effects of IL-17 and inhibition of IL-17 with secukinumab on neutrophil phenotype, lifespan, function and production of IL-17. Secondary Aims: 1. To determine if neutrophil life span and function is associated with vitamin D concentration and VDR receptor expression in PsA patients, and 2. To explore whether vitamin D concentrations and VDR expression influence neutrophil lifespan and function in PsA patients before and after treatment with secukinumab. Exploratory Aims: 1. To evaluate the clinical response of patients with psoriatic arthritis, treated with secukinumab using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20), 2. To identify whether vitamin D status according to winter or summer seasons and levels of VDR expression are associated with skin and joint responses or infection in patients treated with secukinumab in PsA, assessed using PASI 75 and 90, ACR20 response and reporting of infection adverse events. 3. To evaluate the safety of patients treated with secukinumab in terms of adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), infections and serious infections, malignancies, acute injection site reactions and potential immunogenicity over 12 months. Study Design: Screening for eligibility Patient group: Patients attending routine rheumatology assessments will be screened for suitability for the study. Eligible patients, based on diagnosis of PsA (meeting CASPAR criteria and with peripheral joint involvement), will be approached to determine if they are willing to participate. Patients will be randomly assigned to secukinumab treatment or usual DMARD treatment based on a 4:1 ratio. Healthy Control Group: Healthy controls matched by gender and within 5 years of mean patient age (assessed in patient group) will be recruited from National health Service (NHS) and university staff. Baseline assessment Baseline assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function ACR20, Body Surface Area (BSA), PASI 75 and 90, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PSARC), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ5D) &amp; Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). 1. Secukinumab Arm 3 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ 6 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ 9 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR , ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D HAQ 12 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ 13 months (final follow up visit) - pregnancy test, Full Blood Count (FBC), LFTs, serum creatinine and body temperature measurement. Then exit study 2. DMARD only arm (control group to evaluate potential seasonal variability) 3 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ 6 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ 9 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR , ACR20, PASI, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D HAQ 12 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ 13 months (final follow up visit) - pregnancy test, FBC, LFTs, serum creatinin and body temperature measurement. Then exit study 3. Healthy Control Group: Blood sample obtained at baseline for assessment of Vitamin D, VDR and neutrophil function. Analysis Plan: Phase 1: - Measure change at 3 month, 6 and 12 months assessments (from baseline) in neutrophil function, in DMARD control group and secukinumab arms. - Explore using longitudinal models whether change in outcome variables differ in the 2 treatment arms during the first 6 month, adjusting for confounding variables. Phase 2: - Measure vitamin D concentration, VDR at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. - Model fluctuation in vitamin D, which is season dependant and estimate when it is maximal. - Compare treatment response at time point treatment with lowest vitamin D concentration (winter time) with that with highest vitamin D concentration (summer time). - Assess whether difference in neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 and 90 response and NAPSI correlate with change in vitamin D, using longitudinal models</detailed_description>

Patients who have previously been treated with TNFα inhibitors (investigational or approved). History of hypersensitivity to the study drug or its excipients or to drugs of similar classes. Previous treatment with any celldepleting therapies including but not limited to antiCD20 investigational agents (e.g. CAMPATH, antiCD4, antiCD5, antiCD3,antiCD19). Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than PsA that might confound the evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy. Underlying metabolic, hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine,cardiac, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions which in the opinion of the Investigator immunocompromise the patient and/or place the patient at unacceptable risk for participation in an immunomodulatory therapy. Significant medical problems or diseases, including but not limited to the following: uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 160/95 mmHg), congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association status of class III or IV), uncontrolled diabetes. History of clinically significant liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests (LFT) such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin. The Investigator should be guided by the following criteria: 1. Any single parameter may not exceed 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A single parameter elevated up to and including 2 x ULN should be rechecked once more as soon as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to enrollment/randomization, to rule out laboratory error. 2. If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 2 x ULN, total bilirubin should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. In any case, serum bilirubin should not exceed 1.6 mg/dL (27 μmol/L).
