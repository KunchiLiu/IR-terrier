	<brief_summary>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in China. Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) improves the outcome for ischemic stroke patients who can be treated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. In China, in addition to rt-PA, intravenous urokinase within 6 h has also been recommended by the 2010 Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke, and supported by evidence from two intravenous urokinase thrombolysis trials. Urokinase is used more frequently than rt-PA, mainly because it is cheaper. To describe Chinese experience with thrombolytic therapy for Ischemic Stroke within 4.5h onset, we designed a multicenter, prospective, registry study. The aim of INtravenous Thrombolysis REgistry for Chinese Ischemic Stroke within 4.5 h onset（INTRECIS）was to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous rtPA, urokinase as thrombolytic therapy within the first 4.5 h of onset of acute ischaemic stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Thrombolysis Registry for Chinese Ischemic Stroke Within 4.5 h Onset</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRECIS is a prospective multicenter registry using data from 60 centres in the North China. Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who are treated with intravenous rtPA, urokinase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in 60 centres of the North China will be eligible for this registry. Patient involvement in the registry shall not influence any treatment decision. Patients will undergo a complete diagnostic work up including a clinical neurological examination using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, laboratory examination, brain and neurovascular imaging, echocardiography, 24-hours ECG. Clinical outcome will be evaluated on day 1 and day 14 using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, evaluated at 3 months using modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) and assessing adverse events. The proportion of patients with favourable outcome (mRS 0 to 2) at 3 months after treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures will include unfavourable clinical outcome (mRS 3 to 6), NIHSS reported and mortality.</detailed_description>
