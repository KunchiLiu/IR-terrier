As part of the previously completed RCT, participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) were randomly placed into one of two groups: memantine, or memantine plus an individualized management program consisting of home visits, educational sessions for caregivers, and a caregiver support group. Participants received the study intervention for 28 weeks; study follow-up lasted for 52 weeks. The collected data from the existing study books from the 28 week treatment portion of the RCT will be carefully examined with respect to each of the research questions for the present retrospective study.</brief_summary>
