	<brief_summary>Liver function is a key factor that can help predict the clinical outcome in patients with cirrhosis. Traditionally, liver function was measured using either indocyanine green (ICG) or other radionucleotides. Recently, gadoxetic acid has been reported to show liver function in several studies. There have been several approaches to measure liver function using gadoxetic acid, and hepatocyte fraction is one of the promising methods. Since gadoxetic acid enhanced liver MRI is clinically used world widely, it would be valuable if we can measure liver function using hepatocyte fraction.</brief_summary>
