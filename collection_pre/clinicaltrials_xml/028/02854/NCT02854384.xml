	<brief_title>Mobile Phone Radiation and Brain Rhythm in Epileptic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This work shows the effect of the 30 minutes mobile waves' radiation over the normal person brain activity (EEG) and cognition (P300) together with the effect over the unstable brain of the epileptic patients. Exposure to mobile-phone radiation has been reported to increase the spectral power of electroencephalograms (EEGs), particularly in the alpha band, during both the waking and sleeping states. The tendency toward electrical instability of the neural networks of epileptic patients suggests that these individuals may be especially sensitive to electromagnetic fields espcially mobile-phone radiation (MPR). The short-term effects of exposure to electromagnetic (EM) fields on a number of cognitive variables such as memory, attention and speed of decision-making could be assedsed by P 300 latency and amplitude.</detailed_description>
