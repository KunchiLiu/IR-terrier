	<brief_title>A Study of MG4101 (Allogeneic Natural Killer Cell) for Intermediate-stage of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is randomized, multi-center, open-labeled, Phase 2a study in patients with HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 78 patients will be randomized(1:1) into one of the two group, to receive adjuvant therapy using MG4101 (allogeneic Natural killer cells, Treatment group) or no adjuvant therapy (Control group). Patients who were assigned Treatment group will receive 2 cycles of MG4101 (each cycle is 3 treatments at a frequency of once per week, between each cycle has 3 weeks of withdrawal period). After treatment period, patients will undergo follow up for progression and survival every 12 weeks (± 7 days) and follow up 1 year after the last patient`s enrollment date. The Control group`s patients will will undergo follow up for progression and survival every 12 weeks (± 7 days) and follow up 1 year after the last patient`s enrollment date.</detailed_description>
