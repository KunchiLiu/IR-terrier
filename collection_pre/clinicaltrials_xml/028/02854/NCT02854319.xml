	<brief_summary>The objective of the REPRISE EDGE study is to confirm the acute performance and safety of the LOTUS Edge™ Valve System when used with the Lotus™ or iSleeve™ Introducer Set for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in symptomatic patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical valve replacement.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject is ≥70 years of age. 2. Subject has documented calcific native aortic valve stenosis with an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of &lt;1.0 cm2 (or AVA index of &lt;0.6 cm2/m2) and either a mean pressure gradient &gt;40 mm Hg or a jet velocity &gt;4 m/s, as measured by echocardiography and/or invasive hemodynamics. Note: In cases of low flow, low gradient aortic stenosis dobutamine can be used to assess the grade of aortic stenosis (maximum dobutamine dose of 20 mcg/kg/min recommended)c; the subject may be enrolled if echocardiographic criteria are met with this augmentation. 3. Subject has a documented aortic annulus size between ≥20 mm and ≤27 mm based on preprocedure diagnostic imaging. 4. Subject has symptomatic aortic valve stenosis with NYHA Functional Class ≥ II. 5. Subject is considered high risk for surgical valve replacement based on at least one of the following: STS score ≥8%, and/or Agreement by the heart team (which must include an inperson evaluation by an experienced cardiac surgeon) that subject is at high operative risk of serious morbidity or mortality with surgical valve replacement. 6. Heart team (which must include an experienced cardiac surgeon) assessment that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement 7. Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures, and provides written informed consent. 8. Subject, family member and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable of returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits. 1. Subject has a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve. 2. Subject with an acute myocardial infarction within 30 days of the index procedure (defined as Qwave MI or nonQwave MI with total CK elevation ≥ twice normal in the presence of CKMB elevation and/or troponin level elevation). 3. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect prior to study enrollment. 4. Subject is on dialysis or has serum creatinine level &gt;3.0 mg/dL or 265 µml/L. 5. Subject has a preexisting prosthetic aortic or mitral valve. 6. Subject has &gt;3+ mitral regurgitation, &gt;3+ aortic regurgitation or &gt;3+ tricuspid regurgitation. 7. Subject has a need for emergency surgery for any reason. 8. Subject has a history of endocarditis within 12 months of index procedure or evidence of an active systemic infection or sepsis. 9. Subject has echocardiographic evidence of new intracardiac vegetation or intraventricular or paravalvular thrombus requiring intervention. 10. Subject has Hgb &lt;9 g/dL, platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or white blood cell count &lt;1,000 cells/mm3. 11. Subject requires chronic anticoagulation therapy after the implant procedure and cannot be treated with warfarin (other anticoagulants are not permitted in the first month) for at least 1 month concomitant with either aspirin or clopidogrel. Note: An alternative P2Y12 inhibitor may be prescribed if subject is allergic to or intolerant of clopidogrel 12. Subject has had a gastrointestinal bleed requiring hospitalization or transfusion within the past 3 months, or has other clinically significant bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy that would preclude treatment with required antiplatelet regimen, or will refuse transfusions. 13. Subject has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately premedicated, or has known hypersensitivity to aspirin, all thienopyridines, heparin, nickel, titanium, or polyurethanes. 14. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to noncardiac, comorbid conditions based on the assessment of the investigator at the time of enrollment. 15. Subject has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 16. Subject has any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days prior to the index procedure (except for balloon aortic valvuloplasty and pacemaker implantation which are allowed). 17. Subject has untreated coronary artery disease, which in the opinion of the treating physician, is clinically significant and requires revascularization. 18. Subject has documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%. 19. Subject is in cardiogenic shock or has hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic support or mechanical support devices. 20. Subject has severe vascular disease that would preclude safe access (e.g., aneurysm with thrombus that cannot be crossed safely, marked tortuosity, significant narrowing of the abdominal aorta, severe unfolding of the thoracic aorta, or symptomatic carotid or vertebral disease). 21. Subject has arterial access that is not acceptable for the LOTUS Edge delivery system and its compatible Lotus or iSleeve Introducers as defined in the Directions For Use, or severe iliofemoral tortuosity or calcification that would prevent safe placement of either introducer sheath. 22. Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, etc.). 23. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached its primary endpoint. 24. Subject does not have a permanent pacemaker but has a class I or II indication for pacemaker implantation (based on the latest available ESC guidelines).</criteria>
