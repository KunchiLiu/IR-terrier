	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Suffering from diabetes since more than 5 years Patient with brittle type 1 diabetes despite an optimized insulin treatment and educational training will be included. A patient will be considered as experiencing a brittle type 1 diabetes if at least two criteria are present among: persistence of severe hypoglycemia, occurrence of ketoacidosis events without obvious etiology, diagnosis of unaware hypoglycemic episodes &lt; 3 mmol/l based on CGM or selfmonitoring blood glucose data, a mean blood glucose standard deviation&gt;50%, MAGE index (Mean amplitude of glucose excursions)&gt;60 mg/dl, LBGI index (low blood glucose index)&gt;5, Clarke scoreâ‰¥4 or HYPOSCORE&gt;800. Insulin needs &lt; 0,85 U/kg/day HbA1c &lt; 12% ; No residual insulin secretion (plasmatic basal and stimulated Cpeptide &lt; 0.3 ng/ml) Social Security membership or benefit from Social Security Patients who signed the consent form Exclusion Criteria : Exclusion criteria related to islet infusion: Hemostatic disorders, preexisting liver disease (PAL, GammaGT, ASATALAT &gt;2N) or vesicular lithiasis. Exclusion criteria related to diabetic complications: Evolutive proliferative retinopathy, evolutive nephropathy (Glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2 and/or proteinuria &gt;0.5g/day), evolutive cardiopathy or obliterative arteriopathy with trophic cutaneous lesions. Exclusion criteria related to immunosuppressant use: Hemoglobin &lt; 110mg/dL in women and &lt; 120 mg/dL in men, leuconeutropenia, thrombopenia, systemic infection including chronic hepatitis B, C and VIH, neoplasia disease and hypertension&gt;160/100 mmHg.
