	<brief_title>Overactive Bladder in Elderly Patients- An Early Warning of Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The close relationship has been demonstrated between pelvic ischemia and overactive bladder (OAB) in a study involving elderly patients. In this study, it has been found that pelvic ischemia has triggered OAB and it has been related with cardiac ischemia. The aim of this study was to delineate the correlation between OAB and the degree of coronary artery stenosis as demonstrated on coronary angiography.</detailed_description>
