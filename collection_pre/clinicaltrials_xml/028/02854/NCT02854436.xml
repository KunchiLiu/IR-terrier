	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Niraparib in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and DNA-Repair Anomalies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter and open-label (participants and researchers are aware of the treatment that participants are receiving) study that consists of 4 phases; a Prescreening Phase for biomarker evaluation only, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase (Cycle 1 Day 1 and will continue until the study drug is discontinued), and a Follow-up Phase (every 3 months after end of treatment visit). Participants will be monitored for safety during the study period, and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>
