	<detailed_description>The Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (ICGES) is a public health institution established in Panama dedicated to health research and disease prevention. It has been performing virological isolations of influenza and is a part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and a direct collaborator of the CDC. From 2010 a sentinel surveillance program is being conducted in Panama within the ICGES to collect data on influenza and other respiratory viruses using CDC guidance for Respiratory Disease Surveillance.
