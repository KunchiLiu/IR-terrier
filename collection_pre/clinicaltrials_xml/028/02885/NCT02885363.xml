	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to clarify prospectively prognosis of patients newly diagnosed as carriers of a LVNC (incident cases) (i.e. without the occurrence of a survival of the following events: death, heart transplantation or hospitalization for cardiovascular complications). In a second time, prognosis factors will be identify in these patients with LVNC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognosis of Isolated Left Ventricular Non-compaction in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Isolated Left Ventricular Non Compaction (LVNC) is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy supposed to result from the cessation of normal embryogenesis infarction, and characterized by persistent ventricular trabeculations prominent. This is frequently a familial disease, but for which genetic characterization is still incomplete, and then requires the identification of new genes is desirable. The prognosis of LVNC is uncertain, with a mortality rate reported in the literature ranging from 2 to 38%. Some series conclude that LVNC is a very severe heart disease, responsible for a high mortality, other that LVNC is frequently associated with a favorable prognosis. These series are however limited by the short duration of follow-up and the small number of patients included. Between 2004 and 2006, a French registry LVNC, included 105 cases. It was found out that the LVNC was associated with a high rate of complications such as outbreaks of severe heart failure, need for heart transplantation, severe rhythm disorders, and embolic events. The prognosis of LVNC in France appears as pejorative: 1. - there is no evidence that prognosis is different from other forms of cardiomyopathies. 2. - the results of this register can be skewed by the inclusion of incident and prevalent cases (statistical survival bias). Thus, a longer-term monitoring and the identification of relevant prognostic markers are imperative to better understand this rare disease and to improve the therapeutic management.</detailed_description>
