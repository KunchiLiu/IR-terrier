	<brief_title>The Use of Low Dose Prophylactic Naloxone Infusion to Prevent Respiratory Depression With Intrathecal Morphine.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delayed respiratory depression is a well-documented side effect associated with the use of intrathecal morphine. This respiratory depression has implications for patient safety and necessitates either the observation of the patient in a high dependency setting for at least 24 hours or the use of an alternative analgesic technique. Other associated side effects include pruritus, nausea and vomiting and sedation. Naloxone is the most effective treatment for these side effects. However, it is usually given as a reactive treatment when the side effect presents. The hypothesis is that patients who are commenced on a naloxone infusion at low dose early after injection of intrathecal morphine will have a clinically significant reduction in incidence of these side effects. The primary endpoint is a reduction in respiratory depression.</detailed_description>
