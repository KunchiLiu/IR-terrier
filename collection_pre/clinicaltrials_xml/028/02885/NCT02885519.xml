	<brief_title>Integrated Mental Health Care and Vocational Rehabilitation to Individuals on Sick Leave Due to Stress Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Stress disorders have negative effects on workability and have negative effects on both the individual and society. Psychological stress and burnout is not recognized as psychiatric diagnoses, and thus, the estimated prevalence in healthy and sick-listed people is somewhat insecure in Denmark. Together with other common mental disorders, burnout, adjustment disorder and psychological stress are causes of up 40 % of the sick leave claims in Denmark. There is no clear evidence that mental health care alone will provide sufficient support for vocational recovery for this target group. Integrated vocational and health care services have shown good effects on return to work in other Scandinavian countries. Objective: The purpose of the Danish IBBIS study is to investigate the efficacy of 1) a stepped mental health care intervention and 2) an integrated mental health care and vocational rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of burnout, adjustment disorder and psychological stress in Denmark. Method: This three-arm, randomized, controlled trial is set up to investigate the effectiveness of the stepped mental health care model and the integrated mental health care and vocational rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of burnout, adjustment disorder and psychological stress in Denmark. 603 patients are recruited from Danish job centers in four municipalities. The primary outcome is return to work at 12 months. Results/discussion: This study will contribute with new knowledge on vocational recovery and integrated vocational and health care interventions in a Scandinavian context.</detailed_description>
