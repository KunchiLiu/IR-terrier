	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the results during different scanning time points after a contrast drug is given for a FDG PET/CT. The contrast drug helps the researchers "see" the images more clearly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Time Point FDG PET-MR Imaging Optimization for the Evaluation of Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging Procedures: If you agree to take part in this study, you will come to the clinic for your standard-of-care MRI and FDG PET/CT scans. The contrast drug will be injected into a vein in your arm through a standard IV over about a minute. One (1) hour after you receive the contrast drug, you will be moved to the FDG PET-CT scanner where you will have a brain and whole body scan, which will take about 30 minutes. This is the standard scanning time point. After this, you will have a standard-of-care MRI scan of your brain. This MRI will take about 45 minutes. You will come back to the clinic for 2 more FDG PET-CT scans at 4 - 5 hours and at 7 - 8 hours after receiving the contrast drug. The scanning time will be about 20 - 30 minutes each time. These are the research scans. You must fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 6 hours before each scan. When you are allowed to eat, you should eat a low carbohydrate, high protein meal (for example, baked chicken with a side of asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, or any green vegetable/salad). You should also drink about 6-8 glasses of water (each glass should be about 8 ounces). The study staff will give you a handout with specific diet instructions you must follow before the PET scan. Information will also be collected from your medical record. Length of Study Participation: Your active participation in this study will be over after your last PET-CT scan is complete. This is an investigational study. The FDG PET-CT and MRIs are delivered using FDA approved and commercially available methods. Comparing the results from different imaging time points after giving the contrast drug is investigational. Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Preoperative adult (&gt;19 years of age) patients with biopsy proven (as opposed to being status post definitive surgical therapy) or highly suspected glioblastoma of the brain. 2. Cases without prior biopsy will be chosen based upon consensus of an MD Anderson faculty neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon for high probability of representing a glioblastoma 3. T1 post contrast lesion size greater than or equal to 10 mm 1. Children 2. Definitive / gross total lesion resection 3. Prior brain cancer 4. Prior whole brain radiation 5. Known history of cerebrovascular disease, dementia or prior nonmild traumatic brain injury 6. Known allergy to FDG or gadolinium based contrast agents 7. Known diabetes or elevating fasting blood glucose (&gt;180) 8. Pregnant women are excluded 9. Patients less than 19 years of age will be excluded.</criteria>
