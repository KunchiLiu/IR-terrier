	<brief_summary>This is a randomized study investigating whether identification, ligation, and burial of superficial branches of the saphenous nerve crossing the surgical field during total knee arthroplasty reduces the rate of post-operative anterior knee pain and neuralgia compared to standard total knee arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nerve Burial for Preventing Neuralgia After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior knee pain is common after total knee arthroplasty. The incision necessarily travels through the path of a cutaneous nerve - branches of the saphenous nerve. Historically, no effort has been made to separate these branches and bury them away from the surgical scar. It has been noted that some patients develop a painful neuroma, that once resected results in a pain free knee. Investigators are trying to study if identification, ligation, and proper burial of the nerve can prevent the development of neuralgia compared to the typical surgical approach which ignores the nerve branches completely.</detailed_description>
