	<brief_summary>Endotracheal intubation is most commonly taught and performed with the patient supine. Recent literature suggests that elevating the patient's head to a more upright position may decrease peri-intubation complications. However, there is little data on success rates of upright intubation in the emergency department. The goal of this study was to measure the association of head positioning with intubation success rates among emergency medicine residents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotracheal intubation is most commonly taught and performed with the patient supine. Recent literature suggests that elevating the patient's head to a more upright position may decrease peri-intubation complications. However, there is little data on success rates of upright intubation in the emergency department. The goal of this study was to measure the association of head positioning with intubation success rates among emergency medicine residents. Study design was a prospective observational study. Residents performing intubation recorded the angle of the head of the bed, and the number of attempts required for successful intubation was recorded by faculty and respiratory therapists. The primary outcome of first past success was calculated with respect to three groups: 0-10 degrees (supine), 11-44 degrees (inclined), and â‰¥45 degrees (upright); first past success was also analyzed in 5 degree angle increments.</detailed_description>
