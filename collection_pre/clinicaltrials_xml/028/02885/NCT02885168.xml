	<brief_summary>The purpose is to demonstrate that vasoreactivity of patients with septic shock evaluated with dose-response curve is diminished in septic shock and ameliorated by activated protein C (APC). This amelioration is correlated to decrease of inflammation, decrease of reactive oxygen species (ROS) markers and increase of circulating catecholamines.</brief_summary>
