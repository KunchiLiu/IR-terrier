	<brief_summary>High frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) is a high frequency ventilation mode in which high frequency pulses accumulate to generate a low frequency tidal volume at a controlled airway pressure. Previous studies have suggested a protective effect of HFPV on lung injury. The goal of our study is to compare, in early ARDS patients, the effects of conventional mechanical ventilation and of high frequency percussive ventilation on alveolar recruitment and distension evaluated by CT-scan</brief_summary>
