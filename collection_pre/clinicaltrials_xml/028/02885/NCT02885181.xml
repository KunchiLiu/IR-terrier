	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of GS-9876 versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in participants with active RA despite methotrexate (MTX) therapy who had an inadequate response to MTX (either alone or in combination with biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [bDMARDs]).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Active RA disease as defined by: a tender joint count (TJC) of ≥ 6 (out of 68), a swollen joint count (SJC) of ≥ 6 (out of 66) at screening and Day 1 Inadequate response to treatment with oral or parenteral MTX 7.5 to 25 mg/week continuously for at least 12 weeks, with at least 6 weeks at a stable dose (defined as no change in prescription) prior to the first dose of study drug Participants must be receiving a folic or folinic acid supplementation at a stable dose. Prior treatment with Bcell depleting agents (eg, rituximab), unless more than 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug and documented return of CD19+ cells at screening Prior treatment with any commercially available or investigational spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor Concurrent treatment with any other conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) other than MTX and/or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (prior csDMARD treatment allowed if appropriate wash out as defined in the protocol) Concurrent treatment with any biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)(prior bDMARD treatment allowed if appropriate wash out as defined in the protocol). Prior failure to treatment with bDMARDs is not an exclusion criterion.</criteria>
