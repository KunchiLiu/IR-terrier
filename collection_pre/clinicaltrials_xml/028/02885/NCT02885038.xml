	<brief_summary>Platelet concentrates (PCs) characteristics, such as storage duration, ABO compatibility, dose and source, may have an impact on transfusion responses and outcomes. Because of the relative scarcity of PCs the selection of a specific PC for issue to the patient remains a challenging process. Regulatory agencies do not fully address these characteristics in their recommendations for prophylactic transfusions. The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of product-related factors in a real life setting, in order to determine which ones are the most relevant when selecting PCs for patients in prophylactic conditions. Two different endpoints are studied: the corrected count increment and the platelet transfusion time intervals.</brief_summary>
