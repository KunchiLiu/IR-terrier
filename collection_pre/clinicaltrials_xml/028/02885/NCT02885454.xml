	<criteria>Participant must be a female of childbearing potential with a normal menstrual cycle Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kilogram (kg) Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted Participant must have a negative serum (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [beta hCG]) pregnancy test at screening Participant must have a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test at Day 1 Participant is peri or postmenopausal, or participant with bilateral oophorectomia Participant has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (antiHCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or antiHCV at screening Participant has previously been dosed with simeprevir (SMV), odalasvir (ODV), or AL335 in more than 3 single dose studies, or a multipledose study with SMV, ODV, or AL335 Participant with currently active gynecological disorders including, but not limited to, vaginal bleeding without an obvious reason and hyperprolactinemia with or without galactorrhea Participant with a past history of: heart arrhythmias (example, extrasystolic rhythms or tachycardia at rest). Isolated extrasystolic beats are not exclusionary; risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as hypokalemia; family history of short/long QT syndrome; sudden unexplained death (including sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS]) in a firstdegree relative (that is, sibling, offspring, or biological parent)</criteria>
