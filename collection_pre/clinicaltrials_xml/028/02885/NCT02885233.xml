	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Web-Based Fall Prevention Program on People With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of an online self-management program for preventing falls among people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). To accomplish this objective, the investigators have designed a web-based fall prevention program called Free From Falls Online (FFFO), based on the traditionally in-person program developed by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The specific aims of this study are three-fold: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of an online fall prevention self-education program by comparing fall frequency between participants and controls; (2) evaluate the impact of FFFO by comparing patient reported measures of physical function, fatigue, self-efficacy, psychosocial illness impact, social participation and satisfaction, and perception of global health between participants and controls; (3) and to determine usability of and satisfaction with FFFO.</detailed_description>
