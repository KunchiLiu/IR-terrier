For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair. 3. Biologic (antineoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur.

Monoclonal antibodies: At least 3 halflives of the antibody after the last dose of a monoclonal antibody. 6. XRT: At least 14 days after local palliative XRT (small port); at least 150 days must have elapsed if prior TBI, craniospinal XRT or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis; at least 42 days must have elapsed if other substantial BM radiation (e.g., stem cell Infusion without TBI and no evidence of active graft vs. host disease and at least 56 days must have elapsed after transplant or stem cell infusion). 8. Organ Function Requirements: 1. Adequate bone marrow function defined as: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC ≥1000/mm3) 2. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ mm3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment) 3. Patients with bone marrow metastatic disease will not be eligible. 4. Adequate renal function defined as: i. Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥ 70mL/min/1.73 m² or ii. Serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows: Age Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) Male Female 2 to &lt; 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to &lt; 10 years 1 1 10 to &lt; 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to &lt; 16 years 1.5 1.4 ≥ 16 years 1.7 1.4 The threshold creatinine values in this table were derived from the Schwartz formula for estimating GFR (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child length and stature data published by the CDC. iii. Urine protein: ≤ 30 mg/dL in urinalysis or ≤ 1+ on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is &lt; 1000 mg in a 24 hour urine sample. e. Adequate liver function defined as: i. Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age ii. SGPT (ALT) ≤ 110 U/L. For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L iii. Serum albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL f. Adequate coagulation status defined as: PT and INR ≤ 1.5x ULN g. Adequate pancreatic function defined as: Serum amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN h. Adequate blood pressure control defined as: A blood pressure (BP) ≤ the 95th percentile for age, height and gender and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension. Please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP. i. Central nervous system function defined as: Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if receiving nonenzyme inducing anticonvulsants and well controlled. j.
