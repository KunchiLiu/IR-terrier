	<brief_title>An Observational Study of the Correlation Between miRNA in Peripheral Blood and Prognosis in Patients With ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After consulting literature, we obtain 14 miRNAs related to ARDS and vascular endothelial cell(ARDS-VEC-miRNAs) and 2 biomarkers of scathing vascular endothelial.The ARDS-VEC-miRNAs include miR-15a-5p,miR-16-5p,miR-21-5p,miR-24-3p,miR-26a-5p,miR-27a-3p,miR-27b-3p,miR-126-3p,miR-150-5p,miR-146a-5p,miR-155-5p,miR-221-3p,miR-223-3p,miR-320a.The biomarkers of scathing vascular endothelial include vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1),von Willebrand factor(vWF).20 healthy controls and 60 patients diagnose as ARDS in ICU were included in this study.we blood every participants within 24 hours after enrollment and obtain the plasma.Then, we detecte ARDS-VEC-miRNAs,VCAM-1,vWF levels in plasma by real-time quantitative PCR,record the severity of the illness and survival status within 28 days of every patients.Finally,we evaluate the correlation between the value of miRNA related to ARDS and vascular endothelial cell and ARDS severity, vascular endothelial cell damaging degree，mortality in patients with ARDS.</detailed_description>
