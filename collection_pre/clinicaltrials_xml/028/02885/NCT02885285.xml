	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to learn about the impact of exercise on fatigue, anxiety, and depression in Parkinson's disease. It is well established that exercise improves the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, it is not clear which types of exercise are most beneficial for specific non-motor symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Three Distinct Exercise Types on Fatigue, Anxiety, and Depression in Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are recruiting 32 patients who will be randomized into either a spinning class, yoga class, dance class, or no exercise intervention. Classes will be conducted twice a week for 6 weeks total at times convenient for the patients. Patients will also be asked to complete questionnaires after exercise classes to see if the exercise intervention improves measures of fatigue, anxiety, and depression - and what exercise intervention may be superior.</detailed_description>
