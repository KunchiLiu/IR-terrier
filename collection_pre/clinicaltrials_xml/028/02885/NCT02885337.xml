	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis leads to reduced independence and quality of life. Total hip replacement is a successful and cost-effective surgical intervention to relieve pain and improve functioning in patients with osteoarthritis. Research has shown that pre-operative health status strongly predicts outcomes including physical function and hospitalization length after hip replacement surgery. Frail patients, in particular, are at greater risk of poor post-operative outcomes and could potentially benefit from interventions targeting an improvement in their health status prior to undergoing a hip replacement surgery. Partnering with Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare providers, this pilot trial will examine the feasibility of a multi-modal intervention for frail patients that includes a supervised exercise program, vitamin D and protein supplementation, and a medication review. The results of this feasibility study will guide the design of a future multi-center study, which if successful, could be developed into a routine model of care that is implemented in joint replacement programs across Ontario and ultimately improving the lives of frail seniors undergoing hip replacement.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design: The proposed study is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a pre-operative multi-modal intervention and standard care among pre-frail/frail patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery. Pre-frail (score of 1 or 2) or frail (score of 3-5; Fried Frailty Phenotype) patients, ≥ 65 years undergoing elective unilateral total hip replacement after at least 3 months will be recruited from the practices of 6 orthopedic surgeons (Hamilton Arthroplasty Group). A physiotherapist and research assistant (RA) will conduct the eligibility screening at the Regional Joint Assessment Program (Hamilton Health Sciences) during the appointment where the decision to operate is made (3-10 months prior to surgery). Patients with renal insufficiency, a neuromuscular disorder, active cancer or unstable medical conditions will be excluded. Stratified block randomization will be used to randomly allocate participants to the intervention or usual care arms of the study. The allocation sequence will be computer generated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.3. Once the study RA confirms the patient's eligibility, and obtain consent, the RA will fax the participants' eligibility forms, consent and contact to an off-site research member who will randomize the participant based on the random allocation sequence generated. Then a RA will call the participants to inform them if they fall in the intervention or control group and arrange the first visit. Multi-Modal Frailty Intervention (3-10 months) Exercise: A Registered Kinesiologist will develop an individualized exercise program and schedule appointments with the patient at home including goal setting discussion. Participants will be offered free YMCA membership to participate in the IN Motion program.The IN Motion program is designed for older adults and include gentle fit, hydrotherapy and walk fit classes along with health education sessions. Participants will be taught how to monitor their own heart rate and level of exertion using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion 10-point Scale. All participants will be encouraged to exercise at least 3 times per week for 45-60 minutes either at home and/or at YMCA IN Motion classes. The home exercise will incorporate aerobic, resistance training, flexibility and balance components. Patients will be provided with and asked to keep an exercise log-book. Cognitive-behavioral Change Strategy and education: Cognitive Behavioral Change Strategies (CBCS) may be an effective way to facilitate coaching strategies to increase participant exercise levels. In the current study, modules will be presented to participants in the event that they express any barriers to exercise. These barriers will vary based on: the individual, environment, and previous exercise behaviors. Throughout the intervention, CBC will be performed and administered by the Kinesiologist at home visits prior to the participants scheduled surgery. The administration of the modules will be dependent on the challenges that the participants express in relation to exercise (i.e., lack of time, motivation, social support, etc.). A definition of each strategy will be given to the participant; the Kinesiologist will then work through a worksheet with the participant. Also, the study kinesiologist will provide education to the participants about exercise, hip arthroplasty and osteoarthritis. Protein Supplement: Participants will be provided with twice-daily supplements (containing 20 gram protein, 1.5 g β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate /serving) to be taken with a meal or on activity days within 3-hours of exercise. Vitamin D: All participants in the intervention arm will be provided with a supply of Vitamin D3 (1000 IU/day tablets) for the duration of the intervention period. Medication Review: After randomization, a geriatrician will review the medications for patients in the intervention arm and provide written recommendations to the participant's family doctor. Control arm: Patients in the control arm will receive usual care which may include the recommendation to attend fitness classes before surgery; however these patients will not receive the more intensive assessment/intervention of the Kinesiologist and other intervention components. Control participants will be asked pre-operatively and post-operatively to indicate whether or not they exercise, take protein or vitamin supplements. For participants in intervention and control groups will, 1) be monitored for their YMCA attendance and 2) be instructed on the completion a dietary intake log that indicate the type of food and amount over a four-day period in order to calculate energy and micronutrient consumption. Then a RA will call the participants to collect their food intake.</detailed_description>
