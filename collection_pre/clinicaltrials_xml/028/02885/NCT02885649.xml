	<brief_summary>This pilot phase 0 trial studies how well enzalutamide works before surgery in treating patients with kidney cancer. Androgens are a type of hormone produced by the body that may cause kidney tumors to grow. Anti-hormone therapy, such as enzalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens produced by the body and keep kidney tumors from growing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To investigate the effects of neoadjuvant enzalutamide on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). OUTLINE: Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) daily for 90 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo partial or radical nephrectomy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>
