	<brief_summary>Pain is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) but the physiology remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) could make a profit on the pain in PD. The investigator would drive a study with a follow up of PD patients before and after STN-DBS. The pain will be clinically explored by targeted questionnaires and electrophysiological through laser evoked potentials. The questionnaires are designed to quantify and characterize the pain in these patients. Laser evoked potentials will, through repetitive stimulation, study both the functional status of the afferent nociceptive pathways, their habituation to repetitive nociceptive stimuli, and so better understand any abnormalities of the central processing of nociceptive information.</brief_summary>
