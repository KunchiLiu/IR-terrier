	<brief_summary>The pathophysiological features of myocardial diabetic subject combined with cardiac autonomic neuropathy were behind the quietness of myocardial ischemia, known as silent myocardial ischemia (IMS). These patients have the risk to remain asymptomatic until the sudden onset of a myocardial infarction, or even sudden death. That is why the investigators want to evaluate the contribution of non-invasive tools to stand in the diagnosis of IMS patients with diabetes type 2, asymptomatic heart on map: Technical myocardial speckle tracking in studying strains overall average left ventricular (longitudinal, circumferential and radial) measured in 2D and 3D at rest, compared to stress echocardiography with dobutamine (ESD)</brief_summary>
