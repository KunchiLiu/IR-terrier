	<brief_summary>The current management of osteoarthritis is based on non-pharmacological and pharmacological means which include intra-articular injections. The recommendations on the management of hip osteoarthritis stipulate that intra-articular injections of corticosteroid may be considered in patients with an exacerbation not responding to oral treatments. Several recent studies show the effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroids compared with anesthetics. The intra-articular injection of viscosupplementation alone has never been validated in this indication since controlled studies did not show efficacy over placebo. At present, viscosupplementation is considered an anti-osteoarthritic symptomatic slow-acting and its interest is not yet established in hip osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
