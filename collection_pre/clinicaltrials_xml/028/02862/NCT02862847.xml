	<brief_summary>Cosavirus and Salivirus are two new genera of Picornaviridae and are responsible for acute diarrhoea. They have been identified in the pathological stools of infants and immuno-compromised subjects on every continent with prevalences ranging from 2.8% to 8.8% depending on the virus, the cohort and the country studied. To date, no study on these two viruses has been conducted in France to evaluate the circulation and the pathogenicity of these viruses in subjects with diarrhoea. The aim of this study is thus to: - show that these viruses are in circulation in France in infants younger than 5 years old and that the proportions are similar to those reported in the literature. - confirm the relationship between the diarrhoea and the infection with these viruses.</brief_summary>
