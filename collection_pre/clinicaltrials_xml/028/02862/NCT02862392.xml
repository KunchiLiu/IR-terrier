	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that progressive AIS is characterized by a disorder of orthostatic postural control. The analysis and the treatment of posturographic signal on computerized integrate force plates, coupled to clinical and radiographic examinations, could highlight predictive and reliable factors at the moment of diagnosis. Thus, it could help the clinician in his therapeutic approach, based on the postural control improvement (individualized prescription in kinesitherapy, better adaptation to orthopedic treatments by corset). This method is non-invasive, without side effects, fast and achievable in routine care at the moment of the diagnosis of AIS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Progressive Factors of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a tridimensional spine deformation affecting 2% of subjects between 10 and 16 years-old being predominant among girls. It is a severe, progressive and multifactorial disease, and a genetic origin is currently admitted. AIS is progressive (in 3 out of 10 cases) when the scoliosis radiographic frontal angle (Cobb angle) strictly increases by 5째 between the diagnosis date and the end of growth. This progression can be severe requiring heavy treatments (corset, surgery) and it can generate adverse effects (spine pain, cardio-respiratory and functional consequences on walking). The lack of reliable criteria to predict the evolution of AIS is a real problem for the therapeutic decision and it can impact the socio-economic cost of the disease. Several studies show orthostatic postural control anomalies in AIS. The orthostatic postural control is elaborated from the central integration of different sensorial signals (visual, somesthesic and vestibular). Posturography, on computerized integrate force plates, allows to quantify sensorial components of orthostatic postural control. This technique can confirm the disorders of orthostatic postural control in AIS, but the parameters used can not evaluate with precision the progressive potential. The posturographic signal analysis could lead to the implementation of therapeutic strategies adapted to progressive risk. Moreover, this method could prevent the progression in major scoliosis, limit the use of radiography, the application of a constraining corset (worn 23 hours a day) and the possibility of heavy surgery (extent arthrodesis). The hypothesis of this study is that progressive AIS is characterized by a disorder of orthostatic postural control. The analysis and the treatment of posturographic signal on computerized integrate force plates, coupled to clinical and radiographic examinations, could highlight predictive and reliable factors at the moment of diagnosis. Thus, it could help the clinician in his therapeutic approach, based on the postural control improvement (individualized prescription in kinesitherapy, better adaptation to orthopedic treatments by corset). This method is non-invasive, without side effects, fast and achievable in routine care at the moment of the diagnosis of AIS.</detailed_description>
