	<criteria>1. Age 18~65 years old, male or female; 2. Life expectancy≥6 months; 3. ECOG score: 03; 4. Advanced solid tumor (lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer) were diagnosed by pathological or clinical physicians; 5. Enough venous channel, no other contraindications to the separation and collection of white blood cells; 6. Immunohistochemistry and RTPCR technology will be used to determine the positive EGFR family (including EGFR, HER2, HER4) and IGFR1 protein. At least one protein expressed in immunohistochemical tumor tissue should be no less than grade 2 or 2+ scores. The levels of protein are defined as follows: (according to cell staining) : grade 0: without staining; grade 1: 125%; grade 2: 2650% and grade 3: 51100%; (According to the intensity): negative; 1+; 2+ and 3+; 7. Laboratory examination: white blood cell≥3 x 10*9/L, blood platelet count≥60 x 10*/L, hemoglobin≥85g/L; lymphocyte count≥15%, total bilirubin≤100 mol/L; ALT and AST less than five times of the normal level; serum creatinine less than 1.5 times of the normal level； 8. Signed informed consent； 9. Women of childbearing age must have evidence of negative pregnancy test and be willing to practice birth control after 2 weeks following the cells transfusion. 1. Expected Overall survival ＜ 6 months; 2. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, unstable coronary disease (uncontrolled arrhythmias, unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure (&gt; Class II, NYHA), or myocardial infarction within 6 months. 3. Abnormal lung function: FEV (forced expiratory volume) &lt; 30% prediction, DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) &lt; 30% prediction, blood oxygen saturation &lt; 90%; 4. Other serious diseases: nervous, mental disorders, immune regulatory diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, etc; 5. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, or fail to comply with the test requirements.</criteria>
