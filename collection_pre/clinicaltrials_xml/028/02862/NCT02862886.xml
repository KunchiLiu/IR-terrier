	<brief_summary>CHRONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 1. Information provided to study participants 2. Collection of written informed consent 3. Harvesting of myometrial biopsies 4. Creation of tissue explants using myometrial biopsies 5. Stimulation of the explants with LPS 6. Study of the effect of SAR150640 (beta3-adrenergic agonist) on LPS-induced oxidative stress Moreover, demonstrating the ability of beta3-adrenergic receptor agonists to prevent the appearance of oxidative stress and its consequences on tissues, as a complement to previous studies, is an additional argument for the clinical development of this class of pharmaceuticals in the management of threatened premature delivery and labour induction.</brief_summary>
