	<brief_summary>As glycaemic variability on the one hand and hypoglycaemia on the other are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, they are likely, in type-1 diabetic patients, to affect the oxidation of lipoproteins and HDL function, by altering their anti-atherogenic properties. The aim of this study is thus to determine, in patients with Type 1 Diabetic (T1D) who will wear a glycaemic Holter for 1 week, the glycaemia parameters (mean glycaemia, duration of hypoglycaemia, duration of hyperglycaemia, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions) associated with proatherogenic alterations in lipoproteins, in particular: - LDL oxidation - HDL oxidation and alterations of HDL function (anti-inflammatory capacity, antioxidant capacity)</brief_summary>
