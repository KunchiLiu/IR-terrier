	<brief_summary>The risk of falling affects more than one third of people over 65 years old and over 50% of persons over 80 years. These falls have important consequences for the autonomy of the elderly patient and also increase the risk of sequelae and death. The goal of this study is to evaluate a personalized rehabilitation program for elderly patients that fall for the first time and to measure the impact on the fear of falling of these patients. This intervention is a home-based program combining exercises, home modifications and education on fall risk factors.</brief_summary>
