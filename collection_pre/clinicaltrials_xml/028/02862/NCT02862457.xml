	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase I study of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and INCB024360 (epacadostat) in participants with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of INCB024360 administered alone and in combination with MK-3475.</brief_summary>
