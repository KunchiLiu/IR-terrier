	<brief_title>SGLT2 Inhibition in Diabetes and Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that Sodium-GLucose coTransporters (SGLT)-2 inhibition will improve cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) in patients with systolic heart failure. Participants treated with SGLT2 inhibitor Empagliflozin as standard of care will undergo assessments described below. The investigators will measure CRF with a validated cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment received as standard of care, to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition improves cardio-respiratory fitness assessed by changes in peak oxygen consumption (VO2)(mL/kg/min) and minute ventilation (VE)/carbon dioxide production (VCO2) slope, powerful independent clinical predictors of mortality in HF.</detailed_description>
