	<brief_summary>The intravenous injection of 8mg of ondansetron (a serotonin type 3 receptor antagonist) before spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section, leads to a smaller reduction in systolic arterial pressure (SAP). The expected results are a decrease in the frequency and severity of hypotension, thus leading to improved comfort for the mother and decreased maternal and foetal morbidity. Indeed, episodes of hypotension are responsible for impaired foeto-placental circulation, with sometimes severe consequences for neonates. It has been established that episodes of hypotension alter foetal pH. Investigators therefore hope to see a smaller reduction in SAP in the ondansetron group, and show a benefit for the infant. One of the objectives of this study is also to observe a decrease in the quantity of vasopressors used and thus to avoid the adverse effects of their use in high doses. The expected results are thus an improvement in haemodynamic stability during spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. The originality of this project lies in the use of a CNAP monitor (Continuous Non-invasive Arterial Pressure) as the collection of haemodynamic data will allow greater precision with the continuous measurement of AP, as well as a study of maternal cardiac output.</brief_summary>
