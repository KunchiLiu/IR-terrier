	<brief_summary>A first empirical evidence on the difficulties of observance of morphine in cancer patients invited a multidisciplinary team to initiate an innovative quality approach. It shows the lack of transcript of a comprehensive care causing a problem for monitoring actions undertaken for the relief of pain. In addition, two exploratory studies targeting the expectations and needs of the Patient Therapeutic Education (E.T.P) receiving strong opioids. The E.T.P, public health priority, provides a framework for action and improving care. In oncology, the involvement of the patient in pain relief and management of opioids represents an axis of intervention more appropriate. Yet, it is not found in literature. In our department, we conduct an experimental therapeutic education program type "caratif" and a nurse consultation FTE receiving opioids on the model of nursing "care" of J. Watson (humanist emphasis promoting interpersonal teaching-learning mobilizing the patient experience). The ETP folder and its tools have been continuously validated with patients. The heart of the educational process is in the patient's complex path neat oncology and relies on interaction and creativity between patient and caregivers.</brief_summary>
