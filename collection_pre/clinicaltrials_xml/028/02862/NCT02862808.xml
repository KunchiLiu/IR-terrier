	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of syndromic or isolated severe intellectual disability (IQ &lt;50) without a molecular diagnosis Recurrence in siblings (multiplex families) suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance (with or without parental consanguinity) or sporadic cases from a consanguineous union Conventional genetic tests performed (including arrayCGH) and MRI/CTscan available DNA samples from parents and from both unaffected or affected siblings available, for parental segregation and confirmation of candidate variations identified. Availability of a signed informed consent To be affiliated or beneficiary of French social security/healthcare system Parents in the exclusion period of another study or as provided by the national register of volunteers Highprobability diagnostic hypothesis for which a molecular test is available at lower cost than exome sequencing</criteria>
