	<brief_summary>In this prospective, randomized, double blinded study, the needle tip and needle shaft visibility of echogenic and nonechogenic needle were compared in ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Sixty patients scheduled for upper extremity surgery were included in the study. Patients were randomised into two groups, group E (Echogenic) and group NE (Nonechogenic) with 30 subjects in each group. Under ultrasound guidance infraclavicular brachial plexus block was performed. In Group E, Pajunk Sonoplex echogenic needle was used and in Group NE, Stimuplex Braun nonechogenic needle was used. The subjective assessment for needle tip/shaft visibility as scored by the performer and the objective assessment from the recorded block procedure video were noted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Echogenic and Nonechogenic Needles in Ultrasound Guided Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the investigators study was to find out the better among the echogenic and nonechogenic needle in needle tip/shaft visibility and the block success rate in ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block. Sixty patients were randomized into two groups, Group E (echogenic group) and Group NE (nonechogenic group) with thirty patients in each group. The ultrasound imaging of each nerve block was video recorded for later analysis. Recording commenced from skin puncture and stopped at the time of final needle removal (total block time). After each block the performer was asked to subjectively score the percentage time he had visualized the needle tip and needle shaft on a 5 point scale (1 = 0%-20%, 2 = 20%-40%, 3 = 40%- 60%, 4 = 60%-80%, 5 = 80%-100%). The recorded video was later analysed by an investigator. An objective measurement of percentage needle tip visibility and needle shaft visibility was calculated for each nerve block using the formula, Time in view (needle tip) / total block time x 100 Time in view (needle shaft) / total block time x 100 The subjective assessment for needle tip/shaft visibility as scored by the performer and the objective assessment from the recorded block procedure video were noted. Other block parameters were also compared.</detailed_description>
