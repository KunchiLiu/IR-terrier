Participants under evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological disease Use of investigational agents within 3 months of screening, unless allowed by the Sponsor Use of any prohibited medications Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with participant compliance Known hypersensitivity to study drugs, metabolites or formulation excipients Lactating females or those who may wish to become pregnant during the course of the study NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
