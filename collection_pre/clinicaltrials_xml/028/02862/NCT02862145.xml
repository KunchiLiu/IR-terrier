	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the biomarkers, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the liposomal micro-ribonucleic acid-34 (microRNA-34, miR-34). Melanoma patients with easily accessible lesions will undergo serial biopsies and serial blood samples will be collected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamics Study of MRX34, MicroRNA Liposomal Injection in Melanoma Patients With Biopsy Accessible Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MRX34 Induction Therapy consists of 3 cycles of MRX34 treatment given over an approximately 8 week period. Dexamethasone 10 mg PO (or IV) will be given as premedication. On Days 1-5 of each treatment cycle, MRX34 will be given as a daily infusion followed by 16 days of rest. At screening a tumor biopsy sample will be required from all patients. Additional biopsies will be collected at Cycle 1 Day 3 and the end of Cycles 1 and 3 (Day 18 +/- 1 day)</detailed_description>
