	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect the data on the safety and potential effectiveness of intra-tumor injection of MG7-CART cells under ultrasound guidance in patients with liver metastases expressing MG7 positively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of MG7 Redirected Autologous T Cells for Advanced MG7 Positive Liver Metastases(MG7-CART)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Designer T cells are prepared by PBMC which from patients by leukapheresis, and then activated and re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for MG7, which is a glycosylated protein of CEA. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the participant by intra-tumor injection at the dose of (1-6)×108 CAR positive T cells. The cells perfusion process would last for 1min to 2min. The dose of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide will be given two days before CART cell infusion.</detailed_description>
