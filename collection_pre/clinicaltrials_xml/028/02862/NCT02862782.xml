	<brief_summary>Background The trigger for the final maturation of the ovum by providing integration of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and Gonadotropin - releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist was first introduced long ago, but clinically not accepted until the advent of GnRH antagonist protocol in IVF treatment. In a recently published work which compared two types of ovulation induction (standard dose of hcg and in combination of GnRH agonist) in women with normal ovarian response, there was a statistically significant increase in the rates of implantation, clinical pregnancies and live births rates by providing integration of hCG and GnRH agonist. To conclude, providing GnRH agonist in combination of hCF in standard dose is today an accepted treatment for final maturation of the ovums. OBJECTIVE The investigators objective is to investigate whether providing integrated treatment of Gonadotropin - releasing hormone (GnRH) Agonist and human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) to final maturation of the ovum can improve the quality of the embryos, clinical pregnancies and live births rates in women treated with GnRH Antagonist protocol. The main objective is to compare between two existing treatments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The trigger for the final maturation of the ovum by providing integration of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and Gonadotropin - releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist was first introduced long ago, but clinically not accepted until the advent of GnRH antagonist protocol in IVF treatment. In order to prevent Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome in the treatment cycles with GnRH antagonist protocol, it is possible to make the final maturation of the ovums by providing GnRH agonist. In a recently published work which compared two types of ovulation induction (standard dose of hcg and in combination of GnRH agonist) in women with normal ovarian response, there was a statistically significant increase in the rates of implantation, clinical pregnancies and live births rates by providing integration of hCG and GnRH agonist.
