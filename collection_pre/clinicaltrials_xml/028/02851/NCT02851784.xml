	<brief_title>Combination Therapy of Microwave Ablation and Cellular Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCC (D ≤5 cm, fewer than three tumors) patients were treated with radical MWA and 4-6 courses of immunotherapy with CIK every year. The immunotherapy were started at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, 18 weeks and then every 12 weeks after MWA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were differentiated into phenotypically confirmed DCs and effector cells. DC-CIK and CTL were injected into the abdominal cavity. CIK was infused intravenously. The safety, survival effect and peripheral T-lymphocyte subsets of combination therapy group will be recorded and compared with those of MWA group.</detailed_description>
