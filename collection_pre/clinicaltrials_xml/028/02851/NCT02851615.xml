	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SCThrive, a an innovative, technology-enhanced, group self-management intervention that uses a mixed in-person and online format and supported by a tailored mHealth tool, iManage. The study will also evaluate the initial efficacy of SCThrive for increasing behavioral activation (BA) in adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) ages 13 to 21. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the SCThrive group will show greater BA (primary outcome) at post-treatment than the attention control group, and that participants in the SCThrive group will continue to show significantly greater BA at the six week follow-up compared to the attention control group. Investigators will also explore whether SCThrive is associated with greater improvements in self-management behaviors and quality of life (secondary outcome) compared to attention control at the six-week follow-up assessment.</brief_summary>
