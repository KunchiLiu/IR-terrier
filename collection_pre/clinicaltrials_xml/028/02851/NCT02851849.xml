	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) during 12 weeks of treatment with 3 dose levels of LGD-6972 compared to placebo in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of LGD-6972 in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel group, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LGD-6972 in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (a stable [≥12 weeks], daily dose of ≥1000mg at randomization). Subjects with T2DM will be treated with one of 3 dose levels of LGD-6972 (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo once daily (QD) for 12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by HbAlc ≤8.5% or &gt;8.5% at the Placebo Lead-in Visit. Qualified subjects who require adjustment or stabilization of their metformin dose will participate in a run-in period of up to 12 additional weeks prior to randomization. Subjects will have the option to participate in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and end of treatment for assessment of exploratory endpoints.</detailed_description>

Male subjects must either have a vasectomy or agree that they and any female partners will use 2 acceptable forms of contraception, one of which must be a condom, until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Other acceptable forms of contraception include hormonal contraceptives that have been at stable dose for 12 weeks prior to randomization, intrauterine device, DepoProvera®, Norplant® System Implants, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly. Also, male subjects must not donate sperm during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug 3. Willing and able to provide written informed consent 4.

History or evidence of QT prolongation or clinically significant QT prolongation (QTcF &gt;450 msec) at screening, or other significant ECG findings at screening that may place the subject at increased risk by participating in the study 14. Treatment with any type of insulin (injected or inhaled) for &gt; 6 consecutive days within 6 months prior to screening or any insulin therapy within 12 weeks prior to screening 15. Treated with peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorgamma agonists (thiazolidinediones [TZDs]), incretin therapy (GLP1 agonists). or amylin mimetics within 12 weeks prior to screening 16.
