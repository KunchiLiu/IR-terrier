	<brief_summary>Whole body vibration (WBV) acutely improves quadriceps strength, and may improve long-term outcomes in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, it is unclear if WBV influences athletic tasks such as running.

	<brief_title>Whole Body Vibration on Running Biomechanics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have deficits in quadriceps muscles function that influences walking and running biomechanics. In the long term, alterations in walking and running contribute to physical disability and the development of knee osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, rehabilitation for the quadriceps muscles is often ineffective, and novel strategies to improve rehabilitation efforts are needed. Whole body vibration (WBV) acutely improves quadriceps strength, and may improve long-term outcomes in individuals with ACLR. However, it is unclear if WBV influences athletic tasks such as running. Specific Aim 1: The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of WBV on running biomechanics in individuals with ACLR. The investigators hypothesize that WBV will improve running characteristics associated with knee osteoarthritis development.</detailed_description>
