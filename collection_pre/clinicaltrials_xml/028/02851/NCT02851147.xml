	<brief_summary>The purpose of the evaluation is to confirm operability and usability of the SL-D301 Slit Lamp and the DC-4 digital camera attachment by conducting a usability evaluation and subsequently submitting a questionnaire and hold an interview with the operator. Of special interest for the study is to confirm whether the illumination level of SL-D301 is enough to perform an eye exam since the maximum illumination level on the SL-D301 is lower than other existing Topcon digital ready slit lamps due to regulations that limit the maximum light intensity on the human eye. The SL-D301 will be compared against the predicate device SL-3G.</brief_summary>
