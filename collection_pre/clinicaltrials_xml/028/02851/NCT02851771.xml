	<brief_summary>A point-of-care laboratory (POC) was set at North Hospital, Marseille, France for the diagnosis in less than two hours of pneumonia caused by known pathogens, close to the reception of Emergency service. In this instance 30% of patients have no etiological diagnosis after the POC tests Pneumonia. This lab has discovered over 200 new species of bacteria in humans, including vector bacteria and opened the field of large Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA ) viruses. Also, the laboratory of emerging viruses discovered many Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA) viruses transmitted by arthropods. Based on this collection of new pathogens described in POC laboratory, this study proposes to expand the etiological diagnosis strategy of pneumonia after POC tests.</brief_summary>
