	<brief_title>Outpatient Biofeedback in Addition to Home Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that outpatient BF added to home PFMT results in increased frequency of home exercises sets per month performed by the patients and objective cure rate after 3 months of supervised training. Secondarily, to investigate other subjective and objective clinical parameters in the groups that received or not BF together with PFMT after 3 months of supervised training, and in a longer term of 9-month follow-up. Method: 72 incontinent women were randomized to the: BF Group (outpatient BF + home PFMT) or PFMT Group (outpatient PFMT + home PFMT). Assessments: baseline after 3 months of supervised treatment and at 9-month follow-up (after 6 additional months of home PFMT without supervision). Primary outcomes: adherence - monthly exercises sets performed (exercise diary) and objective cure of SUI (pad test) after 3 months. Secondary outcomes: urinary symptoms, muscle function, quality of life, adhesion and subject cure at the two time-points.</detailed_description>
