	<brief_summary>A randomized two-phase clinical trial will enroll 360 participants with age-related cognitive decline, but not Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative diseases (MoCA&gt;25). Cognitively healthy elderly adults will undergo a CT intervention or education training-control (TC) condition in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or sham tDCS control. The CT intervention will employ a suite of adaptive training tasks (Double Decision - Useful Field of View, Card Shark - Working Memory, and Freeze Frame - Arousal-Alerting) from the POSIT Science Brain HQ6, a well validated CT method for enhancing cognitive functioning in the elderly. TC will involve exposure to educational nature videos and related content questions of the same interval and duration as CT, providing a well-matched active control. Participants will receive CT or TC in conjunction with tDCS or sham/placebo prefrontal stimulation administered during training. Participants will be assessed at baseline, after CT (12 weeks), and at 12-month follow-up. At each time point, a comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of brain function, metabolic state, and brain structure will be conducted. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) will be used to assess brain response during working memory, attention and memory encoding. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will assess cerebral metabolites and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations. GABA concentrations from MRS will provide a sensitive marker of neuro-plastic change in task-associated brain regions. Alzheimer's disease risk factors (APOE4, familial history), baseline clinical/demographic characteristics (e.g., diabetes), and neuroimaging biomarkers (e.g., white matter abnormality load) will assess factors with predictive value for individual response to tDCS and CT. Based on power analyses of intervention effects, 80 participants will be randomized to the four treatment conditions in phase 1. Following the intervention, CT (n=40) and TC (n=40) conditions will be compared. Interim analyses aimed at showing that CT has previously established strong effects on cognitive outcomes will be performed, thereby enabling elimination of the TC condition. Phase 2 will enroll the remaining 280 participants into the two CT intervention conditions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 65 to 90 years; this age group was selected because it is at high risk of agerelated cognitive decline and have a sufficiently long life expectancy to participate in the study; Evidence of agerelated cognitive decline in at least one of the three training domains, as defined by performance Â½ standard deviation below normative function on NIH Toolbox derived composite measures of Attention/Executive Function (Dimensional Card Sort, Flanker Task), Working Memory (Picture Sequence, List Sorting); or Processing Speed (Pattern Comparison, Oral Digit Symbol). Ability to participate in the intervention and attend training sessions; Willingness to be randomized to either treatment group; Failure to provide informed consent; Lives in a nursing home; persons living in assisted or independent housing will not be excluded; Cancer in active treatment currently, besides skin cancer; Severe arthritis or disability that limits use of hands, cannot press buttons or press a keyboard key for tasks; Significant cognitive impairment, defined as a known diagnosis of MCI or dementia, Alzheimer's disease or a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score &lt; 25. Scores will be adjusted for education and ethnicity. Unable to communicate because of severe hearing loss or speech disorder; Severe visual impairment, which would preclude completion of the assessments and/or intervention; Progressive, degenerative neurologic disease, e.g., Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, ALS; Terminal illness with life expectancy less than 12 months, as determined by a physician; Stroke involving a large vessel (Mini stroke/TIA may be allowed; leukoaraiosis on neuroimaging is allowed unless present with VaD or VCI diagnosis); Brain Tumor or any foreign body known or previously identified in brain; Currently on gabaergic or glutamatergic medications, or sodium channel blockers, which alter or block the ability of tDCS to facilitate tissue excitability. Severe cardiac disease, including NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure, clinically significant aortic stenosis, history of cardiac arrest, use of a cardiac defibrillator, or uncontrolled angina; Severe uncontrolled diabetes with medication noncompliance, diabetic coma, or frequent insulin reactions; Severe uncontrolled hypertension, e.g., SBP &gt; 200, DBP &gt; 110 mmHg; Other significant comorbid disease that in the opinion of the PI would impair ability to participate in the intervention, e.g. renal failure on hemodialysis, severe psychiatric disorder (e.g. bipolar, schizophrenia), excessive alcohol use (&gt;14 drinks per week); Member of household is already enrolled; Lives outside of the study site or is planning to move out of the area in next 2 years or leave the area for &gt;3 months during the next year; Contraindications to MRI: claustrophobia, any kind of metallic stents or ferrous metal objects in the body, heart valve prosthesis, defibrillator, pacemaker, aneurysm clip, neurostimulation system, cochlear implants, inner ear prosthesis, insulin pump or other infusion pump or other implanted device; ia:</criteria>
