	<brief_summary>Apneas concern about 85% of premature newborns (NB) born after less than 34 weeks of pregnancy. They are considered as an important risk factor for subsequent neuropsychological deficiency. Current pharmacological treatments are not very effective, and have side effects (agitation, irritability, sleep disorders, tachycardia). Some studies suggest that in NBs with apneas resisting to drugs, a permanent odorisation with a drop of vanillin on the incubator's pillow might reduce the frequency of apneas. This latin square design study will test a controlled olfactory stimulation method, i.e. an olfactometer which controls the odor duration, intensity, and sequence using three different odors, to reduce apneic episodes measured using 24-registration of heart and respiratory rates.</brief_summary>
