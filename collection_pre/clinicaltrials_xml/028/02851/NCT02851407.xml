	<criteria>1. Patient must be above the age of 1 month as of the start date of study treatment. 2. Patient must be scheduled to undergo allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (adults or pediatric patients) or autologous HSCT (pediatric patients only) and be at high risk or very high risk of developing venoocclusive disease (VOD). 3. Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study period and for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug; male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception for 6 months after the last dose of study drug. 4. Patient and/or the legal guardian or representative must be able to understand and sign a written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines. 1. Patient has hemodynamic instability within 24 hours before the start of study treatment. 2. Patient has acute bleeding that is clinically significant within 24 hours before the start of study treatment. 3. Patient used any medication that increases the risk of bleeding within 24 hours before the start of study treatment. 4. Patient is using or plans to use an investigational agent for the prevention or treatment of VOD. 5. Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study. 6. Patient has a psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient or legal guardian or representative from giving informed consent and/or assent. 7. Patient has a serious active disease or comorbid medical condition, as judged by the investigator, which would interfere with the conduct of this study. 8.
