	<brief_summary>Heart surgery is a considerable source of stress for the myocardium that must be minimized. Troponin Ic is a reliable marker to determine the level of this myocardial stress. Studies have shown that post-conditioning with AVH has a protective effect on the myocardium, if the treatment is initiated at the start of the ischemia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect on the myocardium (by measuring troponin levels) of the association of pre-conditioning and post-conditioning with Sevoflurane (AVH) sedation administered during and after scheduled surgery for valve replacement, via sternotomy or thoracotomy compared with total intravenous anaesthesia with Propofol.</brief_summary>
