	<brief_summary>HDL in obese non-diabetic patients show major alterations in their function and thus their cardio-protective effects. These alterations could be explained by the quantitative and qualitative anomalies in the phospholipids and sphingolipids in the HDL. These molecules play a major role in HDL function and probably present early modifications in obesity, even before the onset of glycaemia deregulation. The aim of this study is to show the presence of qualitative and quantitative modifications of phospholipids and sphingolipids in HDL from obese patients compared with HDL from non-obese controls.</brief_summary>
