	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk in intra-operative nasal hemorrhage when using a "pushed" probe (Master Ka) in the treatment of naso lacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). In the investigator's experience, this risk seemed to minus using a pushed probe rather than the classical pulled-type probes. A lower risk of hemorrhage could lead to a change in the anesthetic procedure. The gold standard in NLDO is the use of an orotracheal intubation. It could then be replaced by the use of an orolaryngeal mask. A forthcoming study will evaluate the results of this anesthetic change.</brief_summary>
