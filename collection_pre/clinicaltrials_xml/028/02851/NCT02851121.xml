	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to better understand the link between motor system (action) and perception in variable sensorial forms by examining the time course and the dynamic of electroencephalography (EEG) activations. To do so, differents sensimotor study protocols in linguistics and in the fiels of emotional and spatial perception will be realised in order to study prcisely differents links parception-action.</brief_summary>
