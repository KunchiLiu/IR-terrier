	<brief_summary>This controlled weight loss trial in adults at cardiometabolic risk (elevated triglyceride/HDL ratio) followed a randomized, cross-over design and utilized novel, high-protein pasta and cereal to examine the physiological impact of stealth substitution of dietary carbohydrate with protein derived from soy concentrates, wheat protein isolates, and dried egg whites. Pasta dishes were prepared using high-protein orzo and fusilli pasta (Zone PastaRxTM) or conventional, gluten-free pasta, and high-protein flaked cereal (ZoneTM cereal) was matched with conventional flaked cereal. Participants were instructed to follow an energy restricted diet (-500 kcal/d) and incorporate a test food into each of three meals over a 24-hour period. The diet-induced changes in body mass and lean body mass were tracked as well as changes in in insulin sensitivity and common blood biomarkers.</brief_summary>
