	<brief_title>Cognitive Enhancement Through Transcranial Laser Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of LLLT to enhance neurocognitive function in middle-aged adults and examine the modulating influences of carotid atherosclerosis. The specific aims will be accomplished in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by examining cognitive test performance and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to a working memory task in middle-aged adults pre- and post- six-week long intervention of LLLT or placebo. In addition, the investigators will examine if carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) moderates the therapeutic effects of LLLT.</detailed_description>
