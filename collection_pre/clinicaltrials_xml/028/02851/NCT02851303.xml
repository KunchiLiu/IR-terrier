	<brief_summary>This study investigates the use of methadone versus morphine wean for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome for infants exposed to opioids in utero. Half of infants who require pharmacotherapy for NAS will receive a methadone wean, and half will receive a morphine wean. Length of hospital stay, length of treatment and parent satisfaction will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Morphine Versus Methadone for Opiate Exposed Infants With Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates exposed to opiates in utero can develop a constellation of withdrawal symptoms known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Infants with NAS are at risk for multiple medical complications including failure to thrive and seizures, they often require prolonged hospital stays and account for significant health care costs. At University of New Mexico, infants exposed to methadone or heroin in utero who develop NAS requiring pharmacologic treatment undergo a treatment wean with methadone, whereas infants exposed to buprenorphine undergo a wean with morphine. However, morphine is used frequently to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome among methadone-exposed infants throughout the US, and optimal pharmacologic treatment for NAS remains unknown. Anecdotal evidence at the investigators institution suggests that infants treated with morphine have shorter hospital stays compared to infants treated with methadone. Investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate morphine vs methadone treatment of infants with in-utero methadone or heroin exposure. Specifically, length of treatment, need for additional medication to treat withdrawal, and length of hospital stay will be compared. When women are admitted to Labor and Delivery and/or up to 12 hours postpartum, research staff will approach patients about study enrollment. Participants will be approached for study enrollment if medication list on admission includes methadone, if participants self-report methadone use prenatally, and/ or if urine drug screen is positive for methadone or opiates on admission. If women choose to enroll in the study, and their infants require treatment for NAS, their infants will be randomized and assigned a study number for treatment using the methadone or morphine protocols at the time treatment is required. All infants will be monitored for signs of withdrawal using the standard UNM NAS scoring protocol. Standard of care at UNM is to treat infants exposed to opioids in-utero with methadone if they require pharmacologic therapy for NAS, therefore treatment will not be withheld if they choose not to enroll in the study. Standard of care is also to obtain a urine drug screen on all infants with reported exposure to opiates in pregnancy. Enrolled patients will thus undergo routine urine drug screening. The only difference from standard care with regards to the study protocol is the treatment of half of the methadone or heroin exposed infants with morphine. The morphine protocol is proven for safety and efficacy currently in buprenorphine exposed infants. Once randomized, infants will continue on the protocol until discharge. At discharge, parents will complete a patient satisfaction survey.</detailed_description>
