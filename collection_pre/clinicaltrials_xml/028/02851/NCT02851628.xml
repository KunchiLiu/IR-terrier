	<brief_title>The Evaluation of a Gender-based Sizing Model in Comparison of a Conventional Sizing Model for Full Face Masks in the Treatment of OSA in Terms of Performance and Comfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation is a prospective non-blinded and non-randomized investigation. The investigation is designed to assess the gender-based sizing which the Genos mask concept is based on and how it compares to a conventional sizing present in the Prototype Full Face Mask (PFFM) mask. A cohort of up to 38 pre-determined current nasal and full face mask users will be recruited by Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare in Auckland New Zealand, Waikato DHB in Hamilton New Zealand, Hawkes Bay DHB in Hastings New Zealand and WellSleep Centre in Wellington New Zealand. The study will involve baseline (visit one) gathering the participants' prescribed PAP therapy pressure and their usual mask (to have up-to-date records). The next visit (visit 2) 7 ± 4 days after visit 1, the participants will be fit the Prototype Full Face Mask (PFFM) mask. At visit 3, which will be after 7 ± 4 days from visit 2, the participants will be given the Genos Full Face mask. At visit 4, 7 ± 4 days after visit 3, all masks and devices will be collected from the participants.</detailed_description>
