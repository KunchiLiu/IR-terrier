	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a robust therapeutic intervention to ameliorate myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion injury and significantly decrease morbidity and mortality in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), by direct injection of autogeneic mitochondria into the ischemic myocardium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transplantation of Autologously Derived Mitochondria Following Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle biopsies will be collected during the subject's clinically indicated operative procedure. The removal of these biopsy specimens does not extend operative time or require alteration of normal surgical procedures or approach. These samples will then be processed for mitochondria abstraction. Prior studies demonstrate that the number of mitochondria obtained from the same size biopsy provides approximately 1 x 10^10 viable mitochondria. Autologous mitochondria (4 x 10^7/mL) are transplanted epicardially using a 1 mL insulin syringe with a 28 gage needle to the damaged area via 5-10 injections. Total injection volume is roughly 0.8 mL (3.2 x 10^7 mitochondria). Therapy will be delivered at bedside in the CICU during open chest procedure or in the cardiac OR during re-operative procedure. A portable hood will be brought to bedside to isolate mitochondria. All equipment and solutions will be medical grade.</detailed_description>
