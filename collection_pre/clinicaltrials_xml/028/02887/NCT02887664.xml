	<brief_summary>Numerous studies have recommended the use of n-3 PUFA supplementation during human pregnancy and lactation for the prevention of preterm birth, beneficial effects on fetal development, visual and cognitive development and other functional outcomes of the infants. The aim of the present study is to assess the correlation between ratio of n-3:n-6 fatty acid and inflammation markers in SGA infants compared with appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. The investigators hypothesize that in SGA infants n-3 and n-6 fatty acid concentrations in cord blood will differ from those observed in AGA and might correlate with the level of circulating mediators.</brief_summary>
