	<brief_summary>Incomplete information or poorly communicated to the transitional stages of the patient's drug therapy hospitalized cause medication errors. These steps are the admission, transfer within the institution and hospital discharge to home or another institution. The adequacy of the prescription recommendations of good practice is not always optimal. The cost of taking drug therapy and iatrogenic risks preventable drug-related weighs more and more heavily in health spending and in the prolongation of hospitalization or re hospitalization. Clinical pharmacy widely practiced in the Anglo-Saxon countries has demonstrated its effectiveness on these three themes; it seems appropriate to assess this practice in the environment of the French health system.</brief_summary>
