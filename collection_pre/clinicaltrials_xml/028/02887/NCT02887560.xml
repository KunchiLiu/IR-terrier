	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to describe the early adaptation of the right ventricle assessed by echocardiography to change of pulmonary circulation secondary to pulmonary transplantation. Secondary objectives include change of haemodynamics measured by transpulmonary thermodilution and evolution of right heart function in terms of primary graft dysfunction grading.</brief_summary>
