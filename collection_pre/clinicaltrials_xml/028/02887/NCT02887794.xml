	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Although pathophysiology of this disease remains unclear, a growing interest is emerging for low-level sensory function, acknowledging that deficits in early stages of sensory processing are related to higher-order cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia. In the field of auditory processing, symptoms as auditory-hallucinations were found correlated with disabilities to discriminate psychoacoustic parameters of sounds.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basic Auditory Processing and Auditory Hallucinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outcomes: Our main hypothesis is that Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) scores are correlated with the percentage of wrong answers in a Tone-Matching Task test. The main objective is to assess this correlation. Our other objectives are to assess correlation between AHRS as well as other symptoms scales and psychoacoustic tests assessing intensity, length discrimination of non-verbal tones and self-monitoring abilities. Impact of therapeutic procedures (neuromodulation, psychotherapy) conducted independently of our study on these psychoacoustic tests will also be assessed. Methods: 30 subjects with schizophrenia will be included. Clinical and psychoacoustic measures will be carried out at J-0. In the case of patients receiving therapeutic procedures independently of our study, new clinical and psychoacoustic measures will be carried out at J+7 and J+30.</detailed_description>
