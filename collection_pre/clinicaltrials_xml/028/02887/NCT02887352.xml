	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment affects up to 65% of multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects, especially executive functions. The California Card Sorting Task (CCST) assesses specific components of problem-solving ability. There is currently no French version of this test. Reims neurological department in collaboration with Rothschild Foundation has developed a French adaptation of CCST. This version includes three cards packages with two alternate forms to control practice effects (test-retest). In order to assess "test-retest reliability" we have to verify the comparability of the three cards packages within one session in MS patients.</brief_summary>
