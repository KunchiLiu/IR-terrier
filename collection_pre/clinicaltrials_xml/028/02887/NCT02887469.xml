	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Rapid Intermittent Compared With Slow Continuous Correction in Severe Hyponatremia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Moderate to severe symptomatic hyponatremia requires prompt treatment with hypertonic saline. The extent and rate of increase in serum sodium (sNa) levels during treatment are critical. Several methods for continuous infusion of hypertonic saline were used to guide rate of fluid administered to achieve the required serum sodium target. As based on static model, they had a bias to over-correction of hyponatremia. Alternative approach to treatment with hypertonic fluid is to use small, fixed boluses to achieve controlled increments in sNa. However, there was no high quality evidence on whether hypertonic saline are best given in continuous infusion (preferred by most) or bolus injection. The aim of present study, a multi-center, randomized, open labelled, controlled clinical trial, is to investigate efficacy and safety of rapid intermittent correction compared with slow continuous correction with hypertonic saline in patient with moderately severe or severe symptomatic severe hyponatremia. A total 178 patients, who suffer from symptomatic severe hyponatremia, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either intermittent bolus infusion or slow continuous infusion by 3% hypertonic saline. Subjects will take different rate of 3% hypertonic saline for 24-48 hours stratified by severity of clinical symptoms. Serum sodium will be measured at every six hours during two days.</detailed_description>
