	<brief_title>Cytokine Evaluation of Accelerated Tooth Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For this prospective study, 50 individuals will be selected, with skeletal discrepancies randomly divided into two groups: 1 - accelerated tooth movement technique (ATMT) and 2 - Control. Orthodontic records done in two times, initial and preoperative; Gingival Crevicular Fluid samples will be collected using periopapers in 7 times. Flapless cortical perforations will be made in ATMT Group after dental extraction. Surgical protocol will be flapless to preserve periodontal health. After extraction space closure, results will be achieved by cytokine measurements (CCL2/MCP-1,CCL3/MIP-1 alpha, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL8/IL8, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL6, TNF-alpha; TRANCE/RANK L, TNF RII) that will be done using Luminex Assays and cytometer flow. After collecting data, the results will be statistically analyzed.</detailed_description>
