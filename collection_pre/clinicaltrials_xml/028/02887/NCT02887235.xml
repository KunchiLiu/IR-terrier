	<brief_title>Food as Medicine: An RCT to Study the Effect of Home Delivered, Medically Tailored Meals on Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard of care at the cancer center is for all patients receiving cytotoxic therapy to undergo a nutritional consultation and evaluation with a registered oncology dietitian. The goal of this consultation is to prevent nutritional deficiencies, promote optimal nutritional intake, hydration, and weight maintenance, as well as maintain lean body mass. All patients on this study will receive standard of care nutritional services including nutrition consult, evaluation, and as needed follow-ups. However, patients randomized to arm 2 will receive home delivered, medically tailored meals in addition to the standard nutritional care.</detailed_description>
