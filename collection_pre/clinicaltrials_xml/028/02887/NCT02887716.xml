	<brief_title>Mapping the Lumbar Spine Marrow Adiposity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study of the distribution of bone marrow adiposity is little known in subjects who did not have pathology likely to alter the fat content of the vertebrae. Or that fat content is potentially a reflection of brittle bones (osteoporosis, for example), and deserves to be known because it can be used to normalize the lipid fraction values with respect to age or from the level (L1 , L2, L3, L4 or L5) of the vertebra being studied.</detailed_description>
