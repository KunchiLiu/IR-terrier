	<detailed_description>After approval by the ethics committee of the patients Faculty of Dentistry, University of SÃ£o Paulo that having root canal filling of primary teeth will be invited to participate in the study.

The outcome will be the success or failure of endodontic treatments evaluated through permanent tooth in the arch on clinical and radiographic conditions of normality. The longevity of the treatments will be evaluated by estimating survival rates by Kaplan-Meier. The differences between the survival rates according to the type of proposed endodontic treatment will be analyzed using the log-rank test with a minimum significance level of 5%.</detailed_description>
