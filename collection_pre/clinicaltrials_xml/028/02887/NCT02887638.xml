	<brief_summary>Diagnosing and treating posture-related headache (PRH), such as tension-type and cervicogenic headache, is seriously hampered because of common features and complex interaction of the neurological and musculoskeletal system. Current therapies are therefore not as effective and the population of patients with PRH keeps on increasing. The diagnostic as well as the therapeutic process need more structure in order to select the most effective treatment; thereby contributing to preventive measures. This goal can be achieved through fundamental research with a clinically oriented background. Our study starts from a clinical problem, with a growing incidence, and is therefore highly relevant. Because sitting-posture seems to play an important role in PRH, the first step in the diagnostic process is to analyse postural differences between a PRH- and a control-group. In addition, the role of the dura mater in the headache-process will be examined. Patients with PRH will be classified in homogeneous groups based on these results. In a second phase individual-specific treatment programs will be composed. The general treatment-approach of postural abnormalities in the past failed because of the heterogeneous patient-populations. Sub-classifying musculoskeletal problems has been proven to be successful in the past (O'Sullivan &amp; Dankaerts, non-specific low back pain). Our study is divided in 2 phases: - phase 1: profile analysis (no intervention, experimental headache-group vs. asymptomatic controls) - phase 2: interventional phase (clustered headache-groups, based on the results of phase 1</brief_summary>
