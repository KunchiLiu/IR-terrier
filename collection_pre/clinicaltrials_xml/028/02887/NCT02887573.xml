	<brief_summary>Colon capsule endoscopy(CCE) is a new diagnostic method of colonic lesions.It has advantages of no requirement for sedation and air insufflation.The bowel preparation has a closely relationship with yield of diagnosing diseases.Bowel preparation of CCE is not only to clean the colon but also to promote capsule propulsion.Now there is not an optimal method for CCE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Free-residue Nutrients for the Bowel Preparation of Colon Capsule Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: In this study, a new bowel preparation regime of the colon capsule is used.This regime combines free-residue nutrients and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to achieve a better preparation quality. Methods: Participants who underwent a diagnostic colonoscopy examination that demonstrated a colorectal polyps that required endoscopic treatment will be recruited to patients in the study. The first 32 participants receive a traditional low fiber diet two days before the test.Then the patients will take 2L polyethylene glycol (PEG) at 21:00-23:00 before the test day and 2L PEG at 05:00-07:00 on the test day for bowel preparation. The subsequent 30 participants receive two-days free-residue nutrients without other diet before the test.Then the patients will take 2L PEG at 05:00-07:00 on the examination day for bowel preparation. Then they will take 5mg mosapride citrate at 8:00 and ingest the colon capsule at 8:30.0.75L and 0.50L PEG are administered as boosters.And the therapeutic endoscopy will be given on the following day.Before the therapeutic colonoscopy, the participants will take 2L PEG. The colon capsule results will be reviewed by two experienced endoscopists who are blinded to first endoscopy results.</detailed_description>
