	<detailed_description>The study investigators will conduct a patient-randomized controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design to compare the effectiveness of interventions, alone or in combination, to one another. 1500 English and Spanish-speaking patients who are ≥ 50 years old, from a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Chicago, and taking ≥ 5 Rx medications will be randomized to receive: 1) Enhanced Usual Care (EHR tools), 2) EHR tools + SMS, 3) EHR + Portal, or 4) EHR + SMS + Portal.

Evaluate the 'fidelity' (reliability) of each strategy and explore patient, staff, physician, and health system factors influencing the delivery of the interventions, alone and in combination 3. Assess the costs required to deliver each of the interventions from a health system perspective</detailed_description>
