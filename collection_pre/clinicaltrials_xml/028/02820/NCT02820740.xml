	<brief_title>Feasibility Study on LITT for Medical Refractory Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monteris is sponsoring this multicenter, open-label, prospective feasibility study to characterize the performance of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) using the Monteris NeuroBlate System for the treatment of drug-refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy in subjects who are candidates for LITT surgery. The NeuroBlate System uses precise, high-intensity laser light to initiate necrosis of abnormal brain tissue through thermal ablation while limiting injury to healthy tissue. Unlike traditional brain surgery, LITT does not require a large opening in the skull. Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria and sign the informed consent form will enter a Baseline (pre-surgery) Phase to establish their baseline seizure frequency. Subjects, or their caregivers, are required to keep a seizure diary throughout the study, beginning at the first baseline visit. The study will monitor and record subjects' seizure frequency, antiepileptic medications, and physical and emotional health. Upon demonstrating the required seizure frequency and stable antiepileptic medications for the 3-Month Baseline Phase, subjects will qualify for the study procedure. Subjects treated with NeuroBlate will have 2 years of follow-up. Throughout study participation, the study investigator will continuously monitor and document both effectiveness and safety data at study appointments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Relevant Inclusion Criteria are listed below Diagnosis of unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) confirmed clinically and with either (1) ictal scalp recording and MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis or (2) intracranial ictal onset consistent with hippocampal origin Averages 3 or more complex partial seizures (with or without secondary generalization) per month Refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Subjects will be considered refractory if they have failed treatment with at least 2 AEDs due to lack of efficacy Meets the criteria for a medial temporal lobe resection and is a candidate for LITT 18 years or older at the time of consent Relevant Exclusion Criteria are listed below Previous diagnosis of psychogenic/nonepileptic seizures Previous diagnosis of primary generalized seizures IQ less than 70 Subject has a MRIincompatible implanted electronic device or any metallic prosthesis or implant for which brain MRI is contraindicated</criteria>
