History of allergic disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, including allergy, urticaria, respiratory difficulty, angioneurotic edema or abdominal pain. Any autoimmune disease or immunodeficient state, parents, brother and sister with autoimmune disease or immunodeficient disease. Taking immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the last 12 months. Asplenia, functional asplenia or asplenia caused by any situation or splenectomy. Any acute disease or acute attack of chronic disease in last 7 days. History of thyroidectomy or thyroid disease requiring treatment in the last 12 months. Immunosuppressor, cytotoxic therapy, inhaled corticosteroid (excluding corticosteroids spray treatment of allergic rhinitis, acute and nonconcurrent corticosteroids treatment) Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational product in the last 30 days. Woman who is breastfeeding. Prior administration of attenuated vaccine in last 28 days. Prior administration of subunit vaccine, inactivated vaccine or allergic therapy in last 14 days. Current antituberculosis prophylaxis or therapy Any other conditions may compromise the safety or availability of participants in the judgment of the investigator. Following Immunization exclusion standard: Any grade 3 or more serious adverse reaction happen since the last vaccination.
