	<brief_summary>Loxapine is an antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in several countries including the United States. In animal studies in mice, loxapine reduced neuropathic pain. Hence, in a proof-of-principle and dose-escalating study the tolerability and analgesic efficacy of loxapine will be evaluated in patients with neuropathic pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerability and Analgesic Efficacy of Loxapine in Patients With Refractory, Chemotherapy-induced Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this dose-escalating study, 12 patients with refractory, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (including mixed pain) will receive loxapine during four 14-days treatment episodes. The dosage for episode 1 (Days 1-14) will be 10 mg b.i.d., dosages for episodes 2, 3, and 4 will be defined by taking into account tolerability and analgesic efficacy of the former episode. In case of an acceptable tolerability and if a clinically relevant analgesic efficacy is not reached, loxapine dosage will be increased (2nd Episode 10 mg t.i.d, 3rd Episode 20 mg b.i.d., 4th episode 20 mg t.i.d.). In case of an acceptable tolerability and if a clinically relevant analgesic efficacy is reached, loxapine dosage will not be changed. If clinically relevant (serious) adverse events ((S)AEs) occur, loxapine dosage will be reduced or the treatment will be interrupted or stopped irrespective of the analgesic efficacy. A clinically relevant pain reduction / analgesic efficacy is defined by an at least 30% decrease or an absolute decrease of two scale units compared to baseline using 11-point numeric pain rating scale. Patients will receive loxapine as add-on treatment to their usual (analgesic) care.</detailed_description>
