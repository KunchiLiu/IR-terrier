	<brief_summary>The study is about developing the best aftercare treatment possible for Latino/a adolescents who have been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit due to a suicidal crisis (suicidal thoughts or attempts). The treatment's purpose is to help adolescents and their caregivers develop skills to prevent future suicidal crises. Latino/a adolescents usually report more suicidal behavior than other ethnic groups. The question that the investigators want to answer is if a new treatment (socio-cognitive behavioral therapy-(SCBT)) developed to their specific needs, taking into account their culture and aspects of adolescence, performs better than the treatment that they usually receive. Fifty adolescents will be recruited from the Bradley Hospital adolescent inpatient unit or the Hasbro Inpatient Medical &amp; Psychiatric Program, or referred to Gateway Healthcare after discharge from other inpatient units in Rhode Island; half of them will be assigned randomly to the treatment they would usually receive (TAU) and the other half to the new treatment (SCBT). In both groups, caregivers and adolescents will have to complete questionnaires and interviews before the beginning of treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment begin. Questions to the participants will be related to their presenting symptoms, family, social group, problems, and other similar topics. Also, participants will be asked about their satisfaction with the treatment they are receiving. The purpose of the questionnaires and interviews are to follow their progress in therapy. At the end, comparisons will be made between the group who participated in TAU and the group who participated in the SCBT, based on the assessment results from the adolescents and caregivers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment for Latino/a Adolescents With Suicidal Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of a socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB) with Latino/a adolescents in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU). The SCBT-SB protocol was develop in Puerto Rico, but was expand to Latino populations in U.S. based on a previous qualitative study. The SCBT-SB include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Study design: A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the SCBT-SB versus TAU will be conducted in a real world scenario. Participants will be 50 Latino/a adolescents (13-17) admitted to a Psychiatric Unit for suicide ideation or suicide attempts, who have been referred to outpatient care, and at least one legal guardian. RCT's primary question is: Is the SCBT-SB protocol feasible in terms of satisfaction, acceptability, recruitment, retention, and therapist adherence? RCT's secondary question is: What is the magnitude of difference in suicidality and psychopathology symptoms between the SCBT-SB and the TAU at three, six, and 12 months following baseline?</detailed_description>
