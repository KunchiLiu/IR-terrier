	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of CERAMENT™|G used in conjunction with standard-of-care treatment compared to standard-of-care treatment alone in the care of subjects with open fractures of the tibial diaphysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating CERAMENT™|G in Open Diaphyseal Tibial Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CERAMENT™|G is a resorbable, gentamicin containing ceramic bone graft indicated to fill bony voids or gaps which are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure and where there is risk of bacterial contamination.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female 1821 years of age with radiographic evidence on plain xrays of proximal and distal tibial physeal closure, OR male or female 2275 years of age 2. GustiloAnderson Grade II, IIIA, or IIIB open tibial shaft fracture (with or without extension into the metaepiphyseal region) amenable to fixation with an intramedullary nail 3. Bone loss at the fracture site must have a radiographic apparent bone gap (RABG) between 5 and 27.5 millimeters. 4. Life expectancy of at least 1 year 5. Patient is willing to provide informed consent, is geographically stable and able to comply with the required follow up visits, testing schedule and medication regimen 6. Adequate soft tissue coverage at the fracture site (through primary closure or surgical reconstruction, including local and free soft tissue transfer) 7. Definitive wound closure within 10 days of the initial injury 8. Unilateral fracture, or, in the case of individuallyqualifying bilateral open tibia fractures, the more severe of the bilateral fractures. Patients will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply: 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or planning on becoming pregnant during the investigational period 2. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study or previously enrolled in this study 3. Renal failure or documented chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine ≥3.5 mg/L or being treated with dialysis 4. Known hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics, calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxyapatite 5. Preexisting calcium metabolism disorder 6. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c levels &gt; 10%) 7. A current endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g., Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, hyperthyroidism, parathyroid hormone disorder, EhlerDanlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta) 8. Neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease 9. Currently has untreated malignant neoplasm(s), or is currently undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy 10. Inadequate neurovascular status in the involved limb that may jeopardize healing (e.g., GustiloAnderson IIIc classification) 11. Patients who have a preexisting shaft deformity that cannot accommodate a nail or a previous history of osteomyelitis in the index limb 12. Ipsilateral tibial plateau or pilon/plafond fractures 13. Other ipsilateral lower extremity fracture(s) if, in the opinion of the investigator, the treatment and/or rehabilitation of such fracture(s) will substantially interfere with the treatment, rehabilitation or other requirements outlined in this protocol.</criteria>
