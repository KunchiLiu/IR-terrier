	<brief_summary>Non-motor symptoms like mood fluctuations and behavioral disorders are frequent in Parkinson's disease. They may be induced by both the pathology and the dopaminergic treatment and must be considered in treatment policies. Due to their specificity and the absence of an appropriate evaluation tool, behavioral disorders are rarely searched for. Therefore, investigators developed a scale permitting qualitative and quantitative evaluation of behavior according to the severity of the disorders. This study aims to define reference values for healthy individuals</brief_summary>
