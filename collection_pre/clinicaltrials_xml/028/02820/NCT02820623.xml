	<brief_summary>The objective is to compare the accuracy, costs, and cost-effectiveness of three fidelity measurement methods to assess fidelity to cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth. The investigators will randomize 135 therapists, implementing cognitive-behavioral therapy, to 3 conditions: self-report, chart stimulated recall, and behavioral rehearsal (N = 45 for each group). To calculate the outcomes of interest, each condition will be compared to the gold-standard fidelity measurement method, direct observation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project FACTS (Fidelity Accuracy: Comparing Three Strategies)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To achieve the primary objective, the investigators plan to (1) identify the most accurate fidelity measurement method; (2) estimate the economic costs and cost-effectiveness of the fidelity measurement methods; and (3) compare stakeholders' motivation to use each method, as well as identify their perceived barriers and facilitators to use of each method. This study will have a significant positive impact in two ways. First, it will validate fidelity measurement methods that can be used for research. Second, it will produce tools that can be used by community mental health clinics to monitor therapist fidelity, an indicator of therapy quality.</detailed_description>
