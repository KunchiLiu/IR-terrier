	<brief_title>Hemostatic Powder Versus Clinical Management for the Treatment of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding From Tumor Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal tumor bleeding is a challenging clinical condition with a high mortality rate. Several endoscopic hemostasis techniques have been tested, but results were disappointing. Re-bleeding and mortality rates are still high. Hemostatic powder is a promising therapy for tumor bleeding, since it can be applied over large surfaces. Bleeding from a tumor lesion often occurs diffusely on the surface of the tumor rather than from a specific vessel.</detailed_description>
