	<brief_summary>There lacks effective early screen system for the migraine-susceptible women during the peri-menopause period. The processing of acute pain and cognition as well as the underling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) features are suitable for screening pain-susceptible individual. However, there is no study on this issue among the large sample peri-menopause women. The investigators thus designed the current trial to investigate the processing of acute pain and cognition as well as the underling featured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).The investigators will combine pain behavior,cognitive task, fMRI analysis, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and suitable statistical package to investigate the relationship between the above mentioned features and the occurrence of migraine and then test the efficacy of these features in predicting migraine development. The investigators will then try to establish the screening system for migraine-susceptible individuals in peri-menopause women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study on the Processing of Acute Pain and Cognition Among Perimenopause Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the prevalence of migraine is very high during peri-menopause period, there exist significant individual differences in whether developing migraine among this population. However, there still lacks effective early screen system for the migraine- susceptible women during the peri-menopause period. Individual acute pain processing and its interaction with cognition as well as the underling featured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are suitable for screening pain-susceptible individual. Actually, the featured acute pain processing and its interaction with cognition as well as fMRI alterations were reported in two previous small sample trials among pre-menopause population, however, there is no similar study on large sample peri-menopause women. The investigators previously reported abnormal acute pain processing and decreased cognition in the experimental peri-menopause rats as well as peri-menopause women with migraine. The investigators thus raised the current hypothesis that the acute pain processing and its interaction with cognition as well as the underling featured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are usable for screening migraine-susceptible individuals among peri-menopause women. In the current project, The investigators will combine pain behavior,cognitive task, fMRI analysis, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and suitable statistical package to investigated the relationship between the above mentioned features and the occurrence of migraine and then test the efficacy of these features in predicting migraine development. The investigators will then try to establish the screening system for migraine-susceptible individuals in peri-menopause women.</detailed_description>
