	<brief_summary>This prospective, randomized, double blind study aims to determine the optimal volume for adequate sensorial and motor blockade following an infraclavicular block. Patients will be randomized into three groups. Using a constant dose of local anesthetics (45mg bupivacaine 180mg prilocaine), different volumes will be used in each of the groups (First group; 18mL, second group; 27mL, third group; 36mL). Onset, duration and quality of sensory and motor block will be compared for patients between groups</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concentration-Volume Relationship in Infraclavicular Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although ultrasound guided infraclavicular nerve block is routinely used to provide anesthesia for almost all of the upper extremity surgeries, optimal volume and concentration of locak anesthetic to be administered is still a subject of debate. This prospective, randomized, double blind study aims to determine the optimal volume for adequate sensorial and motor blockade following an infraclavicular block. Patients will be randomly allocated into three groups. 81 patients (27 in each group) are planned to be enrolled in this study due to a power analysis performed (G-power ver 3.1). Using a constant dose of local anesthetics (45mg bupivacaine 180mg prilocaine), different volumes will be used in each of the groups (First group; 18mL, second group; 27mL, third group; 36mL). Onset, duration and quality of sensory and motor block will be compared for patients between groups Researchers who perform the block and assess the block quality and onset will be blinded to patients' groups. Patients will also be blinded to groups they are assigned.</detailed_description>
