	<brief_title>Dietary Carbohydrate Consumption on Memory Performance and Mood in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NW and OW/OB children, 9-14 years of age, will participate in the experiment. The effect of 5 different meals (mashed potatoes, hash browns, French fries, rice, or beans matched by 50g of available carbohydrate) and meal skipping will be examined. On six separate mornings, one of the meals or no meal will be provided in a random order upon their arrival. Blood glucose, subjective appetite, and mood will be measured at baseline, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after meal consumption. Cognitive performance will be measured using an immediate and delayed word recall test, and two to three executive function tasks at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after meal consumption.</detailed_description>
