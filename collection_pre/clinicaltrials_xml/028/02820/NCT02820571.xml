	<brief_summary>The OPAL study is about health outcomes in older adults. The investigators are surveying 4,000 adults across England to see how health and physical activity change over time. The information that is collected will help the investigators to understand how a person's health, including conditions such as back pain, affect their mobility as they age, and provide insight into improving the management of health in older adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Oxford Pain, Activity and Lifestyle (OPAL) Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Oxford Pain, Activity and Lifestyle (OPAL) study is a large cohort study of community dwelling adults (n=4000) aged 65 years and over. This cohort data will allow the investigators to describe the prevalence, severity, course and prognosis a range of musculoskeletal problems in older people. The initial focus is to evaluate the impact of back pain on important health outcomes for older people (quality of life, mobility, falls and fractures). In order to do this, the investigators will study people with and without back pain at the inception of the cohort. The OPAL cohort will be followed for 5 years in the first instance and the investigators will study a range of factors hypothesised to moderate and mediate the effects of back and other musculoskeletal pain for example, co-morbidities. The OPAL cohort will be sampled from older people registered with primary care practices. The investigators aim to develop a prognostic tool using the cohort data that will help older people, GPs and other health professionals identify when LBP is a risk factor for disability, functional limitation and loss of mobility, and when LBP should be prioritised as a treatment target.</detailed_description>
