	<brief_summary>The femoral approach is the preferred vascular access for the set-up of emergency catheters in severely traumatized patient. This location combines simplicity and speed of installation, it allows the simultaneous set-up of arterial and venous catheters, and is a provider of few complications and failures. The ultrasound guidance has greatly reduced installation times, failures and complications related to the set-up of central venous catheter. This was amply demonstrated in the internal jugular and subclavian site outside of extreme emergency situations (Fragou M et al 2011, Farrell J et al 1997, Karakistos et al 2006). The benefit of ultrasound guidance for the set-up of arterial and venous catheters in the femoral emergency has not been evaluated in terms of reduction in complications. Then the main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the ultrasound guidance reduces early complications related to the set-up of arterial and venous catheters in the femoral emergency, among severely traumatized patient compared to the reference anatomical technique.</brief_summary>
