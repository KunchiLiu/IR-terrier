	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine how the short-term outcome of subjects implanted with the JOURNEY™ II BCS Total Knee System compares to subjects implanted with other PS total knee systems, and to determine if there is a difference in health care resources consumed that may result in economic savings to patients, the facility and/or the payer. To address the study objectives, patient self-assessment questionnaires, and other objective measures of post-operative function and health care resource utilization will be used for data collection.</brief_summary>
