	<brief_summary>Rehab in a Crate is a therapy gym designed to be affordable, compact and easily transportable. The purpose of this particular study is to gain feedback on the initial design of the Rehab in a Crate system. This will be accomplished by using qualitative ethnographic research methods (i.e. human centered design) in the form of surveys that have been carefully designed by members of the research team. The eligibility criteria of this survey research reflects the intended user base of an eventual finished product, which is survivors of stroke and cerebral palsy across the globe. And while healthcare professionals are not the user base per se, their expertise and feedback should be instrumental in the design of future iterations of the Rehab in a Crate. Ease of use, utility, design, and various features, both existing and intended, will all be surveyed items.</brief_summary>
