	<brief_summary>Infection and trauma take a important role in the acute respiratory failure.There are different causes and degrees of inflammatory reaction in the critically ill patient. The inflammatory reaction should also affect patients on mechanical ventilation dependence with body physiological response and disease prognosis in patients. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that inflammation may have an important role in the prediction of weaning from mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Predictive Effect of the Inflammatory Response on the Evacuation of Mechanical Ventilation and the Mechanism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the process of mechanical ventilation, the patients were divided into two groups according to the failure of spontaneous breathing test and spontaneous breathing test.In the index of predicting mechanical ventilation, the investigators will take the index of inflammatory response, the function index of diaphragm and the amount of exhaled CO2 into account to reduce the failure rate of mechanical ventilation.</detailed_description>
