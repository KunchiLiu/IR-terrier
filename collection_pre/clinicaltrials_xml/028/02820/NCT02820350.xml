	<brief_summary>The SCD (Selective Cytopheretic Device) is an extracorporeal device used as an adjunct to renal replacement therapy (RRT) to improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Funding Source - FDA OOPD (SCD-PED-01)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of a Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) in Pediatric Patients With Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter cartridge. The device is connected in series to commercially available Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) devices. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through this space and it is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit. Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. A patient, or legal representative, has signed a written informed consent form. 2. Must be receiving medical care in an intensive care unit (e.g., ICU, MICU, SICU, CTICU, Trauma). 3. Age less than 22 years. 4. Females of child bearing potential who are not pregnant (confirmed by a negative serum pregnancy test) and not lactating if recently postpartum. 5. Intent to deliver full supportive care through aggressive management utilizing all available therapies for a minimum of 96 hours. 6. Clinical diagnosis of AKI due to hemodynamic or toxic etiologies requiring CRRT (see Appendix B). AKI is defined as acute kidney injury occurring in a setting of acute ischemic or nephrotoxic injury with any one of the following: Increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours or; Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days or; Urine volume &lt;0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours 7. All patients must be able to tolerate regional citrate anticoagulation. Tolerance of regional citrate anticoagulation is defined as meeting both of the following criteria: 1. Two (2) hrs of treatment with citrate anticoagulation without side effects of citrate therapy. 2. Two (2) consecutive intracircuit iCa levels &lt;0.40 mmol/L, at least 30 minutes apart within the first 4 hours of citrate therapy. 8. At least one nonrenal organ failure or presence (proven or suspected) of sepsis 1. Threshold blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg patients with both a systolic blood pressure of less than 80 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 40 mmHg. 2. Irreversible brain damage based on available historical and clinical information. 3. Presence of any organ transplant at any time. 4. Acute or chronic use of circulatory support device such as LVADs, RVADs, BIVADs, ECMO. 5. Presence of preexisting advanced chronic renal failure (i.e., ESRD) requiring chronic renal replacement therapy prior to this episode of acute kidney injury. 6. AKI occurring in the setting of burns, obstructive uropathy, allergic interstitial nephritis, acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, shigatoxin associated hemolyticuremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), malignant hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, atheroembolism, functional or surgical nephrectomy, hepatorenal syndrome, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus nephrotoxicity. 7. Received &gt;12 hour of CRRT during this hospital admission or prior to transfer from an outside hospital. 8. Received &gt;1 hemodialysis treatment during this hospital admission or prior to transfer from an outside hospital. 9. Hospitalization &gt;14 days during this hospital admission and or prior to transfer from an outside hospital. 10. Metastatic malignancy which is actively being treated or may be treated by chemotherapy or radiation during the subsequent three month period after study therapy. 11. Chronic immunosuppression. 12. HIV or AIDS. 13. Severe liver failure. 14. Current Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR), Allow Natural Death (AND), or withdrawal of care status, or anticipated change in status within the next 7 days. 15. Patient not expected to survive 28 days because of an irreversible medical condition. (This is not restrictive to AKI, and may include situations such as the presence of irreversible brain damage, untreatable malignancy, inoperable life threatening condition, or any condition to which therapy is regarded as futile by the PI.) 16. Any medical condition that the Investigator thinks may interfere with the study objectives. 17. Physician refusal. 18. Dry weight of &lt;20 kg. 19. Platelet count &lt;30,000/mm3 at time of screening. 20. Concurrent enrollment in another interventional clinical trial. Patients enrolled in clinical trials where only measurements and/or samples are taken (NO TEST DEVICE OR TEST DRUG USED) are allowed to participate. 21. Use of any other Investigational drug or device within the previous 30 days.</criteria>
