	<brief_summary>In this prospective observational study we aim to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal and rectal Gram-negative bacilli colonization in healthy subjects, and their susceptibility to chlorehexidine. We plan to recruit 100 healthy volunteers secondary endpoints are to determine the phylogentic characteristics of E. coli isolates; to compare the phylogentic characteristics of oropharyngeal and rectal of predominant GNB colonization.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this prospective observational study we aim to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal and rectal Gram-negative bacilli colonization in 100 healthy subjects, and their susceptibility to chlorehexidine. Each participant will undego a oropharyngeal swab collection and a rectal swab at day 0. The Gram-negative bacilli colonization will be identified, E. coli isolates will be studied in terms of phylogeny; gram-negative isolates will be studied in terms of antimicrobial and chlorhexidine susceptibility. The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal Gram-negative bacilli colonization. The secondary objectives are to determine the chlorhexidine and antimicrobial susceptibility of such colonization; to determine the phylogentic characteristics of oropharyngeal and rectal predominant E. coli isolates; to compare the phylogentic characteristics of oropharyngeal and rectal E. coli isolates.</detailed_description>
