	<brief_summary>Recent scientific advances have shown the important role of immune system against cancer. Today, many immunological biotherapy like anti-PD1/PDL-1 are available in cancer treatment and generate durable clinical responses in some patients. The development of tools for monitoring anti-tumor immune responses dynamically is a major challenge to predict the effectiveness of immunotherapies anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL-1. Thus, the objective of our study is to analyse the interest of the monitoring of anti-telomerase T helper 1 (TH1) responses in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy, using an immunoassay developed by our group.</brief_summary>
