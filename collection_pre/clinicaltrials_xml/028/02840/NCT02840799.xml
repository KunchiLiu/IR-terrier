	<brief_title>Effect of KNO3 Compared to KCl on Oxygen UpTake in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (KNO3CK OUT HFPEF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50% of heart failure patients exhibit preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), and therefore have HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). There are currently no proven effective pharmacologic interventions. Exercise intolerance with reduced aerobic capacity is the hallmark of HFpEF and greatly impairs quality of life (QOL). During exercise, blood vessels within active muscle vasodilator, increasing perfusion to the muscle bed. Nitric oxide is a chief mediator of this process. Inorganic nitrate can ultimately be converted to nitric oxide. This conversion occurs preferentially at the site of exercising muscle, allowing for vasodilation to occur, hence increasing blood flow to the working muscle. Preliminary data suggest that inorganic nitrate improves exercise tolerance in HFpEF. The investigator will aim to test this hypothesis in a larger group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis of heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIII symptoms LV ejection fraction &gt;50% during baseline echocardiography Stable medical therapy: no addition/removal/changes in antihypertensive medications, or betablockers in the preceding 30 days. Elevated filling pressures as evidenced by at least 1 of the following within the last 12 months: (1)Mitral E/e' ratio &gt; 8 (either lateral or septal), with low e' velocity (septal e'&lt;7 cm/sec or lateral e'&lt; 10 cm/sec), in addition to one of the following: (a) Enlarged left atrium (LA volume index &gt;34 ml/m2) (b) Chronic loop diuretic use for control of symptoms (c) Elevated natriuretic peptides (BNP levels &gt;100 ng/L or Nterminal prohormone of brain natiuretic peptide (NTproBNP) levels &gt;300 ng/L) (2) Mitral E/e' ratio &gt; 14 (either lateral or septal) (3) Elevated invasivelydetermined filling pressures previously (resting LVEDP&gt;16 mmHg or mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt; 12 mmHg). (4) Acute heart failure decompensation requiring IV diuretics Supine systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg Pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test during the screening visit Orthostatic hypotension defined as &gt;20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure 35 minutes following the transition from the supine to standing position Any rhythm other than sinus with native conduction at the time of screening, based on a 12lead ECG. Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be enrolled as long as their rhythm is sinus at the time of enrollment. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL Inability/unwillingness to exercise Moderate or greater left sided valvular disease (mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation), any degree of mitral stenosis, severe rightsided valvular disease, or presence of a prosthetic valve. Hypertrophic, infiltrative, or inflammatory cardiomyopathy Pericardial disease Current angina Acute coronary syndrome or coronary intervention within the past 2 months Primary pulmonary arteriopathy Clinically significant lung disease as defined by: Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease meeting Stage III or greater Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) criteria, treatment with oral steroids within the past 6 months for an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, or the use of daytime supplemental oxygen Ischemia on stress testing without subsequent revascularization Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45% in any prior echocardiogram or cardiac MRI. Treatment with phosphodiesterase inhibitors that cannot be withheld Treatment with organic nitrates or allopurinol Significant liver disease impacting synthetic function or volume control (ALT/AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase) &gt; 3x ULN (upper limit of normal), Albumin &lt;3.0 g/dL) Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In males of African, Asian or Mediterranean decent, this will be formally excluded prior to enrollment. Methemoglobinemia baseline methemoglobin level &gt;5% Hyperkalemia (serum K&gt;5.0 mEq/L). (note: mEq=milliequivalent) Severe right ventricular dysfunction. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with the safe completion of the study. Participants who have contraindications for MRI but are otherwise good candidates for the study, may be enrolled. In this case, participants will undergo all study procedures except for the MRI scans.</criteria>
