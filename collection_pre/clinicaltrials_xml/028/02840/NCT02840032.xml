	<brief_title>Determination of Pneumothorax Post Lung Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients who undergo transbronchial forceps lung biopsies get a routine CXR after the biopsies are performed. The reason for CXR is to find out if pneumothorax occurred or not. CXR is required patient transportation and interpretation by the radiologist as well as time consuming. Instead, we are planning to perform bedside ultrasound to determine if pneumothorax occurred or not</detailed_description>
