	<brief_summary>Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 1/50,000 in the Caucasian population. The main manifestations of FA are progressive sensory and cerebellar ataxia and cardiomyopathy (CM). It is the most common form of inherited ataxia. A severe CM affects ~60% of FA patients, mostly young adults, and leads to cardiac failure then death. Currently, no therapy can change the course of this severe cardiomyopathy. This study is designed to characterize the cardiac manifestations of FA using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), echocardiography, serum cardiac biomarkers and evaluation of fatigue severity, in the context of the neurological disease.</brief_summary>
