	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability Study of PF-06480605 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2a, single arm, two-stage study in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Subjects will receive 500 mg of PF-06480605 intravenously every 2 weeks for a total of 7 doses. Blood, stool, and tissue samples will be collected at various time points throughout the study to evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Duration of participation for subjects will be approximately 8 months.</detailed_description>
