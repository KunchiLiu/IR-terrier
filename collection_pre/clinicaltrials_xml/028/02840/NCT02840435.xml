	<detailed_description>This study is designed to test the effectiveness of the smoking cessation intervention "Sit to Quit" through a randomized-control trial. This study will compare abstinence outcomes in the Sit to Quit study group to a control group using the North Carolina State Tobacco Quit Line. This is an investigational study (n=60) designed to test Sit to Quit (STQ) versus Quit Line (QL) through a pilot randomized control trial. The proposed study is designed with double-blind procedures (participants and study staff) for randomization of 60 participants recruited through Duke Smoking Cessation Program into two groups: STQ and QL. STQ participants will receive access to the STQ Instructional Video, the STQ manual, and proactive Quit Coach calls supporting STQ. QL participants will be instructed to contact the NC Quit Line and will receive access to "web Coach" (Alere Well-being site), the Quit Line manual, and proactive Quit Coach calls supporting "Quit for Life." All statistical analysis will be performed under the directions of the statistician designated in key personnel. Outcomes of variables including: demographic variables, evaluation responses, and abstinence rates will be analyzed using general regression models using an ANOVA-based design. The study Principal Investigator Dr. James Davis will ultimately be responsible for data and safety monitoring. Subject data will be collected during visits and captured in the Electronic Medical Record. Data will be collected by phone, and this data will be stored in REDCap. Participants that experience events related to their clinical treatment will be recommended to follow-up with their provider.</detailed_description>
