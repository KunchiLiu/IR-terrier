	<detailed_description>Objective: Gestational weight gain and weight retention at 1 year after delivery are associated with long-term obesity. The investigators aimed to investigate the effect of laser acupuncture therapy (LAT) on postpartum weight control. Methods: The investigators randomly assigned 66 subjects with postpartum weight retention to a laser acupuncture group and control group. The subjects were treated at acupoints including the Stomach and Hunger points of the ear, ST25 (Tianshu), ST28 (Shuidao), ST40 (Fenglong), SP15 (Daheng), CV9 (Shuifen), and SP6 (Sanyinjiao) by using verum or sham laser acupuncture over 5 sessions per week. After 12 treatment sessions, the differences in the body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), and waist-to-buttocks ratio (WBR) of the patients were analyzed, and compared between the laser acupuncture and control groups via analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and stepwise regression tests.</detailed_description>
