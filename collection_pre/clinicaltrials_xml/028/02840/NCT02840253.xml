	<brief_summary>Investigators have started an awake spinal anesthesia program in conjunction with pediatric surgical colleagues. Patients are offered the option of awake spinal anesthesia instead of general anesthesia for appropriate surgical procedures. Previous studies have demonstrated a lack of significant hemodynamic changes in neonates and infants following spinal anesthesia; however, there are limited data regarding its impact on tissue oxygenation. The goal of the current study is to assess changes in tissue and cerebral oxygenation using non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy following spinal anesthesia.</brief_summary>
