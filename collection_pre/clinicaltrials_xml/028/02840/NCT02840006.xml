	<brief_summary>CONTEXT: In patients eligible for coronary artery bypass surgery, anesthesia should provide a number of conditions that exceed the limits of cardiovascular stability, myocardial protection and other organs. Moreover, the combination of general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia lessens the homeostatic, metabolic, hormonal and immunosuppressive changes. The goal of this research was to evaluate the consumption of fentanyl citrate in intra-operative in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass under spinal anesthesia associated with general anesthesia. METHODS: Clinical, prospective, randomized and double covered study, approved by the Research Ethics Committee. Fifty-six patients candidates for CABG with CPB, after signing the Terms of consent, were randomized and divided into two groups: GI - General and GII - General + subarachnoid. General anesthesia was induced according to the weight of each patient and maintenance with isoflurane and fentanyl. Spinal anesthesia was induced with 20 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 200 mcg of morphine, the patient is placed in cephalo-position slope of 45 degrees for 10 minutes in Group II. In the statistical study was performed using the Mann-Whitney test; the level of statistical significance was set at 5%.</brief_summary>
