	<brief_title>Impact of Purple Wheat Consumption on Markers of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Adults.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effect of daily consumption of purple wheat bran-enriched wholegrain convenience bars, for 8 weeks on inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma antioxidant capacity. This study is a randomized, parallel arm study with 20 men and 20 women who will adhere to a low anthocyanin and low phenolic aid diet for the duration of the study. The participants will be randomly divided into two groups, using stratification for matching sex and screening hs-CRP level to be equally distributed in each group, and assigned to either the treatment group or control group. Both group will have a 10 day diet run-in period where consumption of foods rich in anthocyanins and phenolic acids will be limited. Both groups will consume 4 servings of wheat products per day for 8 weeks and will replace 4 grain servings from their typical daily intake with the study treatment products. Fasting blood samples will be collected during three study visits, including baseline, for the analysis of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma antioxidant capacity. The plasma metabolites of anthocyanins and phenolic acids will also be determined.</detailed_description>
