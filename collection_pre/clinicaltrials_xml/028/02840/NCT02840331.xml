	<brief_title>Pilot Study on Intra-abdominal Photodynamic Diagnosis in Peritoneal Carcinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypericin-PDT study is an examination of patients with gastric cancer. The peritoneal carcinosis (PC) of the adult represents the final stage of an advanced tumor and was treated in the past, usually by means of palliative chemotherapy. An improvement in survival for patients with PC could be further improved through the use of maximum cytoreductive surgery (CRS) can be achieved with radical removal of the entire tumor mass and the combination of CRS and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (HIPEC) event-free survival and overall survival. A cure of patients is achieved only in the rarest cases. An essential problem in the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is that can only be poorly differentiated from surrounding tissue due to their location, the tumors often not well recognized because of their size or. This results to differ (as scar tissue) for the surgeon the difficulty between eigentlichem tumor tissue and surrounding tissue. Through the use of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic options (for example, photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and therapy (PDT)) above mentioned problems can be improved. In photodynamic diagnosis contrast between tumor and surrounding healthy tissue is improved by an interaction of photodynamic active substance with light of a particular wavelength. The PDT is based on a topical or systemic administration of a photosensitizer (here hypericin), which is irradiated with light of a suitable wavelength and in the presence of oxygen oxygen radicals (with the consequence of a direct cytotoxicity of the tumor cells leading) forms. The study will be carried out in the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery Tübingen at 50 adult patients. The study proposed would examine by hypericin-supported Fluoreszenzlaparoskopy in terms of tumor size, number and location of the combination of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and therapy (PDT) with regard to the detection of peritoneal metastases of locally advanced gastric cancer.</detailed_description>
