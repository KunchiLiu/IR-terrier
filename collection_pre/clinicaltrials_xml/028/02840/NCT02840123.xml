	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to asses safety of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) treatment with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with lysated allegenic tumor lines Evaluate the nonspecific immune response generated in peripheral blood and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) by proposed treatment Evaluate the specific antitumor immunity response generated in peripheral blood and CSF Assess overall survival and progression free survival Correlate the neuroradiological changes with the clinical course and immune response generated in peripheral blood and CSF Quality of life evaluation</brief_summary>
