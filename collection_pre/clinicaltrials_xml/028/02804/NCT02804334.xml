	<brief_title>The Role of Molecules in Blood Cells for Diagnosing Bipolar Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is one study visit for this research protocol. Participants may complete this visit on the day that they sign consent. If there is an upcoming blood draw already scheduled for the participant, within the clinical research trial in which they are enrolled, they may decide to wait until then to receive their blood draw. In addition, if a subject has completed the protocol specific monitoring labs within the past 30 days, either for clinical or research purposes, they do not have to be repeated. After obtaining the informed consent, all potential research participants will be assessed with a systemic clinical interview and a structured interview with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Psychiatric assessments will be administered to all participants, both healthy controls and participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD). All eligible participants will also complete a Clinical Record Form. The form includes demographics, previous treatment history, the number of previous episodes, family history, and other historical correlates.</detailed_description>
