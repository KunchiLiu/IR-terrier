	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis is that use of IV acetaminophen will significantly decrease use of post-operative opioid consumption and enhances recovery after colorectal surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decrease Opioid Consumption With Intra-Venous (IV) Acetaminophen After Colorectal Surgery (DOCIVA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients undergoing laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery are randomized to receive either IV acetaminophen or placebo. All patients received an opioid patient controlled anesthesia (PCA). IV acetaminophen (1 gram) or placebo is given 30 minutes prior to operation and every 6 hours thereafter for up to 5 days post-operatively or discharge. The investigators primary endpoint is to evaluate opioid consumption during the patient's hospital stay. The investigators secondary endpoints are to evaluate return of gastrointestinal function (ROGIF), time to diet ordered (TTDO), length of hospital stay (LOHS) and occurrence of ileus. Pain is measured with the pain visual analog scale score (PVASS) at 3, 8, 24 and 48 hours.</detailed_description>
