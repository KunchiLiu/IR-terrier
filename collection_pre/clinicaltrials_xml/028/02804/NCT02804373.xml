	<brief_summary>The investigator thinks that the oxytocin (OT) can improve durably and significantly the behavior disorders and thus the socialization but also the satisfaction and could thus be an interesting therapeutic alternative for the patients presenting a Prader-Willi Syndrome (SPW). Although today several studies demonstrated the effects of the OT in various domains of the behavior, the investigator do not know either its specificity of action about the cerebral level, or its duration of action, or the optimal modalities of administration and in particular at patients SPW.</brief_summary>
