	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Nasal High Flow Oxygen Therapy With Rehabilitation in the Patients With Chronic Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with chronic respiratory failure, pulmonary rehabilitation is recognized as an evidence-based treatment in improving exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and quality of life. Oxygen supplementation during exercise induced dose-dependent improvement in endurance and symptom perception in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Recently, nasal high flow therapy which consists of high flow gas with an FiO2 ranging from 0.21 to nearly 1.0 adjusted by an oxygen blender, brought to body temperature, and saturated with water through an in-line humidifier is available. The present study is randomised to compare the effect of exercise endurance between oxygen therapy with rehabilitation and nasal high flow therapy with rehabilitation for the patients with chronic respiratory failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy.</detailed_description>
