	<detailed_description>Researchers propose to address extremely high rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in Sonora, Mexico through use of an evidence-based community health worker intervention for adult patients with diabetes who receive care at health centers operated by the Secretaría de Salud, an office of the Mexican government. Researchers will conduct a cluster-randomized trial with a total of 400 patients at 20 health centers to understand whether the 13-week educational intervention, Meta Salud Diabetes, can effectively reduce clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with diabetes. Researchers will also conduct an implementation study that will consist of systematic engagement of local, state and national decision makers to identify barriers, facilitators, and strategies to adopt and integrate community health worker-led cardiovascular disease prevention interventions throughout the 209 health centers in Sonora.</detailed_description>
