	<brief_summary>Ireland is predicted to have the highest older adult population growth of any European Union country. A substantial economic and social challenge of this projected growth is the increased incidence of cognitive impairment and the likelihood of progression to dementia. Dementia's, such as Alzheimer's disease, typically have a long prodromal stage with brain changes identifiable from the earliest stages of neuropathology, providing an opportunity for intervention. Switching to a strategy of earlier identification and prevention would significantly reduce prevalence and the associated cost. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of vitamin D supplements in community dwelling older adults as a lifestyle approach that may support cognitive and physical functioning. The research will incorporate several stages including an initial in-depth screening process, a novel and sensitive cognitive battery, 6 month double blind placebo controlled intervention of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and a concluding participant feedback interview. These results will be used to assess the feasibility of recruiting and assessing community dwelling older adults for extensive nutrition related cognitive studies.</brief_summary>
