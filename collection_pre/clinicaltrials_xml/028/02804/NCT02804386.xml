	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Zoval (Sofosbuvir) and Ribavirin With or Without Interferon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indication Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection (serum HCV RNA level, &gt;10,000 IU per milliliter) with or without cirrhosis Primary Objective o Proportion of participants with sustained virologic response 12/24 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR 12 or 24 weeks) [ Time Frame: Post-treatment Week 12/24 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] SVR 12/24 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ; ie, &lt; 15 IU/mL) 12/24 weeks following the last dose of study medication. Secondary Objective o Proportion of participants experiencing viral breakthrough [ Time Frame: Up to 12 or 24 weeks ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Viral breakthrough is defined as HCV RNA ≥ lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while receiving treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value could be post treatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow-up values. - Proportion of participants experiencing viral relapse [ Time Frame: Up to Post treatment Week 12 or 24 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Viral relapse is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the post-treatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available post treatment measurement. - Proportion of participants with Early Virological Response 4 weeks after start of therapy (EVR4) [ Time Frame: Treatment Week 4 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] - SVR 12/24 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ; ie, &lt; 15 IU/mL) 12/24 weeks following the last dose of study medication.Proportion of HCV RNA within 12 or 24 weeks change from baseline in HCV RNA (log10 IU/mL) [ Time Frame: Up to 12 or 24 weeks ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] - Proportion of participants experiencing an adverse event (AE) leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication [ Time Frame: Baseline to Week 12 or 24 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Number of Subjects 5000 patients Dosing - Sofosbuvir 400 mg tablet taken once daily orally - Ribavirin twice daily orally - 1000 mg in patients with body weights &lt;75 kg - 1200 mg in those with weights &gt;75 kg - Interferon for 12 or 24 weeks Drug duration Duration and combination depends upon the discretion of Principal investigator. Proposed Duration for Genotype: Inclusion criteria • Men and women, 18 years of age or older, - Treatment -Naïve and not responded with the previous therapy - HCV Relapse - Patient of HCV waiting for transplant, bridge to transplant - Cirrhosis - Not previously enrolled in any trial/study of Sofosbuvir Exclusion criteria o Not given informed consent o Pregnancy</detailed_description>
