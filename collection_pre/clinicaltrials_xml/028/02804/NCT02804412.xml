	<brief_summary>Constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) has proven effective in stroke patients. It has remained unclear, however, whether intensity of therapy or constraint is the relevant factor. This study will give an answer to this question to improve speech and language therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aphasia Therapy: Factors of Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although there is clear evidence that aphasia therapy is effective, questions remain as to the intensity of administered therapy, the preferred therapeutic approach and its initiation with regard to stroke onset. CIAT is a a high intense group therapy administered over 2 weeks. Additionally, patients have to communicate solely in spoken words or sentences (constraint). This study compares CIAT with an approach of the same intensity without constraints and a less intense house-typical therapeutic approach.</detailed_description>
