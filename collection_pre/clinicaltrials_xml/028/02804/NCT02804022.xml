	<brief_summary>This is a closed-loop system which is embodied in a novel and intelligent algorithm that takes into account patients' vital signs. The system allows better and responsive titration of personalized pain relief together with non-invasive physiological monitoring that measures oxygenation, breathing and heart rate continuously.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vital-signs-integrated Patient-assisted Intravenous Opioid Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A glaring safety gap in the administration of commonplace Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) opioids unfortunately exists. A significant proportion of patients may suffer from respiratory depression with the use of PCA opioids and it is imperative to discover solutions to improve the safety of PCA opioids, therein improving medication safety, enhancing quality of postoperative care and providing economic cost savings. Currently, no continuous monitoring system that integrates an intelligent decision making response exists. The investigators primary aim is to develop and commercialise a Vital-signs-integrated (using oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate) Patient-assisted Intravenous opioid Analgesia (VPIA) that can be integrated into the hospital-wide monitoring systems is capable of making intelligent decision making responses to bridge the PCA safety gap within 12 months. This VPIA delivery system will be a closed-loop system for safety and efficacy. It will be integrated with continuous vital signs monitoring, and provide appropriate response to breach of safety parameters. It will be part of a larger surveillance system that provides tiered medical and nursing alerts to safety parameters.</detailed_description>
