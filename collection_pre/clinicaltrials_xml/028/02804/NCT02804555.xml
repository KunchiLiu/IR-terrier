	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators examine the effects of intraoperative oxygen administration to the mother on certain enzyme functions of the newborn. With this object blood samples are taken from the newborn's umbilical chord - which is otherwise a routine practice at the investigators clinic - and the mother's radial artery in parallel with umbilical clamping and cutting for blood gas and reactive oxygen species analyses. Samples are analyzed locally in a properly equipped laboratory.</brief_summary>
