	<brief_summary>Comparison of two types of analgesia after cesarean section. All patients will anaesthetised with spinal technique. Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum block to treat postoperative pain. Postoperative pain will measured with visual-analogue scale (VAS). 1, 2, 6 months after surgery each patient will be called to assess neuropathic pain with Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Pain-treatment Techniques After Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Written consent will be obtained before the cesarean section. Only subarachnoidally anaesthetised patients may participate in the study. Pencil-point spinal needle and bupivacaine (Marcaine Heavy Spinal 0.5 %) will be used. At the end of surgery ultrasound-guided regional block will be performed. Each patient will be randomly allocated to one of the treated group: transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) or quadratus lumborum (QL). Patients receive 0.2 mL of local anesthetic solution (0.25 % bupivacaine) on each side. Postoperative pain will be measured with VAS (visual-analogue scale) 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the end of operation. Paracetamol, metamizol, ketoprofen may be given as required. Whenever pain exceeds 40 (VAS) 5 mg of morphine will be given intravenously (maximum two dosages per day). 1, 3, 6 months patients will be called to assess neuropathic pain. Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) will be used.</detailed_description>
