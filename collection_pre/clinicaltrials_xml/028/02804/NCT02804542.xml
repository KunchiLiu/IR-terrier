	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if non-continuous local anesthetic fascia iliaca blocks performed in the emergency department are effective for preoperative analgesia in hip fracture patients. Investigators hypothesize that patients with these blocks will have lower opioid requirements than patients in a historical group in whom blocks were not performed.</brief_summary>
