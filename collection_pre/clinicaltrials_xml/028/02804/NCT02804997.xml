	<brief_summary>The great majority of cardiac surgery patients develop a degree of post-operatory respiratory failure. This is due to several factors. The predominant element in the onset of this respiratory impairment is the constitution of foci of pulmonary atelectasis, caused by peroperative hypoventilation (in the presence or absence of ECC). The incidence has been evaluated at between 54% and 92%, depending on the study. The use of NIV (non-invasive ventilation) might (through the application of continuous positive expiratory pressure) help to counter the development of these atelectasic foci.</brief_summary>
