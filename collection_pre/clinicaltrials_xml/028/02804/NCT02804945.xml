	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to patients who have ARDS. Researchers also want to learn if these cells can help control ARDS when given with drugs that are routinely used to treat ARDS. In this study, all participants will receive standard of care treatment for ARDs, and some participants will receive standard of care treatment and MSCs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARD) in Stem Cell Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MSCs: MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs used in this study were collected from healthy donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory at MD Anderson. The product participant will receive is from a healthy donor that is not related to participant. Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups and participant will have an equal chance of being in either group. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. - If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive MSCs and standard of care drugs for ARDS. - If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive standard of care drugs for ARDS. MSC Administration: If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive MSCs by vein over about 1-2 hours 1 time on Day 1. Both groups will also receive standard of care drugs and treatment for ARDS. The study doctor will tell participant which drugs participant is taking, their risks, and when participant should take them. Study Visits: On Days 1 and 3: - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's heart, kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing. - Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn to check the oxygen level in participant's blood. On Days 14 and 28: °Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's heart, kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing. On Days 30 and 60: °Participant will be checked for possible reactions to participant's treatment, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against participant's body). This will be checked by physical exam, by the doctor reviewing participant's side effects, and blood from standard of care blood draws. At Months 6 and 12: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will be checked for possible reactions to participant's treatment, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against participant's body). This will be checked by physical exam, by the doctor reviewing participant's side effects, and blood from standard of care blood draws. - Participant will have lung function tests. Length of Study: Participation on this study will end after the Month 12 study visit. Participant will be taken off study early if participant is not able to receive the MSC infusion(s), if intolerable side effects occur, if the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. This is an investigational study. MSC infusions for the treatment of ARDS is investigational. Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. ARDS characterized by hypoxemia and bilateral radiographic opacities not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload as judged by the treating physician using all available data. Moderate ARDS includes stem cell transplant patients with the previous presentation and a P/F ratio &lt;/= 200 or S/F ratio of &lt;/= 214. The duration of the hypoxemia criterion and the radiograph criterion must be &lt;/= 96 hours at the time of enrollment. 2. Stem Cell transplant patients age &gt;/=18 years. 3. Treated with appropriate maximal medical therapy for pulmonary toxicity. 4. Patient must achieve a 2hour stable baseline period in order to be eligible to receive product infusion, defined as transcutaneous oxygen saturation in the target range of 8895% without any increase in ventilator settings and stable vasopressor use if the patient requires vasopressor for blood pressure support. 5. Negative pregnancy test in a woman with childbearing potential defined as not postmenopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization. 6. Patient or legally appropriate proxy must be able to understand study instructions and sign consent. 1. NYHA class IV heart failure. 2. Unstable ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. 3. Moribund patients not expected to survive up to 48 hours. 4. Patients with ARDS resulting from trauma. 5. Patients with WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension. 6. Patients with documented deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the past 3 months. 7. Patients with severe chronic liver disease (ChildsPugh score &gt; 10). 8. Patients with previous solid organ transplant. 9. Patients who are allergic to betalactam antibiotics, which are used in the manufacturing of hMSCs. 10. Pregnant and/or lactating women.</criteria>
