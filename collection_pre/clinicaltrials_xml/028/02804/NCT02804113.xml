	<brief_summary>The VMI-CFA study investigates the efficacy of the Supera Stent in the treatment of common femoral artery stenosis or occlusion. 100 patients will be included with a RF of 2 to 4. The lesion is located within the native CFA and treated with predillation prior to stenting with the Supera Peripheral Stent System. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 month post procedure. The primary endpoint of the study is the primary patency at 12 months and periprocedural events up to 30 days post procedure. Secondary endpoints include technical success, primary patency rate at 1 &amp; 6 month, freedom from TLR at 1-, 6- and 12 month follow-up and clinical success at 1-, 6- &amp; 12-month follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient presenting a score from 2 to 4 following Rutherford classification Patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations at the specified times Patient is &gt;18 years old Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study Patient has a projected life expectancy of at least 12 months Prior to enrolment, the guidewire has crossed target lesion De novo lesions located in the common femoral artery, suitable for endovascular therapy The target lesions are located within the native CFA: localized between the origin of the circumflex iliac artery and the proximal (1cm) superficial femoral artery. There is angiographic evidence of a patent deep femoral artery The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis &gt; 50% or occlusion There is angiographic evidence of at least onevesselrunoff to the foot, irrespective of whether or not outflow was reestablished by means of previous endovascular intervention Presence of another stent in the target vessel that was placed during a previous procedure Previous open surgery in the same limb Patients contraindicated for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants or thrombolytics. Patients who exhibit persistent acute intraluminal thrombus at the target lesion site. Perforation at the angioplasty site evidenced by extravasation of contrast medium Patients with known hypersensitivity to nickeltitanium and heparin, including those patients who have had a previous incidence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II Patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders Female patient with child bearing potential not taking adequate contraceptives or currently breastfeeding Ipsilateral inflow (aortoiliac) artery treatment before target lesion treatment with a residual stenosis&gt;30% Use of thrombectomy, atherectomy or laser devices during procedure Any planned surgical intervention/procedure 30 days after the study procedure Any patient considered to be hemodynamically unstable at onset of procedure Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached the primary endpoint. Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF, severe COPD, metastatic malignancy, dementia, etc.) or other medical condition that would preclude compliance with the study protocol or 1year life expectancy Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or nonstudy limb Septicemia or bacteremia Known allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated prior to the study procedure</criteria>
