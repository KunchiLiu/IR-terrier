	<brief_summary>The project's objective is to identify and characterize somatic mutations in cases of idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) on the basis of molecular defects found in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in order to validate the hypothesis whereby ICUS may be a precursor of MDS. To this end, high-throughput exon sequencing (using next-generation sequencing (NGS)) will be used to target the genes known to be mutated in MDS. This study is important for two reasons. Firstly, it will help to optimise the clinical monitoring of patients with molecular defects and considered to be at risk of progression. Secondly, it will provide a better understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of ICUS to MDS.</brief_summary>
