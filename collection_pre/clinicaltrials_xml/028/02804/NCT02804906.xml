	<brief_summary>This pilot feasibility study will test whether a home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention, using physical therapist visits combined with mobile health technology, will prevent decline in high-risk patients post acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Participants will be randomized to either an intervention arm (home-based physical therapy), or a control (usual care) arm. Prior to discharge, participants in the intervention arm will receive a 1-hour educational session by a research physical therapist that includes information on cardiac risk factor management, postoperative recovery, education on medication adherence, and a prescription for home exercise that is tailored to each patient's baseline abilities and limitations. Participants assigned to the control arm will receive a 30-minute counseling session on risk factor modification prior to discharge, in addition to usual care post-AMI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participants enrolled in this research study will receive the FDA-approved FitBit Flex, a wearable activity monitoring device which will objectively measure physical activity and sedentary behavior in the period post-hospital discharge. Daily activity monitoring will include: number of steps, distance traveled, calories burned, number of active minutes.</detailed_description>
