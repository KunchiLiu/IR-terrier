	<detailed_description>[INTRODUCTION] The success of combination HIV prevention efforts, including HIV treatment as prevention, hinges on universal, routine HIV testing with linkage to care and antiretroviral treatment initiation after HIV diagnosis. The proposed study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness and sustainability of innovative incentive strategies, informed directly by behavioral economics and decision psychology, to promote HIV testing among men and HIV and treatment among HIV-infected adults in rural Uganda. [OBJECTIVES] AIM 1: Adult men living in the study communities in rural Uganda (N=3,000) will be randomized to one of three (fixed, loss aversion, and lottery) incentive approaches and different incentive amounts that encourage HIV testing. The hypothesis is that lottery and loss aversion incentives will result in significantly higher testing uptake than fixed incentives. The investigators also hypothesize that the proportion of testers in each arm who are HIV-infected (secondary outcome) will be highest with lottery-based incentives. In sub-samples of men who do and do not test, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews to assess perceptions, attitudes and preferences related to incentives that may affect how incentives influence testing. AIM 2: Adult men and women living in the study communities (N=400) who obtained an HIV-positive result at a community health campaign will be randomized into one of two incentive approaches that encourage HIV treatment adherence. The investigators hypothesize that a financial incentive will be more effective than no incentive in promoting HIV virologic suppression (a measure of success in ART adherence and navigation of the HIV treatment cascade) as incentives capitalize on present bias by drawing attention to a salient, immediate benefit of initiating and/or maintaining treatment, and leverage loss aversion by generating implicit loss as a result of delaying the decision to initiate ART. AIM 3: The investigators will examine the extent to which incentives in one year (Aim 1) affects participation in subsequent testing efforts without incentives. Investigators will also assess effects of the Aim 2 intervention on viral suppression 6 months after incentives are discontinued, i.e. at 12 months. This will reveal whether incentives increase or decrease men's motivation for future HIV testing. Investigators will also calculate the incremental cost of incentives per additional person tested and enrolled in care as well as the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The overall objective is to generate evidence on how best to use low-cost incentives to promote HIV testing among adult men and maximize the benefits of ART among HIV-infected adults in rural Uganda, and to critically evaluate the sustainability of such interventions.</detailed_description>
