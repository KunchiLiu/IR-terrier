	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after 8 weeks of treatment in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) patients age of 8 to 17 years, with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) on optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy +/- other lipid modifying therapies (LMTs) or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of alirocumab. - To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters.</brief_summary>
