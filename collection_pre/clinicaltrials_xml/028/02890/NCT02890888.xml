	<brief_summary>Patients will have a Functional MRI before and after 10 hyperbaric Oxygen treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen on Functional Connectivity in Patients With Cerebral Small Vessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional MRI studies will be done before and 4-6 weeks after Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment to assess changes in connectivity of resting state neural networks. 10 hyperbaric treatments at 2 atmospheres absolute for 1 hour at pressure will be administered. A review of symptoms and and thorough clinical neurological examination by an experienced neurologist familiar with these studies will be done before and 4-6 weeks after the hyperbaric treatments.</detailed_description>
