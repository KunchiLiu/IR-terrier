	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find the number of natural killer (NK) cells from non-HLA matched donors that can be safely infused into patients with cancer. NK cells are a form of lymphocytes that defend against cancer cells. NK cells in cancer patients do not work well to fight cancer. In this study, the NK cells are being donated by healthy individuals without cancer who are not "matched" by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes to patients. After receiving these NK cells, patients may also be given a drug called ALT803. ALT803 is a protein that keeps NK cells alive, helps them grow in number and supports their cancer-fighting characteristics. HLA-unmatched NK cell infusion is investigational (experimental) because the process has not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial of Universal Donor NK Cell Therapy in Combination With ALT803</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ex vivo expanded non-HLA matched donor NK cells in combination with ALT-803 Secondary Objectives: - Describe safety profile / toxicity of combining ALT-803 with NK cell adoptive therapy. - Determine antitumor activity of allogeneic NK cells with ALT-803 support. - Determine if a lymphocyte depleting regimen is adequate for preventing early elimination of HLA-mismatched donor NK cells by host T-cells. Study Design: This is a phase I study with "3+3" design with three planned dose levels of NK cells and a fixed dose of ALT-803. Three patients will be enrolled sequentially to each dose level, starting with dose level 1. Patients will be segregated to either receive ALT803 as cytokine support after NK cell infusion (starting with same dose level as Level 1) or no cytokine administration. Patients in the arm receiving ALT803 will be either hematologic malignancy patients (Cohort A) or Colon/Soft tissue sarcoma patients (Cohort B). Absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the DLT assessment period of 28 days must be documented for all patients enrolled a cell dose without ALT803 before the next cohort of patients to receive cytokines at that dose level can be enrolled. Patients can also be enrolled in parallel to the next cell dose level without cytokines.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologic confirmation of relapsed and or refractory hematologic malignancy, locally advanced or metastatic colon/rectal carcinoma, or refractory and/or relapsed soft tissue sarcomas and have failed at least one standard line of therapy. Patients will be eligible if they have either declined standard treatment regimens or if there is no standard approach to curative salvage therapy per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in the setting of relapsed/refractory disease. In addition, patients for whom a potential 28day delay in treatment will not interfere with the subject's potential therapeutic options can be eligible per the treating physician's discretion. Malignancies can include: Acute myeloid leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Chronic myeloid leukemia Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Non Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin Lymphoma Myeloproliferative syndromes Plasma cell myeloma Colon/rectal carcinoma Soft tissue sarcomas including but not limited to Ewing's sarcoma and Rhabdomyosarcoma Patients must have recovered from acute toxicities of prior chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Any prior nonhematologic vital organ toxicity (cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal) of previous therapy must have resolved to grade 1 or less. All previous chemotherapy or radiation must be completed at least 3 weeks prior to study entry. Immunologic therapy must be completed at least 1 week prior to study entry. Patients with prior stem cell transplant must be greater than 365 days posttransplant. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 Organ function criteria (There is no exclusion for the presence of cytopenias), Serum total bilirubin &lt;2 mg/dl (except if known Gilbert syndrome and normal transaminases) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Pulmonary function (DLCO) &gt;40% of the expected value corrected for alveolar volume and hemoglobin Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (double barrier method of birth control or abstinence) 4 weeks prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of childbearing age must have documented negative pregnancy test prior to start of lymphodepleting regimen. Subjects receiving any other investigational agents. Subjects for whom a potential 28day delay in treatment will interfere with the subject's potential therapeutic options. Patients with untreated malignant involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Head imaging will be necessary to document absence of CNS involvement in patients with colon/rectal cancer and soft tissue sarcomas. Patients with hematologic malignancies who have undergone treatment for malignant involvement of the CNS must have no evidence of residual disease by imaging or CSF sampling prior to study enrollment. History of allergic reactions to chemotherapy agents used in this protocol as part of lymphodepletion regimen (Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide) Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. Chronic active untreated hepatitis B or C infection. Recipients of previous allogeneic transplants who have rash involving more than 10% body surface area attributed to graft versus host disease (GVHD) (&gt; Grade 1 GVHD of skin). Stem cell transplant recipients will be excluded if they are still receiving immunosuppression including steroids for GVHD or have active GVHD in any organ (except for Grade 1 only of skin, not requiring treatment).</criteria>
