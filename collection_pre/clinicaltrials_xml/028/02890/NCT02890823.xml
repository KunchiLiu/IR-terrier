	<brief_summary>To characterize the effect of three different doses of vitamin D3 supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) changes in epilepsy patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) versus patients receiving non enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (non-EIAEDs), and to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for hypovitaminosis D among Thai patients with epilepsy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Three Different Doses of Oral Cholecalciferol on 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Changes Among Epilepsy Patients With Hypovitaminosis D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-blinded prospective, randomized study undertaken at epilepsy clinic of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. The patients with hypovitaminosis D were included and divided into two groups according to the type of AEDs use. Patients receiving each AEDs type were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D3 1000, 3000 or 6000 IU once daily.
