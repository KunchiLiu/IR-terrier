	<brief_summary>This study is testing the effectiveness of "dry needling" for pain management and on muscle strength and leg function for those with knee pain. Dry needling consists of small, monofilament needles that are administered directly into the tissue and manipulated to make the muscle relax for pain relief. This technique is used to treat dysfunctions in skeletal muscle and connective tissue to help diminish pain, reduce impairments of body structure and restore function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dry Needling and Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will evaluate the effects of dry needling on pain, muscle performance, and function in those with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) of the knee. Variables of interest will include self-reported pain scores, self-reported functional outcome and disability questionnaire scores, and various objective clinical measures including muscle strength, joint range of motion, and movement patterns during basic tasks related to activities of daily living. Patients who are referred to physical therapy with PFPS will be recruited. Patients will be randomly and equally allocated into one of the following groups: 1. Gluteal dry needling (GLUTE) 2. Quadriceps dry needling (QUAD) 3. Sham gluteal dry needling (SHAM GLUTE) 4. Sham quadriceps dry needling (SHAM QUAD) 5. Control group (CONTROL) Groups 1-4 will receive 2 sessions of dry needling or sham dry needling to the gluteal and/or quadricpes muscles on their painful lower limb over 2 consecutive weeks in addition to standard physical therapy. The CONTROL group will only receive standard physical therapy. The sham treatment groups (groups 3-4) will receive a placebo treatment that does not penetrate the skin or muscles. Measurements will be performed at baseline prior to any physical therapy interventions and then at week 3.</detailed_description>
