	<brief_summary>Genetic abnormalities in focal epilepsies are well known. A novel gene (DEPDC5) was identified, associated with various genotypes of epilepsies. Recently, DEPDC5 mutations were identified also inside focal cortical dysplasias. This could suggest that a somatic mutation in DEPDC5 could be responsible for the cortical dysplasia. The study aims to identify various genetic mutations responsible for drug-resistant focal epilepsies due to Focal cortical dysplasia in children undergoing surgery for epilepsies due to focal cortical dysplasias in Rothschild Foundation, Paris. Patients and their parents will be recruited to identify genetic abnormalities both in lymphocytic and cortical DNA.</brief_summary>
