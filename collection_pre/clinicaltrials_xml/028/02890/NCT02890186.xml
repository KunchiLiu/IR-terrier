	<brief_title>Dual-loop Target Controlled Infusion for Coadministration of Propofol and Remifentanil Guided by Narcotrend Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patients scheduled for anterior cervical decompression and fusion with internal fixation surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups:closed-loop (group A,n=30) and open-loop group(group B,n=30).The procedure during induction of anesthesia was same in two groups.In group A,if Narcotrend index(NI) fall down to 46 and keep more than 30 seconds,propofol and remifentanil were intravenously infused as feedback automatically to achieve the target NI of 26-46.However,the NI in group B was controlled manually.</detailed_description>
