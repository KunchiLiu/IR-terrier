	<detailed_description>The national recommendations promote the applying of the Contact Additional Precautions (CAP) with the Standard Precautions (SP) to limit the transmission of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. However, that could entail more costs and a reduction of quality of the patient care. This study seeks showing it in way of a non-interventional research in a resuscitation unit. Two periods are compared for noticing the rates of MDR bacteria contaminations.</detailed_description>
