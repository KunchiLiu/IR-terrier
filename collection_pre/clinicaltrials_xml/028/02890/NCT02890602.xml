	<brief_summary>This is a phase Ⅱ study of erythropoietin for management of anemia caused by chemotherapy in patients with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. The investigators want to investigate hematopoietic response of darbepoietin alfa and the quality of life assessment of increasement of hemoglobin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erythropoietin for Management of Anemia Caused by Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Darbepoietin alfa may cause the body to make more red blood cells. They are used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy in patients with malignant lymphoma. Darbepoietin will be applied to R-CHOP(Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, Prednisolone) chemotherapy every 21days ± 2days with fixed 360㎍. It will be applied to chemotherapy until increment of hemoglobin 12.0g/dL. If the hemoglobin level exceeds 12.0g/dL, administration of darbepoietin will be temporarily stopped. And, the questionnaire of the quality of life will be conducted at the baseline, after 2th darbepoietin alfa administration, at study completion.</detailed_description>
