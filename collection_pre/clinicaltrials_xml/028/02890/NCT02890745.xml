	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of empagliflozin on oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes. The association is examined by comparing the difference in oxidative modifications before and after 14 days treatment with 25 mg empagliflozin compared to placebo treatment. The study is randomised, double-blinded, and placebo controlled. Each treatment group consists of 17 males with type 2 diabetes. Oxidative modifications are measured by urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine. A student t-test will be performed to compare the drug treatment with placebo. The results will be published in a peer-review journal.</brief_summary>
