	<brief_summary>Study purpose is to research whether compression therapy is beneficial after truncal vein RF-ablation and distal sclerotherapy done in the same session when needed. Patients will be randomised to either no compression group (Group I) or compression group (Group II)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compression Therapy Following Truncal Vein Endothermal Ablation And Distal Sclerotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study two endpoints are anticipated, first endpoint is to assess safety and adverse effects between groups at 1 month endpoint. Also post-procedural pain and need for painkillers are monitored. Compliance and reasons for non-compliance is recorded in compression group. Second endpoint is to assess mid-term (6 months) success of truncal vein occlusion as well as changes in Aberdeen score between groups compared to pre-operative stage. Study design is non-inferiority trial where in 5% margin occlusion of truncal vein is expected to be equal in two groups at 6 six months. Power analysis showed need for 85 patients per group and taking into account possible dropouts anticipated n = 200.</detailed_description>
