	<brief_title>Effect of Consumption of Non Caloric Sweeteners and Insulin Sensibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the last decades there has been a sustained increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity and, along with it, of chronic noncommunicable diseases. There have been addressed various management strategies, including sugar replacement for Non-caloric Artificial Sweeteners (NAS). Nevertheless, in several cohort studies it has found the opposite effect, it has observed associations between the consumption of NAS with greater weight gain and increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In clinical trials, in both humans and mice, there has been greater association with glucose intolerance, being 3 possible mechanisms: 1) dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota; 2) altered regulation of appetite cephalic phase and secretion of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1); and 3) increased intestinal glucose absorption via increased Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter-1 (SGLT-1) and Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), transporters to glucose absorption. In the following review the major findings in the literature regarding the consumption of NAS and its deleterious effects on human health will be studied.</detailed_description>
