	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab when given together with decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ipilimumab and decitabine may work better in treating patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab and Decitabine in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients who are post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT). II. To determine the MTD or RP2D of combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or refractory MDS or relapsed or refractory AML in patients who are transplant naive. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) including complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) for AML following 2003 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria. III. To determine the ORR including CR, partial remission, marrow CR, hematologic improvement for MDS using 2006 IWG criteria. IV. To determine the overall survival and progression free survival at 1 year. V. To determine the duration of remission. VI. To determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the post allo-HCT cohort. VII. To determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the transplant naive cohort. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To measure the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) prior to treatment and during treatment. II. To evaluate the genome for evidence of clonal evolution among longitudinal samples (prior to treatment, during treatment, and at relapse if relevant) from individual patients. III. To evaluate the histopathologic findings of immune response using immunohistochemistry. IV. To determine the immune response in the AML tumor microenvironment by using flow cytometry and single cell mass cytometry to evaluate T cell subsets. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab. ARM A (PATIENTS POST ALLO-HCT): INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive decitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B (TRANSPLANT NA√èVE PATIENTS): INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive decitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive decitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 52 weeks (1 year).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Patients with AML according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 revised criteria Disease at any relapse is defined as bone marrow blasts &gt;= 5%; or development of extramedullary disease If a participant only has evidence of relapsed disease in an extramedullary site, then prior biopsies for nonskin sites of leukemic involvement will be allowed if there has been no antileukemia therapy since biopsy and if performed within 4 weeks of treatment start Refractory disease is defined as failure to remit after 2 lines of intensive chemotherapy or a minimum of 4 cycles of hypomethylating agent therapy Elderly patients who are 65 years and older with de novo or secondary AML who are determined not to benefit from standard intensive chemotherapy strategies will also be considered after discussion with overall principal investigator (PI) Patients with MDS with excess blasts (myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts1 [MDSEB1] or myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts2 [MDSEB2], according to WHO 2016 revised criteria, those previously diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blasts1 [RAEB1] or refractory anemia with excess blasts2 [RAEB2], or those considered higherrisk per Revised International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSSR] [score &gt;
