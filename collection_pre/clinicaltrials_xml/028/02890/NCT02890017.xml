	<brief_summary>This is a medico-economic study of outpatient surgery paired with a night stay in a patient-hotel, compared with a conventional hospitalization for three types of urological surgeries. The aim is to show that those two strategies are not different in term of adverse effects or rehospitalization, and that the patient-hotel provide a better quality of life at a reduced cost, in order to generate savings for the paying agent: the Healthcare insurance.</brief_summary>
