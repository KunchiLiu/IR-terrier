	<brief_summary>The treatment of renal calculus by retrograde intrarenal surgery(RIRS) isn't able to eliminate stone completely,previous studies have proved that the application of External Physical Vibration Lithecbole(EPVL) treatment can effectively promote the discharge of renal residual stones after RIRS, improve the stone free rate(SFR) .However, when is the the best time of performing EPVL , and with the least complication, there is still no conclusion.Therefore, researchers purpose to evaluate the effectiveness of EPVL in treatment of residual fragments in different time (3 days ,7 days and 14 days) after RIRS by prospective study of clinical trial, which will determine the best time for performing EPVL treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Of External Physical Vibration Lithecbole(EPVL) In Different Time After Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery(RIRS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of external physical vibration lithecbole for the treatment of residual stone in different time (3 days ,7 days and 14 days) after the operation of RIRS，thereby improving stone clearance rate. Investigators will do a multi-centers randomized controlled trial(RCT)，and investigators plan to perform this study in 7 hospitals，which are the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University of China, Department of Urology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University of China, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Tongji Hospital,Hubei provincial people's Hospital,the People' Hospital of Huzhou，The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University of China. Investigators plan to beginning their study August 2016 and end July 2017. three hundred and fifty seven patients with postoperative residual stone after RIRS will be enrolled in this study. By simple random sampling technique, all the patients will be assigned to the group A(EPVL performed in 3 days after RIRS), group B(EPVL performed in 7 days after RIRS),and group C(EPVL performed in 14 days after RIRS)，compared three groups of patients with stone clearance rate and complications.By this study, investigators hope to determine the best time to perform EPVL , improve stone clearance rate after RIRS，and provide better guidance for clinical. The principle of extracorporeal physical vibration lithecbole: A Simple harmonic motion technology in multi-direction was applied. The Lateral acceleration was provided by the physical vibration device in the base through the harmonic vibration wave in the horizontal direction, which induces the urinary stone separate with the kidney or ureter, and expands a moving space for the stone. Meanwhile, an axial effect was produced to push the stone by the physical vibration device in the handle through the harmonic vibration wave in the multi- direction. Finally, with the help of changing the position and direction of the extracorporeally physical vibration machine, the urinary stone was discharged from the urinary collecting system. Number: 357cases(119 cases respectively in group A, B, C) Grouping methods: In this trial, investigators use equilibrium randomization methods that generate random numerical code table, according to the table, patients are randomly assigned to different groups. Evaluating indicator Stone-free rate in 4 weeks after RIRS. Incidence rate of complications and adverse reactions after EPVL(fever, hematuria,etc). Trial method:Cases selection and grouping: in 2 days after RIRS, the imaging KUB(abdominal plain film), patients with radiolucent calculus need to be examined by CT demonstrate the presence of residual fragments, and the cases that meeting inclusion criterion are randomly assigned to groups, and the ureteral stent should be removed in 4 weeks; Laboratory testing: blood routine, urine routine, renal function , coagulation function; Strat the treatment of EPVL before the removal of ureteral stent. Methods of three groups: Group A:EPVL performed in 3 days after RIRS; Group B:EPVL performed in 7 days after RIRS; Group C:EPVL performed in 14 days after RIRS; Preparation before EPVL: the amount of fluid intake is about 1000-2000ml, start the treatment of EPVL when patient's bladder is filling; Record: patients' information; Start the treatment of EPVL; Patients should follow the measures below: the amount of fluid intake is more than 2000ml/d; increase physical activity; rest in position on uninjured side, patients with lower renal calyx calculus need to invert body; Whenever follow-up, all patients undergo the treatment of EPVL. At the last time of follow-up,patients should undergoing EPVL first,then remove stent,reexamined by KUB. Follow up timing: in group A and group B,patients reexamined in 1,2 and 4 weeks after RIRS;In group C,patients reexamined in 2 and 4 weeks after RIRS. Follow up project Laboratory testing: routine urinalysis; Imaging examination: KUB or kidney CT scan (radiolucent calculus) Complications and adverse reactions. Data gathering Fill in follow up table data; Radiological images; IVP(intravenous pyelography) or kidney CT scan; Reexamined by KUB (radiopaque calculus) or CT (radiolucent calculus).If stones have been eliminated completely ,follow-up is over.</detailed_description>
