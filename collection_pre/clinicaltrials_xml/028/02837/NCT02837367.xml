	<brief_summary>The NutriGen project will be using nutrigenomic methods to determine the effectiveness of treatments with specific dietary foods, on the basis of genetic risk predisposition (genetic signature) of obese individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Nutrigenomic Models for the Personalized Treatment With Medical Foods in Obese People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NutriGen project specific aim 1. Establishing a genetic signature model, involved in the donation of methyl groups and unsaturated omega-6/3 fatty acids metabolism, with a high predictive value for classification of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in obese subjects. 1. Establishing a genetic signature model in obese adults with dyslipidemia. 2. Establishing a genetic signature model in obese children with insulin resistance. c. Establishing a correlation between blood/plasma concentrations of the relevant metabolites, genetic signatures and dyslipidemia profile of adults, and respectively a profile for insulin resistance in obese children. NutriGen project specific aim 2. Determining the efficacy of a dietary food specific treatment, which is also correlated with a genetic signature (nutrigenomics), based on the correlations defined in objective 1: 1. Implementation of a treatment with dietary foods (for adults), in the presence/absence of other already prescribed treatments; 2. Implementation of a treatment with dietary foods (for children), in the presence/absence of other already prescribed treatments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults: between 18 and 70 years old; obesity present as defined by body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 and by abdominal circumference ≥84 cm (women), and ≥90 cm (men); dyslipidemia present as defined by: serum Cholesterol ≥200 mg/dl, HDLc ≤50 mg/dl (women) or ≤40 mg/dl (men), serum Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dl, or present treatment for dyslipidemia (e.g. statins, fibrates, omega3 fatty acids, cholestyramine, ezetimibe). Children: age between 7 and 18 years old; BMI &gt;+2SD WHO reference Adults: diagnosed for any type of cancer, or medical history of cancer; any autoimmune disease; any psychiatric disorder; blood coagulation disorders; history of drug abuse; alcohol abuse evaluated using AUDITC.
