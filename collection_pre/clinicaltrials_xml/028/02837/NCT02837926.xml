	<detailed_description>3000 women aged within the age range of 25-45 years old will be recruited; 250-300 women per country. These women will be identified by means of screening registry lists or screening clinical visits. Eligible women will receive a study questionnaire on the HPV vaccine. Additionally, and independently of participating in the study questionnaire, those who accept will get 3 HPV vaccine doses. Depending on country preferences, either Cervarix® (Glaxosmithkline Biologicals, S.A.) at month 0, 1 and 6 or Gardasil® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC) at month 0, 2 and 6, will be administered. Safety data and HPV vaccine compliance will be assessed. A sub study in Spain will also analyze acceptability of HPV vaccination in a sample of women aged 35-40 yrs identified as poor screening attenders. Two independent informed consent forms will be provided; one for the study questionnaire participation and another for HPV vaccine administration.</detailed_description>
