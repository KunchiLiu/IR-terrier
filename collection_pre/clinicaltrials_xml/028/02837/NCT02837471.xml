	<brief_title>Feasibility and Usability of a Pedometer in a Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Program for French-speaking Canadians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and rehabilitation program is an evidence-based, standard of care for those who have coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions; the aim of CVD prevention and rehabilitation program is to minimize disease progression and prevent future cardiovascular events. Behaviour change interventions targeting exercise are effective for improving physical activity levels, but can be intensive and costly. Activity monitors with accompanying web applications may provide a practical compliment to behaviour change interventions as an affordable way to promote and sustain increased physical activity levels, as measured by steps and physical activity levels. To date, no studies have examined the role of a pedometer with accompanying web application on steps and physical activity levels in French-speaking Canadians attending the FrancoForme® cardiac prevention and rehabilitation program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. It is also unknown the average daily steps of Canadian Francophone patients. Identifying successful interventions that promote physical activity among CVD prevention and rehabilitation program patients will help to improve their health as well as decrease the risk of first or subsequent cardiovascular events.</detailed_description>
