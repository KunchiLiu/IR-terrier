	<brief_summary>The human Prion diseases can be classified into sporadic, acquired and inherited forms. Inherited forms usually manifest in higher age so there have to be factors preventing Prion propagation in young mutation carriers. Antibodies against the flexible tail of Prions have been shown to be protective in mice. The investigators intend to screen mutation carriers and controls for the presence of Prion autoantibodies.</brief_summary>
