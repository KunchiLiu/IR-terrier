	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation, Safety and Activity Study of CDX-014 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CDX-014 is an antibody-drug conjugate that binds to a protein called TIM-1, which is found on a high percentage of kidney cancer cells and other tumors. The study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma to determine the safety and efficacy of CDX-014. Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of several levels of CDX-014. The first phase of the study will test the safety profile of CDX-014 and determine which dose of CDX-014 will be studied in the Phase II portion of the study. During Phase II, up to 25 patients will be enrolled and receive the recommended Phase II dose of CDX-014. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic clear cell or papillary renal cell carcinoma. 2. At least two prior anticancer regimens (one must be a VEGFtargeted TKI), or are otherwise inappropriate candidates for all approved therapies. 3. Documented progressive disease based on radiographic, clinical or pathologic assessment during or subsequent to last therapy. 4. Measureable (target) disease. 5. Must have available tumor tissue for TIM1 expression testing 6. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months 7. If of childbearing potential (male or female), agrees to use effective contraception during study treatment and for at least 6 months following last treatment dose. 1. Prior therapy containing MMAE 2. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen, including antibody drug conjugates 3. TKI inhibitor therapy within 2 weeks or at least 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to planned start of study treatment. 4. Monoclonal antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to the planned start of study treatment. 5. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment (palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions allowed up to 2 weeks prior to study treatment start). 6. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to study entry. 7. Use of other investigational drugs within 2 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to study treatment. 8. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions (uncontrolled diabetes or infection), known infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. 9. Brain metastases, unless previously treated and asymptomatic and not progressive for 2 months. 10. Significant cardiovascular disease (including congestive heart failure). 11. Other malignancy except for treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, cured in situ cancers, or other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for ≥ 3 years.</criteria>
