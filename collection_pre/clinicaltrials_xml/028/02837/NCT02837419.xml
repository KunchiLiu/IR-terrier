	<brief_title>Cost-effectiveness of Extracorporeal Life Support Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A direct comparison between usual care and ECLS treatment is difficult. Alternatively we compare predicted mortality for every patient based on validated scoring systems at the initiation of ECLS treatment with the actual outcome, so every patient is his own control. Primary outcome is HRQoL assessed with the EQ-5D questionnaire at 1 year. Healthcare costs and costs from a societal perspective are prospectively measured.</detailed_description>
