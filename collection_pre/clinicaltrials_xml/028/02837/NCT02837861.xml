	<brief_summary>A randomized, parallel-group, pilot study comparing the effect of the early addition of intravenous protein to enteral feeding as tolerated versus enteral feedings as tolerated alone immediately post traumatic injury. Primary: To determine that early and adequate nutritional support will improve protein economy in the first week post -injury as measured by nitrogen balance. We hypothesize that an improvement in nitrogen balance with early maximized protein intake will support the production of acute phase proteins, major antioxidants and the inflammatory response. Secondary: Through the use of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technologies we will determine that our plan for early and adequate nutritional support with adequate protein from day one post injury will alter the metabolomics profile when compared to routine nutritional support. Tertiary: For Specific Aim 3 we will measure several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and soluble proteins.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Subjects admitted to the trauma service and cared for in the SICU will be screened for participation in this study. - If subjects meet eligibility criteria, they will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to enteral nutrition alone or enteral nutrition plus Amino Acid (AA) infusions. - Nutritional assessment will be completed. - Various procedures/assessments will take place over the course of the trial. - Subjects will be followed for 28 days or until discharged or disposition of status. Potential subjects deemed eligible will be randomized by the REDCap Randomization Module and begin study interventions within the first 24 hours of admission to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). Subjects enrolled into the Control Arm will receive routine nutritional support (RNS). RNS for the purpose of this study is defined as: - Nutrition delivered via the enteral route of administration; - Enteral caloric goal of 60-80% of energy requirements; - Enteral feedings to be initiated as soon as medically feasible; - Full parenteral nutrition to be initiated on Day 7 if enteral nutrition has not been started. Subjects will complete the study after Day 5 and will continue with nutritional support as clinically indicated. Subjects enrolled into the Experimental Arm will receive RNS plus supplemental intravenous amino acids (RNS+IVAA). RNS+IVAA for the purpose of this study is defined as: - Nutrition delivered via the enteral route of administration; - Enteral caloric goal of 60-80% of energy requirements; - Enteral feedings to be initiated as soon as medically feasible; - Full parenteral nutrition to be initiated on Day 7 if enteral nutrition has not been started. - Supplemental intravenous amino acids to begin within 24 hours of admission to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU); - Amino acids to supplement enteral protein for total protein intake of 1.5-2 g/kg/day. Subjects will complete the study after Day 5 and will continue with nutritional support as clinically indicated. Allocation of Treatment and Randomization Procedures 40 subjects will be recruited into the study and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. This will take place in lots of 10; permitting evaluation of data after every ten subjects. Potential subjects deemed eligible will be randomized in a blinded fashion by the REDCap Randomization Module to receive either routine nutritional support , enteral feedings as soon as medically feasible supplemented with intravenous amino acids " or routine nutritional support enteral feedings as soon as medically feasible. Randomization treatment assignment list will be created by our statistician; taking into consideration drop outs and replacements.</detailed_description>
