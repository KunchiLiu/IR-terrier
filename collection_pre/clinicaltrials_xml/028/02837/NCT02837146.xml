	<brief_title>Ultrasound as Imaging Biomarker of Early Response to Tocilizumab and Methotrexate in Very Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For most rheumatic autoimmune diseases, treatment has two components: induction of remission and maintenance (to prevent relapse). After screening (week -3 to 0), patients enter into a 3 week run-in period during which no glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is allowed. At week 0, if persistent synovitis is confirmed patients will enter the induction phase. During the induction phase all patients will receive TCZ and MTX from week 0 to week 24. After week 24, all patients will receive MTX. Ultrasound (US) is increasingly used in rheumatic diseases, in particular in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The great resolution of superficial musculoskeletal structures obtained by using high frequency transducers and the high sensitivity of colour Doppler (CD) and power Doppler (PD) techniques allow to detect synovial vascularisation, synovial hypertrophy (SH) and joint effusion (JE). This is a pilot US trial that allow us to explore the hypothesis that an early US response may be predictive of later clinical response.</detailed_description>
