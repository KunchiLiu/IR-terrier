	<brief_summary>The goal of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of radiation-associated lens opacities among interventional cardiology staff members (such as physicians, technicians, and nurses) and determine its association with occupational history. The hypothesis of the study is that interventional cardiology staff will have high prevalence of radiation-induced lens opacities, which will be higher than non-interventional cardiology staff and will correlate with the estimated cumulative lifetime dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk of Radiation-induced Cataracts Among Interventional Cardiology Staff</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational, cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) and its association with prior occupational history of radiation exposure. Participants of the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions 2016 Scientific Sessions to be held in Orlando, FL May 4th to May 7th, will be invited to participate. Both interventional cardiology and non-interventional cardiology staff and non-clinical participants will be assessed. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. They will subsequently be asked to complete a questionnaire on occupational radiation exposure, workplace practices and medical history followed by dilated slit lamp examination using a modified Merriam-Focht scoring system.</detailed_description>
