	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of non-intrusive biofeedback devices that can be worn throughout the day in providing therapeutic cues to college students suffering from chronic anxiety. The biofeedback device detects physiological stress indices in real time (e.g., changes in breathing rate) and provides feedback (e.g., through minor vibration or text messages) serving as a cue to the wearer to recall therapeutic steps at exactly those moments they need to exert cognitive control. Students will be randomized in a 1) experimental group with biofeedback device and 2) experimental group without biofeedback device. Experimental groups will undergo an intervention that will strengthening cognitive control through mindfulness-based relaxation techniques. Outcome measures will include a multi-method approach collecting questionnaire, behavioral, neuro-scientific, and psycho-physiological indices of anxiety and self-control. The proposed study is innovative and has the potential to lead to more effective and cost-efficient types of intervention applications in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biofeedback-aided Intervention for Self-regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty participants will be tested in approximately 5 cohorts of 10 each. After individual first lab visits, participants in each cohort will be randomized into two groups: two experimental groups. The experimental group will subsequently attend a group-based relaxation treatment based on mindfulness meditation principles. After this intervention, one of the experimental groups will use the biofeedback device in the next two weeks, whereas the other experimental group will not. To control for attention effects of the cueing messages that the biofeedback device sends out, the No-Biofeedback group will receive texts at regular intervals, however, these will not be tied to an individual's physiology. To control for the amount of attention in the waitlist group, a lab visit will be arranged where subjects receive general information about anxiety but not any practical treatment advice or exercises. During the lab session, participants will sign informed consent and fill out questionnaires. Questionnaires used will be: - Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Perceived Stress Scale - Patient Health Questionnaire - Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study - and a constructed questionnaire about social support ( family &amp; friends) After that, participants are being hooked up to the EEG and Psychophysiological measures for a Stroop task (identify color of the word). The design will utilize a 1 min congruent task, followed by a 2 minute relaxation period, then a 1 min in-congruent task, followed up a 2 min relaxation period, then another 1 min congruent task, followed by a final 2 minute relaxation period. After that, participants will be deceived to think they will have to give a speech task in front of 5 evaluators. We will, however, inform participants of technical difficulties, resulting in our inability to follow through with the task, then again give the 2 minutes to regulate their physiology. Lab sessions, including set-up, should take about 45 minutes. The same lab procedures are being followed for the second lab visit after, approximately, two weeks.</detailed_description>
