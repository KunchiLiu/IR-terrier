	<brief_summary>This study explores the use of KBP-5074 in patients with advanced stages of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (including patients with severe renal impairment and those on hemodialysis [HD]) and to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of KBP-5074 in male and female patients with severe CKD (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2, based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation) and a subset of patients requiring HD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 Following Oral Administration in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, 2-part study designed to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of KBP-5074 in patients undergoing HD and non-HD patients with severe CKD (defined using the eGFR ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the MDRD equation). The study will be conducted at up to 4 clinical research units (CRUs) in the US. Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled in the study (a single cohort of 6 patients in each of Part 1 and Part 2). Parts 1 and 2 of the study will be conducted in parallel. If Part 1 is completed prior to the completion of Part 2, or vice versa, the PK, safety, and tolerability analyses for the completed study part may proceed as planned and will not be delayed based on the timing of the other respective study part.</detailed_description>

Patients who have had temporary dialysis for acute kidney injury will be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator. 4.

Is a nonsmoker or light smoker (smokes fewer than 10 cigarettes per day). Alcohol addressed in exclusion. 7. Female patients cannot be pregnant or lactating/breastfeeding and will either be postmenopausal (female patients who state they are postmenopausal should have had cessation of menses for &gt;1 year and have serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] levels &gt;40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL, surgically sterile (including bilateral tubal ligation, salpingectomy [with or without oophorectomy], surgical hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy [with or without hysterectomy]) for at least 3 months prior to Screening, or will agree to use, from the time of Checkin (Day 1) until 90 days following the last dose of study drug, the following forms of contraception: doublebarrier method, hormonal contraceptives, barrier with spermicide, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives, or a sterile sexual partner. All female patients will have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test result prior to enrollment in the study. 8. Male patients will either be surgically sterile or agree to use, from the time of Checkin (Day 1) until 90 days following the last dose of study drug, the following forms of contraception: male condom with spermicide and a female partner who is sterile or agrees to use hormonal contraceptives, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives. Male patients will refrain from sperm donation from the time of Checkin (Day 1) until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 9. Is capable of understanding the written informed consent, provides signed and witnessed written informed consent, and agrees to comply with protocol requirements. 1. History of any prior or concomitant clinical condition or acute and/or unstable systemic disease compromising patient inclusion, at the discretion of the Investigator. 2. Has a history or presence of clinically significant (CS) cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, gallbladder or biliary tract, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease, which in the Investigator's opinion would not be suitable for the study from patient safety consideration and could interfere the results of the trial. 3. History of CS hypotension during the 6 months prior to the dose of study drug on Day 1 as determined by the Investigator. 4. History of symptomatic intradialytic hypotension as determined by the Investigator (mild to moderate decrease in blood pressure during dialysis is allowed; HD patients only [Part 2]). 5. History of CS hyperkalemia while on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, direct renin inhibitor, and/or MRA. 6. Hospitalization for hyperkalemia during the last 6 months prior to the dose of study drug on Day 1 or hyperkalemia &gt;5.5 mmol/L during the 2 weeks prior to the Screening visit. 7.
