	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the transcutaneous application of unmodulated 30 Kilohertz (KHz) alternating currents could produce a quickly conduction block and if the pain of whiplash patients decreased.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Application of 30 Kilohertz Currents in Whiplash</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the last years several animal experimental studies have evidenced that high frequency unmodulated currents about 5 KHz can cause a peripheral nerve block. However electric currents with these high frequencies that are usually used for the treatment of pain in humans are interrupted or modulated (i.e. interferential currents). It has show that the diameter of the nerve it is related with the frequency to produce the conduction block. For this reason we decided to applied 30KHz to observe the effects on pain in patients with whiplash and to compare versus sham stimulation. Only one study has applied 5KHz on experimental pain and they have demonstrated changes in somatosensory thresholds.</detailed_description>
