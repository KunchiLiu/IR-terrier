	<brief_title>Hypolipidemic and Antioxidant Capacity of Spirulina and Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, being dyslipidemias, oxidative stress, sedentary lifestyle and obesity primary risk factors. As a way to reduce cardiovascular diseases risk factors, the intake of antioxidants that come from a fruit and vegetable-rich diet or nutritional supplements, have been proposed; in this sense, the cyanobacterium Spirulina maxima is an important source of antioxidants, which is currently associated with cardiovascular protection properties. Furthermore, physical exercise at moderated intensity has protective effect exerted against cardiovascular diseases risks, mainly due to physiological adaptations, including expression of antioxidant enzymes, which stop formation and propagation of radicals, improving redox status of the organism. There is evidence that Spirulina maxima, in addition to exercise, decreases cardiovascular diseases risks, this was mainly observed in animal models. However, no studies in humans under Spirulina maxima and exercise experimental designs proving these benefits are reported. Therefore this study will analyze the independent and synergistic effect of the intake of Spirulina maxima with a program of physical exercise at moderated intensity on general fitness, plasma lipid profile and antioxidant capacity in overweight and obese subjects. Methods/design: Through a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, counterbalanced crossover study design, 80 healthy overweight and obese subjects will be assessed during a 12 week isoenergetic diet, accompanied by 4.5 g/day Spirulina maxima intake and/or a systematic physical exercise program at moderate intensity. Body composition, VO2 consumption, heart rate, blood lactate, plasma concentrations of triacylglycerols, total, low and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, antioxidant status, lipid oxidation, protein carbonyls, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonase will be assessed. Discussion: Spirulina maxima and exercise are good alternatives to improve general fitness, to prevent or lessen dyslipidemia and oxidative stress in subjects with risk factor of chronic or noncommunicable diseases. However the independent and synergistic effect of Spirulina maxima with exercise against dyslipidemias and stress in overweight and obesity is not yet known.</detailed_description>
