	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the current study will be to determine if the use of an underbody heating mattress during cesarean sections will decrease the incidence of postoperative hypothermia, defined as core temperature less than 36C, and if hypothermia occurs, time to normothermia. As part of the primary outcome the difference in the incidence of shivering, its severity, and need for treatment will be investigated. As a secondary goal other maternal perioperative outcomes will be studied i.e. estimated blood loss, change in hemoglobin level on the morning after surgery ie postop day 1, need for blood transfusion, rate of wound infections, length of hospital stay, maternal satisfaction, time to first breastfeeding, time to first 'skin to skin' contact. The relationship between maternal hypothermia and newborn outcomes of temperature and APGAR scores will also be evaluated. Active preoperative and intraoperative warming may prevents inadvertent perioperative hypothermia and may be beneficial for pregnant patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The underbody warming mattress may be a step towards finding a suitable form of warming that is comfortable for awake patients, does not interfere with skin to skin contact and maternal-fetal bonding.</brief_summary>
