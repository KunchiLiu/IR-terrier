	<brief_summary>This study assesses the mean difference in fluid balance at ICU discharge and associated patient outcomes, based on a dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness in septic patients with refractory hypotension in an ICU setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Responsiveness Evaluation in Sepsis-associated Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center randomized study comparing dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness utilizing Starling SV monitor compared to a control group. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 treatment to control group ratio to increase power for sub-analysis by patient population. Patients randomized to the Starling SV arm will have treatment guided by a dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness (measured by a change in stroke volume index &gt; 10%) as assessed by passive leg raise (PLR). Patients randomized to the control group will receive standard of care treatment.</detailed_description>

Contraindication to blood transfusion 9. Attending clinician deems aggressive resuscitation unsuitable 10. Transferred from another inhospital setting 11. Not able to commence treatment protocol within 1 hour after randomization 12. Known intraventricular heart defect, such as ventral septal defect or atrial septal defect 13. Use of additional hemodynamic monitoring involving stroke volume variation (SVV) to determine fluid responsiveness 14. Seizure in the last 24 hours 15. Prisoner 16. Pregnancy 17. Age &lt;18 18. Known allergy to sensor material or gel 19. Inability or contraindication to doing a passive leg raise with both extremities, such as inability to interrupt venous compression boots 20.
