	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized, controlled single-center clinical Study designed to evaluate Physician Preference related to the use of the SurgiQuest AirSeal® Insufflation System (AIS) at low vs. higher pressures for the Management of pneumoperitoneum. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 treatment device to control ratio into one of two (2) different study arms: 1. AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg ±1mmHg; or 2. AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 15mmHg ±1mmHg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pneumoperitoneum Management With SurgiQuest AirSeal® at Low vs. Higher Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed and powered to demonstrate superiority of the AIS at low pressure vs. at higher pressure on a single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg ±1mmHg or to AIS with an insufflation target pressure of 15mmHg ±1mmHg. Secondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and medication use, length of hospital stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal CO2 and the frequency of adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population undergoing laparoscopic surgery.</detailed_description>
