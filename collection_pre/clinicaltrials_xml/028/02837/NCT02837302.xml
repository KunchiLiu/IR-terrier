	<brief_summary>Protein-calorie malnutrition is frequently observed in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. There have been continued interests in potential benefits of long-term oral branched-chain amino acid supplement in improving severity of liver disease. However, there are limited evidences in literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral branched-chain amino acid in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving thirteen centers in Korea nation-wide. The inclusion criteria are liver cirrhosis patients with Child-Pugh score 8 to 10. The major exclusion criteria are abnormal serum creatinine level, and hepatocellular carcinoma with viable tumor. The investigators analyzed improvement of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh score, incidence of cirrhosis-related complications, and event free survival.</detailed_description>
