	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study to evaluate the PK of FF/UMEC/VI in dose combinations of 100/62.5/25 mcg after single and repeat dose administration from a DPI in healthy Chinese subjects. This study will evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics (PK), of FF/UMEC/VI in Chinese healthy population when administered using dry powder inhaler (DPI)as a blended combination of UMEC/VI in one strip and FF in the second strip in dose combinations of 100/62.5/25 mcg. The triple, fixed dose combination product Fluticasone furoate(FF)/ Vilanterol (VI) /Umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) with new configuration enables the delivery of inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), Long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) from a single device. Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled in the study. After taking into account the allowable time windows for screening, treatment and follow-up, a subject will be in the study for a maximum duration of 6-7 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>No significant abnormality on 12lead ECG at screening, including the following specific requirements: Ventricular rate inside the range 4090 beats (inclusive) per minute (bpm) at screening, PR interval &lt;=210milliseconds (msec), No pathological Q waves, QRS interval &gt;=60 msec and &lt;=120 msec, the waveforms must enable the QT interval to be clearly defined and the corrected QT interval by Fridericia's method (QTcF) must be &lt;450msec (machine or manual reading) based on a single ECG value, or an average from three ECGs obtained over a brief recording period. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;=80% predicted and a FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ratio &gt;=0.7 AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x Upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Male/females aged between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive), at the time of signing the informed consent. Male and female is 1:1. Body weight &gt;=50 Kilogram (Kg) and Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 1924 Kg per square meter (m^2) (inclusive). Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and lung function testing. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator considers the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and outcome. Subjects who are current nonsmokers and have not used any tobacco products in the 6 month period preceding screening and have a pack history of &lt;=10 pack years. [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day /20) x number of years smoked] Capable of giving written informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if: she is of childbearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the chance of pregnancy at that point or She must agree to use contraception until the followup visit (i.e. until followup visit is complete) or she is on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method or she is confirmed postmenopausal or permanently sterilised (example [e.g.] tubal occlusion, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy). Lactating or pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test at screening or prior to dosing. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities or a history of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units (males), or an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a 285 milliliter (mL) glass of full strength beer or 425 mL schooner of low strength beer or 1 (30 mL) measure of spirits or 1 glass (100 mL) of wine History of chronic respiratory problems (i.e. history of asthmatic symptoms) in the last 10 years or suffered an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of the screening visit. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening or a positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody or Syphilis antibody. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen or on admission to the Unit. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) or has had exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unwillingness or inability to follow the study procedures outlined in the protocol. The subject is unable to refrain from the consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or any fruit juices containing these fruits from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication and for the duration of the study. Mentally or legally incapacitated. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to heparin, or any corticosteroid, anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2 agonist, lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate or a history of drug allergy or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates their participation. A chest Xray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of clinically significant abnormalities. A chest Xray must be taken before Day1, in any day between screening and Day 1(inclusive) if a chest Xray or CT scan is not available within 6 months prior to screening day.</criteria>
