	<brief_summary>This study is aimed to assess the efficacy of Human derived Transfer factor ( T-lymphocytes homogenate that contains small molecular weight (10 kDa) molecules: various IFNs, ILs, chemokines, endorfins, heat shock proteins) in decreasing rate and/or severity of infections in acute or chronic decompensations of liver cirrhosis and acute on chronic liver failure..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transfer Factor Efficacy in the Management of Cirrhosis-associated Immune Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of mortality from advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) is mediated by so- called specific complications of end-stage liver disease (ESLD); one of the most important is infection (25-30%). Infection is responsible for considerable proportion of ESLD-related mortality. Important in pathogenesis of infections in ESLD is CAIDS (cirrhosis - associated immune dysfunction syndrome), recently re-named to CAID (Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Deficit). TRANSFER FACTOR (TF) is supposed to act at several points in CAID - cascade. This gave rise to hypothesis, that TF could be of benefit in AD/ACLF. Characteristics of TF It has been shown that transmission fo T-Lymphocyte reactivity is transmissible not only by T-cells alone, but also by hommogenate of peripheral white blood cells. Later it became clear that for the transmission of cellular immunity is responsible dialysable fraction of T-lymphocytes homogenate (with small molecular weight of 10 kDa; consists of amino acids, small peptides, nucleotides etc). This homogenate was named Transfer - factor (TF). One dose of lyophilized drug contains: Leucocyti dialysatum 200 x 10 6 (contains various IFNs, ILs, chemokines, endorfins, heat shock protein etc) - stimulates T H 1 response - induces production of IL-1, IL-2 - activates chemotaxis of immunocompetent cells - increases fagocytic activity - activates antigen-presentation by APCs The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of transfer factor in decreasing rate and/or severity of infections in ACLF.</detailed_description>
