	<brief_title>Hyperthermy Endocavitary Treatment in Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study analyzed the evolution of chronic pelvic pain, defined by the different map of myofascial trigger points assets presents the patient with medical treatment compared to treatment with radiofrequency endocavitary electrode MJS. The initial evaluator analyzed by the NIH-CPSI Scale questionnaire and symptoms of chronic pelvic pain Stanford Protocol for female or male quality of life of the patient before the doctor or radio frequency and a month since treatment. the patient to the Principal Investigator, specialist physiotherapist, who appreciates tenderness the presence of a taut band with a map of pain in endopelvic and exopelvic muscles, determining the activation of myofascial trigger points in each is derived. The Principal Investigator proceeds to address each active myofascial trigger points with the MJS electrode four 20-minute sessions twice a week. The MJS has a curved end pressure which favors the compression point plus the location and accurate approach Radiofrequency pathological point as outstanding feature. The high specificity of myofascial treatment offered by the MJS electrode involves no danger, besides having the computer screen conductivity meter and a temperature sensor on the head to control both parameters in real time during the treatment session</detailed_description>
