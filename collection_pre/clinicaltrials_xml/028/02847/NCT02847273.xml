	<brief_summary>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a continuous and non-invasive technology that measures regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2). Whatever the anatomical site of measurement, a normal value of rSO2 would suggest a good adequacy between oxygen supply and consumption at the regional level. Beside the trend ability of previous 2 or 3-wavelength devices, a new 4-wavelength generation of NIRS monitors which could reliably assess real-time absolute values of rSO2 is now available. The investigators aimed to compare peripheral absolute rSO2 values given by the 4-wavelength EQUANOX device 7600 (Nonin Medical, Plymouth, Mn) and the new O3 device (Masimo, Irvine, CA) during conventional cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
