	<brief_summary>The study aimed to investigate whether an Arabinoxylan-enriched crackers consumption for 4 weeks in overweight and obese patients without diabetes mellitus have specific healthy effects on glycemic control (reduction of homeostatic model assessment -HOMA index-). Furthermore, study evaluated the effects of Arabinoxylan on insulin, lipid and Ghrelin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Mild Supplementation of Arabinoxylan Fiber Improves Homa Index in Overweight and Obese Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The beneficial effects of soluble dietary fiber to health are well known: many studies show clearly that it delays the onset of cardiovascular disease and some cancers, and improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. (1,2). Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with increased rate of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, as well as to colon and breast cancer. The introduction of 25-30gr of dietary fiber daily would therefore indicated not only in type 2 diabetic subjects, but also in obese and overweight patients. Most of the foods commonly consumed in Western countries are low in dietary fiber: to reach the recommended levels people should introduce whole grain cereals, legumes, vegetables and dried fruits, not always accepted. We tested the effects on health of crackers baked with a special Integralbianco® flour, enriched with 3,2g of Arabinoxylan / 100g (vs refined flour).</detailed_description>
