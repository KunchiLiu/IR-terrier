	<brief_title>The Effect of Whole Body Cryotherapy on Recovery and Performance: a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study the effects of a single- or multiple whole body cryotherapy (-135°C for max. 2 minutes) vs. cold water immersion (10°C for 15 min) and a passive control group (20 min supine position) are compared. These effects are examined after a muscle damage protocol of the frontal thighs (3 x 30 jumps). The objective recovery parameters are vertical jump, maximum voluntary contraction of the anterior thigh muscle, heart rate, blood pressure, skin-core body temperature and the oxygen saturation of the thigh muscles. Subjective recovery parameters are the local muscle soreness details and the general exhaustion details. The parameters are directly and 24, 48 and measured 72 hours after exposure. The aim is to elicit the effects of whole body cooling to make recommendations to. The current scientific knowledge situation calls for further studies to whole body cooling.</detailed_description>
