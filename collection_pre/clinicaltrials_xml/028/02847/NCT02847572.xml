	<brief_summary>This will be a single center, non comparison clinical trial. Fifty study patients will have the Symfony IOL implanted in their dominant eye and a +3,25D Tecnis Multifocal in their non-dominant eye. The investigators will be evaluated vision at distance, intermediate and near as well as assessing patient satisfaction and spectacle independence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Visual Performance Combining a Symfony IOL and a +3.25 Tecnis Multifocal IOL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each study patient will undergo the same routine cataract extraction procedure in each eye. In their dominant eye a Tecnis Symfony IOL will be implanted and in the non dominant eye, a Tecnis +3.25D Multifocal implanted. The surgeries will be within 2 days of each other. Every patient will receive same postoperative instructions and medications. The aim is to investigate the potential benefits of implanting two different IOL's to give the patient a wider range of near vision with decreased risk of haloing and glare to enable them to be less dependent on reading glasses</detailed_description>
