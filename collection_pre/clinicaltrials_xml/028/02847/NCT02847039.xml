	<brief_summary>The research project aims to try to answer the many questions raised by the identification of new early repolarization syndrome. The questions are varied with both taking optimal clinical management of patients, the frequency and significance of this anomaly in the population on the electrophysiological and molecular basis responsible for this electrocardiographic abnormality. To try to answer these many questions, the approach will be twofold: clinical and genetic. - Establishment of a clinical database containing information of patients who have been identified as carriers of the anomaly based on the initial clinical presentation in order to determine their prognoses. - Physiological approach will be based on a molecular approach to identify genetic abnormalities may be involved in this syndrome. - 200 asymptomatic patients and an unlimited number of patients who presented syncope or aborted sudden death will be included. A blood sample (15 ml) will be performed at inclusion.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Syndrome</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Presence of early repolarization aspect, determined by the J point elevation of at least 0.1 mV above the isoelectric line, with or without extraST segment elevation in at least two leads and / or lateral. Parameters ECG D2 level of the bypass measurable for the presence of long QT syndrome. Late potentials ventricular analyzable. For patients with ventricular fibrillation, negative search for other causes of ventricular fibrillation. For patients with syncope, clinical assessment should included at a minimum, performing a cardiac ultrasound and a stress test. Impossibility to receive clear information (patient's intellectual default). Refusal to sign the informed consent for participation. Under protective measure of justice.</criteria>
