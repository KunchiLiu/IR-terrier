	<brief_title>Smart Phone Application in the Secondary Clinical Prevention Management for Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary prevention for patients with coronary heart disease post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) proved associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates and improvement in quality of life. For the limitation of socio-economic conditions, not all patients post PCI are in a position to receive continuous standardized secondary prevention management. Therefore a smart phone app for secondary prevention management post PCI will be installed on patients' smart phones in order to investigate its effects on risk factors control, medication compliance, as well as quality of life and adverse cardiac events in the next six months post discharge. Participants allocated to the control group will receive a booklet with general advice on secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Patients in app group and control group will be interviewed by telephone at the 2nd week and the 3rd month, and at the 1st month and 6th month they will return our hospital for face to face follow-up and to compliance and medication adjustment, assessment of life quality, risk factors control and medication adherence.</detailed_description>
