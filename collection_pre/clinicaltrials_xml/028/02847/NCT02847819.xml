	<brief_summary>Total of 100 patients are included in this is a prospective observational study to evaluate the role of airway ultrasound (USG) in assessing vocal cord mobility in patients undergoing thyroid surgery. patients will be scanned preoperatively by airway ultrasound which will be compared to post operative ultrasound scans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vocal Cord Movement Assessment Using Airway Ultrasound.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All 100 patients between age groups of 15-70 years, will be scanned pre-operatively to see vocal cord mobility as a reference value. A proper acoustic window is mandatory for optimal visualization of laryngeal structures. Visibility of false vocal cords, true vocal cords and arytenoids will be given one point each for one side, maximal score will be 6. According to points the acoustic window scoring for glottis aperture will be graded as fair, when both false vocal cords are visible (score1-2), along with false cord when both arytenoids are visible scored good (score3-4) and if single or both true vocal cords are visible then scored as very good(score5-6). After the surgery the same patient will be scanned again for vocal cord mobility at 4hours of extubation . Any change in mobility will be recorded. If any change will be observed, direct laryngoscopy (DL) will be done to confirm the diagnosis. Any complication in the post-operative period will be recorded.</detailed_description>
