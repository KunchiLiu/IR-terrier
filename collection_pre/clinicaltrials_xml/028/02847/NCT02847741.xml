	<brief_summary>Suicidal behavior (SB) is a public health problem. The clinical model currently admitted to the understanding of SB is a stress vulnerability model, but so far, all scientific works has no clinical application. The management of psychiatric patients, including depressed subjects, faces the inability to detect those with a high risk of SB. Many studies have shown a link between low cholesterol and SB. A study has recently proposed a total cholesterol threshold below which the risk of suicide could be increased. However, a prospective study is needed to assess the predictive nature of such an indicator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Nature of Total Cholesterol Threshold: Possible Link to Suicidal Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose to assess, within a cohort of patients, the predictive value of a total cholesterol threshold in the occurrence of SB. 555 inpatients suffering from a current Major depressive disorder (MDD), hospitalized in the Department of Emergency Psychiatry and Post Acute Care will be recruited. Each patient will attend a total of 5 visits during a follow-up period of 18 months (visits at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months)</detailed_description>
