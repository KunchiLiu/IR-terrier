	<brief_summary>Improvements in cancer treatment have led to an increasing number of patients being cured or in remission, but they are followed up to detect recurrence, manage persistent symptoms and late treatment effects. With growing survivors, traditional hospital follow-up is not sustainable. New models of follow-up care are needed. This research project aims to develop and establish the feasibility of introducing a new electronic care pathway/system for remote monitoring ovarian cancer patients in remission. The project includes a development phase, followed by a before-and-after study to explore the feasibility of a new pathway/system for remote monitoring.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Improvements in cancer treatment have led to an increasing number of patients being cured or in remission, but they are followed up to detect recurrence, manage persistent symptoms and late treatment effects. With growing survivors, traditional hospital follow-up is not sustainable. New models of follow-up care are needed. Aim To develop and establish the feasibility of introducing a new electronic care pathway/system for remote monitoring ovarian cancer patients in remission. Methods An existing online patient symptom reporting system will be extended for use in remote follow-up. A tracking program will be developed and IT systems integrated in the local hospitals. Development Phase: a) Scoping literature review of existing validated symptom measures. b) Consultation with expert groups to establish choice of questions, relevant symptoms, timing/frequency for monitoring. c) Interviews with patients and clinicians to explore current pathway and redesign. Before-and-After Study A multi-centred quasi-experimental between-subjects before-and-after design will compare usual care (control) with the new electronic care pathway/system. 168 participants will be recruited from Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield, and Airedale (N=84 Leeds, N=84 other sites). Both phases will recruit for ~12 months. In the control group, 84 eligible patients (post-treatment) will be recruited and data collected at routine appointments for 12 months on clinical outcomes and 6 monthly patient-reported outcomes. In the intervention consenting patients (N=84) will be reminded to use the system every ~3 months and have a blood test by their GP. Information will be displayed in respective EPR. Patients will always have the option to speak to/see their 'key clinician'. Virtual clinics will be held for clinicians to review/respond to the data. Clinical and patient outcomes will be collected, and end-of-study interviews conducted. Outcomes - Develop a new electronic care pathway/system for remote monitoring patients in remission - Obtain initial data on clinical and patient feasibility.</detailed_description>
