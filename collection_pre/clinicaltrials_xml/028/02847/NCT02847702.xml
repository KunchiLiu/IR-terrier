	<criteria>Key Inclusion Criteria Include: 1. Males and females ≥ 40 and ≤ 75 years of age with moderate to severe chronic OA pain of the knee (lasting several hours daily) as their predominant pain condition for at least 6 months prior to screening 2. Diagnostic criteria for primary pain condition (American College of Rheumatology [ACR] clinical and radiographic criteria): At least 1 of the following in addition to knee pain: age &gt; 50, stiffness &lt; 30 min, crepitus on active motion, and KellgrenLawrence (KL) grade 2 or 3 radiographic evidence at the screening visit as determined by a local radiologist or rheumatologist. Note that KL grades 2 to 3 require the presence of osteophytes, which is required to meet ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for knee OA 3. Subjects whose OA pain of the index knee is not adequately treated prior to the screening visit: • Subjects must have a selfreported average pain intensity rating of moderate or severe on a verbal rating scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, and severe) over the 7 days prior to the screening visit 4. The subjects must have "average pain over the last 24 hours" scores ≥ 5 and ≤ 9 on an 11point numerical rating scale (NRS) for the index knee on ≥ 3 consecutive days during the screening period and come in for randomization within 72 hours after qualification is met 5. Subjects who are willing and able to stop taking any/all analgesic medications, including overthecounter pain medications, opioids, marijuana, and topical analgesics for OA pain for the duration of the treatment period, with the exception of studyspecific rescue medication. Key Exclusion Criteria Include: 1. Subjects with radiographic evidence of OA with KL grade 0, 1, or 4 2. Subjects at risk for destructive arthropathy, subjects with a history of osteonecrosis, osteoporotic fracture, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA 1 and 2), subchondral insufficiency fracture, and hip/knee dislocations 3. Subjects considered high risk for surgery based upon American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification system for surgery grading, or subjects who would not be willing to undergo joint replacement surgery if required 4. Subjects with chronic pain conditions other than OA of the knee as their predominant pain condition, including gout (except for subjects with gout that is controlled with diet and/or with stable suppressive treatment with uric acid reducing medication(s) and/or colchicine, and who have not had any attack within the past 2 years), pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, active Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis or any other inflammatory arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain conditions, bursitis, or acute injury or signs of active infection in the target pain area 5. Subjects scheduled for surgical interventions of the disease site or any other major surgery during the study conduct period 6. Subjects with a history of a prior joint replacement of the index knee 7. Subjects who have had arthroscopy on either knee or hip within 6 months of entering the study, or open surgery on either knee or hip within 12 months of entering the study. Other protocolspecific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
