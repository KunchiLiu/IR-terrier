	<brief_summary>Assess the depth of sedation and analgesia in pediatric intensive care is critical to the management of intubated patients under mechanical ventilation. The responsiveness of the pupil is changed by the sedation and analgesia. Measuring the pupil diameter is proposed in anesthesia and intensive care to assess the quality of analgesia in adult population. Visually measuring the diameter of the pupil remains very imprecise, but this measure can be accurately and quickly performed thanks to portable devices called Pupillometers. Some devices including AlgiscanÂ® device (IdMed ) can measure in addition to the pupil diameter, the variation of pupil diameter, the latency of the pupillary reflex and the maximum speed of contraction. Pupillometry was tested in adult ICU patients, during painful and painless procedures [1]. In this study, pupillometry was more sensitive for detecting pain compared to the change in heart rate or bispectral index. The objective of this work is to perform measurements of pupil diameter during painful procedures (e.g. tracheal aspiration) in PICU. In parallel we will continue using the Comfort B-scale (has been validated for assessment of pain in children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit [2-5] and compare the results of both types of assessment pain.</brief_summary>
