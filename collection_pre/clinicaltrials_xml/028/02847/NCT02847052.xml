	<brief_summary>IL-22 is an IL-10 family cytokine that plays major actions to increase intestinal epithelial barrier function and regeneration during experimental colitis. IL-22 binding protein is a small, soluble, and secreted protein potently inhibiting IL-22 actions through preventing the binding with IL-22 Recepteur. This study aims at characterizing how IL-22 binding protein is regulated in Inflammatory bowel disease to better understand the way IL-22 acts on epithelial cells during flares of the disease.</brief_summary>
