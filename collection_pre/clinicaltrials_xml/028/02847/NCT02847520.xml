	<brief_summary>If the addiction to games of chance and gambling is a disease of increasing knowledge, the emergence of poker rout evaluation procedures, prevention and treatment usually offered to players in need. In the case of poker, which unlike other games has a real part to address and which damages are expressed differently, the evaluation can not be done identically to other games. This problem has often been emphasized in the literature, in particular the lack of specific tools for the identification of poker gambling problems. Thus, the fact of developing a specific evaluation tool could allow poker to take into account the specificity of poker among other games. This would be part of the evaluation complement batteries currently available to players in general by offering a specific tool, and secondly to allow the assessment of the aspects of the problems often absent for other games . The goal here is to develop and validate a specific tool detection of problem gambling in the particular context of poker.</brief_summary>
