	<brief_title>Effect of Chewing Gum on Post-operative Ileus (GUMPI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients undergoing spine surgery are at risk of developing post-operative ileus, which will lengthen the hospital stay and cause gastrointestinal distress in patients. Post-operative sham feeding in form of chewing a gum seems to increase the functionality of gastro-intestinal tract earlier in patients who have undergone gastro-intestinal and gynecological surgeries. This study will recruit patients undergoing spine surgery at the investigators medical center and allocate them randomly into two equal groups. Patients in one group will be asked to chew gum after surgery and the other group will not be offered anything on chew on. Both groups will be kept nothing per os (NPO) otherwise till the first bowel movement. The first post-operative flatus and defecation time will be recorded as primary measures and other main outcomes will include first post-operative meal, length of stay and presence of ileus. The descriptive parameters of the two groups will also be recorded as related to relevant medical history, surgery, and post-operative care, to adjust for its effect on outcome measures. This study will identify any beneficial effect that chewing gum will have on post-operative ileus development and might be helpful in establishing better post-operative care protocols in patients undergoing spine surgery.</detailed_description>
