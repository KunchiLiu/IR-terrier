	<brief_title>Evaluation of the BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter for Aortic Valve Dilatation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter Study is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm observational study intended to collect data to confirm the performance and safety of the BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter (True™ Flow catheter) when used for dilatation of the aortic valve in preparation for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). This study will be conducted in conformance with the Declaration of Helsinki, applicable national privacy laws, and European, national regulations and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements (ISO 14155:2011 (E)).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject voluntarily provides written informed consent prior to the collection of studyspecific data or performance of studyspecific procedures using an Informed Consent Form (ICF) that is reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee (EC) for the site. The subject is a male or nonpregnant female ≥ 18 years old. The subject is undergoing TAVI for treatment of aortic stenosis. The subject has an annulus diameter that can be treated with the available size device, in accordance with the Instructions For Use (IFU). The patient is unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent. The patient has a known allergy or sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated. The patient has had previous aortic valve replacement. The patient has a known congenital aortic valve abnormality (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve). The patient has echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, or thrombus. The patient has vascular conditions that make insertion and endovascular access to the aortic valve impossible. The patient has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may cause him/her to confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the completion of study procedures. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic, or another device study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically interferes with the objectives of the study.</criteria>
