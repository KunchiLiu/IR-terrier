	<brief_summary>Cervical necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) is a rare but severe complication of pharyngeal or dental infections. The infection can rapidly descend into the mediastinum and lead to a life-threatening prognosis. Treatment consists of a multidisciplinary approach in intensive care with radiologist and with early and repeated surgical debridement. Anti-inflammatory drugs have been incriminated by authors in the development of necrotizing fasciitis. Recently, a single-center study demonstrated that pharyngeal source of CNF and oral glucocorticoid intake before admission was associated with the occurrence of mediastinitis. The aim of the study is to assess the incidence and factors associated with CNF complications, in particular mediastinitis. Secondary outcome is to describe patient characteristics, medical and surgical management. Methods: A retrospective, observational, non-interventional multicentre study is conducted in nine intensive care units in France from January 2005 to December 2016.</brief_summary>
