	<criteria>1. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous) with positive expression of MAGEA3 (primary or metastatic lesion). 2. Have radiographic progression after treatment of at least 1 cycle of platinumdoublet chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy will count as regimen if administered within 1 year before relapse. 3. Patients with tumors of nonsquamous NSCLC histology that have a known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and/or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation can participate in this study if they have failed the appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (intolerance or documented progression of their NSCLC) and have documented progression of their NSCLC on platinum doublet chemotherapy. There is no preferred order of treatment with TKI or platinum doublet therapy. If a patient is found to have one molecular alteration (either sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation), then testing for the other alteration is not required. 4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1 criteria as determined by the site study team. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. 5. Have at least one tumor amenable to biopsy. 6. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. 7. Demonstrate adequate organ function: 1. White blood cell (WBC) count ≥3,000 cells/mm3 2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 cells/mm3 3. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L 4. Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/mm3 5. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ULN for patients with total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5 x ULN 6. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN; ≤5.0 x ULN if patient has liver metastases 7. Serum chemistries sodium, potassium, and calcium within normal limits (WNL) or Grade 1 8. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for patient with creatinine levels &gt;1.5 institutional ULN according to CockcroftGault formula 9. Serum phosphate &gt;0.8 mmol/L (Grade 01) 10. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as prothrombin time (PT) or partial prothrombin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 11. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 8. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 9. Female patients of childbearing potential (refer to Section 9.E.2.c) must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 9.E.2.c, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient. 10. Male patients of reproductive potential (Section 9.E.2.c) must agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 9.E.2.c, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient. 11. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial. 12. Be 18 years of age (or legal age of majority in the jurisdiction) on day of signing informed consent. 1. Has disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent. 2. Has had prior treatment with any anticancer immunotherapy, including therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, or antiPDL2 agent or has previously participated in Merck MK3475 clinical trials or who have had prior treatment with AdMAGEA3, MG1MAGEA3, or any MAGEA3 targeted therapy. 3. Is currently receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of Day 1 dose of treatment. 4. Has had prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or failure to recover (i.e., to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline status) from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 5. Has had prior chemotherapy, or targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ to Grade 1 or to baseline status) from AEs due to a previously administered agent. Note: Patients with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy or ≤Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. Note: Patients receiving prior radiation must have recovered from any acute toxic effect unless Grade 1, irreversible and considered not clinically significant. Note: Patients receiving prior lung radiation with a dose of &gt;30 Gy must wait at least 26 weeks from the date of completion of the lung radiation before the first dose of pembrolizumab. 6. Has received prior treatment with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) based viral vector. 7. Requires use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy that cannot be safely suspended for per protocol biopsies as per standard of care. 8. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Note: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging [using the identical imaging modality for each assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan] for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 28 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability. 9. Has disease/tumor invading a major vascular structure (e.g., carotid artery), tumor related impending bowel obstruction or clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulating ascites, pericardial or pleural effusions. 10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. 11. Has evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis. 12. Has a history of interstitial lung disease. 13. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. 14. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). 15. Has used antiviral medication, within 14 days of enrollment. 16.

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. 22. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. 23. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. 24. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. 25. Has household contacts meeting any of the following criteria for study entry unless alternate living arrangements can be made: a. Women who are pregnant or nursing an infant b.
