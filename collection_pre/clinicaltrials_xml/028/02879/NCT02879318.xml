	<brief_summary>The standard or usual treatment for this disease consists of two chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel given together.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel vs Gemcitabine, Nab-Paclitaxel, Durvalumab and Tremelimumab as 1st Line Therapy in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and reactivate the immune response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone. Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with durvalumab. Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone and while the combination has been studied in a few people, it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma which is metastatic. Must have presence of measurable or evaluable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1). Patients must be considered suitable candidates for, and able to receive, first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease with gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel. Patient must consent to provision of, and investigator(s) must confirm access to and agree to submit to the CCTG Central Tumour Bank, a representative formalin fixed paraffin block of tumour tissue of adequate amount and quality in order that the specific correlative marker assays proscribed in the protocol may be conducted Patient must consent to provision of samples of blood, serum and plasma in order that the specific correlative marker assays Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. No prior treatment for metastatic disease is permitted. Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy if the last dose was given more than 6 months prior to recurrence. Patient may not have received nabpaclitaxel as adjuvant therapy. Prior systemic treatment for borderline resectable or locally advanced disease is not permitted. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below (must be done within 14 days prior to registration). Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper normal limit Serum creatinine &lt;1.25 UNL or Creatinine clearance ≥40mL/min Imaging investigations including CT/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis or other scans as necessary to document all sites of disease done within 28 days prior to randomization. Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life questionnaires in either English or French. Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Patients must be accessible for treatment and followup. Investigators must assure themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and followup. In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient randomization. Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective contraceptive method Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years. Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor, including durvalumab or an antiCTLA4, including tremelimumab. History of primary immunodeficiency, history of organ transplant that requires therapeutic immunosuppression or prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) immune mediated toxicity from other immune therapy. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first planned dose of study therapy, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) within the past 2 years NOTE: Patients with vitiligo, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years) are not excluded. Patients with active or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: cardiac dysfunction (symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia); active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis; active bleeding diatheses; psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent; known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis; known human immunodeficiency virus infection (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies); known active hepatitis B infection (positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as presence of hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc) and absence of HBsAg) are eligible; known active hepatitis C infection. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases requiring concurrent treatment, inclusive of but not limited to surgery, radiation and/or corticosteroids. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination (examples include, but are not limited to, vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella, live attenuated influenza vaccine (nasal), chicken pox vaccine, oral polio vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, BCG vaccine, typhoid vaccine and typhus vaccine) within 30 days prior to randomization. Pregnant or lactating women. Any active disease condition which would render the protocol treatment dangerous or impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy. Any condition (e.g. psychological, geographical, etc.) that does not permit compliance with the protocol. History of hypersensitivity to gemcitabine, nabpaclitaxel, durvalumab or tremelimumab or any excipient.</criteria>
