	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to test a systems-level approach to disseminate a multicomponent, multilevel intervention consisting of educational materials about transplantation and the new kidney allocation system targeting dialysis facility Medical Directors, staff, and patients. Roughly 750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 end stage renal disease Network regions across the United States will be randomized to receive intervention materials. The overall goal of the study is to extend the influence of the national allocation policy in reducing disparities in early steps in kidney transplant access.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the ASCENT study is to test a systems-level approach to disseminate a multi-component intervention consisting of in the era of the new national kidney allocation policy and educational materials targeting dialysis facility Medical Directors, staff, and patients. The investigators will randomize ~750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 End Stage Renal Disease Network regions across the United States, where approximately half of facilities will receive the intervention materials and half will receive an informational brochure. This pragmatic, clinical effectiveness-implementation study will test the effectiveness of the multicomponent, multilevel interventions consisting of a tailored, facility-specific transplant and disparity performance report, educational videos for staff and dialysis patients, and an educational webinar for dialysis facility Medical Directors and staff.</detailed_description>
