	<brief_title>Prophylactic Omentopexy During Laparoscopic Insertion of Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal dialysis is a know and accepted treatment in patients with end stage renal diseases. The is a safe, easy and cheap treatment modality in these patients. After introduction and development of laparoscopic procedures for insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheters, some prophylactic surgical techniques have been proposed as measures to reduce catheter malfunction. Omentopexy is among these techniques. The purpose of this study is to compare function of the peritoneal dialysis catheter (including inflow and outflow failure) in two groups of patients with and without prophylactic omentopexy that was performed during laparoscopic insertion of peritoneal catheters.</detailed_description>
