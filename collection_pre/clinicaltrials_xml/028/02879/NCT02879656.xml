	<brief_summary>The present collaboration study on the treatment of distal radius fractures is aimed to: (i) to compare the functional outcome in patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) score after closed reduction and cast immobilization and operative treatment with volar locking plate in the initial treatment of primarily unstable, non-reducible distal radius fractures in patients over 65 years. (ii) to compare the functional outcome in PRWE score after closed reduction and cast immobilization and operative treatment with volar locking plate in the treatment distal radius fractures with early instability during follow-up, ie. loss of reduction at one week (5 to 10 days) in patients over 65 years. (iii) to compare pain, disability, quality of life, grip strength and the number of complications after conservative treatment and initial and postponed operative treatment of distal radius fracture (iv) to assess the effect of pain catastrophizing score (PCS) on the functional outcome of conservatively and operatively treated distal radius fracture</brief_summary>
