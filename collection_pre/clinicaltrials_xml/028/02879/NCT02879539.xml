	<brief_summary>Reducing power consumption in the cochlear implant is crucial to the development of future smaller sound processors. The commercial MP3000 sound coding strategy has been shown to be more efficient in power consumption to the standard ACE strategy. However in order to develop smaller sound processors, further battery life power savings are required. The aim of this study is to evaluate three experimental sets of MP3000 parameter sets, compared against the default ACE program. In the background for each of the four strategies, experimental noise reduction programs (SpatialNR and NR3) will also be in use. In an additional phase of the study, low stimulation rate ACE programs will also be evaluated against the default stimulation rate.</brief_summary>
