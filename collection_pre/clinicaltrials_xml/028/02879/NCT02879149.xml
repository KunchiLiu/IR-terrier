	<brief_summary>The objective of this long-term study is to evaluate the long term effectiveness and safety of AUGMENT速 Bone Graft vs. autologous bone graft. The study involves evaluation of subjects originally treated under Protocol BMTI-2006-01. Subjects will be asked to consent and return to provide long-term follow-up data at or after 60 months (5 years) have elapsed since their original surgery as a subject in protocol BMTI-2006-01. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The effectiveness and safety profile for AUGMENT速 Bone Graft is maintained and remains comparable to that of autologous bone graft over long-term subject follow-up. REGULATORY PHASE: Post-approval study</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who meet the following criteria may be included in the study: 1. Must be willing and able to provide informed consent and be available for the planned followup evaluations and radiologic tests; and 2. Must have been randomized, treated and included in the safety population of Protocol BMTI200601 (see Exhibit 13.1). 1) Subjects that were excluded from the safety analysis in the BMTI200601 study (subjects not listed in Exhibit 13.1). These subjects were consented, but never treated as part of the BMTI200601 protocol.</criteria>
