	<detailed_description>The aim of the Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is to provide clinicians with an evidence-based structure for eliciting and documenting vital information about preferences for patient driven care of their serious illness. It is designed to help open the door for patients, families, and clinicians to talk and reflect on end-of-life issues in an ongoing way. The hypothesis of the Serious Illness Care Program is that adherence to the conversation guide portion, the SIGC, will enhance patient understanding and allow control over their own decisions, relieve burdens of decision-making on family members, and help patients achieve a state of peace as they approach the end of life. For this protocol specifically, the investigators are testing a pilot intervention of a quality improvement project; the investigators plan to train clinicians and assess the feasibility and impact of the Serious Illness Care Program, which includes patient identification, clinician training, "triggering" of clinicians to conduct the SICG conversation, and documentation, in the iCMP at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.</detailed_description>
