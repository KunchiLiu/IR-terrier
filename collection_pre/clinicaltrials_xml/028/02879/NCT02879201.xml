	<brief_summary>The investigators conducted a comparison trial between SLED and CRRT in critically ill patients to evaluate the outcome for all cause mortality at 30 day . The secondary outcome were recovery of renal function, complications during therapy and duration of hospitalization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Venovenous Hemodiafiltration Versus Sustained Low-efficiency Hemodialysis for Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury in Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators performed a single center experience accumulated over 12 months since February 2009 with a continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) and hybrid technique named sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED). The primary end point was death from any cause by day 30. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients were eligible for inclusion when serum creatinine was &gt; 2 mg/dL, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) was initiated. The selected patients were treated with CVVHDF or SLED.</detailed_description>
