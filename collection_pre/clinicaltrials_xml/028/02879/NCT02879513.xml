	<brief_title>Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients With Pathological Partial Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All the patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had pathological complete response (pCR) or partial response to DP will enrolled in this trial. Those who had pCR will continue the two cycles of DP as adjuvant chemotherapy. This arm will considered as a control arm.
