	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of Chidamide Combined With Cyclophosphamide、Prednisone、Thalidomide in Treatment of Fragile Patients With Relapse/Refratory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma :a Phase II,Single-arm,Open-label, Muti-center Study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chidamide Combined With Cyclophosphamide、Prednisone、Thalidomide in Treatment of Fragile Patients With Relapse/Refratory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chidamide is a new histone deacetylase inhibitor and shows anti-tumor activity in Relapse/Refratory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma.Cyclophosphamide、Prednisone、Thalidomide(CPT) is an oral combination regimen for lymphoma patients who can not stand the standard chemotherapy. The investigators therefore design this open-label,phase II, single-arm trial to investigate the efficacy of Chidamide Combined With CPT in treatment of fragile Patients With Relapse/Refratory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma Primary Outcome Measures: • overall response rate Secondary Outcome Measures: - duration of response - progression free survival - overall survival Enrollment:45 Study Start Date: August 2016 Primary Completion Date: March 2018</detailed_description>
