	<brief_summary>This study investigates the variations in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness during uncomplicated anterior and intermediate uveitis, respectively. The objectives are to 1 ) confirm the RNFL thickening during an uncomplicated anterior uveitis as described in the literature, 2) measure the RNFL thickness during an uncomplicated intermediate uveitis specifically and 3) describe the variation in time of RNFL thickness during the two types of uveitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Variations in Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness During Uncomplicated Anterior and Intermediate Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty six individuals (18 with anterior uveitis and 18 with intermediate uveitis) will be recruited at the Centre universitaire d'ophtalmologie du CHU de Qu√©bec. RNFL thickness will be measured with optical coherence tomography at 3 times. For anterior uveitis, the RNFL thickness will be measured at presentation, 1 week and 4 to 6 weeks. For intermediate uveitis, the RNFL thickness will be measured at presentation, 4 to 6 weeks and 4 months. The initial thickness will be studied for each type of uveitis and progression over time will be studied also for each type of uveitis.</detailed_description>
