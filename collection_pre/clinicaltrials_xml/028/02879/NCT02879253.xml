	<brief_summary>This study is part of the french research program ANR NEMRO "MICROROBOTIC NASAL ENDOSCOPY BY OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY: IMPACT OF SMELL DEFICIENCY ON NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES." Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between the decrease in olfactory faculties of patients and the presence of neurodegenerative diseases. This possible relationship has created a need to inspect in detail the area of the nasal cavity that houses the olfactory function. Thus, the purpose of NEMRO project is developing a robot to explore olfactory slots of patients, with a view to extract images through non invasive imaging probe, and hoping to identify early signs of degeneration the olfactory tissue. The robot developed will thus be able to navigate in the nasal cavity of patients, and to break into the olfactory slots, which will host the imaging phase. The purpose of this study is therefore to collect data on the usual path of instruments (endoscope, for example) in this area, and future potential pathway of the robot. This collection made from Computed Tomography (CT) scans will define the clinical geometry of the target area and provide precisely the dimensional constraints needed to build the NEMRO robot .</brief_summary>
