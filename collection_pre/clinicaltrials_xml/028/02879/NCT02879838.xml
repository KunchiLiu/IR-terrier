	<brief_summary>The purpose is to compare clinical, functional, professional and socio-economical characteristics of patients with occupational asthma and work aggravated asthma. Secondary purposes are: - to evaluate diagnostic value of new non-invasive techniques such as exhaled nitric oxide and cytology of induced expectoration; - to estimate medical-social becoming of diagnosed work-related asthma after one year; - to establish a biobank of blood samples of individuals with work related asthma for measurement of cytokines and search for genetic polymorphisms associated with asthma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants with work related asthma or suspected work related asthma will obtain a precise diagnosis concerning severity and control of respiratory disorder and also the possible effect of professional environment on the disorder. Their medical care and medico-legal care, in case of recognition of occupational disease, could be ameliorated. In general, this study will allow the harmonization of diagnostic care and medical, medico-professional and medico-legal management of cases of work related asthma in specialized hospitals.</detailed_description>
