	<brief_summary>To compare presurgical motor mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation for surgery (nTMS) of rolandic lesions to surgery with mapping without implementing these data into neuronavigation as control. Primary objective: Permanently new postoperative deficit is lower when the preoperative motor mapping is available to the surgeon</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental intervention: presurgical motor mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and fusion with intraoperative neuronavigation Control intervention: presurgical motor mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation without access of the surgeon to this data Follow-up per patient: 6 months Duration of intervention per patient: 45 minutes</detailed_description>
