	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess a major complication of total laparoscopic hysterectomy, vaginal dehiscence, with two different colpotomy techniques. With this aim patients to be operated for laparoscopic hysterectomy will be randomized to two different techniques. The colpotomy will be undertaken by 'cut mode' in the first group and 'coagulation mode' in the second group. All of the operations will be preformed by the same surgical at a university hospital. Vaginal dehiscence after surgery is the primary outcome measure.</brief_summary>
