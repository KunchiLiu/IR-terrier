	<brief_summary>Increased tarsal platform show (TPS) and decreased brow fat span (BFS) are associated with favorable results in women undergoing cosmetic blepharoplasty. The authors evaluate the efficacy of a technique (brassiere sutures) to increase TPS and decrease the BFS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TPS After Upper Blepharoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, comparative, case series study of 100 eyelids (50 consecutive women patients) treated with cosmetic upper blepharoplasty by a single surgeon. Patients were randomized to receive traditional upper blepharoplasty with a single running suture skin closure versus orbicularis oculi muscle fixation to periosteum (brassiere sutures) prior to skin closure. Patient age, follow-up length, complications and treatment were analyzed. The mean of TPS, BFS and TPS/BFS ratio was measured before and after surgery at 3 anatomic landmarks. 56 eyelids (28 patients) were treated with traditional single suture blepharoplasty and 44 eyelids (22 patients) had brassiere sutures. After surgery, the mean change in TPS was 2.10 mm with brassiere sutures compared to 2.04 mm without (p &lt;.001). The mean change in BFS was 3.33 mm with brassiere sutures compared to 3.19 mm without (p &lt;.001), The mean change in TPS:BFS ratio at all 3 anatomic landmarks was statistically significant in both groups but the change was statistically greater with the use of brassiere sutures (p &lt;.001). Brassiere sutures during upper blepharoplasty were associated with a postoperative increase in TPS decrease in BFS, and increase in TPS/BFS.</detailed_description>
