	<brief_summary>State of the question Over the past decade, the incidence of melanoma (MM) has steadily increased in France and in most developed countries. This increased incidence was concerned mainly MM thin while the incidence of MM thick that represent the true "killers", and mortality from MM remained stable or increased slightly over the same period. These epidemiological data and observations from everyday medical practice dermatologists suggest the existence of different growth patterns within MM. Indeed, some MM progressing slowly sometimes for decades before diagnosis but are thin at the time of resection. Conversely, others MM grow very quickly, resulting in thick tumors despite a diagnosis and resection sometimes very early. These fast growing MM (FGMM) probably contribute significantly to the relative mortality in MM, as improved screening failed to influence to this day. Our team has already demonstrated that the growth kinetics of the MM was a prognostic factor of tumor aggressiveness regardless of the thickness of the tumor. Using the same method to calculate the growth rate, an Australian team recently studied the growth rate in a population of patients suffering from MM. In this population 1/3 of MM had a growth of more than 0.5 mm per month. Clinical aspects and FGMM of these risk factors were individuals (injuries symmetrical achromic and regular occurrence among about older and low-nevi). The European and Australian people are very different in particular regarding the prevention policy, these results can not be extrapolated to the French population.The main objective is to identify risk factors for FGMM in French propulation</brief_summary>
