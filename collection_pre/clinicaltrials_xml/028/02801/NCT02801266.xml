	<brief_summary>This project develops a contraceptive counseling protocol (CCP) grounded in scientific evidence and evaluates the CCP for promoting behaviors conducive to preventing unintended pregnancy among women. The project develops and refines the CCP using focus groups and in-depth interviews with (a) key administrators in the national office of Planned Parenthood (b) key administrators in participating Title X clinics, (c) contraceptive counselors, and (d) clients of the health centers. The CCP uses scientifically grounded principles for guiding effective decision making and provider-client communication. Ten Title X clinics are randomly assigned to one of two conditions (5 clinics per condition): (1) treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) implementation of the CCP. Approximately 150 women are selected for study participation in each clinic, yielding about 1,400 participants (half control and half CCP). Immediately following their counseling session, women complete a computer-administered interview that serves as a fidelity check and permits evaluation of the effects of the CCP on variables associated with counseling satisfaction. All women are re-interviewed by phone 6 months later and 12 months later. The effect of the CCP on method-choice effectiveness, method switching, gaps in protection, and use accuracy are evaluated.</brief_summary>
