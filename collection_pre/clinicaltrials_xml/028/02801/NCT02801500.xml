	<brief_title>Superior Bilioenteric Anastomosis by Magnetic Compressive Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The superior bilioenteric anastomosis is one of the most common and difficult operations in Hepatobiliary Surgery. The traditional manual anastomosis has become one of the main prognosis factors because of the length of suture time, the difficulty of operation, the high incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture. Magnetic compressive anastomosis can realize the fast anastomosis, reduce the difficulty, and reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture. Currently, the majority of studies of magnetic compressive bilioenteric anastomosis are merely confined within clinical case report and single-center, small sample, retrospective study, thus they are lack of convictive evidence of evidence-based medicine for the security, reliability and convince. This study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. To evaluate the security, reliability and convince of magnetic compressive superior bilioenteric anastomosis, this study compared the incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture between magnetic compressive anastomosis and traditional manual anastomosis among patients who need superior bilioenteric anastomosis operation. The study design plan to enroll 70 patients and divide into Study Group (Group A: Magnetic compressive anastomosis) and Control Group (Group B: traditional manual anastomosis) as 1:1 ratio randomly by stratification factors. The incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture, length of bilioenteric anastomosis time, value of serum bilirubin, length of discharge time of magnetic device and mean time of hospital stay will be evaluated. The patients will drop out of the study if adverse events happen, active request for dropping out, new-onset severe disease or death. The primary and secondary end point will be observed by regular follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with age between 18 to 75 Patients' gender was not limited Patients who were welldiagnosed and had the indication for superior bilioenteric anastomosis. Patients whose lifetimes will be longer than 12 months. Patients who are willing to join this clinical trial and informed consent form voluntarily. Woman during pregnancy or lactation or anyone with mental disorder The wall of hepatic duct or jejunum was too thick so that the attractive force of magnetic device cannot meet the requirements of compression. Any anatomical variation in bile ducts system or the inner diameter is too small so that the magnetic device cannot place in. Any foreign body has been implanted in body, such as heart pacemaker. Surgical contraindication, including: ChildPugh C with hepatic encephalopathy Anyone with heart, lung, kidney dysfunction or other organ dysfunction, and cannot tolerate surgery.Hepatic ducts stone disease, who was diagnosed as Acute Cholangitis of Severe Type, especially complicated with bacteremia or septic shock. End stage disease, complicated with biliary cirrhosis or portal hypertension.Patients with longterm obstructive jaundice, dehydration, electrolyte disturbance or coagulation defects; Patients have the tendency or history of bleeding. Any other disease in perioperation periods which needs MRI examination in the next 8 weeks post operation.</criteria>
