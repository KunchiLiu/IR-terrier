	<brief_summary>The study proposed in this protocol aims to document the physiological, subjective, behavioral, and neural effects of reduced environmental stimulation (floating) in patients with current or prior eating disorder. The primary aim of this study is to determine the safety of this intervention. Secondary aims including determining whether floating has an impact on symptom reports such as those related to anxiety and eating disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Restricted Environmental Stimulation on Eating Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Floating creates an environment with minimal visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal input to the brain. The float rooms used in this study are both lightproof, and thus completely dark when the entry door is sealed and the lights are turned off, reducing all visual input to the brain. Each float room was constructed with thick soundproof walls, restricting most outside noises from entering the room, thereby reducing auditory input to the brain. A high concentration Epsom salt water solution allows individuals to effortlessly float on their back while remaining completely still, reducing both proprioceptive and tactile input to the brain. The temperature of the water is calibrated to the temperature of the skin (~94° F) and the temperature of the air is calibrated to the temperature of the water, making it difficult to discern the boundary between air and water, thus reducing thermal input to the brain while minimizing the need for thermoregulation of the skin. While both float pools dramatically reduce external sensory information, it is important to note that participants are in full control over the experience. For example, participants can enter and exit the float pool whenever they choose. Each float pool also contains a blue LED light that can be turned on and off via an air-coupled light switch in the pool. Both float rooms contain a shower for cleaning before and after floating. In a prior study the investigators have found that healthy participants found the pool condition to be relaxing and stress relieving. The current study aims to determine the safety of floating with a clinical population, specifically individuals with a history of eating disorder who are of normal weight.</detailed_description>
