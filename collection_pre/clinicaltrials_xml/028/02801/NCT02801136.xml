	<brief_summary>This research study is examining the effects of a cognitive behavioral intervention (an intervention focused on changing behaviors and thoughts) for psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES, episodes resembling epileptic seizures but with no medical explanation). Participants engage in 8 individual therapy sessions consisting of either cognitive behavioral therapy or supportive therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Outcomes of CBT-PNES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants come to our laboratory for a total of 11 sessions. During the initial visit, participants complete several questionnaires assessing demographics, personality style, relationships with friends and family, as well as past and current PNES symptoms. Participants must provide EEG results indicating a diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Participants receive a PNES diary to record all episodes during the course of the study. They are randomly assigned to either receive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PNES or supportive therapy, and they return 8 times over the next 8 weeks for therapy sessions. If randomized to CBT, participants and a family member learn how to change behaviors and thoughts to address PNES. If randomized to supportive therapy, they discuss stressors and how they relate to the PNES. Procedures are the same for each therapy group. The first therapy session lasts approximately 90 minutes. All subsequent sessions last about one hour. After completing the 8 therapy sessions participants return one week later for a follow-up visit lasting approximately one hour. This visit consists of answering several questionnaires and an interview about current PNES symptoms. Lastly, participants return two months later for a final follow-up visit similar to the one week follow up visit.</detailed_description>
