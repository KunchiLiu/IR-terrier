	<brief_summary>The present study would be the first to investigate the relationship between reward-induced dopamine (DA) release and neural function using a combined PET/fMRI approach. Data from this project conducted in healthy subjects will provide preliminary data for a larger grant application to study patient populations with known abnormalities in DA including schizophrenia, major depressive, substance use, and eating disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Reward-induced Dopamine Release on Functional Connectivity: a Combined PET/fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1. To test the relationship between reward-induced dopamine (DA) release on changes in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in healthy subjects. In 20 healthy adults, the investigators will examine reward-induced DA release (measured using positron emission tomography, PET) in the ventral striatum, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex, as previously described. Before and after the reward task the investigators will examine RSFC (measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) between these structures, which have been shown to form functional pathways serving motivation and emotion regulation in rodents and nonhuman primates. The investigators hypothesize that DA release will impact the functional relationship between these and other structures as determined by changes in RSFC. Sub-Aim 1. In a subset of subjects, evaluate the use of VersaPET for estimating18F-fallypride levels in plasma. The VersaPET device (developed by Dr. Paul Vaska, Co-PI) will be used to measure levels of plasma radioactivity. This is a PET device placed around the lower leg that allows continuous high-resolution, fast frame imaging of the arteries in the leg in a completely non-invasive manner, while the whole-body PET scanner acquires images of the brain. The radioactivity derived from this device, as well as the resulting outcome measures, will be compared to those estimated with arterial analysis. The overall goal is evaluate whether in future studies this device can be used as a noninvasive alternative to arterial lines for the purpose of determining a blood input function for compartmental modeling. This device will be used as available, and on a case-by-case basis (Dr. Vaska, personal communication). Of the 20 subjects proposed, the investigators expect about half to use this device. Aim 2. To examine the relationship between dopamine release and the Reward Positivity (RewP) potential. Subjects will be presented with the option to participate in an event-related potential (ERP) study. The investigators will correlate the amount of DA release with the amplitude of the RewP potential, an ERP that is enhanced in reward versus non-reward circumstances. Based on previous studies, the investigators hypothesize that RewP amplitude will positively correlate with dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.</detailed_description>
