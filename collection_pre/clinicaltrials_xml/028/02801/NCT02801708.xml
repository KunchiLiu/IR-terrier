	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of continuous 7-day Holter ECG for detecting covert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with recent embolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) of undetermined cause after completion of a standard clinical work up including an initial 24-hour Holter monitoring.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Detection of Underlying, Covert ATrial Fibrillation Using 7-day Holter Electrocardiogram in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Covert atrial fibrillation (AF) is a relevant potential cause of a recently proposed clinical construct, "Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS)". However, routine post-stroke work up including 24-hour Holter monitoring may fail to detect paroxysmal AF. A recent systematic review has shown an increased AF detection rate with longer monitoring durations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ambulatory 7-day Holter ECG (EV-201, Parama-Tech inc.) for detecting AF in patients with recent ESUS after completion of a standard clinical examination.</detailed_description>
