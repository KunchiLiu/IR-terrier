	<brief_summary>Protein requirements in individuals who participate in endurance-based exercise training have been suggested to be greater than the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Our recent study using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique have suggested that protein requirements in young men are at least 30% higher than the recommended protein intake. The present study will investigate the impact of protein sufficiency on protein metabolism and performance during intensified training periods as a means to further our understanding of the nutritional requirements for the endurance athlete.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy, male, endurancetrained participants who have run regularly more than 45 km or 4.5 hours/week Participants who are categorized at least "very good" based on a study by Shvartz &amp; Reibold [40], in which peak rate of oxygen consumption(VO2 Peak) is used as an index. (i.e. the participants whose VO2peak is ≥57 ml/kg/min (1824 y), ≥54 ml/kg/min (2529 y), ≥52 ml/kg/min (3034 y), ≥49 ml/kg/min (3539 y), ≥47 ml/kg/min (4044 y), ≥44 ml/kg/min (4550 y) according to his age, Participants who can cover 10 km in less than 60 min after the VO2peak test and 5 km Time trial on session 2. Participants will be 1850 years old. Participants are willing to abide by the compliance rules of this study Inability to meet health and physical activity guidelines according to the The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for everyone. Female Inability to adhere to any of the compliance rules judged by principal investigator or medical doctor Regular tobacco use Illicit drug use (e.g. growth hormone, testosterone, etc.)</criteria>
