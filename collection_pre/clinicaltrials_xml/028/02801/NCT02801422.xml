	<brief_summary>The aim of this fMRI study is to investigate neural indices of relapse in cannabis dependence. The development and maintenance of drug addictions have been associated with deficits in cognitive control, craving and impaired stress regulation. Therefore, neural markers of brain processes underlying the beforementioned components will be studied. Subsequent follow-up drug use interviews will reveal associations between relapse in cannabis dependence and alterations in brain networks of cognitive control, craving and stress.</brief_summary>
