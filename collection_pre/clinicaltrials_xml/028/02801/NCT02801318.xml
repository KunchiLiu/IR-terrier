	<brief_summary>Acute confusional states known as delirium frequently occur in Intensive Care Units (ICU), mostly after cardiac surgery, leading to serious consequences. Sleep deprivation has been described in ICU patients and is considered as a risk factor for delirium but its role is still unknown. It is therefore essential to identify whether sleep deprivation and more specifically REM sleep alterations could facilitate occurence of delirium in ICU.</brief_summary>
