	<brief_summary>For preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma, usage of serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may be helpful. Additionally, the prognosis of the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma treated with gastrectrectomy may be associated with serum and peritoneal levels of tumor markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum and Peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 for Gastric Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical usage of tumor markers on preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma is a controversial issue. It has been thought that there is a positive correlation between serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 and pathologic features of gastric tumors and peritoneal dissemination. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of serum and peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 to predict TNM stages and peritoneal washing cytology in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma after curative gastrectomy, and to determine predictive value of these measurements to the development of recurrence and death.</detailed_description>
