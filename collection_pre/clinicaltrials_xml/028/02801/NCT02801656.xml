	<brief_summary>Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, caused by loss of healthy gut flora. Conventional treatment uses antibiotics to kill Clostridium difficile. A novel treatment uses replacement of gut flora by fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Randomized trials have established safety and efficacy of FMT in recurrent CDAD, but no trial has used FMT for primary CDAD. This study will randomize patients to oral encapsulated FMT or oral Vancomycin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Primary Clostridium Difficile Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with primary CDAD will be approached for consent and randomized equally to two arms: oral FMT with oral Vancomycin placebo, or oral FMT placebo with oral Vancomycin. FMT will be prepared from anonymous donors screened according to Health Canada guidelines and stored frozen.</detailed_description>
