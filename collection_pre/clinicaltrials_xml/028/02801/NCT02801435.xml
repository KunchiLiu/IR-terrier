	<brief_title>Icotinib Hydrochloride Cream in Patients With Mild to Moderate Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Icotinib Hydrochloride is a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment of advanced nonsmall- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China in its oral form. As EGFR is implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, icotinib hydrochloride is being developed as a cream for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. This is a single-center, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 4.0% icotinib hydrochloride cream by topical administration. Icotinib hydrochloride cream will be applied to subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
