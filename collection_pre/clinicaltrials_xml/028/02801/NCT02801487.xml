	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) along with concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens along with concurrent chemotherapy (40 mg/m^2, weekly) to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating Carbon Ion Radiotherapy With Concurrent Chemotherapy for Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) along with concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD in the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose starting from 52.5GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to potentially 62.5GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) along with concurrent chemotherapy (40 mg/m^2, weekly) to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is used for the phase I dose escalating part of the trial and approximately 25 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD in the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II part of the trial will be a single phase single arm study.</detailed_description>
