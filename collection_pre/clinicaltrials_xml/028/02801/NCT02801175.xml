	<brief_summary>Consecutive patients with paroxysmal AFib scheduled to undergo pulmonary vein isolation either with radiofrequency (RF) or cryoballoon will be included. Left atrial appendage emptying flow velocity (LAA-EFV) will be measured with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) immediately before and following left atrial ablation (1 month post). The change in LAA-EFV will be compared between the two groups (RF versus Cryo).</brief_summary>
