	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized placebo- controlled clinical trials is to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus reuteri containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP). Material and methods: Thirty six gingivitis patients will be recruited and monitored clinically at baseline, 3 and 6 month after therapy. All patients will receive scaling and periodontal treatment and randomly will be assigned over an experimental (SRP + probiotic, N=18) or control (SRP+ placebo, n=18) group. The lozenges will be used once per day during 3 month.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Effect of Lactobacillus Reuteri in Treatment of Gingivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gingivitis is the most prevalent worldwide periodontal disease, is characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tooth without causing periodontal attachment loss. Preventive and / or therapeutic measures to facilitate or improve their control are therefore very important, much more if you consider that gingivitis and periodontitis are considered part of an ongoing inflammatory process. Treatment of gingivitis, like that of all periodontal diseases has been based on the implementation of control measures personal and professional plaque. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it has been reported that although mechanical therapy achieved significantly decrease the periodontopathogens, this may be only temporary since bacteria can recolonize the treated niches in the oral cavity. In this context, it has emerged as a new treatment strategy complementary use of probiotics such as Lactobacillus reuteri, which possess anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Generally speaking, probiotics would promote health by competitive exclusion of some or positive pathogenic bacteria. Objective: To evaluate the effect of the administration of Lactobacillus reuteri as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy in adolescent and young adult patients with gingivitis. Methodology: A randomized double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the effect of probiotic lozenges Lactobacillus rhamnosus as an adjunct to conventional periodontal treatment of patients with gingivitis will be performed. Expected Results: Statistically significant decrease in bleeding and gingival index in the experimental group compared with the control.</detailed_description>
