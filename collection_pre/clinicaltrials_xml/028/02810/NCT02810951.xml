	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of FCX-007, evaluate C7 expression and the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007 and to analyze wound healing as a result of FCX-007 administration in subjects with RDEB.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of FCX-007 for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RDEB is a congenital and progressive orphan skin disease caused by the deficiency of the protein type VII collagen (COL7). The objective of this study is evaluate the safety FCX-007 intradermal injections in RDEB subjects. Additionally, the trial will evaluate type VII collagen expression, the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007, as well evidence of wound healing. Six adult subjects are expected to be treated with FCX-007 in the Phase I portion of the trial and six subjects age 7 or older in the Phase II portion of the trial. All subjects will receive FCX-007 to one or more paired target RDEB wounds. Proof of mechanism will be monitored through digital photography of target wounds and assays conducted on biopsies taken from target wounds.</detailed_description>
