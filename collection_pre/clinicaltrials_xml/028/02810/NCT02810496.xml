	<brief_summary>As the investigators observed a case of glucocorticoid mutation revealed by incidentally discovered bilateral adrenal nodular hyperplasia, it was postulated that this molecular anormality could be more frequent than previously described. To validate this hypothesis, it was decided to study 150 multicenter consecutive patients, presenting with incidentally discovered bilateral adrenal masses without clinical signs of Cushing's disease. In all these patients GR gene will be studied, mutations will be detected and described, functional disturbance will be tested. Usual polymorphisms will be described. Correlation between clinical signs, hormonal and morphological abnormalities and presence or absence of GR mutations will be searched.</brief_summary>
