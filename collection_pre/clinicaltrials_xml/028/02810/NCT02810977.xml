	<brief_summary>Anesthesiologists try to avoid complications with significant peri -operative morbidity and mortality such as bronchoaspiration in patients requiring a surgical procedure under anesthesia. Currently, this is achieved based on experts recommendations from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. However, there are tools like ultrasound that allow assessment of gastric content and volume. This tool allows to individualize each patient and base the decisions objectively. The investigators will assess gastric content and volume by ultrasound in patients who have fasted and require surgery at two University Hospitals.</brief_summary>
