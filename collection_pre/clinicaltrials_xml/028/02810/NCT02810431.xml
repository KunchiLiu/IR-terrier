	<brief_summary>Background: This protocol is designed to have samples from closing protocols transferred to this protocol for long-term storage. The protocol is concerned with the retention of blood, plasma, serum, CSF, aspirates, bone marrow, ascites fluid, urine, saliva, PBMCs, skin, mucosal, tumor and healthy tissue samples from patients with cancer to support basic science and clinical research activities of the Medical Oncology Branch and other intramural Laboratories and Branches at the NIH Clinical Research Center and Center for Cancer Research. Objectives: To allow long-term storage of biospecimens collected during prospective clinical trials in patients with various cancer phenotypes, as needed to support the research activities of the Medical Oncology Branch and other Laboratories and Branches. Eligibility: Samples eligible for long-term retention must be from those who have signed consent for storage and retention of biospecimens. Design: Acquired samples will be barcoded and associated data will be entered into an encrypted computer software system, and securely maintained to protect patient identifiers. Samples are retained and made available to the original PI, or other Investigators with the original PI's permission, following submission and approval of a supplemental research protocol to the IRB or OHSRP.</brief_summary>
