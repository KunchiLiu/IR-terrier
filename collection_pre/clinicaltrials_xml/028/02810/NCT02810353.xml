	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the dentoskeletal effects of the expander with differential opening in orthodontic patients in the mixed dentition. Half of participants will undergo rapid maxillary expansion (RME) using the expander with differential opening, while the other half will undergo RME using the conventional Hyrax expander.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of the Dentoskeletal Effects of the Expander With Differential Opening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, a rapid maxillary expander with differential opening was developed aiming to treat maxillary constrictions greater in the anterior region compared to the posterior region of the maxillary dental arch. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dentoskeletal effects of the expander with differential opening in orthodontic patients in the mixed dentition. Material and methods: Fifty patients with maxillary constriction in the mixed dentition will be prospectively and randomly allocated in one of two study groups. The experimental group will comprise 25 patients who will be submitted to rapid maxillary expansion with the expander with differential opening. The control group will be comprised by 25 individuals who will undergo rapid maxillary expander with the Hyrax expander. Digital dental models will be acquired immediately pre-expansion (T1) and six months post-expansion (T2). The Orthoanalyzerâ„¢ software will be used to measure maxillary and mandibular widths, arches perimeter, arches lengths, palatal depth, and inclinations of maxillary and mandibular canines and permanent first molars. The intergroup and interphase comparisons will be analyzed using t tests and paired t tests, respectively (p&lt;0.05).</detailed_description>
