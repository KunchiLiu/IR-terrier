	<brief_title>Dynamic Stress Perfusion CT for Detection of Inducible Myocardial Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) provides accurate assessment of the coronary arteries and detects significant coronary stenosis with high diagnostic accuracy. However, the hemodynamic relevance of these stenotic lesion remains unclear, although highly relevant for clinical decision-making. Recent technical developments with third-generation dual-source CT allow to determine myocardial perfusion during hyperemia and thus for assessment of the hemodynamic relevance of coronary lesions using a dynamic acquisition mode. To date, there is only very limited evidence of the feasibility of this approach stemming from single-center studies with varying standards of reference. Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MPICT for the detection of hemodynamically relevant coronary stenosis (as determined by invasive FFR) in patients with suspected or known CAD clinically referred for invasive angiography. In an optional sub-study the diagnostic accuracy of MPICT for the detection of myocardial perfusion defects as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) will be investigated. Study design: Observational cohort study with fractional flow reserve (FFR) during invasive angiography as the reference standard. Study population: Patients with known or suspected CAD clinically referred for invasive angiography. Main study parameters: Myocardial perfusion defect on dynamic CT perfusion imaging, and diagnostic accuracy as compared invasive FFR.
