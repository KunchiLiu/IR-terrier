	<criteria>Main Written informed consent/assent obtained from subjects/subjects' parent(s) or legally acceptable representative indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in it. Male or female, aged 2 through 75 years. Diagnosis of PID with impaired antibody production, i.e.: Diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) as defined by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID)/Pan American Group for Immunodeficiency (PAGID) diagnostic criteria. Or X linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) as defined by ESID/PAGID diagnostic criteria. Established replacement therapy with any intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) reference preparation during the previous 6 months, including documentation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) trough levels. Established replacement therapy with a single IVIg reference preparation for at least 3 months prior to treatment start with BT595 at a 3 or 4 week schedule with a constant IVIg dose that did not change by ±20% of the mean dose, regular dosage intervals, and at least 1 IgG trough level of ≥5 g/L during the previous 3 months. Main Known intolerance to immunoglobulins or comparable substances (e.g., vaccination reaction). Known intolerance to proteins of human origin or known allergic reactions to components of the study product. Acquired medical conditions known to cause secondary immune deficiency, such as chronic lymphatic leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, as well as protein losing enteropathies and hypoalbuminemia. Recent febrile illness that precludes or delays participation. Active infection and receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this infection at the time of screening. Note: if the subject is deemed to be a screen failure due to a nonserious active infection requiring antibiotic therapy, the subject may be rescreened after the initial screening. Therapy with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs at the time of enrollment (current daily use of corticosteroids, i.e., &gt;10 mg prednisone equivalent/day for &gt;30 days. Intermittent corticosteroid use during the study is allowable, if medically necessary). History of thrombotic events (including myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident [including stroke], pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis) within the 6 months before treatment start with BT595 or the presence of significant risk factors for thrombotic events. Therapy with live attenuated virus vaccines within 3 months before start of the study. Selective, absolute immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency or known antibodies to IgA.</criteria>
