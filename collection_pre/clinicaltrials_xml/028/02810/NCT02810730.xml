	<brief_summary>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the 4th leading cause of cancer in the USA. Its incidence is increasing both in France and in Europe, whereas all the other cancers are decreasing in Europe. Moreover, its seriousness is still high, with a mortality rate higher than the average incidence. The aim of PAPAFA study is to assess the prevalence of the pancreatic anomalies which can be revealed thanks to imaging, for patients having a 1st degree pancreatic adenocarcinoma familial history. This could allow detection of lesions which are less than 10 mm long, and improve the dark prognostic of this pathology.</brief_summary>
