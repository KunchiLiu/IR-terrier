	<brief_summary>Overweight and obesity are public health problems worldwide. Even though heredity may be one of the causes the diseases, the vast majority of cases is rather linked to a sedentary lifestyle associated or not with a low-variety, high-calorie diet. Many diets and slimming methods propose low-calorie meals or physical exercise, and the consequences of these are sometimes negative with advancing age (muscle wasting). Certain studies have shown the efficacy of foods with antioxidant properties on the reduction of blood pressure, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and weight or on the distribution of fat mass-lean mass. The investigators put forward the hypothesis that the daily consumption of two yoghurts containing XXS, a mixture of natural polyphenolic compounds -rich in quercetin- from plant extracts, could lead to weight loss, a better fat mass-lean mass distribution and an improvement in markers of oxidative stress in overweight persons aged 50 to 65 years.</brief_summary>
