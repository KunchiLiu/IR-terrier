	<brief_summary>The goal of this project will be to demonstrate that Synaptive Medical's Diffusion Tensor Imaging(DTI) product functionality used in pre-operative planning and intraoperative surgical navigation, improves clinical outcomes corresponding to a reduction in neurological and neuropsychological deficits in pediatric brain tumor surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DTI &amp; Tractography in Pediatric Tumor Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain tumours are the most common form of solid tumours in children which often arise from the cerebellum. Treatment involves a complete resection of the tumour. Although surgical resection may eliminate most of the malignancy, signs of post-neurologic deficit may present as a consequence to the treatment. One such example is cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS), a postoperative syndrome typically arising 1 to 2 days after resection of a midline posterior fossa tumor; it consists of diminished speech progressing to mutism, emotional lability, hypotonia, and ataxia. While some of the symptoms recover after a few months, neuropsychological testing shows long term deficits in language (agramatism), executive function and verbal memory. This study aims to investigate whether the use of Synaptive Medical's BrightMatterâ„¢ technology can help neurosurgeons better visualize and plan surgeries by avoiding eloquent fiber tracts in the brain and cerebellum; thus minimizing damage pertaining to neurologic and motor functionality. The use of these products will also be assessed for improved clinical outcomes in pediatric tumor surgery.</detailed_description>
