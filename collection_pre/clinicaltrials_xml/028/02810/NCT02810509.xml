	<brief_title>Quality of Anticoagulation With Warfarin in Patient With Atrial Fibrillation for Secondary Stroke Prevention in Korea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To assess the quality of anticoagulation with warfarin in real world practice of Korea for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF-related Cardioembolic (CE) stroke 1) who initiated warfarin therapy and treatment at least for more than 7 days of warfarin adjustment period (warfarin-initiated cohort), and 2) who initiated and maintained warfarin therapy at least for more than 90 days after the 7 days of warfarin adjustment period (long-term warfarin-treated cohort). - To explore predictors for poor INR control.</detailed_description>
