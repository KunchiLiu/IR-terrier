	<brief_summary>Phase-II, prospective, open label, no control group to assess the safety of 68Ga-DOTA-TATE injection in patients with suspected or diagnosed with tumors expressing somatostatin receptors. Each included patient will receive an administered dose of 50 mcg or less of the peptide (DOTA-TATE) and a range of activity between 100 - 200 MBq of 68Ga-DOTA-TATE. The efficacy of 68Ga-DOTA-TATE in assessing this kind of tumors has been proved by numerous studies.</brief_summary>
