	<brief_summary>The study is a pragmatic cluster randomized trial that is being conducted in 6 countries, with sites in 4 cities in Canada, Benin, Brazil, Ghana, Indonesia and Vietnam. The trial tests a complex intervention-a two phase programmatic public health package which includes a standardized public health evaluation and analysis, to identify problems and barriers limiting Latent Tuberculosis Infection diagnosis and treatment among close contacts of active Tuberculosis cases. This will be followed by implementation of appropriate solutions. The primary objective of the study is to increase the proportion starting Latent Tuberculosis Infection treatment among household contacts of patients with active pulmonary. A secondary objective is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this two phase intervention. If successful, this approach can be expanded throughout these countries. After initial preparations, including administrative and ethical review, all participating sites will be randomized to intervention or control. Immediately after this, Phase 1 will begin in intervention sties with the standardized public health evaluation to identify barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment initiation and the selection of solutions to be used in Phase 2. To ensure standardization of data gathering research staff will use (i) current indicators of the Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade of care in intervention facilities (number of contacts per index case registered, investigated, started on treatment and completing treatment) and (ii) interviewer administered questionnaires for patients with active pulmonary Tuberculosis, adult and child household contacts and clinic staff. These questionnaires will assess latent Tuberculosis-related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs from the perspective of these different participants. Results from intervention sites in Phase 1 will be analyzed, and used by the investigators, together with local public health officials, to decide on appropriate corrective solutions in each sites. In Phase 2, solutions for problems identified will be selected and implemented at the intervention sites. Study outcomes and costs will be measured at all intervention and control sites throughout Phase 1 &amp; 2. Results will be disseminated within each country through existing links with national Tuberculosis programs, and through international organizations such as the World Health Organization.</brief_summary>

Index case questionnaire: Newly diagnosed patients with microbiologically confirmed active pulmonary Tuberculosis (Pulmonary Tuberculosis smear or culture or GeneXpert positive or Nucleic Acid Amplification test (NAAT) Age ≥ 18 years old At least 1 Household contact, with contact investigation underway Signed informed consent Health care worker Only extrapulmonary Tuberculosis 2. Household contacts questionnaire Age ≥ 18 years old Informed consent signed Sleeps in the same house at least 1 night per week during the past 3 months with person who has confirmed active Tuberculosis OR Spent more than one hour per day in the house for at least 5 days per week with person who has active Tuberculosis in the past 3 months Exclusion criteria: Adult contact (age ≥ 18) who has already completed the child contact questionnaire Currently has active Tuberculosis Health Care worker 3. Health Care worker questionnaire: Inclusion criteria: Health care worker involved in care of Tuberculosis patients, and/or their contacts Age ≥ 18 years old Signed informed consent Exclusion criteria: Has ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS (currently or in the past) 4. Parents of Children (under 5 years of age) who were Household contact Inclusion criteria: Age ≥ 18 years old Signed informed consent Parent/legal guardian/responsible caregiver of child under 5 years of age And one of the following two mandatory eligibility criteria: Child sleeps in the same house at least 1 night per week during the past 3 months with person who has active pulmonary Tuberculosis OR Child spent more than one hour per day in the house for at least 5 days per week with person who has active pulmonary Tuberculosis ( in the past 3 months) Exclusion criteria: The parent is the source (Index) case The parents is an Aadult contact who has already completed the contact questionnaire for adults The child currently has active Tuberculosis</criteria>
