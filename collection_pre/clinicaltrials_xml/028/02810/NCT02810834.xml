	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis of the Fueling Learning Through Exercise (FLEX) study is two innovative school-based physical activity programs (a walking/running program and a classroom activity break program) will increase school-time and total daily minutes children engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, relative to controls, and that children who attend schools with these PA programs will demonstrate improved cognitive functioning, academic achievement, and attendance, relative to controls.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The FLEX Study is a three-year, randomized control trial that seeks to understand how two different innovative school-based physical activity (PA) programs influence not only children's time spent in MVPA but also their cognitive and academic outcomes. The FLEX Study will be implemented and evaluated by researchers from Tufts University. The project is funded by the National Institutes of Health. Schools participating in the study will be randomly assigned to receive a walking/running program, a classroom physical activity program, or no program (control) during first year and a half of the study. Third and fourth grade children will be enrolled in the study. Physical activity will be assessed objectively using accelerometry. Additional measurements will include: BMI/BMI-z (measured height and weight), diet and physical activity questionnaires, cognitive functioning (tests of working memory and inhibitory control).</detailed_description>
