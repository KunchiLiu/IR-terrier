	<brief_summary>The first study of my PhD showed that acute supplementation of berry extracts can modulate cognitive behaviour in healthy adults. There is a growing body of evidence supporting an improvement in memory and learning performance in animal models following the ingestion of flavonoid rich fruits (Shukitt-Hale et al 2008;Spencer 2008; Spencer et al., 2008). However, study 2, showed no effect on any aspects of memory in healthy young adults after supplementation of the berry extracts. It is hypothesised that the lack of behavioural effects on memory of the berry juice in study 2 was because of the cohort used. These healthy adult participants were already performing near to their peak (Salthouse et al., 2009), and unlike study one, participants were not mentally fatigued enough to reveal subtle cognitive benefits. The aims of the study are to examine if acute supplementation of two berry extracts in an older population can augment memory, attention and executive function. Secondly, the time course of these behavioural effects will be measured by multiple cognitive assessments throughout the day after consumption of the extracts.</brief_summary>
