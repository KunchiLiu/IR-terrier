	<brief_title>MIFI Flutter Registry - Ablation of Atrial Flutter With IntellaTip Sensor Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MIFI Flutter Registry is a non-interventional, multi-centre, prospective registry in consecutive patients with atrial flutter and indication for right atrial isthmus ablation. The registry is an observational study and patient's participation in this study has no impact on his/her indication for treatment, diagnostics or therapy. Patients are supposed to be treated according to current guidelines and the site's internal directives. Treatment pattern and treatment initiation, continuation or changes are solely at the discre-tion of the physician and the patient. There will be no attempt to influence the treatment patterns of any individual treating physician. All drug prescriptions will be in the usual standard of care. Participation in the registry will in no way influence payment or reimbursement for any treatment received by subjects during the study. A minimum of 10 hospitals in Germany treating atrial flutter and using the Maximum voltage-guided (MVG) ablation technique are eligible for participation. The enrolment period is estimated to be 6 months. Eligible are all patients with atrial flutter, who will visit consecutively a participating site of the MIFI Flutter Registry. It is planned to enrol approximately 120 patients in total. The follow-ups of patients will be performed using a standardized patient interview (telephone call) at 6 months by Institut f√ºr Herzinfarktforschung (IHF). In case of relevant complications, the treating physician is asked to provide medical records for verification. If the patient is not accessible by phone, local registration offices will be contacted for further information.</detailed_description>
