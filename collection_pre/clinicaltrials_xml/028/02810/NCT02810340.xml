	<brief_summary>MCV-5 is a vaccine being studied for use against a germ that causes infections of the brain and/or the blood. There are several licensed vaccines that protect against meningitis caused by 4 different types of the germ, but there is one type of the germ that these vaccines do not protect against. MCV-5 includes the same coverage as these other vaccines and includes a fifth type. The purpose of this study is to test how this vaccine affects adult human volunteers when compared to a licensed meningitis vaccine. Investigators will monitor volunteers for side effects and collect blood to test for antibodies.</brief_summary>
