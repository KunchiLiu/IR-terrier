	<brief_title>Clinical and Structural Outcome of Conventional Versus Accelerated Corneal Collagen Cross-linking (CXL).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 patients with signs of progressive keratoconus are randomized to either corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) with conventional ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation at 3 milliwatt/cm² (mW/ cm²) or accelerated ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation at 9 mW/ cm². In both groups riboflavin with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was used. The objectives of this study are to evaluate and compare different corneal parameters (maximum corneal curvature, depth of collagen cross-linking, endothelial cell density) and clinical outcomes of uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA)) after CXL with conventional and accelerated UVA irradiation.</detailed_description>
