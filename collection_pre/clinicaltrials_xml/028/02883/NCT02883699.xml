	<brief_title>Individually Tailored Training Prescriptions in Cancer Patients: The TOP Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TOP Study is a two-stage study on individually tailored endurance and resistance training prescriptions for breast and prostate cancer patients after the end of primary therapy in order to optimize training effects. The TOP Study Part I aims at identifying the most appropriate way of individual intensity prescription. In a descriptive cross sectional study, 20 breast and 20 prostate cancer patients perform singe endurance and resistance training sessions prescribed by means of different methods of intensity prescription. The most appropriate method of intensity prescription is identified through considering predictability/homogeneity of physiological responses as well as perceived exertion and enjoyment. The TOP Study Part II aims at investigating the most effective training method in terms of enhancing physical fitness for both endurance and strength training. The design is an exploratory four-arm 12-week randomized controlled training intervention trial in 60 breast and 60 prostate cancer patients. In two endurance arms, vigorous continuous training is compared to a polarized program consisting of moderate training and aerobic high intensity interval training (HIIT). Similarly, in two resistance training arms, standard machine based hypertrophy training is compared to training following a daily undulating periodization design.</detailed_description>
