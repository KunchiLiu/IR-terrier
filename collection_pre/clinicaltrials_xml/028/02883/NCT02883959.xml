	<brief_summary>Pain is a common problem encountered in about 60 % of critically ill patients who can communicate. Its occurrence can be related to several causes, mainly dominated by invasive procedures. Pain management is typically based on a combination of prevention, evaluation, and therapeutic agents. However, it appears important to develop adjuvant approaches. Music therapy is one of them and that has been evaluated in various medical conditions. The aim of our study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of music therapy in critically ill patients during potentially painful nursing procedures.</brief_summary>
