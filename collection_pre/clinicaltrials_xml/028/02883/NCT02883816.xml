	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to show that there is a concordance between lung disease at 13 months and the existing 9 weeks in newborn babies with cystic fibrosis asymptomatically. This will identify at the first examination at 8 weeks, newborns who have the most impaired lung function at 13 months. To meet this objective an assessment of their lung function at 9 weeks and 1 month will be performed in newborns diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.</brief_summary>
