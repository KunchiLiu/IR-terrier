	<brief_summary>The purpose is to determine the effect of mesenchymal stem cells administered at the early phase of septic shock on the evolution of organ failure assessed by SOFA score (Sepsis Organ Failure Assessment score) on day 7 (or death day or day of recovery unit exit if before day 7) compared to that observed in a group of control patients. The secondary purpose is to assess the role of heterologous mesenchymal stem cells on the occurrence and duration of failure of each organ and on the mortality at day 28 and day 90. The safety of administration will be also assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients hospitalized in recovery unit and having a very severe septic shock with community origin (≥ 2 organ failures other than hemodynamic) since less than 12 hours, will receive 10^6/kg heterologous mesenchymal stem cells in 250 ml albumin 4%, infused for 30 minutes in central venous line or 250 ml albumin 4% alone.</detailed_description>
