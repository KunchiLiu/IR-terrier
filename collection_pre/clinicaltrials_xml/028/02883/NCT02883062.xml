	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab before surgery works in treating patients with newly diagnosed, stage II-III triple negative breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or Without Atezolizumab Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Stage II-III Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test the hypothesis that the combination of chemotherapy and atezolizumab will increase tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test the hypothesis that the combination of chemotherapy and atezolizumab will increase the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of response to chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC. II. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on the immune response in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC. III. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on neoantigen-specific T cell responses in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC. IV. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on long-term clinical endpoints such as overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In both arms, within 3-6 weeks, patients undergo mastectomy or lumpectomy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
