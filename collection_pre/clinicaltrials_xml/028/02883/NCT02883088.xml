	<brief_title>Relationship Between OCT Coronary Plaque Morphology and Clinical Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is commonly caused by plaque ulceration and subsequent local thrombosis. Plaques that tend to rupture are typically characterized by a large superficial lipid pool, delimited by a thin fibrous cap and often exhibit local signs of inflammation. Such atherosclerotic lesions are commonly described as vulnerable plaques (1-4). Identification of these plaque features with imaging modalities is potentially a valid approach to identify patients at increased risk of M (5). Optical coherence tomography is capable of visualizing superficial plaque components at a high resolution (in the range of 10-15 microns) and can depict all the features of plaque vulnerability or thrombogenicity (6,7). The aim of the study is to relate presence of multiple OCT criteria of plaque vulnerability with following clinical events in a subset of coronary lesions. For this purpose all plaques in the proximal-mid portion of the left anterior descending artery will be evaluated with FD-OCT assessing the following criteria: - minimum lumen area (MLA) &lt;4 mm2: - fibrous cap minimum thickness &lt;65 µm: - lipid arc extension &gt;180°; - presence of macrophages;</detailed_description>
