	<brief_summary>A new subcutaneous infliximab formulation is being developed by Celltrion, Inc. as an alternative to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically takes less than 2 minutes. The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab would increase the treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to self-administer their therapy [Jackisch et al. 2014]. This Phase 1 randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group study is designed to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety between CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients with active CD or active UC.</brief_summary>
