	<brief_summary>The aim of this study to determinate if there is a correlation between visual acuity gain in patients who underwent a Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) corneal keratoplasty and the central thickness of the graft.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Graft Thickness on Visual Gain After Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Were included in this study eyes who underwent a DSAEK for endothelial dysfunctions indication (mainly acquired after phacoemulsification or for Fuchs dystrophy) between early 2012 and mid 2015 at CHR Metz-Thionville (Mercy Hospital) Were excluded eyes presenting pathologies (e.g. Age-Related Macular Degeneration, or diabetic macular edema) which are known to induce visual acuity decrease, non-related to the success of the graft and graft failure cases. Central graft thickness was measured in Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Topography (AS-OCT RS-3000 Nidek). Visual acuity gain was defined by the differential between pre-operative visual acuity (VA) and post operative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) obtained during post-operative visits.</detailed_description>
