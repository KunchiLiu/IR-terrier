	<brief_title>Effects of Robotic-assisted Gait Training In Non-Ambulatory Patients After Guillain-Barré Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system, which may lead to rapidly developing motor deficits, sensory deficits, autonomic dysfunction and respiratory failure. Approximately, 20.3% of patients cannot walk unaided at 4 weeks of symptom onset and 18.0% at 6 months. So, restoration and improvement of independent walk are one of major goals of GBS rehabilitation. For severely affected neurological patients, gait training using conventional therapy is technically difficult due to their motor weakness and balance problems. Robotic-assisted gait training （RAGT）is an effective alternative to treadmill therapy with partial body weight in intense gait rehabilitation after some neuropathy. And the proven reliability and safety of RAGT suggest that it may be effective for treating non-ambulatory patients after some neuropathy. In our study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAGT in non-ambulatory patients of GBS.</detailed_description>
