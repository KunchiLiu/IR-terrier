	<brief_summary>The Investigators hypothesise that asthma is not a single disease, but a syndrome resulting from several distinct underlying disease processes known as endotypes. There are approximately 30,000 genes in humans, and each gene is responsible for the production of a particular protein. Using a technique called "whole genome expression profiling" The Investigators have undertaken a small study looking at the activity of all 30,000 genes in the airway tissue of people with asthma. This work has identified 3 mutually exclusive distinct molecular patterns (endotypes) of severe asthma and has identified other potentially important molecular targets (manuscripts in preparation). In particular,the Investigators have found that 25-50% of patients have asthma associated with the activity of proteins called Th2 cytokines (Th2-high asthma). New treatments are in development that target this pathway. However, the Investigators do not know what is driving severe asthma in patients who do not express these Th2 cytokines. The aim of this study is to investigate in more detail the molecular mechanisms driving severe asthma in patients who do not express Th2 cytokines (Th2-low asthma), so that the Investigators can identify new targets for treatment in this group. To do this the Investigators will collect airway tissue via a telescope (bronchoscope), and analyse gene and protein expression in the tissue. The Investigators will then compare the molecular activity between patients with Th2-high and Th2-low asthma, and healthy control subjects (data obtained from a parallel study).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma is a very common disorder which causes a great deal of distress for patients, and occasionally results in premature death. Approximately 10% of people with asthma have severe disease which is not helped by current treatments; The Investigators need to find new treatments for these patients urgently. Patients with asthma are not all the same, but have distinct features which characterise their asthma.The Investigators therefore hypothesise that asthma is not a single disease, but a syndrome resulting from several distinct underlying disease processes known as endotypes. There are approximately 30,000 genes in humans, and each gene is responsible for the production of a particular protein. Using a technique called "whole genome expression profiling" The Investigators have undertaken a small study looking at the activity of all 30,000 genes in the airway tissue of people with asthma. This work has identified 3 mutually exclusive distinct molecular patterns (endotypes) of severe asthma and has identified other potentially important molecular targets (manuscripts in preparation).

	<criteria>1. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent and to comply with the study protocol 2. Age 1865 years at the time of informed consent 3. Severe asthma (BTS treatment step 4/5) despite intensive followup by an asthma specialist for at least 3 months 4. Diagnosis of asthma at least 12 months prior to informed consent 5. Baseline post bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 40% of predicted 6. History of asthma treatment with high doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids ( ≥1000 μg fluticasone propionate daily or equivalent (Clenil [BDP] 2000 μg, Fostair [BDP] 800 μg, fluticasone furoate 192 μg, budesonide dry powder 1600 μg, ciclesonide 640 μg), and LABA, with or without an additional controller, for at least 3 months prior to screening or previous corticosteroid optimisation (RASP workstrand 1). 7. For patients using oral corticosteroids, adherence with oral prednisolone regimen, as demonstrated by detectable serum prednisolone and evidence of suppressed cortisol within 6 hours of reported daily dose on at least one occasion during the screening period 8. Assessment according to the standards of the BTS UK Difficult Asthma Network or equivalent 9. Chest Xray or computed tomography (CT) scan obtained within 12 months prior to consent (Visit 1) or chest Xray during the screening period (prior to Visit 2) confirming the absence of other clinically significant lung disease 10. Documented history of bronchodilator reversibility response of ≥12% and ≥ 200 mL within the past 18 months, as demonstrated by any of the following: i) Documented airflow obstruction (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] &lt;70%), where FEV1 has varied by ≥ 12% either spontaneously or in response to oral corticosteroid therapy, or ii) PC20 (provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% fall in FEV1) to methacholine &lt;8 mg/mL indicating the presence of airway hyperresponsiveness, or iii) change in FEV1 by ≥ 12% and ≥200 mL after acute reversibility testing with 400 μg albuterol or 2.55 mg nebulized salbutamol Treatment with intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM]) or intraarticular corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period for any reason, including an acute exacerbation event A severe asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 4 weeks. The patient has had an exacerbation of asthma requiring the new administration of oral steroids or an increase of at least 10 mg in their usual oral prednisolone dose within the last 4 weeks defined from the last day of adjusted prednisolone therapy (such patients can rescreened &gt;4 weeks from the last exacerbation)..
