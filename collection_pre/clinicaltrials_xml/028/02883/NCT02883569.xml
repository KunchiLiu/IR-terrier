	<brief_summary>Purpose: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) between surgical and non-surgical treatment for patients with low back pain Hypothesis: There will be significant differences in surgical and non-surgical treatment effect in patients who need operation for herniated intervertebral disc and spinal stenosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Study for Surgery vs. Non-Surgery in Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Eighty percents of the total population experiences lower back pain (LBP). Prevalence of LBP is about 20 to 30%. LBP is the most frequent disease and causes a lot of the medical and social costs. Recently the traditional drug therapy, exercise therapy has been developed and various non-surgical treatments have been developed. Surgical techniques are also rapidly evolving. In Korea lumbar spine surgeries were performed in accordance with the national practice guidelines presented by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Many patients who do not meet the surgical criteria undergo the non-surgical treatment, but there is no reliable research data for a systematic and cost-effective results of non-surgical treatment. It will be a big part of the future medical expenses because there is no guideline for the expensive procedure. Contents: 1. Prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate effectiveness and efficacy between surgical vs. non-surgical treatment for optimal treatment of low back pain 2. Prospective observational clinical study for non-surgical treatment methods 3. Analysis of health insurance data 4. Comprehensive symposium 5. Provide guideline for optimal treatment of low back pain 6. The results will be used to reflect National health insurance policy Development Results: Suggestion of guideline for optimal treatment of low back pain through analysis of efficacy and effectiveness between treatments</detailed_description>
