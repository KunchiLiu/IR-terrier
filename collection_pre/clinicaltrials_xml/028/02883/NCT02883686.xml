	<brief_summary>Depression during pregnancy and postpartum is a major public health problem with adverse correlates and consequences for women and their children; although efficacious treatments for depression during pregnancy exist, few women receive such care. A widely recognized barrier to treatment engagement is the lack of effective, available care that is well aligned with women's treatment preferences. To close the gap between treatment need and receipt among depressed pregnant women, this study aims to develop and test the effectiveness of disseminating behavioral activation, an efficacious and acceptable treatment for depression, using peer delivery for pregnant women with depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mom for Moms Study: Peer Delivery of Behavioral Activation for Depression During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a 3-phase structure, the study will: (1) refine the BA intervention for delivery by peers in obstetric settings, (2) develop and test web-based peer delivery training and fidelity tools, and (3) evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and preliminary effectiveness of BA peer delivery within community-based obstetric practice settings, and consistent with an experimental therapeutics approach, test the extent to which this delivery approach engages putative targets validated in prior studies of BA and explore novel targets potentially specific to peer delivery.</detailed_description>
