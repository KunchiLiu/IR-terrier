	<brief_summary>This study explores the potential for a more rapid onset of pain relief when drug administration is performed through the epidural needle, a technique of epidural loading that provides a rapid and reliable level of labor analgesia without the disadvantages of a combined spinal-epidural, and could add a valuable new tool to anesthesiologists.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study explores the potential for a more rapid onset of pain relief when drug administration is performed through the epidural needle, a technique of epidural loading that provides a rapid and reliable level of labor analgesia without the disadvantages of a combined spinal-epidural, and could add a valuable new tool to anesthesiologists. Investigators propose to conduct a single blinded, randomized controlled trial to determine if a difference exists in the speed of onset and spread of labor analgesia between patients receiving an epidural loading dose through the epidural needle or catheter. Group 1 (Epidural Catheter Administration) participants will receive the 10 mL epidural loading dose in 5 mL increments via the epidural catheter following catheter placement (current standard practice). Group 2 (Epidural Needle Administration ) participants will receive the 10 mL epidural loading dose in 5 mL increments via the epidural needle prior to catheter placement (experimental group). Various parameters will be measured in the time after drug administration to evaluate blood pressure, heart rate, and fetal heart rate. Following delivery, the total anesthetic dose, total number of doses demanded, total number and dosage of rescue doses, and overall patient satisfaction will be recorded.</detailed_description>
