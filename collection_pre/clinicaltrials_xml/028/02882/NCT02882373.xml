	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if L-arginine can help control side effects of anti-cancer drugs such as high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and kidney problems. L-arginine is a nutritional supplement and will be compared to a placebo in this study. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups: Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. - If participant is in Group 1, they will receive L-arginine. - If participant is in Group 2, they will receive the placebo. Study Drug/Placebo Administration: Participant will receive L-arginine or the placebo as a liquid 4 times a day in between meals. The liquid will be prepared by a pharmacy. Participant should take the study drug/placebo 30 minutes before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and then again around 9 PM. The dose of the L-Arginine or the placebo may be increased if the study doctor thinks it is needed. Study Visits: One (1) time each week participant will have their blood pressure checked. This can be done at home if participant has a blood pressure monitor. The study staff will teach participant how to take their blood pressure accurately. If participant does not have a blood pressure machine, then they will need to come to the clinic 1 time each week while they are in the study. One (1) time each month blood (about Â½ teaspoon) and urine will be collected for protein testing and to check participant's kidney function. Length of Study Participation: Participant may continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to 3 months. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug/placebo if their symptoms get worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up call. Follow-Up Call: One (1) month after participant stops taking part in the study, they will be called by the study staff and asked how they are doing. This call should last about 5 minutes. This is an investigational study. L-arginine is not FDA-approved for the treatment of a specific disease or condition. Its use in this study is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
