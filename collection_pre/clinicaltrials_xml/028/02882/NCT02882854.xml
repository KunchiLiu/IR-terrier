	<brief_summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain are the most common causes of Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) discharge delay, with untreated PONV occurring in 20-30% of post-surgical patients. The effect of guanfacine (GF) administration on pain and nausea scores will be assessed with two groups. One group will receive 1 mg of GF to take orally and the other group will receive a similar appearing placebo (containing no drug) to take orally.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Guanfacine for PONV and Pain After Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain after surgery is commonly treated with narcotics which can potentiate PONV, further delaying PACU discharge. In multiple studies, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine reduce both the incidence of PONV and post-op pain, as well as requirements for postoperative analgesics. These actions are mediated via central alpha-2A receptors (A2AR). Of the A2AR agonists, guanfacine, though a weak antihypertensive agent, has the highest selectivity for the A2AR, but to date is untested for its potential to treat either PONV or post-operative pain.</detailed_description>
