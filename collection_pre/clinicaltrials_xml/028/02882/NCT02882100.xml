	<brief_summary>This study is powered to prospectively evaluate the relative effectiveness of adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV; FLUAD) in preventing influenza mortality, hospitalization, and functional decline in a nursing home population in the U.S., compared to the commercially available, standard dose trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV; Fluvirin).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SUMMARY: A random study sample of up to 1000 NHs within 75 miles of the local area of the 121 cities where the CDC performs weekly influenza surveillance (estimated N= 11,239) may be offered the opportunity for participation; the first 1000 eligible to participate and accepting the offer will be enrolled. Participating facilities will be offered vaccine education for residents and staff, but will be randomly allocated to receive aTIV (FLUAD) vaccine or usual care (TIV) vaccination for their residents. BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), including pneumonia, bronchitis, and tracheobronchitis, is the leading cause of infectious mortality and hospitalization in older adults , and nursing home (NH) residents. Pneumonia and infection often produce attenuated signs and symptoms in older adults, leading to delayed or even misdiagnosis for this population. Diagnosis is further compromised due to few and sporadic clinician visits with nursing home residents, and reduced access to radiology. LRI may or may not directly lead to hospitalization, but LRIs are associated with considerable other morbidity than can result in hospitalization, including exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases. Hospitalization rates for NH residents vary considerably between facilities, but the majority of hospitalizations occur during the 12 weeks during which influenza peaks each year. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to estimate the differences in hospitalization rates during influenza season experienced by long-stay nursing home residents, between facilities using adjuvanted trivalent vaccine vs. standard trivalent vaccine. The secondary objective is to estimate the differences in the likelihood of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) functional decline and mortality rates in the study nursing homes, and influenza outbreaks.</detailed_description>
