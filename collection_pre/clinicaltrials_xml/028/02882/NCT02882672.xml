	<brief_summary>This study aimed to determine if eight-weeks of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation could improve adiponectin and cardiovascular disease risk factors in overweight coronary heart disease patients. Patients were included in the study if: they were approved to do so following a physical, physiological and psychological test; did not take part in regular physical activity; had stable heart failure for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria included: a history of surgery within the preceding 4 months; had an unstable angina, acute phase of myocardial infarction, and/or unstable arrhythmia; had obstructive cardiomyopathy, exercise-induced ischemia or arrhythmias, uncontrolled arrhythmias, resting blood pressure more than 200/120 millimeters mercury, aortic stenosis, and/or peripheral artery disease; exercise limitations due to neuromuscular and/or musculoskeletal disease; had any health problems that prevented maximum effort on the treadmill test. Target population included of all patients with a history of myocardial infarction and diagnosis of congestive heart failure who were referred to Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Centre. 60overweight coronary heart disease patients were randomly assigned to either an eight-week, three times weekly exercise group (n=30), or a non-exercising control group (n=30). Exercise sessions took place at 60-85% of maximal heart rate, lasted 45-60 minutes and included a 10-minute warm-up, 40 minutes of aerobic exercises, consisting of stationary cycling, walking and/or jogging, flexibility, balance exercises, and weight-bearing activity and a 10-minute cool-down.</brief_summary>
