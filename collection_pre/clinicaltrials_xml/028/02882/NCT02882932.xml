	<brief_summary>Super Oxidized Solution (SOS) was used in peritonitis and results were compared by using normal saline solution in two groups. Abdominal fluid was taken to check for bacterial load after giving lavage with SOS solution and in other group normal saline. SOS is a high level disinfectant, non-flammable and no special training is required to handle it.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Evaluation of Intra-operative Peritoneal Lavage With Super Oxidized Solution and Normal Saline in Peritonitis Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim - To investigate the efficacy of super-oxidized solution (SOS) over normal saline in peritonitis. The investigators objectives are to present the potential clinical impact of intraperitoneal lavage with solutions for early recovery of the patient by reducing the infection rate. Methods - A double-blind random clinical trial was performed in 240 patients diagnosed as peritonitis at MMIMSR, Mullana, Ambala, India, from December 2014 - November 2015. Subjects were divided into 2 groups, i.e. 120 patients in the study group and 120 cases in the control group. Both the groups underwent peritoneal lavage ; the study group received SOS where as control group underwent normal saline lavage. The effectiveness of both the solutions were compared.</detailed_description>
