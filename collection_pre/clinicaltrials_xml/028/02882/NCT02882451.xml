	<brief_summary>Pinaverium bromide can be used to treat symptoms related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional disorders of the biliary tract. In this study, pinaverium bromide was compared with Vitamin C for the facilitation of bile duct cannulation in patients. The primary outcome was successful deep bile duct cannulation. The second outcome was the major papillary orifice, bile juice flow from the papilla, time to achieve deep bile duct cannulation, and fluoroscopy time for deep bile duct cannulation in the pinaverium bromide group versus Vitamin C group.</brief_summary>
