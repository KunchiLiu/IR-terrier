	<brief_title>Parent Behavioral Training for Disruptive Behaviors in Tourette Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disruptive behaviors occur in 80% of children with Tourette Syndrome, and can be more disabling than the tics themselves. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a parent training program to control disruptive behaviors in children with Tourette Syndrome. In addition, social cognition will be examined in all the participants to analyze its relationship with the severity of disruptive behavior and the treatment response. 42 children with Tourette Syndrome and moderate disruptive behaviors will be randomly assigned to a 10-week Parent Training Program or a 10-week Supportive Therapy. Clinical response will be evaluated after the intervention period, and three and six months later.</detailed_description>
