	<criteria>A subject is eligible for inclusion in this study if all of the following criteria apply: 1. The subject voluntarily gives written informed consent to participate in the study. 2. The subject participated in and completed study CVTCV003. 3. Sexually active women of childbearing potential must practice true abstinence from intercourse when it is in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or use two different forms of highly effective contraception. Medically acceptable forms of effective contraception include: (1) approved hormonal contraceptive (such as birth control pills), (2) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, (3) an intrauterine device (IUD), or (4) partner vasectomy. Women of child bearing potential include any females who have experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months). Males participating in the study must use a condom during the length of the study, and for at least 48 hours after discontinuing study medication. 4. The subject has not developed a concurrent illness or condition during the conduct of the previous study (including but not restricted to, sleep apnea, chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, uncontrolled systemic hypertension or left sided heart disease) that would make participation in this study detrimental to the subject's health in the opinion of the Investigator. 5. In the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the subject is able to communicate effectively with study personnel, is considered reliable, willing and likely to be cooperative with protocol requirements, including attending all study visits, and is mentally and physically capable of administering Remodulin by continuous SC infusion using a micro infusion pump. A subject is not eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: 1. The subject permanently discontinued Remodulin during study CVTCV003. 2. The subject is pregnant or lactating.</criteria>
