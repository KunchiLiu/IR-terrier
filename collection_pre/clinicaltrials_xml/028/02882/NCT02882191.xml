	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of LevoCept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase II clinical study 250 subjects will be enrolled at unto 14 centers in the US. Study Population: Pre-menopausal women ages 18 - 40, at risk for pregnancy, who are interested in using only this intrauterine contraceptive for birth control will be eligible for this study. Subjects must provide written informed consent and meet the study subject selection criteria without any exclusions as outlined in the Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP). Primary Effectiveness Outcome: The primary outcome measure is effectiveness, evaluated as the absence of pregnancy at 12 months. Safety and other outcome measures include: Study Device Placement: - Ease of placement - Placement success Safety: - Serious Adverse Events - Adverse Events Tolerability: - Bleeding and spotting patterns - Discontinuation rate and reasons for discontinuation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Between 1840 years of age at the time of study initiation; 1.1 Enrollment will be targeted for 225 subjects aged 1835 (for safety and effectiveness analyses) and an additional 25 subjects aged 3640 (for safety only) (note: all subjects will be included in the analysis for device placement and tolerability); 2. Premenopausal, as determined by regular menstrual cycle (28 ± 7 days) for the last 3 months; 2.1 Based on patient history, when not on hormonal contraceptives; 3. Sexually active with a male partner who has not had a vasectomy; 4. Reasonably expected to have to coitus at least once monthly during the study period. 5. In a mutually monogamous relationship of at least 36 months duration; 6. Seeking to avoid pregnancy for the next 12 months; 7. Willing to use the study device as the sole form of contraception; 8. Willing to accept a risk of pregnancy; 9. Normal PAP or ASCUS with negative high risk HPV test result within the appropriate screen timeframe, unless considered at risk; 10. Able and willing to comply with all study tests, procedures, assessment tools and followup; and 11. Able and willing to provide and document informed consent and Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information (PHI). 1. Known or suspected pregnancy; or at risk for pregnancy from unprotected intercourse earlier in current cycle 2. Subject who anticipates separation from her partner for more than 1 cycle within the next 12 months; 3. A previously inserted IUD that has not been removed by the time LevoCept is placed; 4. History of previous IUD complications, such as perforation, expulsion, infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) or pregnancy with IUD in place.; 5. Injection of hormonal contraceptive (e.g., DepoProvera) within the last 10 months; 5.1 Must have had 2 normal menstrual cycles since the last injection; 6. Planned use of any noncontraceptive estrogen, progesterone or testosterone any time during the 12 months of study participation; 7. Postpartum, prior to a minimum of 6 weeks or complete uterine involution; 8. Exclusively breastfeeding before return of menses; Lactating women will be excluded unless they have had have had two normal menstrual periods prior to enrollment. 8.1 Must have had 2 normal spontaneous menstrual cycles since delivery 9. Unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding (suspicious for serious condition), before evaluation; Immediately postseptic abortion or puerperal sepsis; 10. Severely heavy or painful menstrual bleeding; 11. Suspected or known cervical, uterine or ovarian cancer, or unresolved clinically significant abnormal pap smear requiring evaluation or treatment. 12. Any history of gestational trophoblastic disease with or without detectable elevated ßhCG levels, or related malignant disease without an intervening normal pregnancy; 13. Known anatomical abnormalities of the uterine cavity that may complicate IUD placement, such as: 13.1 Submucosal uterine leiomyoma 13.2 Asherman's syndrome 13.3 Pedunculated polyps 13.4 Bicornuate uterus 13.5 Didelphus or uterine septa 14. Known anatomical abnormalities of the cervix such as severe cervical stenosis, prior trachelectomy or extensive conization that, in the opinion of the investigator would prevent cervical dilation and study device placement; 15. Current or recent (within the last 3 months) pelvic infection (cervix, endometrium, or fallopian tubes), or mucopurulent cervicitis; 16. High risk for STDs (e.g., multiple sexual partners); 17. Known or suspected HIV infection or clinical AIDS; 18. Known intolerance or allergy to any component of the LevoCept system; including nickel, silicone or tantalum; 19. Currently participating or planning future participation in a research study of an investigational drug or device during the course of this investigational study; 20. Subject had LevoCept placed previously or had 2 attempts at placement; 21. Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months prior to the screening visit; 22. Any general health or behavioral condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could represent an increased risk for the subject or would render the subject less likely to provide the needed study information.</criteria>
