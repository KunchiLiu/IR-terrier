	<brief_summary>Tinea Pedis infected the feet of about 20-25% of the world population. Tinea Pedis is a fungal infection of the feet and it is easily spread. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed. The aim of this study is to prove the antifungal and antibacterial activity of Ginko Biloba (GKB) &amp; Glucosamine (GL) as separate material or both in combination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucosamine Sulphate and Ginkgo Biloba as Antifungal Activity for Treating Tinea Pedis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ginko Biloba (GKB) &amp; Glucosamine (GL) were formulated in different dosage forms such as capsules, hydrogel and spray. GKB&amp;GL were in filled in hard gelatin capsules as three formulae (GKB caps, GL caps and both as mixture in caps). Also, GKB&amp;GL were formulated in hydrogel using 2% carbopol 934 as three formulae (GKB only, GL only and both as mixture). The same also were formulated as spray using alcohol, water and glycerol in concentration of 60%, 20% and 20% respectively. The study included 5 trials, involving 35 participants. The oral formulae were tried on 30 participants having Tenia Pedis. Fluconazole was as standard antifungal drug.The antifungal activity of all gel formulae was determined by Agar well-diffusion method. It is also important to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months for local and systemic activity, to establish whether or not the infection recurred or not. In future clinical trials, research should consider the costs of the different treatment approaches.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>It is important to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months for local and systemic activity of Ginkgo Biloba and Glucosamine, to establish whether the infection recurrent or not. Larger numbers of participants having different kind of fungal infection are needed to test efficiency drug in order to produce more reliable data.</criteria>
