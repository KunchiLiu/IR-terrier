	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the study is to improve the experience for pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia inductions. The specific objective for this proposal is to establish whether the CIBA tool demonstrates inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity with the Induction Compliance Checklist.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing the Reliability and Validity of the CIBA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed research study will assess the reliability and validity of a new tool that is being used in the Department of Anesthesia (The Child Induction Behavioral Assessment tool) to grade the difficulty of patient behaviors exhibited during anesthesia inductions. The Child Induction Behavioral Assessment (CIBA) tool is more succinct than previously validated tools for assessing behavioral responses to inhalation inductions, making it practical for use in a busy clinical practice setting. Having clinicians document a patient's behavioral response to induction using the CIBA tool is useful because this information can help to optimize subsequent induction plans if the patient returns. Additionally, population data may be collected using electronic data reports for QI purposes. Prior to using data from the CIBA tool in QI initiatives, it is important to assess whether this tool is reliable and valid.</detailed_description>
