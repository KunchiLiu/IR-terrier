	<brief_summary>This clinical research study has 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. The goal of dose escalation in this clinical research study is to find the best dose of IACS-010759 that can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The goal of dose expansion in this clinical research study is to learn if the dose of IACS-010759 found in the dose escalation part of the study is the best dose to use in future studies using IACS-010759 in patients with AML. The safety and tolerability of this drug will also be studied. This is the first study using IACS-010759 in humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of IACS-010759 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you joined the study. Up to 6 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled in the dose escalation part of the study. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in dose expansion. If you are enrolled in dose escalation, the dose of IACS-010759 you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of IACS-010759. Each new group will receive a higher dose of IACS-010759 than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. A new group at a higher dose level may be started at the same time as an ongoing group receiving a lower dose. If this happens, participants will be assigned in an alternating manner between the lower dose and higher dose groups. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of IACS-010759 is found. If you are enrolled in the dose expansion part of the study, you will receive the dose level of IACS-010759 that was found to be the best dose in the escalation part of the study. In the dose expansion part of the study, 6 participants will also be enrolled in a food-effect group (described in more detail below) to help researchers understand the effects of taking the study drug with food. Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 21 days. Cycle 1 only is 28 days. You will take IACS-010759 by mouth one (1) time every day. On Day 1 of Cycle 1 only, you will take your first dose of IACS-010759 and then wait 7 days to take your next dose. Starting on Day 8 of Cycle 1, you will take the study drug every day for the next 21 days. You should take each dose with a glass of water and at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If you miss a dose, you should not take another dose until the next scheduled time. If you are enrolled in the food-effect group, you will take your first dose of IACS-010759 within 30 minutes after eating a high fat meal. You will be admitted to the hospital on Day 1 of Cycle 1 for 24 hours and on Day 8 of Cycle 1 for 7 days. This is done so that you can be checked on for any side effects. Length of Study: You may continue to take IACS-010759 for up to 12 cycles. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be able to continue receiving the study drug beyond 12 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on this study will be over after long-term follow-up (described below). Study Visits: On Days 1, 8, 14, and 28 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 8-9 teaspoons each time) will be drawn before and after the dose to test for routine, acid/base level, and PD testing. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before the dose and then 5 more times over the next 12 hours after the dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have an EKG - On Day 28 only, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy to check the status of your disease and to create a lab test to learn how well the drug works. On Days 2 and 4 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, acid/base level and PK testing. On Days 9, 10, 12 of Cycle 1: - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) and urine will be collected for routine testing before and after the dose. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before the dose and then 6 hours after the dose for PK testing. - On Day 10 only, blood (about 6 teaspoons each time) will be drawn before the dose and then 6 hours after the dose for PD testing. - On Day 10 only, you will have a physical exam. On Days 17 and 22 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your pancreas functions and for routine and acid/base level testing. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose and 6 hours after the dose. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - On Day 22 only, blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing. - On Day 22 only, you will have an EKG. On Days 1 and 21 of Cycles 2 and 3: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, acid/base level, and PK testing. °During Cycle 2 only, this blood draw will also be used to check how well your pancreas functions. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - On Day 21 of Cycle 3 only, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy. On Days 8 and 14 of Cycle 2: - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and acid/base level and PK testing. This blood draw will also be used to check how well your pancreas functions. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your pancreas functions and for routine and acid/base level testing. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. Every 2-3 cycles while you are on study, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy. If the study doctor increases your dose of study drug, the following will be performed weekly during the first cycle of the higher dose: - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and acid/base level and PK testing. This blood draw will also be used to check how well your pancreas functions. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. If the study doctor stops and re-starts your dose of study drug, the following will be performed: - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for acid/base level testing and to check how well your pancreas functions. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose and 6 hours after the dose. If the study doctor lowers your dose of study drug, the following will be performed when you start taking the lower dose: °Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose and then 6 more times over the next 72 hours after the dose. End-of-Study Visit: About 30 days after your last dose of the study drug: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy. If you are unable to return to the clinic for the visit, this testing can be performed by a local doctor and the results will be sent to the study doctor. The research nurse will call you to ask about your health. These calls should last about 5 minutes. Long-Term Follow-up: If the disease appears to be responding to the study drug, a member of the study staff will call you every 3-6 months for up to 5 years to ask how you are doing and about any side effects you may be having. Each call should last about 5 minutes. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be asked to come into the clinic for a physical exam. This is an investigational study. IACS-010759 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 48 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

Have been informed of other treatment options and is not a candidate for standard treatment options or stem cell transplant at the time of enrollment. 8. Age &gt;/= 18 years. 9. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of initiation of IACS010759 administration will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents and biological/immunebased therapies or at least 5 halflives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents. The halflife for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochures, or drugadministration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The use of chemotherapeutic or antileukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for subjects with controlled CNS leukemia at the discretion of the PI and with the agreement of the Sponsor. (2) Use of hydroxyurea for subjects with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first 2 cycles on therapy. These medications will be recorded in the casereport form. 10. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception include: 1) Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; 2) Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment; 11. #10 continued: 3) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening).
