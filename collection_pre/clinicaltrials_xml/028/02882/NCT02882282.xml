	<brief_title>Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for High Risk Oral Intra-Epithelial Neoplasias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. If you are assigned to Arm A (the control group), you will not receive treatment and will only be observed. If you are in Arm B, you will receive pembrolizumab. This is called randomization. Both you and the study doctor will know to which group you have been assigned. If you are in Arm A, you will not be able to crossover into Arm B and you will not have any study visits until the end-of-treatment/follow-up visits (described below). Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 3 weeks (21 days). If you are in Arm B, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over 30 minutes on Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of Cycles 1-4. Study Visits (Arm B Only): On Day 1 of Cycles 2-4: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - During Cycle 2, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - During Cycle 2, you will have 2 oral swabs for biomarker testing. Any blood, tissue, and oral swabs left over after study testing (including the follow-up visits described below) will be stored at MD Anderson for use in future biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers, as described in this consent form. If at anytime during the study or during follow-up you are diagnosed with oral cancer, or if you previously had oral cancer and it returns: - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - You will have oral swabs for biomarker testing. Length of Study Participation: If you are in Arm B, you may receive pembrolizumab for up to 4 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. All participants will take part in the end-of-treatment and follow-up visits. End-of-Treatment Visit: About 3 months after your first dose of study drug or randomization: - You will have a physical exam. - Your tobacco and alcohol history will be collected. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - Oral lesions will be measured and biopsied to check the status of the disease. If you had a lesion and it went away, the area where the lesion was located previously will be biopsied. - You will have 2 oral swabs collected for biomarker testing. - If you are in Arm B, urine will be collected for routine tests. - If you are in Arm B and can become pregnant, blood (about 2 teaspoons) or part of the above urine sample will be collected for a pregnancy test. Follow-Up Visits: About 6, 9, 18, 24, and 30 months after your first dose of study drug or randomization: - You will have a physical exam. - Your tobacco and alcohol history will be collected. - At 6 months only and if you are in Arm B, blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. About 12 and 36 months after your first dose of study drug or randomization: - You will have a physical exam. - Your tobacco and alcohol history will be collected. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. - You will have oral swabs collected for biomarker testing. - At 12 months only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - At 12 months only, if you have a lesion, it will be measured and biopsied. If you had a lesion and it went away, the area where the lesion was located previously will be biopsied. Long-Term Follow Up: You will be contacted (either called, mailed, or e-mailed) to check on how you are doing and your cancer status. This information may also be collected from your medical record, if needed. The study doctor will tell you how often you may be contacted. Each phone call should last about 10 minutes. This contact will continue unless you withdraw from the study. If you cannot be contacted for any reason, your family members may also be contacted to learn how you are doing. The study staff will ask you for their contact information (such as a phone number or email address). If you do not want to have your family members contacted, you do not have to give the researchers this information. This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is currently being used for research purposes in head and neck cancer. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 250 people will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histological evidence of oral intraepithelial neoplasia within 12 months prior to enrollment. Subjects with a history or clinical diagnosis suggestive of oral intraepithelial neoplasia, or patients with a history of invasive oral cancer are eligible, but must have a confirmed histological diagnosis of oral intraepithelial neoplasia before randomization. Histological evidence of oral intraepithelial neoplasia on an invasive oral cancer resection specimen is acceptable. A visible, measurable, clinical lesion (such as leukoplakia and/or erythroplakia) is not required. Only individuals with high risk profiles will be considered eligible for randomization. High risk profiles are defined as patients without a prior oral cancer and have LOH at 3p14 and/or 9p21 plus at least at one additional chromosomal site (4q,8p,11p,13q, or 17p) or patients with a prior oral cancer history and have LOH at 3p14 and/or 9p21. All high risk patients must also meet the additional eligibility criteria (29). 2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent. 3. Be &gt;/= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent for the trial. 4. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained oral biopsy. 5. Have a performance status of 02 on the ECOG Performance Scale. 6. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined: Hematological: Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt;/=1,500/mcL, Platelets &gt;/= 75,000/mcL. Hepatic: Serum total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 X ULN or Direct Bilirubin &lt;/= ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;/=2.5 X ULN 7.
