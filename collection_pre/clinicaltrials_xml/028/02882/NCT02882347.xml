	<brief_summary>Post hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a serious medical problem could lead to patient death, however, definite treatment strategy has not been established. The liver is a regenerating organ and the possibility of PHLF could be reduced when the appropriate liver regeneration is guaranteed. Portal flow has known to be important during liver regeneration. Low portal flow cannot induce proper regeneration, contrary, excessive flow increase shear stress in the hepatic sinusoid resulting liver failure. Various medications has been used in malignant liver cirrhosis to reduce portal pressure. Among them, somatostatin has been used modulating portal flow reducing portal and sinusoidal pressure. In this study, the investigators administrate somatostatin at a rate of 3.5ug/kg/hour to PHLF patients (prothrombin time &lt; 50% and serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.9mg/dl after liver resection) until recovery from liver failure. For assessment of the recovery of liver failure, the investigators evaluate aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), serum total bilirubin and prothrombin time periodically after administration of medication.</brief_summary>
