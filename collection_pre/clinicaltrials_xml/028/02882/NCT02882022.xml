	<brief_summary>This study is an investigation into the effect that CPAP has on the pressure in the middle ear. It will evaluate the middle ear pressure and ear drum appearance at multiple levels of CPAP pressure delivered via a full face mask. These measurements will be used to determine optimal levels of CPAP to affect individual's middle ear pressure, particularly those with negative middle ear pressure due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.</brief_summary>
