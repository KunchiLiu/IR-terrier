	<detailed_description>51 subjects were selected and separated into two groups: those new to the treatment (Group 1)and those who had been in treatment for more than 1 year (Group 2). There were 32 participants in group 1 and 19 in group 2. mean age for Group 1 was 41.7 and Group 2 was 50.5. The age range for Group 1 was 21 to 66 and in Group 2 34 to 73. Group 1 subjects were fitted with a Luco hybrid OSA appliance (LHOA). They were followed over a 14 day period with adjustments made to the device as required. The second study [milestone] was completed at that time. Group 2 subjects, who had previously been in treatment with the device for and mean of 4.1 years, had an initial study with the device and a second study following 48 hours without the device.
