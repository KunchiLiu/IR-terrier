	<brief_summary>The general purpose of the trial is to investigate whether metformin is taken up into the breast tumor. Studies in the last few years have shown an effect of metformin on cell proliferation on breast cancer. It is though unclear whether the effect on tumor is direct, indirect or a combination of the two. The investigators plan to: - investigate if metformin is taken up in breast cancer using our novel 11C-metformin tracer and positron emission tomography (PET) - investigate whether the uptake is correlated to the amounts of organic cation transporters (OCT1-3, MATE 1 &amp;2 and PMAT) using quantitive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).</brief_summary>
