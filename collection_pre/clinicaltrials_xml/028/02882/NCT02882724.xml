	<brief_summary>Background: It has been shown that adults with Multiple sclerosis (MS) have less leg strength than their peers, as well as impaired balance, which has led to an increased prevalence of falls in this population.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 8-weeks aquatic exercise training in balance, endurance and speed in women with MS. Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 32 women with clinically-definite relapsing-remittent MS who were registered through the Isfahan MS association volunteered for this study. They randomly selected an aquatic exercise (n = 17) and control (n = 15) groups. Aquatic exercise group completed a 8-week aquatic exercise training program consisted of three sessions per week, each session lasting 45 to 60 minutes 50 to 75 percent of their maximum heart rate reserve on 20-25 degree centigrade's, whereas the control group was instructed to maintain their current lifestyle. The balance of angry was surveyed with using of Berg analyze, speed and endurance 6 minutes walking test before starting of exercise program and after 4 weeks and at the end of 8 weeks was analyzed. The obtained data's were analyzed using analysis of variance with repeated measures.</brief_summary>
