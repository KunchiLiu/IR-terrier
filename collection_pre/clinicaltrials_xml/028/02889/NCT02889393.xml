	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether teduglutide is safe and feasible to be given for the treatment of enterocutaneous fistula (ECF). We hypothesize that the drug will be well-tolerated and will improve the volume of daily ECF output as well as improve the functional quality of life.</brief_summary>
