	<brief_summary>Psycho-behavioral disorders assessment is crucial for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). DAPHNE scientific staff have therefore developed a quantification and follow-up scale specifically dedicated to patients with FTD in current clinical practice. This scale is called DAPHNE to Disinhibition, Apathy, Perseveration, Hyper orality, Negligence and loss of Empathy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Psycho-behavioral disorders assessment is crucial for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). DAPHNE scientific staff have therefore developed a quantification and follow-up scale specifically dedicated to patients with FTD in current clinical practice. This scale is called DAPHNE to Disinhibition, Apathy, Perseveration, Hyperorality, Negligence and loss of Empathy. This study aims to validate this scale. This validation will include methodological steps required to develop a new clinical tool, by studying internal consistency, loyalty, and concurrent validity in comparison with validated existing tools. Complementarily, sensitivity and specificity will be assessed via a control population including patients with Alzheimer's disease, , progressive supranuclear palsy and bipolar disorder with cognitive disorders.</detailed_description>
