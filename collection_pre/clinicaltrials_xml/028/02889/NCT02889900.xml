	<brief_summary>This is an open label, single arm, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of cediranib and olaparib tablets in platinum-resistant relapsed high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy and who do not carry deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Cediranib in Combination With Olaparib in Patients With Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will recruit approximately 100 patients aged ≥18 years, with histologically proven diagnosis of platinum-resistant relapsed high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have received at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy, and who do not carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation. All patients should have recurrent platinum resistant disease. All patients should have received prior antiangiogenic treatment e.g. bevacizumab, either in a first line or a recurrent setting. To be eligible to enter the study, all patients should have measurable disease (as assessed by the Investigator) There is no maximum duration for taking the study treatments (cediranib+olaparib). Patients should continue on study treatments until objective radiological disease progression, as defined by RECIST version 1.1 guidelines, or they meet other discontinuation criteria. Following discontinuation of study treatment patients will be followed for disease progression (if they have not already progressed), survival and post-progression anti cancer therapies until the data cut-off for the final OS analysis, approximately 12 months after enrolment of the last patient.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent, and to comply with the requirements of the protocol 2. Females aged ≥18 years with previous histologically proven diagnosis of high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma 3. No evidence of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes 4. Recurrent platinumresistant disease, defined as radiological evidence of disease recurrence within 6 months of the last receipt of platinumbased chemotherapy. Patients with platinum refractory disease are not eligible 5. CT/MRI evidence of measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 defined as at least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 7. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks 8. Prior receipt of antiangiogenic treatment e.g. bevacizumab in first line or recurrent setting 9. At least three prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Only one prior nonplatinum treatment is allowed 10. Confirmation of the availability tumor sample from the primary or recurrent cancer must be provided 11. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function 12. Adequately controlled blood pressure 13. Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction 14. Able to swallow and retain oral medications and without gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of cediranib or olaparib 15. Postmenopausal or evidence of nonchildbearing status for women of childbearing potential as confirmed by a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to start of IPs 1. Exposure to any IP during the last 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer), prior to enrollment 2. Previous treatment with PARP inhibitor. For this study, BSI201 (iniparib) is not considered as PARPi 3. Recent cancerdirected therapies: Radiotherapy (RT) within 4 weeks, chemotherapy or other systemic anticancer therapy within 4 weeks, or prior antiangiogenic treatment (e.g., bevacizumab) within 6 weeks prior to starting treatment 4. Cancer antigen125 (CA125) only disease without RECIST 1.1 measurable disease 5. Major surgical procedure within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment; patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery and surgical wound should have healed prior to starting treatment 6. Clinically significant signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to starting treatment 7. History of intraabdominal abscess within 3 months prior to starting treatment 8. History of GI perforation. Patients with a history of abdominal fistula will be considered eligible if the fistula was surgically repaired, there has been no evidence of fistula for at least 6 months prior to starting treatment, and patient is deemed to be at low risk of recurrent fistula 9. Other malignancy within the last 5 years 10. Persisting ≥Grade 2 CTCAE toxicity (except alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy) from previous anticancer treatment(s) 11. Central nervous system metastases 12. Patients with any of the following: History of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to starting treatment; Unstable angina; Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with clinically significant abnormal findings; New York Heart Association functional classification of III or IV 13. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN) per institutional guidelines, or &lt;55%, if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines, for patients with the following risk factors: Prior treatment with anthracyclines; Prior treatment with trastuzumab; Prior central thoracic RT, including exposure of heart to therapeutic doses of ionizing RT; History of myocardial infarction within 612 months prior to start of IPs; Prior history of other significant impaired cardiac function 14. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months 15. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness 16. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ treatmentrelated acute myeloid leukemia (tAML) or with features suggestive of MDS/AML 17. Concomitant use of known strong and moderated CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers</criteria>
