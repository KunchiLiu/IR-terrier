	<brief_summary>GRAIL is using deep sequencing of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to develop assays to detect cancer early in blood. The purpose of this study is to collect biological samples from donors with a new diagnosis of cancer (blood and tumor tissue) and from donors who do not have a diagnosis of cancer (blood) in order to characterize the population heterogeneity in cancer and non-cancer subjects and to develop models for distinguishing cancer from non-cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study with collection of de-identified biospecimens and clinical data from at least 10,000 participants from clinical networks in the United States. The study will enroll at least 7000 cancer subjects with multiple solid tumor types (the CANCER arm) and at least 3000 representative subjects without a clinical diagnosis of cancer (the NON-CANCER arm). Cancer subjects with a new diagnosis and no prior systemic therapy will be recruited. Clinical data relevant to cancer status are collected from all participants and their medical record at baseline, and subsequently from the medical record at intermittent future time points, at least annually for up to 5 years. The study test(s) to be used in this protocol are next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay(s) that are under investigation and development at GRAIL.</detailed_description>
