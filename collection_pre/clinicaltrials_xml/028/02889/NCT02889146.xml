	<brief_title>Progressive Mobility Program and Technology to Improve the Level of Physical Activity and Functionality of ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evolution of treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has increased the survival and morbidity post hospital. Functional disability in these patients has its main factor in the weakness and loss of muscle mass, which is the major complications reported by these patients. The most negative result in long-term post ICU is the impact on quality of life and functional decline due to muscle disorders and fitness. This is achieved by the period of inactivity and prolonged rest, leading to losses and changes in various body systems. Given these facts, interventions for greater mobility in bed and out of it are very important. Early mobility programs has proved beneficial, however, as in other types of rehabilitation, the exercises should be prescribed with its specific characteristics, including the intensity. However, little has been described in the researches abut the activity level in the ICU, and using a quantitative measure. The use of technology seems to facilitate the offering of this type of therapy, supplying the limitations. Therefore, there are little evidences about these topics and randomized controlled studies to investigate these factors.</detailed_description>
