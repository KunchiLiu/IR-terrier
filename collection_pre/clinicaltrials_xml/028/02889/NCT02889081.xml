	<brief_summary>The study is a prospective birth cohort study and the purpose is to describe the status of maternal key nutrients(eg. folate and vitamin D) supplementation among pregnancies at early gestation in Shanghai, to find out the association between the level of serum key nutrients and atopic dermatitis (AD) in offsprings during 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal Key Nutritional Factors and Offspring's Atopic Dermatitis (MKNFOAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study based on Shanghai pregnancy population is a prospective birth cohort. The investigators obtain the data of participants' folic acid and vitamin D supplement intake through the questionnaire at 12-14 gestational weeks. And the investigators collect participants' blood samples during gestation to directly detect the biological exposure levels of folate and vitamin D. In the follow-up, skin barrier function is evaluated at time of infant 24-48 hours, 42 days and 6 months. During 6 months from birth, the incidence of AD is investigated on offsprings. This cohort study is aimed to (1) clarify the association between prenatal key nutrients with offspring AD; (2) assess the role of maternal key nutrients in the skin barrier of offsprings. It will be a good evidence for the AD prevention and a meaningful protocol to reduce the incidence of AD by its unique design.Univariate and multivariate association analyses will be performed to identify risk factors to AD by using multivariate logistic regression model.</detailed_description>
