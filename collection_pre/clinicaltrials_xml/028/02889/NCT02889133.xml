	<brief_summary>Primary Hypothesis - The 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery of units obtained from donors exhibiting iron-deficient erythropoiesis will not meet FDA standards for clinical use. - The 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery of units obtained after intravenous iron repletion will improve significantly and will meet FDA standards for clinical use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Iron Deficiency Study - Red Blood Cells From Iron-deficient Donors: Recovery and Storage Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency is common among regular blood donors, but the recovery and quality of red blood cell (RBC) units from iron-deficient donors has not been rigorously examined. Evidence from both animal and human studies indicate that when the iron supply for erythropoiesis is inadequate, the RBCs produced have multiple metabolic defects that impair their ability to tolerate refrigerated storage. Studies in a mouse model demonstrated decreased post-transfusion recovery of refrigerator-stored RBCs obtained from iron-deficient donors. The planned studies will identify human donors at greatest risk of providing RBCs with poor post-transfusion recovery by using a combination of a decreased serum ferritin concentration and increased RBC zinc protoporphyrin, as described below. To evaluate unequivocally the role of iron deficiency in poor posttransfusion RBC recovery, intravenous iron will be used for iron repletion.</detailed_description>
