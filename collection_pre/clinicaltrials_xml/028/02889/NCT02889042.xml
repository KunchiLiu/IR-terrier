	<brief_summary>France is one of the European countries with the highest rate of death by suicide, more than 10 400 deaths each year, about 16 people out of 100 000. Although suicide mortality rate tends to fall between 1987 and 2008 the number of suicide attempts (TS) against observed by an upward trend between 2005 and 2010. However, the most important predictor of death by suicide remains the TS. Now these are primarily TS Poisoning Drug-Volunteer (IMV), especially benzodiazepines. These IMV, there have been 16% recurrence in the past year and 21% at 4 years among hospitalized patients. Or a Health Barometer 2005 survey showed that 58% of respondents with a TS over the last 12 months had not been hospitalized. This type of acting out, especially the repeated IMV (IMVr) is underestimated epidemiologically because it is an unknown phenomenon and too little screened by health professionals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeated Voluntary Drug Intoxication (IMVr): Characterization of a New Addictive Behavior by Clinical Phenotyping and Functional Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IMVr constitute severe behavior disorder, chronic and costly given the multiple prescriptions, hospital admissions, including emergencies, and repeated treatment failures, in the absence of specific treatment of psychopathological problematic background. Indeed many arguments lead to evoke the existence of a functioning underlying addictive type, rather than a problem of suicide, especially from the second recurrence (often characterized by low lethality and suicidal intentionality). This impulsive behavior and / or compulsive repeatedly would not simply the consequence of a pharmacological benzodiazepine dependence (it is also not systematic), but would demonstrate a similar operation to that of behavioral addictions. Furthermore, a preliminary study has shown that this type of behavior was not limited to a BPD personality type, since it is mainly found pathological personalities depressive and avoidant types. In this context it is urgent to make an accurate characterization of these patients IMVr because the integration of the addictive dimension in their care will adapt strategies psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, and the terms of issue of psychotropic and especially benzodiazepines .</detailed_description>
