	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the potential for improving balance for a single individual with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The participant will engage in supervised therapy using commercial games on the Xbox Kinect. This study will also evaluate the viability of improving cardiovascular fitness using this intervention as well. The investigators hypothesize that balance improvements will occur and that using the Xbox Kinect is a viable way of improving cardiovascular fitness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using the Xbox Kinect for Chronic TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various forms of virtual reality (VR) training have been recently used for rehabilitation of neurological impairments including postural stability and coordination. Virtual reality training has also been shown to increase motivation and attention through its use of novel goal-directed challenges. The Xbox Kinect gaming system allows the Veteran to perform challenging full-body and goal-oriented activities. Balance improvements using laboratory developed games have been demonstrated in those with a history of TBI. However, the investigators are specifically interested if improvements can be made using commercial games which can be utilized in physical therapy clinics more readily. Exercise gaming has been shown to provide adequate intensity exercise to improve heart health in the healthy population. However, such benefits have not yet been investigated using the Xbox Kinect for individuals with a history of TBI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A male or female Veteran participant must have sustained traumatic brain injury greater than 1 year prior to baseline assessments Veteran will be between the ages of 18 and 65 years old Veterans with any cardiac condition that may cause sudden decompensation during cardiovascular testing and training (e.g., severe congestive heart failure and uncontrolled hypertension) If Veteran has a significant cardiac history (as defined by American College of Sports Medicine), physician approval will be acquired prior to cardiac stress tests Veterans with a previous history of behavioral impairments (e.g., aggression or inappropriate actions) that would preclude participation in standard physical therapy Veterans with lower extremity amputation Veterans that exhibit greater than mild cognitive impairments as shown by a score 17/30 or less on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Veterans that are unable to stand unsupported for at least 2 minutes Veterans that are unable to ambulate on treadmill with bilateral hand support</criteria>
