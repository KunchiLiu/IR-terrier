	<brief_title>Relationship Between Sensory Processing and Motor Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to analyse correlation between the sensory processing and motor development in preterm infants. A total of 60 infants who were born preterm (n=30) and term (n=30), the corrected and chronological ages between 10-12 months, were included in this study. Test of Sensory Function in Infants was used to evaluate sensory processing, and Alberta Infant Motor Scale was used to evaluate motor development.Spearman correlation test indicated strong positive relation between sensory processing and motor development in preterm infants. Given the relationship between sensory processing and motor development in preterm group, for effective implementation of physiotherapy assessments and interventions, it was thought that it is necessary to evaluate the sensory processing as well as the motor development in preterm infants.</detailed_description>
