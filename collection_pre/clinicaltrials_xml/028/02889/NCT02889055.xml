	<brief_summary>Current recommendations for the conduct of sédationanalgésie ICU encourage the use of the lightest possible sedation strategies, avoiding the administration of benzodiazepines source of longer durations of ventilation and ICU stay of syndrome cessation, mental confusion. Among the proposed alternatives, administration of halogenated volatile agents (sevoflurane) in resuscitation is interesting because their favorable pharmacokinetic even after prolonged administration: no tachyphylaxis, rapid clearance, no withdrawal syndrome. There are two suitable delivery devices sevoflurane in intensive care, both with CE marking. The device Mirus ™ (Pall Medical, Fribourg, Switzerland) is the newest and it is easy to use and reliable. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of Mirus ™ device in trauma resuscitation and cardiovascular resuscitation. Specifically, it will use this modality in case of failure with conventional sedation products (propofol, midazolam): maximum permissible doses, sedation weaning failure due to severe agitation.</brief_summary>
