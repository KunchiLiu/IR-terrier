	<detailed_description>Very few literatures reported the clinical use of microbiota or bacteria for brain diseases. The most effective strategy for reconstruction of gut microbiota should be fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMT for epilepsy. Patients were diagnosed as epilepsy by electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI and clinical data when the study began and then were randomly assigned to groups that received single FMT with fecal from healthy donors or placebo with equal water. Patients (blinded) were required to stop antiepileptic drugs after FMT and the follow up last for 6 months.The primary outcome measure was the frequency of the seizures. Secondary outcome measure were the examination of EEG and MRI.</detailed_description>
