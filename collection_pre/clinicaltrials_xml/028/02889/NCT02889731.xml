	<brief_summary>Background: Suicides by jumping from the high buildings of acute hospitals are dramatic events which are highly traumatizing to families, staff and fellow pts. In the 10 years from1995 to 2010 the investigators have counted 10 suicide cases despite extensive measures taken to predict and avoid them. The investigators hypothesized that constructive measures at the windows that would render access more difficult could discourage spontaneous suicidal behaviour and would reduce the suicide rates. Intervention: Starting in 6/2004, a 20 mm diameter metal guard-rail (which resists 250kg) was installed at each window of a 360 bed acute hospital at a height of 113cm, 18cm above the window parapet with the aim to visually, psychologically and physically discourage potential suicidal impulses.</brief_summary>
