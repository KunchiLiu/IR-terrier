	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter retrospective study in good prognosis Chinese patients. Data will be collected from infertile women who underwent first in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (Cetrotide) protocol at about 4 IVF centers to investigate the factors associated with clinical pregnancy rate. The definition of the good prognosis subjects is, age not more than 35 years old, Baseline serum Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level no more than 10 milliinternational units (mIU)/milliliter (ml), Body mass index (BMI) not more than 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), previously underwent no more than 3 IVF/ICSI cycles, and the total dose of Gonadotropin used no more than 2500 IU in current cycle. No intervention(s) will be administered on the subjects. Data required to investigate the factors associated with the pregnancy outcome of GnRH antagonist IVF cycle will be collected from the subjects' medical records into database through electronic data capture system and analyzed.</brief_summary>
