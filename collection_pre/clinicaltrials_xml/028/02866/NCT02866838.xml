	<brief_summary>Novel, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) target selected players in the coagulation cascade as the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa-inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication of NOAC treatment (NOAC-ICH). Outcome of NOAC-ICH can be devastating and is a major cause of death and disability. There is no proven treatment for NOAC-ICH. Hematoma expansion (HE) is associated with unfavorable outcome. Tranexamic acid (TA) is an anti-fibrinolytic drug that is used in a number of bleeding conditions other than ICH.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Acute intracerebral hemorrhage (symptom onset &lt;12h) Prior treatment with a novel direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban; last intake &lt;48hours or proven NOAC activity by relevant coagulation assays) Age &gt;18 years, No upper age limit Informed consent has been received in accordance to local ethics committee requirements Severe premorbid disability (modified Rankin scale &gt;4) Anticoagulation with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (recent intake) Secondary intracerebral hemorrhage (e.g. arteriovenous malformation (AVM), tumor, trauma) Note it is not necessary for investigators to exclude underlying structural abnormality prior to enrolment, but where an underlying structural abnormality is already known, these patients should not be recruited.
