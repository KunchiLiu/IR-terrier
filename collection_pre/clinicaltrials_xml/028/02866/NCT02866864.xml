	<brief_title>Animal Allergy in Korean Veterinary Researcher</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will visit annual conference of Korean veterinary researchers. After informed consent, Korean veterinary researchers who attend their conference and agree to enrollment into this study will be asked to respond to questionnaires regarding their gender, age, underlying allergic diseases, family history of allergic diseases, occupation and it's duration, contact animal and contact duration. Subjects will also be requested to report allergic symptom, causal animal and situation of contact including veterinary service, animal experiment, pet ownership, and ingestion if subjects suffer from allergic symptom when subjects contact animal.
