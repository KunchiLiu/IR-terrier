	<brief_summary>Despite advances in early detection and treatment strategy, about 25 to 40% of patients treated for breast cancer develop metastasis. Some patients are in a therapeutic impasse situation. It is therefore necessary to consider all possible options. The Estramustine showed encouraging results in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Given the clinical data, the answer rate of Estramustine and its impact on progression free survival deserve to be studied in earlier clinical situation. This Phase II study evaluated the efficacy of Estramustine in women with breast cancer and metastates, already treated with aromatase inhibitors and for whom this treatment has failed.</brief_summary>
