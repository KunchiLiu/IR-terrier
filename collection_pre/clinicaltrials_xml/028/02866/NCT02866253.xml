	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of pre-IVF cycles treatment with and without DHEA(Dehydroepiandrosterone) on the ovarian reserve markers, the number of oocytes obtained and IVF(in vitro fertilization) outcomes of DOR(diminished ovarian reserve) patients and the expression of BMP-15(bone morphogenetic protein 15),GDF-9（growth differentiation factor 9) and IGF-I(insulin-like growth factors-1) in follicular fluid.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>78 patients were enrolled according to the inclusion criterion. They were randomized into two groups, 40 were in DHEA group and 38 were in control group. The DHEA group received DHEA (Lab Hercules™) 25mg three times a day continuing more than 12 weeks prior to the start of IVF treatment till the day of egg collection and the control group got without any DHEA treatment. All of the IVF women patients were given CC(clomifene citrate)+HMG(human menopausal gonadotropin) protocol for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Hormonal profile including E2(estradiol),FSH(follicle-stimulating hormone) ,P(progesterone) ,LH (luteinizing hormone),T(testosterone),AFC(antral follicle account),serum and follicle AMH(anti-Mullerian hormone)levels will be repeated in follicular phase (D2 or 3) of cycle followed by an IVF treatment using CC+HMG protocol based on our standard departmental regimen. Improvement of ovarian reserve markers would be assessed by the change in serum and follicle AMH levels. Cycle characteristics including the dose of gonadotrophins use, duration of stimulation, number of oocytes obtained, number of fertilized embryos and good quality embryos will be recorded and follicular fluid will be saved for the test of DHEA-S(Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and IGF-I. BMP-15 and GDF-9 expression in the follicular fluid were detected with western blot.</detailed_description>
