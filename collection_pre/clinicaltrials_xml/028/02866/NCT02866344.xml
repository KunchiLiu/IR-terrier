	<brief_summary>This single-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial is designed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hepatic resection and microwave ablation (MWA) to determine the optimal operative intervention for the local treatment of resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases. The primary aim of this study is to test the following hypothesis: 2-year local disease control is equivalent between patients receiving the experimental therapy (MWA) and patients receiving the standard therapy (hepatic resection) as treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastases determined to be resectable by radiographic imaging. Secondarily, the investigators expect that 2-year intrahepatic (regional) and metastatic disease recurrence rates are equivalent between the two treatment arms in this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (diagnosed at the time of colon or rectal resection or on endoscopic biopsy) with liver metastases (by liver biopsy or by history of biopsyproven colon/rectal cancer with characteristic imaging findings): Imaging showing typical features of colorectal cancer liver metastasis; Cytologic/histologic diagnosis of colorectal cancer or colorectal cancer liver metastasis. No more than 3 hepatic metastatic lesions noted on preoperative imaging No lesion greater than 5 cm in maximal dimension Adequate clinical condition to undergo laparoscopic or robotassisted laparoscopic liver resection or microwave ablation as treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastases Willing and able to give informed consent Radiologic (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) evidence of invasion into major portal/hepatic venous branches and no extrahepatic metastases Evidence of recurrent disease adjacent to a previous ablation or resection site Severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance of &lt;40 mL/min) Pregnant or nursing women</criteria>
