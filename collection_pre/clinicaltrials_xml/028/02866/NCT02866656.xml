	<brief_summary>In the present study, by evaluating the efficacy and safety of low intensity ultrasonic on ASO, to explore the noninvasive auxiliary treatment of ASO. 90 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: A)control group, patients were given Conventional conservative treatment; B）treatment group, patients were given Conventional conservative treatment and low intensity ultrasonic treatment ; Treatments last for 4 weeks, three times a week, stimulation was given 8 minutes every time, location of treatment were lower limb ischemia area and its surrounding tissues; outcome indicators were recorded Before and 4 weeks after the trial, The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), ankle brachial ratio, the farthest distance Walking, percutaneous tissue oxygen tension, tissue oxygenation index recovery time, local skin temperature, ultrasonic blood vessels, and muscle enzymes, hepatic and kidney function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Research of Low Intensity Continuous Ultrasonic on Lower Limb Arteriosclerosis Occlusion（ASO） Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound is a form of sound whose frequency is higher than the natural audible range for humans (&gt; 20 kHz) and ultrasonography has been widely used as diagnostic devices for several decades. In addition to diagnostic purposes, ultrasound is clinically used for therapeutic applications, including tumor ablation, thrombolysis, bone regeneration, and facilitated drug delivery. Recently, therapeutic angiogenic effects of low-intensity ultrasound have been reported in endothelial cells, chick chorioallantoic membrane, and a rat model of hind limb ischemia. the investigators hypothesis low-intensity ultrasound can improve the ailment of ASO. In the present study, by evaluating the efficacy and safety of low intensity ultrasonic on ASO, to explore the noninvasive auxiliary treatment of ASO. 90 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: A)control group，patients were given Conventional conservative treatment: B）treatment group，patients were given Conventional conservative treatment and low intensity ultrasonic treatment; Treatments last for 4 weeks, three times a week, stimulation was given 8 minutes every time, location of treatment were lower limb ischemia area and its surrounding tissues；outcome indicators were recorded Before and 4 weeks after the trial, The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), ankle brachial ratio, the farthest distance Walking, percutaneous tissue oxygen tension, tissue oxygenation index recovery time, local skin temperature, ultrasonic blood vessels, and muscle enzymes, hepatic and kidney function. the investigators speculate after 4 weeks of Low intensity ultrasonic treatment, all the observation index of ASO patients can be improved; meanwhile, creatine kinase, liver and kidney function, blood in urine routine, electrocardiogram (ecg) has no obvious change.</detailed_description>
