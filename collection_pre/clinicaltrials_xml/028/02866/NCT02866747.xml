	<brief_summary>This study is a phase I/II, national, multicenter, open-label study starting with a Phase I part followed by a Phase II part. The phase I part of the study aims to evaluate the safety of the association of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hFSRT) and the anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab immunotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. A maximum number of 12 patients will be enrolled in this phase I part. Once the recommended combination schema will be declared, patients will be enrolled in the Phase II part of the study in order to evaluate the efficacy (local control rate) of the combined treatment in recurrent glioblastoma. In this Phase II part, patients will be assigned by randomization to one of the two following arms: - Arm A (control arm): Radiation therapy alone (17 patients) - Arm B (Experimental arm): Combined treatment with Anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab (33 patients)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 years at time of study entry. 2. Previous histopathologic confirmation of glioblastoma. 3. Any line of recurrence of glioblastoma proven by contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) within 28 days prior to the first fraction of radiotherapy (RT), per modified Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria. Note: Recurrence is defined as progression following therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, radiation, second surgery). 4. Recurrent nodule of an histologically confirmed diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV malignant glioma (Glioblastoma) occurring in or out the previous irradiation fields. 5. Recurrent disease documented by MRI evidence with a size of the recurrence evaluated on T1 postgadolinium sequence ≤35mm. 6. Patient for which a reirradiation (by hFSRT) has been decided by the multidisciplinary medical board. 7. Patients with measurable disease. 8. Prior radiotherapy must be ended at least 12 weeks before the first fraction of RT (unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or histopathologic confirmation of unequivocal tumor to eliminate pseudoprogression images according to RANO recommendations). 9. In case of previous antiVascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) targeted therapy: at least 28 days between the last injection of antiVEGF/VEGFR targeted therapy and the first fraction of RT. 10. Karnofsky performance status ≥70. 11. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function, as defined below: Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/mm3 Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (for patient with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome, Total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min, using the CockcroftGault formula: Female CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kilograms (kg) x 0.85 /72 x serum creatinine in milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) Male CrCl = (140 age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00/72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL 12. Female Patients must either be of nonreproductive potential (i.e., postmenopausal by history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause; or history of hysterectomy, or history of bilateral tubal ligation, or history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry. 13. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (e.g., Social security for France (Health Insurance)) obtained from the patient prior performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations. 14. Patient willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. 1. Multifocal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) recurrence. 2. Distance between tumor and optic ways including chiasma or brainstem &lt;1 cm. 3. Prior reirradiation. 4. Prior exposure to Durvalumab or other antiProgrammed cell death 1(PD1), antiProgrammed deathligand 1(PDL1), anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibodies. 5. Patient who received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first fraction of RT. 6. Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) within 28 days prior to the first fraction of RT. 7. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first fraction of RT (exception: systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent are allowed as well as steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan premedication) Topical, inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic steroids are not prohibited). 8. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Fridericia's Correction 9. Presence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease or extracranial disease. 10. Active suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease (including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Note: participants with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger, are permitted to enroll. 11. Known primary immunodeficiency or active Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 12. Known active or chronic viral hepatitis or history of any type of hepatitis within the last 6 months indicated by positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV sAG) or hepatitis C virus antibody. 13. History of organ transplant requiring use of immunosuppressive medication. 14. History of active tuberculosis. 15. Current pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease. 16. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses. 17. Other invasive malignancy within 2 years prior to entry into the study, except for those treated with surgical therapy only. 18. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the study drug. 19. Any prior Grade ≥ 3 immunerelated adverse event (irAE) or any prior corticosteroidrefractory irAE. 20. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational product within 4 weeks prior to the first fraction of RT. 21. Participation in any other clinical trial which delivered a dose &gt;60 Gy for the primotreatment for glioblastoma. 22. Female patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not employing highly effective method of birth control. 23. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, is likely to prevent the patient from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may put the patient at unacceptable risk. 24. Mental impairment (psychiatric illness/social situations) that may compromise the ability of the patient to give informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study. 25. Patient who has forfeited his/her freedom by administrative or legal award or who is under guardianship.</criteria>
