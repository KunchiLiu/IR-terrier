	<brief_summary>This study will provide important evidence to the Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health (MCDMCH) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) on how to effectively implement iCCM with a focus on improving both the flow of supplies to CHWs as well as the quality of their supervision and mentorship. The overall aim will be to determine whether improvements in supplies for community health workers (CHWs) and strengthened supervision result in improved early and appropriate treatment for children with malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea in rural Zambia when compared to CHWs offering iCCM without this logistics and supervision support.</brief_summary>
