	<brief_summary>The trial enrolls patients undergoing a complex cardiac surgery. The primary goal of the trial is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic dose response relationship of the monoclonal antibody IFX-1 in these patients. In addition, this trial further aims to characterize the safety and the pharmacokinetics of IFX-1 as well as to collect first data on its efficacy on clinical surrogate endpoints.</brief_summary>
