	<brief_summary>Traveler's diarrhoea or turista is the most common disease in travelers. It has been reported based on studies in 20 to 60% of travelers, depending among other conditions and travel destinations. Currently, less than 30% of the etiology of diarrhoea is identified by bacteriological v,irological and parasitology traditional techniques. This ignorance of the diarrhoea etiology causes difficulties in the establishment of a specific and rapid management in this extremely common condition and having a significant cost to society. Technological advances in laboratory diagnosis, such as quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), can allow us now to improve the etiological diagnosis of traveler's diarrhoea using simple rectal swabs. So, the principal objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a new diagnosis strategy in order to establissh the etiological diagnosis of traveler's diarrhoea. The hypothesis consists in improving the number of patients with a confirmed etiological diagnosis of traveler's diarrhoea by 5%.</brief_summary>
