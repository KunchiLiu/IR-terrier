	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is a leading cause of infertility due to anovulation. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are considered as first line medical therapy to regularize menses in woman with PCOS. However they may worsen the metabolic profile of patients by elevating insulin resistance which is already deranged in PCOS. As there is higher prevalence of insulin resistance in Indian women with PCOS, insulin sensitisers like metformin may be more beneficial. Hence this study is undertaken to compare the combined effect of metformin and OCPs on the clinical, hormonal, metabolic and ovarian ultrasonographic characteristics in patients with PCOS and to evaluate whether this combination of drugs is more advantageous than OCPs or metformin alone in improving the clinical and metabolic profile.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of OCP and Metformin on Clinical, Hormonal, Metabolic and Ultrasonographic Characteristics in PCOS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim to enroll about 120 patients fulfilling the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS in our study. Patients will have a baseline clinical examination (Body weight, Body mass index, Waist circumference, Hirsutism score), hormonal profile (FSH, LH, fasting Insulin/glucose ratio, DHEAS, testosterone levels), metabolic profile (fasting and 2 hour post prandial plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides level), ultrasound examination (ovarian volume and subcapsular follicle count, stromal echogenicity) and doppler blood flow study (ovarian stromal velocity, Pulsatility index, Resistivity index, Systolic/Diastolic ratio and stromal vascularization index). Patients will be then randomized using a computer generated randomization program into two groups according to BMI (&lt;25 and &gt;25). The randomization will be stratified in order to achieve a homogenous distribution of PCOS patients in both arms of the study with respect to age and body mass index. Each group will be further subdivided into three treatment arms. 1st treatment arm will receive OCP containing 35 microgram ethinyl estradiol and 2 mg cyproterone acetate cyclically (21 days regimen) daily; 2nd treatment arm will receive OCP containing 35 microgram ethinyl estradiol and 2 mg cyproterone acetate cyclically (21 days regimen) while the 3rd treatment arm will receive OCP plus metformin 500 mg twice daily for a period of six months. Each patient will be asked to keep a diary of her menstrual periods over the study period. The patients will be followed up at 3 and 6 months of treatment to evaluate the changes in the above mentioned parameters. Analysis of the data will be done through descriptive and perceptive statistical methods by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software.</detailed_description>
