	<brief_summary>A barrier to initiating progestin contraceptives in the early postpartum period is the concern of interference with breastfeeding, specifically lactogenesis. In this trial, the investigators aim to add to safety data on the effects of immediate insertion of the contraceptive implant on breastfeeding. The investigators seek to examine the time to lactogenesis with immediate post-delivery insertion in delivery room versus insertion of a contraceptive implant in the postpartum ward prior to medical discharge. For this study, 82 consenting women will be randomized to immediate implant insertion (0-2 hours following delivery) in the delivery room or insertion of the implant following delivery in postpartum room and prior to medical discharge (24-48 hours following delivery).</brief_summary>
