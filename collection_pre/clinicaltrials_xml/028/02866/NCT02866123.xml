	<brief_summary>There are several ways to verify the correct positioning of a gastric tube. Radiography is considered the reference method. The use of ultrasonography could diminish the number of radiographies necessary. The hypothesis of this research is that gastric ultrasonography performed during insertion of the tube is a reliable examination to check the correct positioning of gastric tubes in intensive care.</brief_summary>
