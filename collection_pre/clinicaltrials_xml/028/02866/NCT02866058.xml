	<brief_title>Outcomes of Cesarean Section vs Vaginal Delivery: Instrumental Variable Adjusted Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine administrative data provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Maternal obstetrical delivery and neonatal hospitalization records provided by CIHI will be linked before analysis. The primary outcome is in-hospital perinatal mortality. The data will be analyzed by traditional multi-variate logistic regression, and the results from this analysis will be compared to the results from instrumental variable adjusted regression using the Generalized Method of Moments. The instrumental variable is the rate of cesarean delivery among women living within the same hospital catchment area. All analyses will be adjusted for maternal, infant, delivery provider, and hospital factors, as well as for clustering at the level of the delivery hospital.</detailed_description>
