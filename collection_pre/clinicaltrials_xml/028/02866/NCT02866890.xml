	<brief_summary>The Laryngeal Tube Suction Disposable( LTS-D) has recently undergone considerable structural changes in design. As these changes may influence the performance of the LTS-D relative to the old LTS-D version the investigator decided to check the new LTS-D in the pediatric version The investigator hypothesized that the LTS-D perform clinically well during general anesthesia with controlled ventilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The New Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable for Childrens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LTS-D, is a second generation supraglottic airway device, made from the medical polyvinyl chloride introduce in 2005. It is used for maintaining the airway during spontaneous and controlled ventilation during general anesthesia . It has been advocated for prehospital emergency airway management and serves as a useful tool during failed intubations The LTS-D has recently undergone considerable changes in design based on clinical studies and investigators feedback. The new LTS-D is available to adult and pediatric sizes.For childrens the devices is presented in the size 3 for patients of &lt; 155 cm (&gt; 30 Kg.), the size 2.5 for patients 125-150cm. (20-30 Kg.), the size 2 for patients of 12-25 Kg, the size 1 for patients of 5-12 Kg and the size 0 for patients &lt; 5 Kg. As these changes may influence the performance of the LTS-D relative to the old LTS-D version the investigator decided to check the new LTS-D in the pediatric version. The investigator hypothesized that the LTS-D perform clinically well during general anesthesia with controlled ventilation.</detailed_description>
