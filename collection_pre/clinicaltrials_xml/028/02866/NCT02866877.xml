	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam in critically ill patients who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patients will be evaluated for development of augmented renal clearance and the effects and duration of effects this may have on levetiracetam clearance.</brief_summary>
