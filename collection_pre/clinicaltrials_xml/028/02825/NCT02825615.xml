	<brief_summary>Purpose Two techniques of radial artery cannulation, ultrasound guided (USG) and conventional method (CM) were compared to find the better technique in general and in different hemodynamic subsets of patients. Method This is a prospective randomized, single center study of 100 patients. The details of the primary cannulation technique, number of attempts, time taken, failure and cross-over technique were recorded for three different hemodynamic subsets with Systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mm hg, 80-100 mm hg and &gt; 100 mm hg.</brief_summary>
