	<brief_summary>The investigators study aims to test the correlation between the Cascade Abrazo point-of-care testing (POCT) device (Helena Laboratories, USA) and plasma levels of apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POCT to rule out or detect relevant levels of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in real-life patients.</brief_summary>
