	<brief_title>Management of Malignant Pleural Effusion - Indwelling Pleural Catheter or Talc Pleurodesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized prospective study that will include 120 patients with malignant pleural effusion with high rate of accumulation; less than one month, The patients will be divided randomly for two groups, each group 60 patients, the first group will undergoes talc pleurodesis, the second group will undergoes Indwelling Pleural catheter insertion. The two groups will be followed up for one year, starting at the time of intervention, after 14 days of intervention, after 30 days of intervention, once monthly for one year. The patients will be evaluated according to the rate of complication; need for further intervention in each group, improvement of the quality of life, respiratory improvement, radiological evaluation based on chest Xray findings, rate and duration of admissions that are related to pleural effusion during the year of study.</detailed_description>
