HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) 7.09.0% (5375 mmol/mol) as assessed by central laboratory at screening Body mass index (BMI) below or equal to 35.0 kg/m^2 at screening Ability and willingness to take at least 3 daily mealtime insulin bolus infusions every day throughout the trial Any of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack within the past 180 days prior to the day of screening Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation known on the day of screening History of hospitalization for ketoacidosis below or equal to 180 days prior to the day of screening Treatment with any medication for the indication of diabetes or obesity other than stated in the inclusion criteria in a period of 90 days before screening Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might jeopardise a Subject's safety or compliance with the protocol</criteria>
