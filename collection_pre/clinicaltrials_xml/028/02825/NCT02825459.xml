	<brief_title>Does Abstinence From E-cigarettes Produce Withdrawal Symptoms?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: The investigators will recruit 120 individuals who are long-term daily and exclusive users of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. Participants will be asked to use their own e-cigarette as usual during the first week of the study and to then stop their use of e-cigarettes for 6 days. The total study duration will be 14 days. Participants will be instructed to continue abstinence from other tobacco and nicotine products during the entire study. The investigators will use an escalating payment system with bonuses based on breath and urine samples to encourage compliance. Every day during the study, participants will report e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette use and monitor symptoms of nicotine withdrawal via a phone call to an Interactive Voice Response system. Participants will attend 3 study visits each week to provide urine and breath samples to verify compliance, and to complete brief surveys.</detailed_description>
