	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the success rate of routine one-stage exchange for treatment of chronically infected total hip arthroplasty performed at the investigators institution, and to compare it to the current literature reporting success rate of selected one-stage exchange procedure or two-stage procedure. The secondary goal is to detect the potential prognostic factors and potential selection criteria which may influence the success rate. The tested hypothesis is following: the success rate of routine one-stage exchange is lower than that of selected one-stage or two-stage procedure</brief_summary>
