	<brief_summary>M7583 is an investigational drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies, which are cancers that form in B cells (cells that are part of the immune system). This study has been designed to assess the use of the study drug in patients with B-cell lymphomas who have tried and did not respond well (or the B-cell lymphoma came back) to at least one but not more than three types of treatment for cancer. This is a Phase I/II study, which means that it is looking at several dose levels of an investigational medication in terms of its safety and how well it is tolerated in multiple doses. The final selected dose will be tested for activity against the tumor in specific populations of lymphoma (Mantle cell lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient population In the dose escalation cohorts: Patients with pathologically confirmed B cell malignancy (i.e. DLBCL, CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL], follicular lymphoma [FL], mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Morbus Waldenström), with at least 1, but not more than 3 prior lines of therapy. In the dose expansion cohort: Patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (ABC subtype) histopathologically confirmed by gene expression profiling (GEP) tested at a central laboratory or MCL with documented overexpression of either cyclin D1 or t(11;14), with at least 1, but not more than 3 prior lines of therapy, and measurable disease according to the Cheson criteria. Life expectancy of greater than 4 months from the first dose of M7583 and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than equal to (&lt;=) 2 at Screening Adequate hematological function in the absence of transfusions defined (within 6 weeks prior to first dose of study medication) defined by white blood cell (WBC) count greater than equal to (&gt;=) 3 x 109/liter (L) with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 109/L, platelet count &gt;= 50 x 109/L, and haemoglobin &gt;=9 gram per decilitre (g/dL). Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 2.5 x ULN, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 2.5 x ULN. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than (&gt;) 45 milliliter per minute (mL/min) according to the 4component Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. (GFR [mL/min/1.73 m2] = 175 x serum creatinine (Scr)1.154 x age0.203 x 1.212 [if African American] x 0.742 [if female]). Documented disease progression (based on Cheson and Halleck criteria) after the most recent treatment regimen. The patient must also agree to pretreatment and ontreatment tumor biopsies of an affected lymph node or bone marrow aspirates if bone marrow is involved. Adult male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years. Previous exposure to any BTK inhibitor. Known central nervous system lymphoma or leukemia. History of Richter's transformation or prolymphocytic leukemia. Prior therapy with: Anticancer treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or with any other anticancer therapy within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) of trial drug treatment; (6 weeks for nitrosurea or mitomycin C). Any investigational agent within 28 days prior to C1D1 of trial drug treatment. Not recovered from toxicity due to prior therapy, to pretherapy status or Grade 1 or less (except alopecia). Received surgical intervention within 21 days prior to C1D1 of M7583 treatment or received prior allogeneic stem cell transplant or autologous bone marrow transplantation within 6 months prior to first dose of M7583. Current significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, including corrected QT duration (QTc) prolongation of &gt; 480 msec or a history of past or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or significant cardiac arrhythmia. A history of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease as follows: not fully recovered cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrolment), myocardial infarction (less than (&lt;) 6 months prior to enrolment), unstable angina or congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification Class &gt;= II). Current hypertension uncontrolled by medication. Concomitant treatment with nonpermitted drugs, including but not limited, to warfarin or other Vitamin K antagonists. Patients receiving medications, herbal supplements, or food known to be moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A within 7 days prior to the first dose of M7583, or moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A within 21 days prior to the first dose of M7583, or drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic index that cannot be stopped before the first dose of trial treatment.</criteria>
