	<brief_title>Taiwan ACE Beads for Hepatoma Embolization Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Taiwan ACE Beads used for chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads. In this study, the procedure is similar with conventional TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization). At the target vessels, radiologists will inject lipiodol with doxorubicin first, then Taiwan ACE Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of injection is also similar with conventional TACE. Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria in order to be entered into the study: A. Both genders of patients age 18 or older. B. Patients diagnosed of liver cancer (MUST meet at least ONE of the following criteria:) 1. Diagnosed via tumor biopsy by Pathologists, and confirmed by onservice physician. 2. High risk patients (Viral hepatitis B or C or cirrhotics) with typical liver cancer image appeared on more than two radiographic examinations (Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan or Angiography). 3. High risk patients (Viral hepatitis B or C cirrhotics) with evidence of enlarging image of liver cancer via more than two followup records. C. In intermediate stage by BCLC staging, tumor size between 3 to 6 centimeters, with liver function at ChildPugh class&lt;9, and is either difficult to accept an operation or reluctant to accept any operation. D. Disease can be treated by transarterial chemoembolization, and can be evaluated by Ultrasound, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT). E. Performance status ECOG 2 or less. Patient has a life expectancy of at least 3 months. If patients meet any of the following criteria they may not be entered into the study: A. major branch of portal vein has been invaded already; extrahepatic metastasis or the the other malignant tumors. B. Evidences of decompensation: Total Bilirubin&gt;2, PT prolong&gt;3 seconds, AST &gt; 500U/L, ALT&gt; 500U/L, ChildPugh classâ‰§9, refractory ascites, active bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and severe infection. C. Tumor size (diameter) larger than 6 centimeters or smaller than 3 centimeters. D. Cr&gt;2.0 mg/dL and eGFR&lt;50%. E. Allergic to iodine or other injections. F. Other main organ failure (Heart, Lung, or Kidney) G. WBC&lt;3000, ANC&lt;1500. H. Performance status ECOG of 3 or more. I. Unable to followup by ultrasound or CT scan. J. Unwilling to sign a written informed consent form. K. Pregnant women and breath feeding women. L. Patients whose blood vessel are too difficult to do Taiwan ACE Beads procedure. M. Prominent AV shunt. N. Severe atherosclerosis. O. Vasospasm or possible major vascular injury. P. Arteriovenous shunt patients, diameter larger than the size of microsphere available. Q. Collateral vascular exists and may endanger nontargeted area during arterial chemoembolization. R. Contraindications for doxorubicin. S. Number of tumors more than 3 and locate at different lobes.</criteria>
