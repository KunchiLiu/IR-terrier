	<brief_title>Use of Betashot in Children and Adults With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to explore the use of Betashot in a group of children and adults with epilepsy who are consuming their normal diets, but limiting intakes of foods high in carbohydrate and sugars. The participants will be required to drink Betashot to enable the following assessment: 1. Tolerance (side effects such as bloating or cramps) 2. Acceptability (flavour, texture, taste) 3. Compliance (how easy it is to use Betashot at the advised quantity, as part of their daily diet)</detailed_description>
