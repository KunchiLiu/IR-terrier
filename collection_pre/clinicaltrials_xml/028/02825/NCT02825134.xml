	<brief_summary>A randomized clinical trial investigating transcatheter (TAVR) versus surgical (SAVR) aortic valve replacement in patients 75 years of age or younger suffering from severe aortic valve stenosis. Study hypothesis: The clinical outcome (composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI and stroke) obtained within 1 year after TAVR is non-inferior to SAVR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Younger Low Surgical Risk Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Acquired aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common heart valve disease in the Western World with a prevalence of 2-7% at the age of &gt;65 years. If untreated, it may lead to heart failure and death. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) until recent years has been the definitive treatment for patients with severe symptomatic AS. A less invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been developed and has been a treatment of choice mostly for elderly high risk or inoperable patients. As TAVR technology is continuously evolving and improving, it may be anticipated that it will become a valuable alternative - and even the preferred choice of treatment - for younger, low-risk patients with severe aortic valve stenosis in the near future. However, to date, there is no clinical evidence that supports this hypothesis. AIM: The purpose of the study is to compare TAVR and SAVR with regard to the intra- and post-procedural morbidity and mortality rate, hospitalization length, functional capacity, quality of life, and valvular prosthesis function in younger, low risk patients with severe AS, scheduled for aortic valve replacement. POPULATION: Younger low risk patients with severe aortic valve stenosis, which are scheduled for aortic valve replacement using a bioprosthesis. Subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria, not having any exclusion criteria, and consenting to the trial will be randomized 1:1 to TAVR or SAVR with 496 patients in each group. DESIGN: The study is a randomized clinical multicenter trial. Central randomization with variable block size and stratification by gender and coronary comorbidity will be used. An independent event committee blinded to treatment allocation will adjudicate safety endpoints. Interim analysis is planned after the first 20 events included in the primary end-point (all-cause mortality, stroke or myocardial infarction). INTERVENTIONS: TAVR: Any CE-Mark approved transcatheter aortic bioprosthesis may be used in the study, and the choice is at the discretion of the local TAVR team. The transfemoral TAVR procedure may be performed under general anaesthesia, local anaesthesia/conscious sedation, or local anesthesia. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can be performed up to 30 days prior to TAVR or as a hybrid procedure. SAVR: The surgical SAVR technique follows standard protocol of the local department of cardio-thoracic surgery. The operation is performed under general anesthesia, which follows standard protocol of the department of anesthesiology. A commercial available surgical aortic bioprosthesis at the surgeons discretion will be implanted. Concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery may be performed. END POINTS: The primary endpoint is the composite rate of all-cause mortality death, myocardial infarction and stroke within one year after the procedure (VARC-2 defintions). Secondary endpoints are listed below. Follow-up will be performed after 30 days, 3 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter for a minimum of 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 75 years or younger. Severe aortic stenosis (AS) (valve area &lt;1cm2 or &lt;0.6 cm2/m2), which requires valve replacement (symptomatic with angina pectoris, dyspnea or exerciseinduced syncope or near syncope OR asymptomatic with abnormal exercise test showing symptoms on exercise clearly related to AS or systolic LV dysfunction (LVEF &lt;50%) not due to another cause.) Anticipated usage of biological aortic valve prosthesis. Low risk for conventional surgery (STS Score &lt;4%). Suitable for both SAVR and transfemoral TAVR. Life expectancy &gt;1 year after the intervention. Informed consent to participate in the study after adequate information about the study before randomization and intervention. Coronary artery disease, not suitable for both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). LVEF &lt;25% without contractile reserve during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Porcelain aorta, which prevents openheart surgery. Bicuspid valve with aorta ascendens diameter â‰¥45mm Severe femoral, iliac or aortic atherosclerosis, calcification, coarctation, aneurysm or tortuosity, which prevents transfemoral TAVR. Need for open heart surgery other than SAVR with or without CABG. Myocardial infarction within last 30 days OR percutaneous coronary intervention requiring dual antiplatelet therapy within last six months. Coronary angiogram with a SYNTAXscore &gt;22. Previous openheart surgery or previous mediastinal radiation therapy. Stroke or TIA within the last 30 days. Current endocarditis, intracardiac tumor, thrombus or vegetation. Ongoing severe infection requiring intravenous antibiotics. Unstable preprocedural condition requiring intravenous inotropes or mechanical assist device (IABP, Impella) on the day of intervention. Kidney disease requiring dialysis or severely impaired lung function (FEV1 and/or diffusion capacity &lt;40% of predicted). Allergy to heparin, iodid contrast agent, warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel.</criteria>
