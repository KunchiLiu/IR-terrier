	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the effect of Djulis-Buckwheat drink on cardiovascular protection after ingesting for 8 weeks. In addition, the correlation between the supplement and the cardiovascular disease-related gene expression is evaluated. The results will be used for the application of functional products for cardiovascular protection. Ninety subjects (age 30~65) with Prehypertension or Hypertension stage 1 will be included and randomly allocated into 3 groups: Placebo, Djulis-Buckwheat and Buckwheat. The subjects will take sample (100 ml/day) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure will be measured on week 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The blood biochemical parameters and gene expression analysis will be examined on week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (the follow up).</brief_summary>
