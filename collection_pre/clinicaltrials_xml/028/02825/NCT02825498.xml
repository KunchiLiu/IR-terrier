	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard treatment option for cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) dependent atrial flutter. We plan to perform a randomized prospective trial comparing the efficacy of contact force (CF) guided CTI ablation against catheter ablation with the operator blinded to contact force parameters.</brief_summary>
