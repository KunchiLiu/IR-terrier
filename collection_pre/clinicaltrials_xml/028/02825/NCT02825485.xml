	<brief_summary>It has previously been found that there is no correlation between degree of hydronephrosis and presence of reflux; however this is oftentimes the criteria physicians use to obtain a VCUG.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimizing the Utilization of Voiding Cystourethrography for Patients With Antenatal Hydronephrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators conducted a previous retrospective study to evaluate other possible findings on ultrasound that may better predict reflux. Investigators found that if a postnatal ultrasound showed any of the three findings of hydroureter, duplication or dysmorphic kidney, then the odds ratio of detecting reflux was 8.07 (95%CI 3.86, 16.87). The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized prospective study to validate this retrospective study. Investigators hypothesis is that patients with hydronephrosis alone will be more likely to have negative VCUG studies; hence obtaining a VCUG for this indication may not be warranted.</detailed_description>
