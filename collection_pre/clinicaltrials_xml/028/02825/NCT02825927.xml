	<detailed_description>The present study aims to investigate the effects on swallowing function of a specific rehabilitation program with oral screen in the elderly population included. The present study is a part of an on-going cross-sectional, descriptive project called SOFIA where approximately 400 elderly individuals, admitted to short-term care (from the five regions/county Dalarna, Gävleborg, Örebro, Värmland and Västerbotten in Sweden), will be included. The purpose of the overall project is to gain a broader understanding of aspects of dysphagia, eating, oral health, and quality of life and care among elderly people in short-term care facilities. In the present study, 35 elderly individuals identified with dysphagia in the overall project (swallowing capacity &lt;10ml/sec) and without known dementia will be offered to participate and to undergo oral screen training for 5 weeks. The participants' status regarding swallowing, eating, quality of life and oral health will be assessed before and immediately after the intervention and 6-months post-intervention. A control group (35 people in short-term accommodation included in the overall project, identified with dysphagia but not offered the intervention) will undergo the same assessments (at start, after 5 weeks, and 6-month post-intervention) as the intervention group regarding swallowing, eating, quality of life and oral health status. Cluster randomisation of short-term accommodation facilities will be made for those patients participating from the five regions/county to either intervention group or control group. Participants will be recruited consecutively to either the intervention- or the control group, depending on which short-term care facility they are staying at. The investigators hypothesize that oral screen rehabilitation for elderly individuals with dysphagia and with different diagnoses treated in short-term care results in improved swallowing capacity.</detailed_description>
