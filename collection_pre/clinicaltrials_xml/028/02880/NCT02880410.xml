Uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions of hypertension (systolic &gt;180 mm Hg), angina pectoris, or cardiac dysrhythmia; or recent history of intracranial hemorrhage 4. Serious infection, immunosuppression or concurrent medical condition (chronic or acute in nature) that may prevent safe participation or ability to meet followup requirements 5. Pregnancy, or planning to become pregnant 6. Patients whose physical dimensions cannot be accommodated in the MRI scanner or patients with contraindications to MRI imaging such as pacemakers, noncompatible aneurysm clips, shrapnel and other internal ferromagnetic objects 7.
