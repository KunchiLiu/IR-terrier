	<brief_summary>Coronary revascularization (CR) is increasing rapidly in China and varies significantly in proportion ( PCI:CABG=15:1). Few studies assess the appropriateness of CR in China. Recently, National Center for Cardiovascular Disease organized experts to release Chinese version appropriate use criteria(C-AUC) for coronary revascularization by RAND method aimed at regulating indications of CR. The criteria is considered to contribute to clinical practices, quality assessment and health insurance policy, however, the validation of C-AUC is unknown. Thus the investigators study aims at assessing the validation of Chinese AUC by multi-center prospective registry. The investigators will recruit 4000 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography with positive outcome consecutively and collect baseline information. Sequently, one-year follow up will be done to collect the prognose, including death, rehospitalization, medicine, medical compliance and life quality etc. One hand, the investigators will compare the outcomes between different therapies in the same indications according to C-AUC to evaluate the validation of C-AUC. On the other hand, the investigators will evaluate the rationality of CAD therapy in Beijing by C-AUC.</brief_summary>
