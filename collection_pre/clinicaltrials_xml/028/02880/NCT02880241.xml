	<brief_summary>The present proof-of-concept Phase IIa study aims to confirm, in patients, the observed activity of MMV390048 against P. falciparum in pre-clinical models and the human Induced Blood-Stage Malaria (IBSM) challenge model, and to determine the activity against P. vivax malaria in patients, both over 14 and 28 days. Additional aims are to characterise the safety of MMV390048 in patients. Patient safety will be monitored for up to 35 days post-dose including pharmacokinetic assessments. The study will investigate descending single doses of MMV390048 in response to results obtained in the first cohort/dose in each malaria sub-type. The results of this trial will identify active, well-tolerated doses for investigation in combination with a partner drug within a Phase IIb clinical trial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present Phase IIa study aims to confirm, in patients, the observed activity of MMV390048 against P. falciparum in pre-clinical models and the human IBSM human challenge model, and to determine the activity against P. vivax malaria in patients, both over 14 and 28 days. Additional aims are to characterise the safety of MMV390048 in patients. Patient safety will be monitored for up to 35 days post-dose including pharmacokinetic assessments. The study will investigate descending single doses of MMV390048 in response to results obtained in the first cohort/dose in each malaria sub type. The results of this trial will identify active, well tolerated doses for investigation in combination with a partner drug within a Phase IIb clinical trial. Preclinical studies using SCID mice inoculated with P. falciparum-infected red blood cells link doses and exposures to the efficacy of MMV390048.38 The active dose in the SCID model causing maximum effect (ED90) against the parasites is 1 mg/kg/day. The MPC derived from the SCID data was 39 ng/ml.39 A human dose for the treatment of P. falciparum was sought that could maintain blood concentrations above 39 ng/ml (100 nM) for 8 days. Assuming linear pharmacokinetics and based on observed data from the Phase I exploratory formulation study in human volunteers, a dose of approximately 20 mg would be estimated to achieve the pharmacodynamic target drug concentration in humans based on the preclinical efficacy data generated in the SCID mice model. For new antimalarial drugs the translation of a predicted efficacious dose from the SCID mouse to the human challenge model and in turn to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated P. vivax or P. falciparum is unknown. To minimise the risk to patients and to ensure the highest probability of success, the maximum safe dose (as determined in healthy volunteers) that maintains a toxicokinetic safety margin to the repeat dose studies was selected for the first cohort in this study. This dose is expected to exceed the predicted MPC on Day 8 and provide significant target coverage at the site of action.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Body weight between 40 kg and 90 kg inclusive Presence of P. vivax or P. falciparum monoinfection confirmed by: Fever, as defined by axillary temperature ≥37.5°C or oral/rectal/tympanic temperature ≥38°C, or history of fever in the previous 48 hours for P. vivax and 24 hours for P. falciparum and, Microscopically confirmed parasite infection: 1,000 to 40,000 asexual parasite count/µL blood Written informed consent provided by the patient in accordance with local practice. If the patient is unable to write, witnessed consent is permitted according to local ethical considerations. Ability to swallow oral medication The patient is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned Willing to be hospitalized for at least 72 hours or until malarial parasites are not detected by microscopy on 2 consecutive occasions whichever comes later and return to clinic for all followup visits Women must be of nonchildbearing potential (WNCBP) as per one of the following definitions: postmenopausal defined as having ageappropriate, natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea for at least 12 months prior to screening in the absence of an alternative medical cause for the amenorrhea, or premenopausal with irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy at least 6 months prior to screening (as determined by subject medical history) Sexually active men must agree to comply with strict appropriate contraception rules (barrier contraception, e.g. condom) or complete abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. The contraception coverage in this situation should ensure full elimination of MMV390048, i.e. until 120 days after MMV390048 administration to the enrolled male patient (covering a full sperm cycle of 90 days starting after 5 x t½ of the drug). Abstinent patients must agree to use the abovementioned contraceptive methods if they start sexual relationships during the study, and to continue these methods until 120 days after study medication.
