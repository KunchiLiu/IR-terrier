	<brief_summary>A single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial was done to assess the periodontal status of the individuals and the presence of red complex microorganisms (RCM) such as Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas.gingivalis and Tannerella.forsythia in the subgingival tissues of periodontal pockets at baseline followed by the application of mangostana gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. The periodontal parameters and RCM were again assessed at 3rd month and compared with the placebo group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Garcinia Mangostana L.Pericarp Gel as a Local Drug Delivery in Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The study aim to assess the periodontal status of individuals and the presence of red complex microorganisms (RCM) such as Treponema denticola (T.d), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) and Tannerella forsythia (T.f) in the subgingival tissues of periodontitis subjects before and after the application of 4% mangostana gel (MGA) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. Methods: 25 sextants (MGA group) were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) and subgingival application of mangostana gel used as local drug delivery (LDD). 25 sextants (Placebo group) were treated with SRP and placebo gel. Clinical parameters were recorded and the presence of RCM were assessed at baseline and at 3rd month. Statistical Analysis: The mean probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding index, plaque index were assessed at 0th day and 3rd month and compared between the groups using one way analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA). Intra-group comparison (MGA) for the presence of T.d, from baseline to 3rd month and inter-group comparison (MGA &amp; Placebo) at 3rd month was done using Fischer exact test. In both MGA and placebo group, the presence of T.d in subgingival tissues was compared with the clinical parameters at 3rd month using student's t-test. The p â‰¤ 0.05 was chosen as a level of significance.</detailed_description>
