	<brief_summary>This prospective phase II trial study aims to optimize the increase in dose to the target volume at high risk (85 to 90 Gy over 90% of its volume) and the intermediate target volume (60 Gy to 90 % of its volume) in 3D Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy in treating patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Optimization in 3D Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The causes of treatment failure and death in cervical cancer are still often linked to a local cancer progression - The importance of local control for healing, than the cervix situation in the center of pelvis between bladder and rectum which are sensitive organs to irradiation justify the use of utero-vaginal brachytherapy - This open label, multicenter, phase II study evaluates the benefit of increasing in dose to the target volume at high risk and the intermediate target volume in 3D Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy in treating patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. - Local control and tolerance are evaluated</detailed_description>
