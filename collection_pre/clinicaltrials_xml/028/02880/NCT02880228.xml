	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma that are eligible for stem cell transplant. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Eligible for Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the very good partial response (VGPR) or better response rate (&gt;= VGPR) after 4 cycles of pembrolizumab added to standard doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone, when used as initial therapy in patients with previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) in patients, who are considered eligible for stem cell transplantation. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the &gt;= partial response (PR) rate after 4 cycles of treatment with pembrolizumab added to standard doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. II. To determine the &gt;= VGPR response rate at any time during treatment with pembrolizumab added to standard doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. III. To determine the progression free survival and overall survival among patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM following treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone. IV. To determine the toxicities associated with pembrolizumab added to standard doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM. V. To determine the success rate of stem cell collection following initial therapy with the combination of pembrolizumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed MM. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. PDL-1 expression on myeloma cells and non-tumor cell compartments from the bone marrow will be assessed at baseline. II. Measures of T-cell activation / exhaustion will be assessed at baseline and after cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 3, and cycle 4. III. Natural killer (NK) cell function and numbers will be evaluated at baseline and after cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 3, and cycle 4. OUTLINE: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 of course 1, day 15 of course 2, and day 8 of course 3. Courses 1-3 repeat beyond 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo stem cell transplantation after 4 courses of treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months or 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
