	<brief_title>A Clinical Evaluation of Propel Mini Sinus Implant Placement in the Frontal Sinus Ostia Following In-office Dilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, intra-patient controlled, multicenter trial with 50 subjects enrolled at up to 15 sites across the United States. Study subjects undergo implant placement on one side following in-office balloon dilation, while the contralateral side undergoes balloon dilation only and serves as a control.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patient has provided written informed consent using a form approved by the reviewing IRB. Patient is 18 years of age or older. Patient is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements. Patient has CRS defined as sinonasal inflammation persisting for more than 12 weeks and complains of at least 2 of the 4 following symptoms: nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion, nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion, nasal discharge (anterior/posterior), facial pain/pressure, reduction/loss of smell Postendoscopic sinus surgery, patient has bilateral obstruction of the frontal sinus ostia by scarring and/or polypoid edema. Patient is a candidate for an inoffice balloon dilation procedure. In the opinion of the investigator, treatment with the Propel Mini Sinus Implant as an adjunct to balloon sinus dilation is technically feasible and clinically indicated in the frontal sinus ostia. Expanded amount of ethmoid sinonasal polyps extending beyond the middle meatus of grade 3 or 4 unless reduced prior to randomization in the study. Oralsteroid dependent condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other conditions. Known history of allergy or intolerance to corticosteroids or mometasone furoate. Clinical evidence of acute bacterial sinusitis or invasive fungal sinusitis. Active viral illness (e.g., flu, shingles). Clinical evidence of disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to complete followup assessments through Day 180 postprocedure. Currently participating in another clinical trial.</criteria>
