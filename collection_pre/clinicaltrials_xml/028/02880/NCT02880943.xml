	<brief_title>Dose-finding, Safety and Efficacy Study of Radium-223 Dichloride (XOFIGO) in RCC Patients With Bone Metastases. (EIFFEL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, phase I/II study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the most successful dose (MSD) of XOFIGO®, in renal cancer patients with metastases to bone, without (Group A) or with (Group B) visceral metastases. Dose-finding will be performed according to the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) using either toxicity (escalation cohort) or joined toxicity-efficacy (expansion cohort) endpoints. Two groups of patients will be evaluated: - Group A: patients with bone disease mainly will be treated with XOFIGO® alone. (node and/or adrenal metastases and/or ≤5 lung metastases ≤1cm each are allowed in Group A). - Group B: patients already treated with an ongoing approved Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) for their visceral metastases will be treated with XOFIGO® for bone disease. XOFIGO® will be administered intravenously as a bolus injection every 4 weeks with a maximum of 6 administrations per patient. Four dose levels are available for evaluation : 27.5 kBq/kg, 55 kBq/kg, 88 kBq/kg and 110 kBq/kg. Starting dose for phase I will be 55 kBq/kg. Visit schedule: Selection Patients will come to the hospital at baseline, and screening assessments must be performed within 28 days prior to first XOFIGO® administration. XOFIGO® period Patients will receive an injection of XOFIGO® on Day 1 of each 4 weeks-cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients will be subject to physical examination, blood sampling and pain evaluation prior to each injection. Scintigraphy of biodistribution of radium-223 dichloride will be realised on C1D1 after the 1st injection of XOFIGO® On C1D15, patients will also come for physical examination and blood sampling. On C2D15 (end of DLT period for phase I), patients will also come for end of DLT period evaluation and will be subject to physical examination and blood sampling. Prior to C3D1 and C5D1, patients will undergo WB-IRM and FNa-PET. End of treatment visit (EOT) will take place 4 weeks after the last administration of XOFIGO®. In the absence of confirmed bone progression at XOFIGO® discontinuation time, patients will continue to undergo WB-IRM and FNa-PET every 2 months until confirmed bone progression or end of follow-up. Confirmation of bone progression upon WB-IRM will be performed 4 weeks after the initial progression is observed. Follow-up Patients will be followed-up for a maximum of 12 months from the 1st administration of XOFIGO®. Number of subjects: Maximum number of patients to be enrolled in the escalation cohort is 21. Maximum number of patients to be enrolled in the expansion cohort is 21. Group A: 2-4 patients; Group B: 38-40 patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed metastatic renal cell carcinoma with a clear cell component. 2. Bone metastases upon bone scan with no CT and MRI performed any time within period of 4 weeks prior to study entry, with at least one evaluable unidimensional bone lesion (i.e., ≥1 malignant tumour mass that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension ≥ 10 mm on T1weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI]). Group A: bone metastases (lymph nodes and/or adrenal metastases, and/or ≤ 5 lung metastases of less than 1 cm each, are allowed). Group B: bone metastases AND visceral metastases upon MRI (according to revised RECIST 1.1 criteria). 3. Patient in a) first (naïve), or b) second or third line setting receiving or about to receive an approved Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (patients on mTOR inhibitors are not eligible). 4. Male or female, age ≥18 years at ICF signature time. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 6. Good or Intermediate prognostic group according to the International Metastatic Database Consortium (IMDC). 7. At least 4 weeks from the end of a previous systemic treatment, if any, with resolution of all treatmentrelated toxicity according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 grade ≤ 1 except for alopecia. 8. Palliative local treatment allowed if performed ≥ 2 weeks prior to study entry for radiotherapy, cementoplasty or minor surgery; ≥ 4 weeks prior to study entry for major surgery. 9. Adequate organ function defined by the following criteria: Absolute Neutrophils count (ANC) ≥1 500 cells/mm3 Platelets ≥100 000 cells/mm3 Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless there are liver metastases in which case AST and ALT ≤5.0 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Estimated glomerular filtration rate upon MDRD ≥ 50 mL/min Urinary protein &lt; 2+ by urine dipstick. If dipstick is ≥ 2+ then a 24hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is &lt; 2 g per 24 hours Corrected calcium ≤ 2.8 mmol/L. 10. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7days prior to treatment initiation. 11. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrolment. 12. Willingness, for men and women,to use effective contraception during study treatment and for 6 months after last dose of study drug. 13. Willingness to comply with protocol requirements. Poor prognostic group according to the IMDC. 2. Prior radiotherapy to ≥ 40% of bone marrow, whole pelvic irradiation and/or prior isotope therapy whatever the isotope (any α or βemitters). 3. Active secondary cancer including prior malignancy from which the subject has been diseasefree for ≤ 3 years (however, adequately treated superficial basal cell skin or cervical carcinoma in situ before 4 weeks prior to entry are eligible to the study). 4. Known brain or leptomeningeal involvement. 5.
