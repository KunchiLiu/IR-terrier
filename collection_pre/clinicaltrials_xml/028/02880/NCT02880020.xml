	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab works in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With or Without Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Is Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the response rate of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Ascertain the response rate of nivolumab alone and in combination of ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable GIST by Choi criteria. II. Assess the progression-free survival (PFS). III. Ascertain the clinical benefit rate (CBR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] and stable disease [SD]) of nivolumab and ipilimumab in refractory/unresectable GIST. IV. Explore the safety of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare RR and CBR in patients whose tumors are programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive (+) and PD-L1 negative (-) at baseline. II. In the patients who are PD-L1 positive, compare RR and CBR in patients with 1% and 5% tumor membrane staining. III. Determine the baseline mutational load of patients at the start of treatment. IV. Determine the response to treatment based on the baseline mutation load and baseline GIST mutations. V. Determine the response rate based on GIST mutational status. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes every 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 14 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

12 weeks Histological confirmation of GIST Mutational testing of patient samples for KIT and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) mutations; (this will not hold up starting therapy, but will be done for all patients lacking up front mutational testing) Patients must have refused or have evidence of intolerance to or progression on imatinib This study permits the reenrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pretreatment failure (i.e., subject has not been randomized / has not been treated); if reenrolled, the subject must be reconsented Adequate archival tissue must be available from the prior 3 months to signing consent; if not, an adequate tumor specimen obtained by either excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy or core needle biopsy must be sent to the central pathology lab for evaluation; the material must measure at least 0.8 × 0.1 cm in size or contain at least 100 tumor cells Measurable tumor lesions according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt;

3 × ULN Willingness to provide consent for biopsy samples; tumor biopsies will be required for all subjects, tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be lesions used as RECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy; if a RECIST target lesion is used for biopsy the lesion must be &gt;= 2 cm in longest diameter Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug Women must not be breastfeeding Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 halflives of study drug (25 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 155 days posttreatment completion Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 halflives of the study drug plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 215 days posttreatment completion; in addition, male subjects must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements; WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from contraceptive requirements, and still must undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section Male subjects must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during the entire study and for 5 halflives of study drug plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) after dosing has been completed At a minimum, subjects must agree to use one highly effective (which have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly) OR one less effective method of contraception as listed below: WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to use one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below;
