	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Criteria A Boy &gt;14yr without any sign of puberty, testis &lt;4ml BA ≥12yr Sex hormone (LH,FSH, T) are prepubertal level No other hormones problems (other pituitary glands axis are normal except gonad axis) No space occupying lesion, No tumor on MRI of pituitary and hypothalamus area Kallmann's syndrome(KS) patients may companies with dysosmia or dysplasia of olfactory bulb or olfactory tract on MRI Karyotype is 46，XY Exclude chronic diseases, malnutrition Criteria B For the boy &lt;14yr. who companies with micropenis or cryptorchid or hypospadias and they have anosmia or dysplasia of olfactory bulb/olfactory sulcus/olfactory structs on MRI include in. Criteria C As the phenotype of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are variant, some of them may have partial puberty. So, we enrolled them when they have testis volume &gt;4ml or the testosterone level 〉200ng/L，companies anosmia or dysplasia of olfactory bulb /olfactory sulcus/ olfactory structs on MRI, and the puberty arrested in half a year. These patients can be diagnosed as Kallmann Syndrome. Any ascertain reason contributes to the non puberty development (Chromosome abnormal, trauma, surgeries) or any ascertain disease such as PraderWilli syndrome or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism Systemic diseases (such as chronic kidney failure, Mediterranean anemia, poor controlled diabetes) Proteinenergy malnutrition Eating disorder (such as anorexia nervosa, binge eating) Any brain diseases history: tumors in brain or pituitary or after their surgeries</criteria>
