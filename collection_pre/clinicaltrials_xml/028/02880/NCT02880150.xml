	<brief_summary>Climbing at high altitude and tolerating hypoxic environment require specific physiological adaptations. Large intersubjects differences exist regarding the ability to adapt to high altitude and hypoxia. The present study aims to characterise the physiological responses to hypoxia in a group of elite climbers by comparison to sea level athletes. We hypothesised that elite climbers would show better physiological responses to hypoxia and more preserved performances compared to sea level.</brief_summary>
