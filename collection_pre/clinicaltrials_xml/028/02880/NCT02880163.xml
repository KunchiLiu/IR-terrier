	<criteria>1. Estimated age of 16 years or older (or subject weight estimated at greater than 50 kg if age is unknown) 2. Emergent, exsanguinating haemorrhage, from abdominal source as defined by: SBP &lt; 90 Activation of massive transfusion protocol AND Decision made to proceed to emergent laparotomy within 30 minutes of admission 3. Confirmation of abdominal haemorrhage by: Positive Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) or Diagnostic Peritoneal Aspiration (DPA) 4. The abdomen is considered the primary site of active haemorrhage 5. Subject is intubated and sedated per local guidelines 6. Decision to administer foam is made within 30 minutes of admission to the emergency department. 7. Definitive surgical care is expected to occur within three hours of foam deployment 1. Known or suspected major diaphragm injury 2. Known or suspected untreated pneumothorax 3. Known or suspected untreated hemothorax 4. Traumatic brain injury resulting in decapitation, visible brain matter or considered non‐ survivable based on initial physical exam 5. Received greater than five consecutive minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the pre‐emergency department setting 6. Known allergy to isocyanate 7. Known or suspected pregnancy 8. History of prior abdominal surgery or evidence of abdominal surgery (scars) 9. Disrupted abdominal wall that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude ResQFoam from being adequately contained within the abdominal cavity 10. Subject in whom the abdominal aortic junctional tourniquet (AAJT) or Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) techniques have been used 11. Known Prisoners 12. Subjects with burns &gt; 20% of total body surface area 13. Known Do Not Resuscitate order (DNR) or Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) 14. Enrolled in another randomized, interventional study</criteria>
