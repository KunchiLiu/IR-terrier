	<brief_summary>Chronic pain represents an important health problem responsible for decreases in quality of life, and is associated with great negative impact in society and economy. In many cases, its treatment does not reach therapeutic success causing health professionals and patients dissatisfaction. Chronic pain is also associated with somatization, hopelessness and catastrophizing thinking. These information processing includes sensorial, emotional and cognitive-appraisal thinking, which manifests the working of neural networks at cortical and sub-cortical levels. Attention is a central aspect in the processing of pain modulation. Like in addictions (e.g. smoking, alcohol), chronic pain may debut with displacement in the focus of attention and alterations in the sensorial processing in the incentive-motivation tests. Considering that other studies have indicated that experimental and clinical pain is capable of modulating cognitive activities such as attention and expectation, in this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that the presence of pain will reduce the reaction time to visual stimuli related to pain/suffering, and this bias could be modified using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of tDCS Related to Techniques in Cognitive Processing Attentional Retraining Fibromyalgia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will be included women aged between 18 and 65 years, chronic pain fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, pain unresponsive to analgesics such as paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, Carisoprodol, Zanaflex (Tizanidine) and Codeine and give informed consent to participate after initial evaluation. Primary outcome is to Evaluate whether the tDCS associated with cognitive retraining technique is able to modulate attentional bias in fibromyalgia patients. Secondary outcomes are: compare the effect of active tDCS and sham in: Assessed with the Visual Analog Scale for 8 days, Functional capacity, Conditional pain modulation (CPM), Maximal Heat Pain tolerance,Catastrophic thinking,Serum levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Beck Depression Inventory, forward and backward digit span( WAIS),Pittsburgh sleep quality and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test.</detailed_description>
