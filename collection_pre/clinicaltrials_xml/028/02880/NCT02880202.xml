	<brief_title>Impact of Massage Therapy on the Quality of Life of Hospice Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As an integrative therapy, there is growing evidence that massage therapy can be an effective therapeutic tool for relief of pain and non-pain symptoms in hospice and palliative care patients. Massage therapy can provide comfort, relaxation, and improve quality of life for patients. The primary aim of the study is to gather data on the effects of complementary massage therapy on patient's symptoms and quality of life. The study goal is to improve patient symptoms of pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life through the use of massage therapy provided to hospice patients. Questionnaires would be utilized before and after each massage intervention and would quantify symptom and quality of life levels.</detailed_description>
