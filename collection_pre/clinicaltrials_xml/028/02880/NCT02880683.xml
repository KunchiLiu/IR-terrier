	<brief_title>Cardiac Output Autonomic Stimulation Therapy for Heart Failure (COAST-HF) - Human NeuroCatheter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-center feasibility study performed in patients undergoing a planned cardiac catheterization. This study investigated the feasibility of the NeuroTronik CANS Therapyâ„¢ System to improve acute hemodynamics. Purpose-built stimulation catheters were percutaneously inserted into an upper venous structure near the heart via right femoral vein and or left subclavian vein access using standard introducers and techniques. Subjects were instrumented with left ventricular and femoral artery catheters for pressure measurement and stimulated for approximately 60 minutes. Baseline hemodynamic measures were collected before stimulation and compared to measured values during stimulation. Following completion of the protocol, all in-dwelling equipment and catheters were removed.</detailed_description>
