	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate the reproducibility of neuromuscular monitoring data of recovery from neuromuscular blockade, obtained with TOFScan速 and TOF-Watch SX速, in adult and pediatric population. Secondary purposes are to evaluate the reproducibility of data obtained with 2 monitors for: - the onset of clinical action of curare: suppression of the first response of train of four monitoring (T1) of 95% initial value - the duration of clinical action of curare: recovery of the first response of train of four monitoring (T1) to 25% initial value - recovery of first (T1), second (T2), third (T3) and fourth response (T4) of train of four monitoring, and recovery of T4/T1 to 40% and 60% initial value (T4/T1 0.4 and 0.6) - complete recovery from curarisation, at T4/T1=90% and T4/T1=100%.</brief_summary>
