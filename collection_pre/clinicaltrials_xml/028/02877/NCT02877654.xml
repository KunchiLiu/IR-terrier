	<brief_summary>Increased intestinal permeability is one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in irritable bowel syndrome. The expression of some intestinal tight junction proteins is decreased mostly in IBS-diarrhoea patients. This decrease is correlated with increased intestinal permeability. Currently, no test used in clinical practice could assess intestinal permeability. We hypothesis plasmatic zonulin could reflect intestinal permeability in IBS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is There Any Correlation Between Plasmatic Zonulin and Expression of Intestinal Tight Junction Proteins in IBS Patients?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of our study is to look for a correlation between plasmatic zonulin and increased colonic permeability (assessed by the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins by western blot) in IBS patients and to look for a role of intestinal low-grade inflammation and microbiota. Population : IBS patients with diarrhoea or IBS with constipation or mixed with worsening of symptoms Outcomes measures : Plasmatic zonulin (ELISA kit) Occludin expression in colonic biopsies (western blot)</detailed_description>
