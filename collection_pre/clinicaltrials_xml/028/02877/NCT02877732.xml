	<brief_title>EYE-TRAC Advance: Technology Verification (ETA-TV) Cohort 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes to establish the reliability of EYE-SYNC data and the utility of the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device as a sideline concussion assessment tool. The clinical research study will be conducted to 1) determine if eye-tracking, assessed on the sideline by EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device, is a potential marker of injury that can be used in conjunction with other sideline evaluations to inform decisions regarding removal of athletes from play and 2) to use the EYE-SYNC goggle data as a post- injury recovery monitor.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Both CCS and CTR must meet the following 3 criteria: Athletes between the age of 18 25yearsold. 20/30 or better eyesight (corrected vision allowed). English fluency. Control Subject: â€¢ Control Subject (CTR) a teammate of the concussed subject who did not experience impact but who was actively participating in the same sport and session along with the injured teammate at the time of injury Concussed Subject: Concussed Subject (CCS) those who experience impact where concussion is highly suspected as evidenced by impairment in any of the SCAT3 Domains: Symptoms, Physical Signs, Immediate Memory and Orientation. An Injured Athlete is concussed if he/she is FAIL on the Physical Signs, Score = 0 on the Orientation or Scoring below the cutoff scores on the Symptom Checklist and/or Immediate memory SCAT3 domains. A) Symptoms: Rating of 2 or higher on any of the following items: 1. Headaches 2. Nausea or Vomiting 3. Dizziness 4. Balance Problems 5. Blurred Vision 6. Feeling Slowed Down 7. Feeling like "in a fog" 8. "Don't feel right" B) Physical Signs: Balance (Leg Stances): Number of Error(s) on any of the following 7 subtests classifies a subject as concussed. I. Double Leg Stance: At least 3 errors II. Single Leg Stance: At least 3 errors with either dominant or nondominant foot III. Tandem Stance: At least 3 errors or more. Balance (Tandem Gait): FAIL on at least 2 of 4 trials: I. FAIL per trial: more than 14 seconds to complete a trial II. FAIL per trial, if one or more of the following errors are made 1. If step off the line; 2. Separation between heel and toe 3. Touch/grab the examiner or an object D) Orientation: Score = 0 on any of the following 5 items Date: Score = 0 (any date different from current) Month: Score = 0 (any month different from current) Day of the week: Score = 0 (any different from current) Year: Score = 0 (any different from current) Time: Score = 0 AND answer is MORE than + or 1 hour apart from the correct time. E) Immediate Memory Recall Total Score = less than 13 words recalled. Clinical diagnosis of a neurological condition including the following: Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Brain Tumor/Cancer, Nystagmus and/or Other major neurological condition. Clinical diagnosis of any of the following eyesight abnormalities: Uncorrected Amblyopia, Uncorrected Myopia, Uncorrected Presbyopia, Uncorrected Farsightedness, or Uncorrected Astigmatism. Psychiatric history with any of the following: 1. Clinical diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder lifetime 2. Clinical diagnosis of ADHD or ADD Lifetime 3. Clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder within last year 4. Clinical diagnosis of substance abuse disorder within last year 5. Clinical diagnosis of major anxiety disorder within last year MEDICATION 6. Requires use of a psychotropic medication. Cannot have participated previously in any of the ETATV study visits (for instance, a subject that has completed any study visit as a control subject cannot participate as a concussed subject at a later time point).</criteria>
