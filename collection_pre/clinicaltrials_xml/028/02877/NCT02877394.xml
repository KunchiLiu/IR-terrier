	<brief_summary>Constipation is a very common problem. Western style toilets that are nearly universal in the United States require the person to sit on the toilet. However, results from uncontrolled studies suggests that a squatting posture (as prevalent in many foreign countries) may be better at facilitating evacuation compared to a Western style commode. One uncontrolled, unpublished study suggests that a footstool improved bowel symptoms in nearly 98% of 153 constipated participants. Hence, the investigators propose to evaluate the benefits of a footstool on symptoms and anorectal functions in constipated patients. Hypothesis: the regular squatting assist device (7 inches) but not a sham device (2 inches tall) will improve symptoms of constipation.</brief_summary>

Patients who meet Rome III criteria for irritable bowel syndrome will also be eligible provided they also meet above criteria. Exclusion criteria: Current use of opioid analgesics. Patients on opioids will be allowed to participate if they have discontinued them for at least 3 days (72 hrs.) before date of screening and are willing to stay off them for the duration of the study. Current use of anticholinergics (e.g. nortriptyline, amitriptyline, hyoscyamine). Patients who use low dose tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline upto 50 mg/day or amitriptyline upto 25 mg/day ) will be eligible provided they do not increase the dose during the study period. Patients on higher doses or on other anticholinergics are eligible to participate if they can discontinue their medication at least 3 days (72 hrs) before the date of screening and are willing to stay off them till the study is complete. Current use of laxatives (MiraLax, Exlax, senna, herbal supplements), linaclotide, lubiprostone, and prucalopride to treat constipation patients using these medications will be eligible to participate if they can discontinue the medication at least 3 days (72 hrs.) before the date of screening and are willing to stay off them till the study is complete.</criteria>
