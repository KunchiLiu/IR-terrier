	<detailed_description>This is a qualitative study to determine which factors affect the patient experience of having a liver MRI, what information patients would like to receive after their MRI, and how patients would like this information communicated to them. Each individual will receive at least an MRI scan (LiverMultiScan), with many also receiving a FibroScan (Transient Elastography). Patients will then undergo a focused qualitative interview, as well as filling out a questionnaire. The interviews will be thematically analysed and trends identified by significance.</detailed_description>
