	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation of a Modified Staged Treatment Algorithm Using the AeriSeal System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AeriSeal-STAGE trial will be a prospective, multicenter study that intends to evaluate the safety of a modified staged treatment algorithm with an escalation of dose using the AeriSeal System in the treatment of subjects with severe emphysema in a controlled trial design setting as compared to published data from prior studies. The trial is anticipated to enroll fifteen (15) study subjects with homogeneous, or upper lobe predominant heterogeneous emphysema, in three (3) centers in Europe.</detailed_description>

Radiologic picture consistent with active pulmonary infection, e.g., unexplained parenchymal infiltrate 3. Significant interstitial lung disease 4. Significant pleural disease 18. Subject's baseline electrocardiogram (EKG) indicates arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities 19. Subject has high cardiac risk after undergoing cardiac risk assessment in accordance with published guidelines or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, renal failure or cerebrovascular disease 20. Clinically significant asthma (reversible airway obstruction), chronic bronchitis, or bronchiectasis 21. Allergy or sensitivity to medications required to safely perform bronchoscopy and the AeriSeal System treatment under general anesthesia or conscious sedation 22. Participation in an investigational study of a drug, biologic, or device within 30 days prior to entering the study or planned during the course of the study. 23. Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 15 kg/m2 or &gt; 35 kg/m2 24. Female subject pregnant or breastfeeding 25.
