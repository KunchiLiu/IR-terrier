	<detailed_description>The study aims to draw a comparison between ProSeal LMA, i-gel and LTS-D supraglottic airway devices in terms of the efficacy and safety in anaesthetised patient on Mechanical ventilation undergoing elective surgical procedure. Methodology: A prospective randomized control study conducted on 150 patients undergoing elective surgical procedure under general anaesthesia at Dr Sushila Tiwari Hospital and Government medical college, Haldwani. Following detailed pre-anaesthetic check-up, informed written consent was taken from patient fulfilling the required criteria. Patients were randomly allocated into 3 groups namely Group I (i-gel, n=50), Group P (p-LMA, n=50) and Group L (LTS-D, n=50) by online generated randomization. Standard general anaesthesia protocol was followed and once adequate depth was achieved i-gel or p-LMA or LTS-D appropriate for weight or / and height was selected and inserted. An effective airway was confirmed and device was fixed from maxilla to maxilla. The three groups were compared with respect to number of Insertion attempts, ease of insertion of device, time taken for placement of device, airway sealing pressure, ease and number of attempts of gastric tube placement and complications noted if any.</detailed_description>
