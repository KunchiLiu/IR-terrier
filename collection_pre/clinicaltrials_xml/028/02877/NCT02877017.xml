	<brief_summary>Miscommunications are a leading cause of serious medical errors in hospitals, contributing to more than 60% of sentinel events, the most serious adverse events reported to the Joint Commission. Efforts to improve patient safety in hospitals have centered on improving communication between providers. While provider-focused communication interventions have led to reductions in patient harm, patients and families have been notably absent from most interventions to improve patient safety. This proposal seeks to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a family safety engagement intervention aimed at reducing harm in hospitalized children.</brief_summary>
