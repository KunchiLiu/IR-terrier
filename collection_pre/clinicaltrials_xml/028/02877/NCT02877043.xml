	<brief_summary>In 2009, centres that carried out lung resection for cancer were required to obtain authorization following the first cancer plan. One of the criteria to obtain authorization was the volume of activity: the centre had to carry out at least 30 lung resections per year for cancer. Five years later, it would be useful to know the impact of this new organization of oncology on the quality of care. To answer this question, the PMSI database is an ideal source of an indicator of quality: in-hospital mortality. This observational cohort study will be conducted using the national PMSI database with data covering the period from 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2013. It will be limited to hospitalization for lung resection. The time will be divided into 3 periods: 2005-2007, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013; the period 2008-2010 includes the implementation of authorizations for cancer surgery.</brief_summary>
