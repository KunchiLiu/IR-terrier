	<criteria>Have Crohn's disease or fistulizing Crohn's disease of at least 3 months' duration, with colitis, ileitis, or ileocolitis, confirmed at any time in the past by radiography, histology, and/or endoscopy A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [bhCG]) pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test result at Week 0 Adhere to the following requirements for concomitant medication for the treatment of Crohn's disease, which are permitted provided that doses meeting these requirements are stable, or have been discontinued, for at least 3 weeks before baseline (Week 0), unless otherwise specified: a) Oral 5aminosalicylic acid (5ASA) compounds, b) Oral corticosteroids at a prednisoneequivalent dose at or below 40 milligram per day (mg/day), or 9 mg/day of budesonide, or 5 mg/day beclomethasone dipropionate, c) Antibiotics being used as a primary treatment of Crohn's disease, d) Conventional immunomodulators (that is, azathioprine (AZA), 6mercaptopurine (6MP), or Methotrexate (MTX)): participants must have been taking them for at least 12 weeks and at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before baseline A participant who has had extensive colitis for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 8 years, or disease limited to the left side of the colon for &gt;= 12 years, must either have had a colonoscopy to assess for the presence of dysplasia within 1 year before the first administration of study agent or a colonoscopy to assess for the presence of malignancy at the screening visit, with no evidence of malignancy Have active Crohn's disease, defined as a baseline Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of &gt;= 220 but &lt;= 450 Participants who have received intravenous (IV) corticosteroids less then (&lt;)3 weeks or have received tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha) antagonist biologic agents (example, monoclonal antibody [mAb] therapies) or other agents intended to suppress or eliminate tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha) &lt;8 weeks or have received Vedolizumab &lt;16 weeks before the first administration of study drug Woman who is pregnant or planning pregnancy or is a man who plans to father while enrolled in the study or within 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent Participants with certain complications of Crohn's disease that would make it hard to assess response to study drug Participants with a history of or ongoing chronic or recurrent infectious disease Has previously received a biologic agent targeting interleukin (IL)12 or IL23, including but not limited to ustekinumab or briakinumab (ABT874)</criteria>
