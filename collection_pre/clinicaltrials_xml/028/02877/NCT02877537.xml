	<brief_summary>The purpose is to characterize the change of respiratory admittance induced by salbutamol inhalation in children and young adults. A variation threshold will be fixed to distinguish asthmatic and healthy subjects. This project could allow a better identification of asthmatic individuals needing a treatment, a reduction of morbidity of asthma, a reduction of unnecessary treatments administered in individuals with respiratory but not asthmatic symptoms, a better comprehension of bronchial hyperreactivity and its role in asthmatic disease.</brief_summary>
