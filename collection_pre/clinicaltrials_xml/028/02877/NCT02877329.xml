	<brief_title>Internet-delivered ACT for Treating the Psychological Effects of Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hearing loss is the most common sensory disability in the world. Hearing loss is an auditory disability which affects not only speech recognition, but also the ability to recognize, locate and identify sounds in one's environment. Today there are a variety of studies investigating the relationship between hearing loss and mental health. For example, there are studies showing that hearing loss can lead to depression, somatization, social isolation, worrying or anxiety, loneliness, smaller social networks, lower self-efficacy, sensitivity to stress, burnout, and impaired sleep quality and quality of life in comparison with people with normal hearing. Initial results from other studies indicate that acceptance may be of importance, as it in turn can lead to increased help-seeking.To avoid prolonged stress and a healthy self-efficacy could contribute to greater well-being of people with hearing loss. This is the first study to use ACT to improve psychological health in people with hearing loss through the process of psychological flexibility. The treatment is eight weeks long and internet delivered through self-help texts with weekly therapist support.</detailed_description>
