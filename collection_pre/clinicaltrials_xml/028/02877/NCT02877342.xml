	<brief_title>Pre-hospital Notification of Injured Patients Presenting to Trauma Centres in India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a longitudinal prospective cohort study of injured patients being transported by ambulance to the major trauma centre study sites. In the pre-intervention phase, prospective data on patients will be collected on pre-hospital assessment, notification, in-hospital assessment, management and outcomes and recorded in a new tailored multi-hospital trauma registry. All injured patients arriving by ambulance and allocated to a red or yellow priority category will be eligible for inclusion. The intervention will be a pre-hospital notification application in the form of an Android program that will be used by ambulance clinicians to notify emergency departments of selected hospitals of an impending arrival of a patient. The application will use a simple algorithm based on trauma triage principles developed by the Australia-India Trauma System Collaboration (AITSC). The proportion of severely injured patients arriving to hospital after notification will be the primary outcome measure with a target of 70%. Secondary outcomes evaluated will be availability of a trauma cubicle, presence of a trauma team on patient arrival, time to first chest x-ray and in-hospital mortality.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All injured patients arriving by ambulance and allocated to a red (1st) or yellow (2nd) priority category will be eligible for inclusion. Data will be collected prospectively by trained data collectors positioned in the trauma centres. Retrospective inclusion will be continued for all screened patients presenting to any of the included hospitals with injury (including neardrowning) as the primary diagnosis and with at least one of the following criteria: 1. Admission to hospital 2. Death after triage but before admission 3. Dead on arrival Exclusion criteria: Patients meeting screening criteria will be subsequently excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Dead at scene 2. Alive at triage but not admitted to hospital (discharged alive) 3. Isolated poisoning 4. Isolated burns 5. Single digit finger or toe amputations (unless of the thumb or great toe), only</criteria>
