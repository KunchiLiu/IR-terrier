	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate specific capacities of face detection of individual neurons by comparison with their capacity of object detection in medial temporal lobe and ventral temporal cortex in epileptic patients. Secondary purpose is to evaluate specific capacities of detection of known faces of individual neurons by comparison with their capacity of detection of unknown faces in medial temporal lobe and ventral temporal cortex in epileptic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Neurons Responses During Visual Recognition in Epileptic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this interventional study, patients explored with mixed intracerebral electrodes (micro and macro-contacts) will be presented sets of images (objects, unknown faces, famous faces). Spikes and Multi-Unit-Activity will be recorded and analyzed and compared between conditions.</detailed_description>
