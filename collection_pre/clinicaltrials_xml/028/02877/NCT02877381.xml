	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid in Revision Total Joint Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Prospective randomized control study Scientific Background/Intro: Total hip or knee arthroplasty is associated with the risk of moderate to significant blood loss. Approximately one-third of patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery require one to three units of blood postoperatively. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that has been successfully used orally, intravenously, and topically to control bleeding after total joint replacement. The use of TXA has been shown to significantly reduce the need for blood products during total joint replacement.1-3 Many studies have explored the use of various TXA regimens following primary TKA. Tanaka et al. demonstrated both that pre-operative administration of TXA was superior to intra-operative administration and that a double dose regimen is superior to a single dose regimen.4 Maniar et al. further supported the idea that pre-operative TXA administration is superior, and the addition of higher doses of TXA improved efficacy without an increase in thromboembolic complications.5 More recently, Lin et al. demonstrated that combining a pre-operative IV dose of TXA with an intra-articular dose after arthrotomy closure was superior to an intra-articular dose alone.6 Also, in an unpublished randomized control trial that we recently completed, we found oral TXA to provide equivalent blood control at a lower cost than IV TXA. It is well known that revision joint arthroplasty cases are more complex than primary joint replacements. Revision total knee arthroplasty is associated with a greater risk of blood loss and increased transfusion rates compared to primary TKA.7 Despite the vast body of literature investigating TXA following primary TKA, only three retrospective studies have been published on the use of TXA after revision TKA.8-10 All three studies have shown that IV TXA decreased both the rate of transfusions and the amount of blood transfused when compared to controls.8-10 Although the TXA formulations used in primary TKA have been shown to be effective in the retrospective studies, the amount of blood loss and risk of transfusion still remains significantly higher than during primary TKA. By performing the first randomized control trial on the use of TXA following revision TKA, we believe it will help change practice patterns by providing evidence that the same TXA formulations used in primary TKA are inadequate for revision TKA. Additionally, we will be exploring new combinations of TXA administration to answer some questions brought up by previous studies in regards to the optimal TXA regimen.</detailed_description>
