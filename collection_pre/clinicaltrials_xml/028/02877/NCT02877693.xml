	<brief_title>A Post-market Clinical Evaluation of St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System on Patients Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical investigation is a prospective, multicenter, 2-phase, single arm, Asian study. - In the 1st phase patients will be enrolled within 60 days of implant with a St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System approved for thoracic scan with 1.5 Tesla MRI scanning machines. - In the 2nd phase patients will be enrolled within 60 days of implant with a St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System approved* for thoracic scan with 3.0 Tesla MRI scanning machines. - NOTE: The 2nd phase of this study will start only after receiving appropriate regulatory approval for MRI labelling at 3.0T and phase 1 enrollment has completed</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is pectorally implanted with St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System within 60 days 2. Subject is willing to undergo an elective MRI scan without sedation NOTE: Antianxiety agents (e.g. minor tranquilizers, etc.) may be used as long as the patient can communicate with site personnel during the MRI scan 3. Subject's ventricular bipolar capture threshold is stable &lt; 2.5V @ 0.5ms 4. Subject's ventricular sensing is measurable (patient has underlying rhythm &gt; 30bpm) and the sensing amplitude is &gt; 4mV 5. Subject is able to provide informed consent for study participation (legal guardian or legally authorized representative is NOT acceptable) 6. Subject is willing and able to comply with the prescribed followup tests and procedures 7. Subject is not contraindicated for an MRI scan (per the MRI Screening Form) 1. Subject is pacemaker dependent 2. Subject has a non SJM MRI compatible endocardial lead implanted or capped 3. Subject has another existing active implanted medical device, e.g., neurostimulator, infusion pump, etc. that has MR labeling that will not allow the MRI scans per this protocol to be completed. 4. Subject has a high voltage lead revision incidence within 60 days of the enrollment visit 5. Subject has other nonMRI compatible device or material implanted NOTE: MRI compatible knee replacements, hip replacements, stents, etc. may be included as long as the labeling of these devices allow MRI scans conducted per this protocol NOTE: MRI compatible mechanical, prosthetic, and bioprosthetic heart valves may be included as long as the labeling of these devices allow for MRI scans conducted per this protocol NOTE: Nonremovable dental implants may be included 6. Subject has a lead extender, adaptor, or capped/abandoned lead 7. Subject is enrolled or intend to participate in a clinical drug and/or device study (investigational device, investigational drug, new indication for a device or drug or additional testing beyond standard of care procedures), which could confound the results of this trial as determined by SJM. 8. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the duration of the subject's participation in the study 9. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to any condition 10. Subject has exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g., age)</criteria>
