	<brief_summary>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) of the myocardium by limb ischemia/reperfusion may mitigate cardiac damage, but its interaction with the anesthetic regimen is unknown.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Preconditioning and Myocardial Protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will test if RIPC will be associated with differential effects depending on background anesthesia. Specifically, the investigators hypothesized that RIPC during sevoflurane anesthesia attenuates myocardial injury in patients undergoing congenital cardiac defects repair surgery and that effects may be different during propofol anesthesia.</detailed_description>
