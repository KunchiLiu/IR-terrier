	<detailed_description>This project will implement and evaluate the Child STEPs (see Weisz et al., 2012) treatment approach through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at eight K-8 public schools. The STEPs model has two components: (1) a modular protocol that combines 33 modulesâ€”i.e., descriptions of common elements within evidence-based therapies for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and conduct problems; and (2) a web-based system for monitoring student responses to treatment and providing weekly feedback to therapists, to guide their selection and sequencing of the STEPs modules. The project will include an evaluation of the effectiveness of STEPS compared to "treatment as usual" (known as Usual Care or UC) on students' mental health and school-related outcomes, and an analysis of whether changes in school outcomes are mediated by changes in student mental health.</detailed_description>
