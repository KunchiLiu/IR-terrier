	<brief_summary>Usually, cervical spine fractures are not considered as osteoporotic fractures. However, recent studies show that odontoid fractures are the most common fractures of the cervical spine in elderly and may occur in a context of low trauma energy. Thus, the goal of this observationnal study is : - to describe the different type of odontoid fracture and to characterize bone status in elderly patient (&gt;65 y) who underwent odontoid fracture in a context of low trauma energy. - To describe short and long term outcomes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics and Outcomes of Odontoid Fragility Fractures in Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients over 65 y admitted for low trauma odontoid fracture will be consecutively included in the study after informed consent. The investigators will record: - clinical risk factor of osteoporosis and health habits including accomodation - type of fracture and characterization of the odontoid fracture on imaging (standard X ray / MRI / QCT) - Bone status : bone mineral density on DXA, lab tests for secondary osteoporosis check-up, previous vertebral fracture on VFA or X ray - osteoporosis managment : nutrition, vitamin D, anti-osteoporotic drugs - treatment of the fracture : surgical / non surgical - adverse event during hospitalization - lenght of hospital stay - type of discharge Follow-up Ã  3 and 12 months : dead vs alive ; accomodation ; autonomy ; new fracture</detailed_description>
