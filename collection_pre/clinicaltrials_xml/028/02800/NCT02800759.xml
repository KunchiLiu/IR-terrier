	<brief_summary>Cis-9-cetylmyristoleate (CMO) is a naturally occurring fatty acid complex (FAC). Nutraceuticals containing CMO are used to improve knee pain despite the lack of placebo-controlled studies in humans. The aim of the double-blind controlled clinical trial is to explore the minimal effective dose of CMO for relieving knee joint pain.</brief_summary>
