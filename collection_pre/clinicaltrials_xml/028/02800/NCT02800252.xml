	<brief_title>Effects of Omega-3 Plus Low-dose Aspirin as Adjunct to Periodontal Debridement for Chronic Periodontitis in Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a global epidemic. Its complications can have a significant impact on quality of life, longevity, and costs in public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2040, 642 million people will suffer from diabetes, around 10% of the world adult population (WHO, 2015). Periodontal Diseases are considered the sixth complication of DM. This close relationship between both diseases is characterized by mutual influence. Thus, an appropriate control of periodontal disease may facilitate the DM control, improving quality of life on diabetic patients. Besides that, the presence of DM might impair prognosis of diverse dental treatments due to its inflammatory nature, negative influence on wound healing, on bone biology, and the establishment of infections. As a host modulatory therapy (HMT), the daily supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and low-dose aspirin has been proposed as adjunct therapy to the treatment of chronic periodontitis, showing good clinical and metabolic results in normoglycemic patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of daily supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and low-dose aspirin as adjunct therapy to one-stage full-mouth periodontal ultrasonic debridement for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in type 2 diabetic patients through a superiority randomized clinical trial.</detailed_description>
