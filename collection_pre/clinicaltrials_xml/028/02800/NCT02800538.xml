	<brief_summary>The previous research by one of our members in the research team (H. Miller) suggests a possible influence of oral nutrients intake of certain fat or carbohydrates (glucose, fructose) on executive control. On the other hand, another previous study from our group (L. Van Oudenhove) suggests a subliminal influence of intragastric administration of fatty acids on subjective and neural responses to negative emotion induction. The purpose of this study therefore is to examine the effect of intragastric administration of certain fatty acids and carbohydrates on executive control in healthy volunteers. Therefore two group of healthy volunteers are invited to the study. The first group will be randomly administered one of the three fatty acid emulsions or placebo via a nasogastric tube in each of the visits， while the second group receives one of two carbohydrates or saline in a random order. After the exposure period, participants will use a computer to perform there different tasks to measure executive control. During each study visit, regular measurements of emotion, physical sensations, as well as blood glucose will be assessed. Furthermore, an electrocardiogram will be continuously recorded for the calculation of vagal function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>N = 66 (n = 36 in the CAG group; n = 30 in the FAG group) These numbers are based on a power calculation for a repeated measures ANOVA with one withinsubject factor using Gpower software version 3.1.7 (http://www.psycho.uniduesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3), indicating that these sample sizes are needed to achieve 90% power to detect a mediumsized effect (f = 0.25).
