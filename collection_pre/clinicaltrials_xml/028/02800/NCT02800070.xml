	<brief_summary>This is a first-in-human study for the treatment of Fabry disease. Eligible patients will have an autologous stem cell transplantation using CD34+ cells that are transduced with the lentivirus vector containing the human alpha-gal A gene. The researchers of this study would like to see if the re-introduction of transduced cells will help increase the levels of alpha-gal A enzyme levels and to determine the safety and toxicity of autologous stem cell transplantation using CD34+ cells transduced with lentivirus vector containing the alpha-gal A gene. This study's objective is to determine the safety and toxicity of lentivirus alpha-gal A transduced CD34+ cells in adult males with Fabry disease.</brief_summary>
