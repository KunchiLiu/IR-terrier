	<brief_summary>Primary brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression of EFGR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), which is associated with poor prognosis. Several methods of inhibiting this receptor have been tested, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with recurring GBM, intracranial superselective intra-arterial infusion of Cetuximab (CTX), at a dose of 250mg/m2 in conjunction with hypofractionated radiation, will be safe and efficacious and prevent tumor progression in patients with recurrent, residual GBM.</brief_summary>

Informed consent must be obtained at the time of patient screening Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men will be informed of the potential unknown risk of conception while participating in this research trial and will be advised that they must use effective contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period Patients with significant intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with treatment or posttreatment clinical monitoring Patients with radiological evidence of leptomeningeal disease Patients with history of allergic reaction to CTX Patients who completed chemo/RT less than 6 months prior to enrollment Patients who have not failed standard Stupp protocol</criteria>
