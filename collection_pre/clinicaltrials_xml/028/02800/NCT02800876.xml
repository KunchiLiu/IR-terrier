	<brief_summary>Retrospective study to evaluate the impact of computational wall stress analysis based on computed tomography (CT) of ruptured and not-ruptured aortic aneurysms as an additional predictor for rupture with dedicated software.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Aortic Aneurysms With Focus on Wall Stress and Wall Rupture Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with known aortic aneurysm who received clinically indicated CT during a time period from 01/2004-12/2013 the CT data was evaluated with dedicated software, A4clinics, VASCOPS GmbH, Graz, Austria. The following parameters will be evaluated: exterior and luminal diameter, intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness, vessel-, luminal- and intraluminal thrombus volume, peak wall stress (PWS), peak wall rupture risk (PWRR), von Mises-stress and rupture risk-index in the ILT.</detailed_description>
