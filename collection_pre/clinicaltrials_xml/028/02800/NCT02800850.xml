	<brief_summary>Many older adults with dementia living in long-term care facilities experience depression and agitation, which cause angst and personal suffering. Prior to this research, evidence was inconclusive but indicated that bright light exposure may reduce depression and agitation in long-term care residents with dementia. The purpose of this study was to determine if the degree of improvement in depression and agitation scores over the course of eight weeks was significantly greater in persons with dementia receiving bright light exposure than in persons with dementia receiving placebo light exposure. Sixty individuals participated in the study, with 30 in the bright light group and 30 in the low level light group.</brief_summary>
