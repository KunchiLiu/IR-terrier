	<brief_summary>To evaluate the effectiveness of subthreshold laser treatment on retinal sensitivity in patients with reticular pseudodrusen and incipient Geographic Atrophy (GA) secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Secondary objective is to investigate changes in best-corrected visual acuity, atrophy progression and safety.</brief_summary>
