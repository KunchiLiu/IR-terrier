	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) patients often receive long term oral anticoagulants. If the indication is strong, in the secondary chronic thrombo-embolism pulmonary hypertension (CTE-PHT) prevention, the frequent prescription (50 to 90% of patients) contrasts with their low level of proof in the PHT. Last but not least, anticoagulants are known to be the principal cause of iatrogenic hospitalization (major bleeding). In this study, patients are all followed during one year, to determine the annual frequency of major bleedings (according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) international definition). Each event notified is validated by an independent committee for clinical events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bleeding Frequency Under Anticoagulant Treatment in Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) patients often receive long term oral anticoagulants. If the indication is strong, in the secondary chronic thrombo-embolism pulmonary hypertension (CTE-PHT) prevention, the frequent prescription (50 to 90% of patients) contrasts with their low level of proof in the PHT. Last but not least, anticoagulants are known to be the principal cause of iatrogenic hospitalization (bleeding). The only one study scaling the tolerance of anticoagulants for this population found major hemorrhagic levels discording with the clinical practice : really high for connectives associated to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAHT), and lower in "simple" pulmonary embolism in CTE-PHT. These discoveries could belong to methodological failures of this study: a retrospective, monocentric one, without adjudication of events by an independent committee. Furthermore, there were no information about the existence of a validated indication for anticoagulant treatments. Patients are all followed during one year, to determine the annual frequency of major bleedings (according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) international definition). Each event notified is validated by an independent committee for clinical events.</detailed_description>
