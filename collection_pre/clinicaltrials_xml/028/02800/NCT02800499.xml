	<brief_summary>The KOrea COpd Subgroup Study team (KOCOSS) cohort is an ongoing, longitudinal, prospective, non-interventional and observational study within the Korean COPD patients. The prevalence of early COPD (mild to moderate COPD based by 2011 GOLD(the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guideline) is high in Korea. However, the patients with early COPD are not underdiagnosed due to mild symptom. The purpose of this study is to investigate early COPD characteristics and disease course and to form a guideline for early detection of COPD patients and prevention of progression to severe COPD.</brief_summary>
