	<brief_summary>Statins are one of the lipid lowering drugs that help in reducing cholesterol levels in the body by specifically inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; which is a rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. Rosuvastatin (RSV) and atorvastatin (ATV) have shown to have bone stimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1.2% RSV and 1.2% ATV gel as a local drug delivery and redelivery system as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of degree II furcation defects.</brief_summary>

The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1.2% RSV and 1.2% ATV gel as a local drug delivery and redelivery system as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of degree II furcation defects. Methods: Ninety patients with mandibular buccal class II furcation defects were randomly allocated into three treatment groups: SRP plus placebo gel (group 1), SRP plus 1.2% RSV gel (group 2) and 1.2% ATV gel (group3). Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline then after 6 months. The gels were redelivered at the respective sites at this 6 month appointment. Then again all clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded after 3 months. (9 months from baseline)</detailed_description>
