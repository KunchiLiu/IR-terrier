	<brief_title>Does CERC-501 Attenuate Stress-precipitated Smoking Lapse?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be performed in subjects who are heavy cigarette smokers currently not seeking treatment for tobacco use disorder. The study is a crossover design study (within-subject analysis), which allows for subjects to be their own control. Each period of the crossover consists of a 7-day out-patient treatment period followed by a single out-patient testing day on Day 8. Subjects will participate in a laboratory session following the McKee Stress-Smoking Lapse Test. Upon completion, subjects will undergo a 7 day washout period followed by the second period of the crossover design and a 7-day follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
