	<brief_title>Correlation Between Preeclampsia and Positive for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Screening Test: STOPBANG Questionnaire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Since the gold standard diagnosis of OSA is polysomnogram which is limited by cost and availability. Therefore, various screening tools were proposed in order to identify high risk OSA patient such as Stop-bang questionnaire. From the previous study, Stop-bang showed a high predictive performance and the score equal or higher than 3 determines high risk for OSA.</detailed_description>
