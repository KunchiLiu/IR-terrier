	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common disorder and associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, distinguishing transient AKI from persistent AKI may help in individualizing treatment and limit short and long term consequences of AKI. Previous studies suggested usual urinary indices to perform poorly for separating transient from persistent AKI in an unselected population of critically ill patients. The recent KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines underlined the need for additional strategies in estimating renal short term prognosis. Recently, a Furosemide stress test (FST) was validated in a cohort of unselected critically ill patients. This stress test performance was found to be good in predicting capacity to identify those patients that will progress to advanced stage AKI. Additionally, FST performance was higher than those of usual renal biomarker. The limited sample size of this preliminary study however precluded adjustment for usual confounders including oliguria. The primary objective of this study is to assess diagnostic performance of FST in differentiating transient and persistent AKI. Secondary objectives are to assess diagnostic performance of FST in predicting need for renal replacement therapy, and to confirm FST results after adjustment for confounders.</brief_summary>
