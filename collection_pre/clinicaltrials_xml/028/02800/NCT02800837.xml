	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate the STENTYS Xposition S for Treatment of Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease, previous mono-center studies have shown promising results with the previous generation of the self-expandable STENTYS stent (paclitaxel eluting stent, delivered via withdrawal of a sheath). The TRUNC study aims at assessing at large scale the Xposition S in the treatment of ULMCA disease. The Xposition S is a sirolimus eluting stent, mounted on a balloon delivery system. The study aims at collecting clinical practice routine data from 200 patients.</detailed_description>
