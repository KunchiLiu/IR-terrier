	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single arm post-approval study is to demonstrate continued safety of the Axium Neurostimulator System for dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation. The primary endpoint is the 12-month serious adverse event rate for permanent implants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TARGET Post-Approval Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A maximum of 376 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic, intractable, pain of the lower limbs due to CRPS types I and II will undergo a trial of the Axium Neurostimulator System across 40 study sites in the United States. Only subjects who report a 50% or greater reduction in overall pain intensity through direct patient-reported percentage of pain relief will receive the permanent implant. Subjects will then return to the office for follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-permanent implant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is male or female between 22 and 75 years of age. Subject has moderate to severe chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs resulting from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) types I or II. Subject has a baseline VAS score of &gt; 60 mm for overall pain at the time of the baseline assessment. Subject is willing and able to comply with the study requirements. Subject is able to provide written informed consent. Subject has an active implantable medical device including but not limited to cardiac pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators. Subject is currently involved in medically related litigation, including workers compensation. Subject has previously failed (i.e. did not receive &gt; 50% pain relief) spinal cord stimulation. Subject has a life expectancy of less than one year. Subject is pregnant or of child bearing potential and not using adequate contraception as determined by the investigator. Subject has, or plans to have, a spinal cord stimulation system or infusion pump system implanted. Subject has, or plans to have, a peripheral nerve stimulation system (PNS) or peripheral nerve field stimulation system (PNfS) implanted. Subject is considered to be a poor surgical or study candidate, which may include, but is not limited to the following: any medical, social, or psychological problem that could complicate the implant procedure and/or recovery from the implant procedure or could complicate the required procedures and evaluations of the study in the judgment of the investigator.</criteria>
