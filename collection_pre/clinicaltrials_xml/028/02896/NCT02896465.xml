	<brief_summary>Assessment of the impact of oral Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) application on acute diarrhoea and the development of prolonged and persistent diarrhoea in paediatric patients hospitalized with acute diarrhoea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Childhood Diarrhoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is single site, double blind, randomized of HMO addition (1.5 g /day) to standard of care in paediatric diarrhoea patients. HMO application and follow-up of the children at home will be done for 2 weeks. Control patients receive only the standard of care (ORS plus zinc). A breastfed group of diarrhoea patients will serve as reference group. The total sample size is 495 patients. Patients will be females and males aged 6 months to 2 years old with acute diarrhoea.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Non breastfed children (group I and group II): 1. Both male and female children between the ages of 6 months to 2 years. 2. Acute diarrhoea (&lt;48 hours) without interfering comorbidities, e.g. acute respiratory tract infection, sepsis, gross electrolyte imbalances etc. 3. Guardian is willing to have the child admitted to the hospital as an inpatient until resolution of diarrhea and to return to the clinic with the child on Day 14 after admission for a final evaluation. 4. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to admission to this study. 5. The subject has a physical examination that reveals no clinically significant abnormalities other than those expected for subjects with acute infectious diarrhea. Non breastfed children (group I and group II): 1. Children of either sex who are fully or partially breastfed until one week before enrolment (since breastfed children receive naturally HMO, their inclusion into the ORS/zinc or HMO/ORS/zinc arms would critically interfere with the study question; depending on children's age 30 to 50 % of mothers would do so at icddr,b). However, an unblinded reference group will be constituted by agematched children who are breastfed at the moment of hospitalization for acute diarrhea and where the mothers want to continue breastfeeding on the study ward (so breastfeeding is only an exclusion for the randomized groups). 2. Suspected or confirmed cholera as detected by a positive DF examination in stool collected on admission. (The large volume and quick evacuation of stool could interfere with product presence in the gut) 3. Symptom duration &gt; 48 hours at screening. 4. Vomiting severity that is likely to make administration and retention of test product impossible. 5. Severe malnutrition defined (using zscores) as: severe stunting (SS; heightforage zscore &lt; −3.00); severe underweight (SU; weightforage zscore &lt; −3.00), and severe wasting (SW; weightforheight zscore &lt; −3.00), using the World Health Organization reference value. Moderate malnutrition was defined as follows: moderate stunting (heightforage zscore −3.00 to &lt; −2.00); moderate underweight (weightforage zscore −3.00 to &lt; −2.00); and moderate wasting (weightforheight zscore −3.00 to &lt; −2.00). We considered children as wellnourished if their zscores for weightforage, heightforage and weightforheight zscore were form −2.00 to +1.00. Children with moderate malnutrition will be enrolled since they develop with higher frequency PD). 6. Child already receiving antibiotics or antimotility drugs for this diarrhea episode prior to screening. 7. Children with any food allergy. Breastfed children, (Group III Reference group) 1. Exclusive Breastfed children Either sex: Male and female 2. Age 612 month 3. Acute diarrhoea (&lt;48 hours) without interfering comorbidities, e.g. acute respiratory tract infection, sepsis, gross electrolyte imbalances etc. 4. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to admission to this study. 5. The subject has a physical examination that reveals no clinically significant abnormalities other than those expected for subjects with acute infectious diarrhea.</criteria>
