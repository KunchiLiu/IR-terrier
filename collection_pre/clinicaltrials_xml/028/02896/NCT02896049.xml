	<brief_title>Celsius TCS Hyperthermia System PMCF Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During this PMCF Trial from each participating center the internal data of all Celsius TCS Hyperthermia devices are collected. The participating centers are obligated to report any device-related failure and Adverse Event (injury to the patient). The center reports together with the device-internal data allows to calculate the failure and the complication rates. It will be analyzed regarding the kind of tumor and the concomitant treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The outcome groups (with/without failure or complication) will be analyzed regarding demographic and treatment parameters.</detailed_description>
