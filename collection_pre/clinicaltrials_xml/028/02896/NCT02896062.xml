	<detailed_description>In the present study, a sleep-coaching program for small groups of a maximum of eight participants is developed. The program is comprised of four different sessions and is provided to member of the German armed forces. One session lasts approximately 1.5 hours and sessions are applied on a weekly basis. Each session deals with a different topic, addressing all major categories of sleep disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders) and teaching ways of self-help and information on when to seek medical treatment. The program is evaluated by a cross-over study design with treatment and waiting control groups. After the treatment group has finished the course, the waiting group attends the sleep coaching session. All subjects fill in sleep logs and several questionnaires prior to (t0) and after the treatment group has finished the sleep coaching (t1), after the waiting group has finished the course (t2), and in a 3-month follow-up session (t3). Furthermore, sleep is recorded according to the AASM-standard criteria for two consecutive nights each at the time-points t0, t1, and t2. Subjective and objective sleep quality will be compared across the time-points, and between groups. In total, at least 48 participants are included in study.</detailed_description>
