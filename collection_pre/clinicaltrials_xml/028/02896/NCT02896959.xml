	<brief_summary>Postoperative surgical pain has been extensively study with regard to anaesthesia pain modalities, however little is published with regards to various arthroscopic shoulder surgical techniques. An intriguing characteristic of shoulder arthroscopy is the various arthroscopic pump pressures used by different surgeons. One could hypothesize that excessive water retention from the arthroscopic pump could causes excessive tissue pressure and swelling resulting in post operative pain. Unfortunately we could not find any literature in the English language regarding varying pressure pump settings on post operative pain control. For that reason we would like to assess how variable pump pressure effect tissue pressure over pre set time points, and how this may relate to post operative pain control.</brief_summary>
