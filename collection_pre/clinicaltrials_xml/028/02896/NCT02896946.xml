	<brief_summary>The detection of small liver metastases represents a major challenge during the staging process of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Currently, thoraco-abdominopelvic CT represents the established imaging modality for selecting patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma for curative surgery. However, despite its performance, 13% to 23% of patients undergoing a surgical procedure are finally found to have an unresectable disease because of arterial involvement, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or the existence liver metastasis that had not been detected by preoperative workup. Compared to CT, diffusion-weighted MRI provides a better contrast resolution for soft tissue and liver imaging, and thus leads to a better detection of focal liver lesions. Hence, it could be hypothesized that the use of DW-MRI in patients with potentially resectable PA may improve the selection process of candidates for curative pancreatic resection by increasing the detection of LM undiagnosed by traditional preoperative work-up</brief_summary>
