	<brief_summary>Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer related mortality. Among them, non small cell lung cancer accounts for 85%. Only part of patients could be treated with radical surgery, and some patients were unfit for surgery due to the poor cardio-pulmonary function or refuse surgery. For those patients, microwave ablation (MWA) could be an alternative treatment. Several small sample retrospective studies verified that MWA could be an efficacy and safe treatment.</brief_summary>
