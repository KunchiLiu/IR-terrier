	<brief_summary>Currently, the real scope of sealants (AS) is poorly documented in temporary dentition and its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Yet it seems reasonable that the AS in temporary dentition could slow the specific development of carious lesions in early childhood. In addition, this non-invasive approach could delay the conventional food and thus save financial costs for more complex treatments. Finally, the installation of AS could afford, as demonstrated in adult teeth, lowering the cariogenic bacteria prevalence engaged in the caries process.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently, the real scope of sealants (AS) is poorly documented in temporary dentition and its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Yet it seems reasonable that the AS in temporary dentition could slow the specific development of carious lesions in early childhood. In addition, this non-invasive approach could delay the conventional food and thus save financial costs for more complex treatments. Finally, the installation of AS could afford, as demonstrated in adult teeth, lowering the cariogenic bacteria prevalence engaged in the caries process. Main objective: To evaluate the effect of AS on caries incidence in the deciduous dentition obtained over a period of three years, taking into account the risk of caries established initially. Secondary objectives: 1. To assess the prevalence and caries attack sites at the end of each year 2. Estimate the retention rate (partial or complete) of the AS during the study 3. Determine the cost savings of treatment during the trial period</detailed_description>
