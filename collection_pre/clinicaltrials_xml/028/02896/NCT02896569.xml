	<brief_title>Tolerability of Using a Post-Treatment Topical Adjuvant Combination Following Fractional Radiofrequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, open-label, multi-centre study to evaluate the tolerability of the application of a combination of a serum containing human bone marrow stem cell derived growth factor and cytokines (SCR Complex™) and a botanical lipid based occlusive (Bio Cel™) following facial fractional RF treatments using the Venus Viva™ SR system. Each subject will receive 2 treatments separated by a 3-week interval. Subjects will complete a VAS and Tolerability Scale immediately following each treatment. Telephone follow-up calls by the site will ask the subject to respond to the Self-Report Adverse Event Questionnaire 24 and 72 hours after the first treatment and 24 hours after the second treatment. Subjects will complete a Home Tolerability Scale 24 and 72 hours after the first treatment and 24 hours after the second treatment. Subjects will return for the final FU visit and be asked to respond to the Self-Report Adverse Event Questionnaire and complete the Home Tolerability Scale for 72 hours. The investigator will also evaluate the subject's improvement using the GAIS at this visit.</detailed_description>
