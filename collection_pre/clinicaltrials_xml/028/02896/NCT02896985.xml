Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial. Written informed consent must be obtained and documented. Primary nonresponders to 16 weeks of adalimumab therapy. Received any investigational drug within the 16 weeks of adalimumab therapy. Serious underlying disease other than CD that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to participate fully in the study. History of alcohol or drug abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study procedures. Stools positive for Clostridium difficile.
