	<brief_title>Evaluation of Esthetic Performance of Resin Infiltration Technique on Enamel Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The teeth that meet the inclusion criteria will be cleaned from debris and clinical intra-oral photos of the lesions will be taken before and after the treatment. Resin infiltration technique will be performed according to manufacturer's instructions under rubber-dam isolation. Intra-oral photos will be taken directly after infiltration (1 day), and 1 week and 6 months later. The system of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) involving 3 color parameters: lightness (L), red/ green chromaticity (a), and yellow/blue chromaticity (b), will be used to assess the extent and durability of color and lightness changes between lesion and sound enamel areas before and after resin infiltration. The extent of assimilation and durability of effect will be assessed by comparing CIE L*a*b data collected before infiltration (baseline), directly after infiltration (1 day), and 1 week and 6 months later. The color assessments were standardized using a spectrophotometer (SpectroShade, Italy). Lesion areas will be measured for each time point by using an image analysis toolkit (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.). Multifactorial analysis of variance with repeated measures will be used for statistical analyses.</detailed_description>
