	<brief_summary>In previous studies exploring specific sequences of MRI (susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL)), the investigators have shown the great sensibility of these MRI sequences to detect arteriovenous shunts, compared to angiography imaging (static or dynamic). This prospective study aims to compare multisequence MRI to brain arteriography imaging in patients undergoing brain arteriovenous malformations embolization.</brief_summary>
