	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of ascorbic acid and combination chemotherapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body, has come back, or cannot be removed by surgery. Nutrients found in food and dietary supplements, such as ascorbic acid, may improve the tolerability of chemotherapy regimens. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ascorbic acid and combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascorbic Acid and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine safety of intravenous ascorbic acid in combination with fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test feasibility of collecting quality of life (QOL), patient reported outcomes (PRO) data and correlative studies on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.</detailed_description>
