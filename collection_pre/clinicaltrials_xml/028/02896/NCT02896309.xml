	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate treatment on the intrarenal renin-angiotensin-system in adult patients with a metabolic acidosis and chronic kidney disease. This treatment is compared to sodium chloride treatment, which serves as control for increased sodium-intake and no treatment, which serves as time-control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Correction of Metabolic Acidosis in CKD on Intrarenal RAS Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In chronic kidney disease (CKD), as glomerular filtration rate decreases, excretion of hydrogen ions fails, leading to progressive metabolic acidosis (arterial pH &lt; 7.35 and a serum bicarbonate concentration &lt; 22 meq/L). Metabolic acidosis enhances further progression of CKD. It is known that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is stimulated during metabolic acidosis, but it's specific role in the renal response on changes in the acid-base balance is unknown. Correction of metabolic acidosis by administration of bicarbonate is a common intervention in patients with metabolic acidosis due to chronic kidney disease. It is proven to slow down progression of CKD. There is no knowledge on the effect this therapy has on the intrarenal RAS. Since acidosis does not change serum renin levels, and bicarbonate therapy has no effect on blood pressure, it seems to have no effect on the systemic RAS. The investigators hypothesize that bicarbonate therapy diminishes intrarenal RAS activity without affecting the systemic RAS.</detailed_description>
