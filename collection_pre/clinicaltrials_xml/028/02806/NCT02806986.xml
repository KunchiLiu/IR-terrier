	<brief_summary>Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in order to have approximately 20 adult subjects and 20 pediatric subjects treated with subcutaneously administered IGSC 20% who complete the entire study. This study will include 3 study stages: Screening/Previous Regimen Phase, IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 1 (13 IGSC 20% weekly doses), and IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2 (39 IGSC 20% weekly doses). A total of 52 doses of IGSC 20% will be administered with a final follow-up visit 1 week after the last dose at Week 53. Subjects/caregivers will be trained on self-administration of IGSC 20% by the clinical site personnel.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, efficacy, PK, safety and tolerability study of IGSC 20% in subjects with PI. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in order to have approximately 20 adult subjects and 20 pediatric subjects treated with subcutaneously administered IGSC 20% who complete the entire study. This study will include 3 study stages: Screening/Previous Regimen Phase, IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 1 (13 IGSC 20% weekly doses), and IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2 (39 IGSC 20% weekly doses). Previous Regimen Phase: Subjects will be infused with their current ongoing ("previous regimen") IVIG/SCIG regimen (pIV/pSC) in the clinic to obtain 2 trough IgG levels (obtained prior to each pIV/pSC infusion) on each subject's "previous regimen". 20% IGSC Treatment Stage 1: The first dose of IGSC 20% will be administered at the clinical site immediately after Baseline assessments are complete (SC#1). All subjects will receive 13 IGSC 20% infusions at weekly intervals. IgG trough blood levels will be measured at all (except SC#3) study visits All other doses of IGSC 20% may be infused at home (once properly trained) or in the clinic. The Treatment Stage 1 dose will continue into IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2. IGSC 20% Treatment Stage 2: The IGSC 20% dose (mg/kg) will remain constant with no dose adjustment permitted in this phase, unless it is absolutely medically necessary. While all subjects will have a SC#17 clinic visit and standard assessments, serial PK sampling will only be performed in a subset of adult subjects:</detailed_description>

Inhaled or topical corticosteroids are allowed.</criteria>
