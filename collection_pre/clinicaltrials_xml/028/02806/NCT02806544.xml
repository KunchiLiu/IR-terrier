	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Tamoxifen in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer in a Low/Middle Income Country</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm feasibility study of neoadjuvant tamoxifen for locally advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer in a low-resource setting in a middle-income country (Guatemala). Patients will be treated with tamoxifen for four to six weeks, then have an on-treatment biopsy to assess Ki-67. If Ki-67 is less than or equal to 10%, the patient will continue on tamoxifen for a total of 4 months; if Ki-67 is greater than 10% or there is clinical progression, patients will be taken off study. The study will evaluate the proportion of patients treated with four months of tamoxifen who undergo definitive surgery and the clinical and pathologic response rates.</detailed_description>
