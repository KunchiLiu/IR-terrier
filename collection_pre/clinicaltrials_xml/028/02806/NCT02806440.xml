	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect and mechanism of low dose naltrexone for treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia. It s a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. It is a 2-center study that takes place at The Multidisciplinary Pain Center in Copenhagen and at The Multidisciplinary Pain Center in Give.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Naltrexone for Treatment of Pain in Patients With Fibromyalgia - Effect Via a Central Mechanism?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia syndrome is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder characterized by pain, profound fatigue, sleep disorder, mood disturbance etc. The prevalence is estimated to be 2-8%. Treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia is often based on opioids. However, opioids may lead to tolerance, addiction and hyperalgesia and alternative treatments are therefore warranted. Low dose naltrexone (3-5mg) (LDN) has shown promising results in the treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia, but there is a need for further research. At the typical dose of naltrexone, 50 mg, it is an opioid antagonist. However LDN demonstrates analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, possibly involving an antagonism of microglia in the CNS. The investigators hypothesize, that LDN has a better pain relieving effect than placebo in in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). The investigators also hypothesize that LDN has a better effect upon experimentally induced pain in FM-patients, compared to placebo. A tentative mechanism is a central facilitation of the endogenous pain inbitory system.</detailed_description>
