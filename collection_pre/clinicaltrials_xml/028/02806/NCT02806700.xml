	<brief_summary>Twitter use is surprisingly well represented across broad demographic population segments and health-related messages. The promise of using Twitter is that its use is growing rapidly, it allows the investigators to view communications that were impossible to intercept before, and it potentially provides information faster and less expensively than collection from other media channels. Prior work also supports that social media interventions can improve health behavior change (e.g. weight loss, physical activity) and outcomes.The overarching goals of this proposal are to understand the uses and limitations of this communication channel to improve patients' ability to manage their CV health condition.</brief_summary>
