	<brief_summary>- Background: Asthma is a frequent disease characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodeling. Consistent epidemiological data indicate that outcome of asthma in adults may be determined in early childhood. This may be due to bronchial remodeling, an abnormal repair process that contributes to the development of poorly reversible airway narrowing. It appears very early in the natural history of the disease and involves increased mass of bronchial smooth muscle (BSM). The mechanism of such an increase has been related with an increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation. Recently, we have demonstrated that in severe asthma, BSM increased proliferation is induced by an enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, we have also shown that immature human, non-asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) proliferate to a greater extent than normal adult ASMC, in a similar fashion to adult asthmatic ASMC. Immature ASMC may thus have great potential to stimulate airway remodeling. We thus hypothesized that remodeling is an early process and certain characteristics of ASMC in severe preschool asthma may predispose such children to persistent remodeling with airway obstruction later in life. - Purpose: To investigate prognostic factors of airway remodeling in preschool children, with special attention to ASMC proliferation (mitochondrial mass &amp; biogenesis). - Methods: In the initial phase of the project, 75 severe asthmatic preschool children (&lt;5 yr) will be prospectively recruited from the "CHU de Bordeaux" and the "CHU de Toulouse" according to the "Haute Autorité de Santé" criteria. Inclusion visit will include written informed consent, asthma control evaluation, clinical examination, lung function testing (exhaled NO, plethysmography), prick tests, chest X Ray and blood sample for total IgE levels. Bronchial specimens from all subjects will be obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy at visit 2. Airway remodeling will be evaluated by morphological analysis. After smooth muscle mitochondria will be analyzed by electronic microscopy &amp; immunoblotting. Comparison between the 2 groups will be performed by unpaired t tests for parametric data and x2-tests for non-parametric data. In the second phase of the project, patients will then be followed-up till the age of 7-10 yrs, when another bronchoscopy with biopsies will be performed.</brief_summary>
