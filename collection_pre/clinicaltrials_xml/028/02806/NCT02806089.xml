	<brief_summary>Aim of this study is to determine in chronic kidney disease patients: - the involvement of malnutrition inflammation and atherogenesis syndrome (increase in C reactive protein and decrease in serum albumin) on voluntary muscle strength impairment - the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and muscle mass - the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and lean body mass - the correlation between voluntary muscle strength and physical activity</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim of this study is to determine in chronic kidney disease patients: - the involvement of malnutrition inflammation and atherogenesis syndrome (increase in C reactive protein and decrease in serum albumin) on voluntary muscle strength impairment (estimated by handheld dynamometer) - the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and muscle mass (estimated by creatinine index) - the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and lean body mass (estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis) - the correlation between voluntary muscle strength and physical activity (the physical activity being estimated by the "Voorrips" score questionnaire)</detailed_description>
