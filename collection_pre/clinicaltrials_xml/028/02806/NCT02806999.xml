	<brief_summary>Berberine is a conventional component in Chinese medicine. In recent years, effects of Berberine on improvement of glucose metabolism have been explored. The purpose of this study is to observe the therapeutic effects of combination of insulin and berberine on stress hyperglycemia in patients after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Therapeutic Effects of Insulin and Berberine on Stress Hyperglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients at risk for stress hyperglycemia are often prescribed insulin (Intensive insulin therapy, IIT and maintenance of blood glucose at a level between 80 and 110 mg per deciliter), which are the medication that reduce the level of glucose in the blood. By lowering the glucose level, these patients have a lower incidence of arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury, and heart failure and so on. But there are many patients whose hyperglycemia are not well controlled.If investigators are simply doubling the insulin, that only 10% of the benefit can be received.And it often bring significant side effects (Such as: hypoglycemia, etc.) in critically ill patients. Several studies have suggested that the use of berberine can effectively lowering the blood glucose level.The chemical structure and mechanisms of drug is clearly, and the side effects are seldom, the price of berberine is very cheap. The purpose of this study is to observe the therapeutic effects of combination of insulin and berberine on stress hyperglycemia in patients with heart disease whose level of blood glucose are not well controlled when only using insulin postoperatively. This study will enroll postoperative patients who currently are injected with insulin by insulin pump，but the level of blood glucose is not controlled well. Patients will be assigned to receive 500mg of Berberine twice a day or a placebo(meanwhile they are receiving intensive insulin therapy) in a randomized, double blind, and prospective way. Investigators will occur at preoperative baseline, operating time and postoperative days 2, 4 and 8. Blood will be collected for laboratory testing, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluationⅡ and therapeutic intervention scoring system-28 will assess patient's condition at baseline and days 2, 4 and 8. At days 2, 4 and 8, medication efficacy will be also assessed and tests of blood glucose will be performed. Insulin count will be used to assess effectiveness of Berberine treatment at days 2, 4 and 8. Meanwhile, medication side effects will be monitored and the incidence of hypoglycemia or stool frequency are rigorously recorded at days 2, 4 and 8.</detailed_description>
