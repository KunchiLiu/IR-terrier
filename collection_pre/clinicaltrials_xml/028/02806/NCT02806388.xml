	<brief_summary>This study aims to screen tumor molecular profile for better selection of anticancer treatment, in particular, allocation to clinical trials if available.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Molecular Profiling for Allocation to Clinical Trials (IMPACT) Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Molecular profiling will be performed on archival tumor tissue or freshly collected tumor tissue from re-biopsy. Blood and/or saliva may be collected to study the genetic makeup and also to compare the tumor molecular profile. Personalized therapy will be given based on molecular profile.</detailed_description>
