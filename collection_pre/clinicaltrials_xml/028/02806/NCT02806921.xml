	<brief_title>Changes in the Tear Film With Scleral Contact Lens Wear for Keratoconic Eyes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scleral contact lenses are rigid gas permeable lenses designed to rest on the sclera while vaulting over the cornea with a fluid reservoir. The use of scleral contact lenses has become the current standard of practice as a nonsurgical management of corneal ectasia and ocular surface diseases. Cases have been recently presented of scleral lens wearers exhibiting adverse corneal findings and conjunctival injection from lens wear. These findings are likely associated with the mechanical and hypoxic effects due to poor fitting characteristics at the limbal area. Tear film analysis detecting changes in the levels of proteinases and cytokines have helped researchers gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of complications in soft contact lenses wearers, dry eye, and keratoconus. Ultimately, this study will provide insights in relating scleral lens fitting characteristics and corneal and limbal physiological responses.</detailed_description>
