	<brief_summary>A number of groups have demonstrated very low incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in haploidentical and unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Still the relapse of the underlining malignancy is a problem after this prophylaxis. Ruxolitinib is currently one of the most promising drugs in the treatment of steroid-refractory GVHD. On the other hand, its primary indication is myelofibrosis, and it was demonstrated that ruxolitinib before allogeneic SCT might improve the outcome. This pilot trial evaluates whether the combination of PTCy and ruxolitinib facilitates adequate GVHD control, and decreases the risk of graft failure and disease progression in myelofibrosis patients.</brief_summary>
