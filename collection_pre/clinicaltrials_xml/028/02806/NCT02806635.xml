	<detailed_description>Nationwide, lower-income (LI) couples (those with household incomes &lt;200% of the federal poverty level) - many of whom are also African American, Hispanic/Latino, or rural couples - face numerous challenges to their relationships. Chief amongst those challenges are: 1) higher risk of relationship problems and 2) lack of access to effective relationship services to prevent or intervene with relationship distress. Compared to higher-income couples, LI married and cohabiting couples are significantly more likely to divorce or separate and report lower relationship quality. Unfortunately, LI couples are least likely to receive interventions to prevent or solve relationship problems. To overcome these barriers, we propose to test the effectiveness of two effective web-based curricula - OurRelationship and PREP Online. A total of 850 LI couples will be recruited nationwide and randomly assigned to the PREP Online program, the OurRelationship program, or a wait-list control group and followed for six months. Once randomly assigned to group, couples will be assessed at one month, two months, four months, and six months following randomization. After couples randomized to the wait-list control group finish their waiting period, they will be able to select the program they would like to complete (OurRelationship or ePREP) but will not complete research assessments during or following their participation in the program. Interested couples can find out more information (and sign up for the study) at www.OurRelationship.com</detailed_description>
