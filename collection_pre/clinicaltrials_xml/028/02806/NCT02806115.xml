	<brief_summary>Investigators found that the degree and the duration of aceto-whitening differed between gastric intestinal metaplasia(GIM) and the surrounding normal mucosa: the area of GIM showed a severe degree of aceto whiteness and the whitening continued longer than the surrounding normal mucosa, which investigators called "severe whitening" and "delayed fading", and investigators realized that GIM could possibly be diagnosed by using these differences.The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the efficacy of "severe whitening" and "delayed fading" for diagnosing GIM.</brief_summary>
