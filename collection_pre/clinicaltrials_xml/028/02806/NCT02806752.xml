	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab and TA Combination Therapy vs. Ranibizumab Monotherapy in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a vascular disease of the choroid, appears to be the predominant subtype of exudative or "wet" AMD in Asian populations, in contrast to choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD (CNV-AMD) in Western populations. There are distinct differences in pathophysiological, clinical and epidemiological factors between the two subtypes, although they also share some common risk factors. In contrast to CNV-AMD, PCV does not seem to respond as well to anti-VEGF treatment. The optimal treatment option for PCV remains elusive, with most studies showing good short-term visual outcome but poorer longer-term outcome with current treatment strategies. Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of PCV, while developing novel and effective treatments strategies to prevent PCV-related vision loss is significant unmet needs. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects and safety of ranibizumab therapy combined with TA versus ranibizumab monotherapy in patients with PCV. Second, the pharmacogenetics effect of inflammatory related genes and polymorphism in response to the treatments of PCV will be explored. To further confirm the role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis and advance of PCV, it is important to determine the levels of inflammatory factors in the anterior chamber aqueous humor from PCV patients, comparing with the aqueous humor acquired from the age-matched age-related cataract patients undergoing phacoemulsification.</detailed_description>
