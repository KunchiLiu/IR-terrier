	<brief_title>Effectiveness of an Online Prevention Program in Reducing the Risk of STD Infection in Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescents and young adults are at the greatest risk for acquiring an STD. Approximately 3 million people between the ages of 18 and 24 become infected each year. Education about the risks and consequences of unprotected sex is a powerful tool that can be used to prevent or reduce the risk of infection. The program in this study will deliver messages to educate participants about condom use and the risk of STD infection. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored interactive online risk reduction program versus a standard online risk reduction program in reducing the risk of STD infection in young adults. Participants in this 1-year open-label study will be recruited exclusively via the internet. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive internet-based messages from either the Youthnet program or the control program. Messages from the Youthnet program will be interactive and tailored specifically to HIV/STD risk reduction. The control program will deliver standard STD/HIV prevention messages. Participants will be assessed at baseline and a follow-up session 4 months after enrollment. Frequency of condom use and attitudes toward condom use will be assessed using behavioral scales.</detailed_description>
