	<detailed_description>This is a randomized study evaluating the effectiveness and direct effect a commercial soy supplement has on prostate cancer and normal prostate tissue. Patients will be randomized to either receive placebo or a commercial soy supplement for 2-4 weeks prior to the planned surgery for treatment of their prostate cancer. The specific objectives are: 1. To assess the effect of soy supplementation on endogenous hormone production levels and serum prostate specific antigens. 2. To assess the impact of soy supplementation on estrogen receptor expression(ER). 3. To determine the impact of soy isoflavones on cell cycle regulation and associated gene expression.</detailed_description>
