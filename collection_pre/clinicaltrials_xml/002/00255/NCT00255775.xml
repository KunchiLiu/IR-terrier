	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs or substances to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of broccoli sprout extract may prevent lung cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well broccoli sprout extract works in preventing lung cancer in smokers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Broccoli Sprout Extract in Preventing Lung Cancer in Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the effect of broccoli sprout extract on levels of DNA adducts in participants who smoke. - Determine the effectiveness of broccoli sprout extract in reducing tobacco-carcinogen induced DNA adducts in these participants. Secondary - Determine the effects of broccoli sprout extract on markers of the Nrf2 pathway in these participants. - Determine the effectiveness of broccoli sprout extract, in increasing the activity of the Nrf2 pathway, in these participants. - Evaluate the feasibility of using lymphocytes and buccal cells to monitor DNA adducts and changes in the Nrf2 pathway in these participants. OUTLINE: Participants are stratified according to GST genotypic polymorphism (M1 vs T1). Participants receive oral broccoli sprout extract daily for 3 weeks. Participants keep a daily diary of their eating and smoking habits for 3 weeks before, during, and for 3 weeks after study treatment. They must continue to smoke during the study, but are encouraged to quit after completing the study treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
