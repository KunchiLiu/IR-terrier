	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and radiation therapy before a donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide together with total-body irradiation followed by cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil works in treating patients who are undergoing a donor umbilical cord blood transplant for hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, and Total-Body Irradiation Followed by Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate Mofetil in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing a Donor Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant for Hematologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency, extent, and rate of donor (myeloid and lymphoid) engraftment in patients with serious hematologic malignancies treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low-dose total-body irradiation followed by unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation and post-transplant immunosuppression comprising cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. - Correlate clinical and umbilical cord blood-related factors with engraftment in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine transplant-related complications, in terms of toxicity, myelosuppression, infections, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine treatment-related mortality of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a uncontrolled, pilot study. - Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -6 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0. - Unrelated allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT): After completion of TBI, patients undergo 1 or 2 unrelated allogeneic UCBTs on day 0. - Post-transplant immunosuppression: Patients receive oral or IV cyclosporine daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 180 and oral or IV mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-30. Patients are followed periodically for 1 year after transplantation. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
