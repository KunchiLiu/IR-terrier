	<brief_title>Contraceptive Effectiveness Trial of Cellulose Sulfate Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cellulose sulfate has been shown in preclinical studies to have both contraceptive and antimicrobial properties. Clinical safety studies have shown it to be safe for use up to six days in women and 7 days in men, and ongoing studies are assessing its safety for twice daily use for 14 days in women.
