	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Dexlansoprazole MR on Maintaining Healing in Subjects With Healed Erosive Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, 6 month maintenance study. The study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of daily Dexlansoprazole MR (60 mg and 90 mg) with that of placebo, in maintaining healing of erosive esophagitis. Because the development plan for Dexlansoprazole MR formulation was revised, the results of 2 identical studies, T-EE04-086 (this study, NCT00255164) and T-EE04-087 (NCT00255151), were combined and analyzed as a single larger study referred to as study T-EE04-086. A total of 451 subjects were included in the combined analysis: 237 subjects were enrolled into Study T-EE04-086, and 214 subjects were enrolled into Study T-EE04-087.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have successfully completed the Phase 3 Study TEE04084 (NCT00251693) or TEE04085 (NCT00251719); and have healed esophageal erosions proven by endoscopy. Complete healing was assessed for change in LA Esophagitis Classification grades A, B, C, or D to healed (defined as anything less than the criterion for Grade A). The subject was counted as healed if endoscopy findings did not meet the Grade A criterion. Use of prescription or nonprescription proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine (H2) receptor antagonists, sucralfate, misoprostol, or prokinetics throughout the study Use of antacids (except for study supplied) throughout the study. Subjects using drugs with significant anticholinergic effects such as tricyclics who cannot stay on a stable dose throughout the study. Need for continuous anticoagulant therapy.</criteria>
