	<brief_title>Movement Disorders Caused by Antipsychotic Drugs in Older Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of antipsychotic drugs can result in tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a syndrome that causes repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements in the tongue, lips, or jaw. It can also cause facial grimacing, random movements of arms, legs, fingers, and toes, as well as swaying movements of the trunk or hips. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) include a variety of symptoms, such as involuntary movements, tremors, rigidity, body restlessness, and changes in breathing and heart rate. TD and EPS are side effects of older antipsychotic drugs. Newer antipsychotic drugs, such as quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, do not present as large a risk of developing these side effects. This study will assess the incidence of and risk factors for tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms associated with quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone among middle-aged and elderly individuals with psychotic disorders. Additionally, the study will examine the effect of these drugs on symptoms of pre-existing, drug-induced TD. It will also explore the impact of movement disorder symptoms on everyday functioning and quality of life. Some participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive quetiapine, olanzapine, or risperidone. Participants who are not randomly assigned to a medication will still receive one of the three medications, based on the decision of their physician. Initial evaluations will be conducted to collect demographic information, as well as medical, psychiatric, and pharmacologic histories. Dosing will be determined by each participant's psychiatrist. All participants will be followed for approximately 5 years. They will report to the study site for outcome assessments at baseline, Months 1 and 3, and every 3 months for the remainder of the study.</detailed_description>
