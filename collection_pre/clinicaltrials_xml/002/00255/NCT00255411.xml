	<brief_summary>This study will explore how the mind and the brain work to cause movement symptoms or seizures in people who do not have a recognized neurological or medical disorder. The study includes a check for psychiatric disorders, symptoms and their severity; psychiatric and personality questionnaires; and neuropsychological testing. Normal, healthy volunteers, people who have movement symptoms not due to a brain or medical disorder and people who have seizures not due to epilepsy may be eligible for this study. All candidates must be 18 years of age or older. All participants have a medical history, physical examination and psychological evaluation, including completion of questionnaires. People with movement symptoms or seizures have a symptoms evaluation. Some participants also undergo neuropsychological testing, including questionnaires, pen-and-paper or computerized tests, and motor tasks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The objectives of this study are (1) to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse and dissociative experiences in both psychogenic movement disorders (PMD) and non-epileptic seizures (NES) and (2) to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse and both PMD and NES. The secondary objective of the study is to investigate if measures of response inhibition differ between PMD subjects compared to normal controls. This study is part of a larger study investigating the psychological and biological correlates of conversion disorder. Study population We intend to study adult patients with diagnoses of PMD seen by the Human Motor Control Section clinic or patients with diagnoses of NES seen by the Epilepsy clinic and normal controls. Design A psychiatric assessment, measurement scales and neuropsychological testing will be administered to the PMD and NES patients and normal controls. Outcome measures The first primary outcome measure will be the comparison of the different subtypes of childhood abuse (as measured by the Childhood Trauma Interview) and the severity of dissociation (as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale). The second primary outcome measure will be the comparison of frequencies of different subtypes of childhood abuse (as measured by the Childhood Trauma Interview) between PMD, NES and normal control groups. The secondary outcome measure will be the comparison of stop-signal reaction time as measured with the stop-signal task.</detailed_description>
