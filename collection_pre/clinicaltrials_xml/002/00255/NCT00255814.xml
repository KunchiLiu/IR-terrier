	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy in treating patients with liver metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high dose per fraction, highly conformal radiotherapy in patients with liver metastases. Secondary - Determine the failure patterns and survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Correlate dose-volume characteristics with possible toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the local control rate within irradiated fields in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients undergo highly conformal radiotherapy (HCR) to the liver once daily, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of HCR until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
