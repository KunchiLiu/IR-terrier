	<brief_title>Study Testing the Biologic Activity and Safety of an Immunotherapeutic in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, a new Immunotherapeutic production process will be used that shows evidence of potentially much higher biologic activity in pre-clinical studies than the production process used in a previous study (clinical protocol MB-002-003). While both processes are based on individual subject autologous tumor RNA and autologous monocyte derived DCs, the maturation of DCs in this newly modified process involves an altered regimen of culture with cytokines. In addition, huCD40L mRNA is added to the autologous expanded tumor total mRNA for electroporation. These changes promise a much improved migration, and activity profile of the DC-Immunotherapeutic product in RCC subjects.</detailed_description>
