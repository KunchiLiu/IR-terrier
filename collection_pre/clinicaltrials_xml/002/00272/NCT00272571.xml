	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are to test the hypothesis that external counter pulsation therapy (ECPT) provides clinical benefit by improving the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in peripheral blood of patients with angina pectoris.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of External Counter Pulsation Therapy on Circulating Endothelial Progenitor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECPT is a non-invasive approach for increasing blood flow to the heart in patients with myocardial ischemia. ECPT produces beneficial effects in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. However, the exact mechanisms of ECPT action are not defined yet. Evidence has now accumulated that bone marrow-derived cells with angiogenic capability, termed EPCs, circulate in the blood of adults. EPCs possess the ability to home to sites of ischemia and contribute to neoangiogenesis. We prospectively study CAD patients [Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina class II-IV], before and after ECPT , and compare them with age- and sex-matched controls. Peripheral blood CD34+ cells, EPCs (CD34/VEGFR2+ cells), EPC colony forming units (CFUs) and brachial artery endothelial function is assessed prior to and after ECPT. Percent improvement in endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (%FMD) is assessed using high-resolution ultrasound.</detailed_description>
