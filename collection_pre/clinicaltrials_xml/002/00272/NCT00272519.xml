	<brief_title>Life Skills Intervention for Adolescents Perinatally Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the salient advantages of this intervention model is that it has been developed and implemented in several studies with adolescents. However, data concerning the effects of this model are much less extensive with adolescents perinatally infected with HIV. The proposed study is designed to address this gap in knowledge by conducting a pilot intervention tailoring the life skills intervention to the needs of young adolescents, perinatally infected with HIV, and to their primary caregivers. Given the emphasis on peer group interaction, the proposed intervention model also has the potential to reduce some of the social isolation imposed by the experiences related to HIV infection by creating opportunities for adolescents to interact with others who are managing comparable stressors and treatment regimens.</detailed_description>
