	<brief_title>Itopride in Functional Dyspepsia:a Dose Finding Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia remains unsatisfactory. We will assess the efficacy of Itopride, a D2 antagonist with acetylcholinesterase effects in patients with functional dyspepsia. Patients with functional dyspepsia will be randomized to Itopride (50, 100 or 200 mg tid) or placebo. After 8 weeks of treatment, three primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed: a) change of the severity of functional dyspepsia symptoms (assessed by the Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire), b) patientâ€™s global assessment of efficacy (proportion of patients symptom-free or markedly improved)and c) improvement of pain and/or fullness by at least one grade on a 5-grade scale.</detailed_description>
