	<brief_summary>- The primary objective of the present study is to verify the superiority of Telecare program vs. standard SMBG program in terms of mean HbA1c value (- 0,5%) at end-point. - The secondary objectives of the study are the assessment of: total daily dose of insulin, changes in glycaemic and lipid profile, frequency of hypoglycaemias, changes in weight, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness of Telecare program vs. common ambulatory program; general safety (adverse event profile, other routine laboratory parameters).</brief_summary>
