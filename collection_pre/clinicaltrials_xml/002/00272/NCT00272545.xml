	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Normalization of Eating Intervention Program for Treating Women With Eating Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses. They are often characterized by disturbances in eating behavior, such as drastic reduction of food intake or extreme overeating, as well as feelings of distress or extreme concern about body shape or weight. The two main types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third type, binge-eating disorder, is pending approval as a formal psychiatric diagnosis. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, and they occur more often in females than in males. Studies have shown cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to be the most effective approach to treating eating disorders. However, the applicability of these findings to clinical settings and intensive outpatient therapy programs (IOPs) remains unknown. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a new approach to a normalization of eating (NOE) program, based on principles of CBT, in treating women with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Participants in this open-label study will be assigned to receive either treatment-as-usual (TAU) or NOE. Participants admitted to the study in the first 8 months of the trial will receive TAU. Those admitted after the first 8 months will take part in the NOE program. Participants may begin receiving treatment as soon as they enter the study and will continue receiving their assigned treatments for 6 weeks. All participants in the NOE group will be required to report to the study site three evenings a week. They will receive individual therapy, as well as take part in group and family therapy sessions. In addition, they will be supervised while eating a meal. Body weight, results of the Eating Disorders Examination and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, and self-report measures will be assessed post-treatment and at the Month 6 follow-up visit. Note: Participants are recruited from the Renfrew Center's outpatient programs located in the Philadelphia area. Individuals outside of Renfrew cannot volunteer for this study.
