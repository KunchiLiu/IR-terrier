	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To evaluate in explorative manner the fasting blood glucose (FBG) coefficient of variability (CV)calculated on SMBG values (SMBG : Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose). Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are the assessment of: changes in glycaemic control (HbA1C), frequency of hypoglycaemias, changes in weight, final insulin dose, changes in lipid parameters, changes in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, profile of patient which best fits each of the algorithms with the dependent variable of change in HbA1C and independent variables of age, gender, race, tobacco use, diabetes complications, initial HbA1C, initial weight, duration of diabetes mellitus, general education and diabetes education.</brief_summary>
