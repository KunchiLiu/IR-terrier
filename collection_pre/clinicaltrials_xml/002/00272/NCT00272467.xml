	<brief_title>Healing Effects of Rebamipide and Omeprazole in Helicobacter Pylori-positive Gastric Ulcer After Eradication Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to evaluate the ulcer healing efficacy of rebamipide administered following the eradication therapy in comparison with the well known PPI, omeprazole. This is a double-blind, comparative study which is expected to prove the role of rebamipide in gastric ulcer healing after the eradication therapy. This study may contribute to further clinical research on a new type of ulcer treatment by looking at the treatment modality based on the enhancement of defensive factors.</detailed_description>
