	<brief_summary>In the Congenital Myopathy Research Program at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, the researchers are studying the congenital myopathies (neuromuscular diseases present from birth), including central core disease, centronuclear/myotubular myopathy, congenital fiber type disproportion, multiminicore disease, nemaline myopathy, rigid spine muscular dystrophy, SEPN1 and RYR1 myopathy and undefined congenital myopathies. The primary goal of the research is to better understand the genes and proteins (gene products) involved in muscle functioning and disease. The researchers hope that our studies will allow for improved diagnosis and treatment of individuals with congenital myopathies in the future.

	<brief_title>Molecular and Genetic Studies of Congenital Myopathies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Congenital Myopathy Research Program consists of a group of scientists and healthcare providers all working to better understand the congenital myopathies. We are taking two approaches to reach our research goals. The first involves identifying and describing new genes and proteins involved in the skeletal muscles that allow our bodies to move. Simultaneously, studies are underway to identify genetic changes (mutations) that cause human neuromuscular disease. Thus, our second approach is to identify mutations, learn how they are inherited in families, and understand how they lead to weakness in individuals with neuromuscular disease. These approaches allow correlation of our basic muscle biology findings with our studies on muscle tissue of affected individuals. Our research would not be possible without the generous participation of individuals and families with congenital myopathies. Participation in our studies is free of charge. Travel to Boston is not required, and we welcome the participation of individuals from around the world. We appreciate the participation of all individuals with a congenital myopathy, as well as their first-degree relatives. Participants with a congenital myopathy are asked to donate medical records, a blood or saliva sample, and a muscle tissue sample (if available). Participating relatives are asked to donate a blood sample. The blood/saliva sample is used to acquire DNA (genetic material) which can be used to identify genetic changes and to study how a disease is inherited in a family. The medical records are employed to understand a participant's symptoms. The muscle tissue is used to better understand the disease at the muscular level by studying the gene expression and protein levels in individuals with congenital myopathies.
