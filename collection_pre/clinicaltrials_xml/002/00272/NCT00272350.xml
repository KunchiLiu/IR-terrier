	<brief_summary>Background: In vivo experiments have documented the ability of ZD6474 to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical tumor models. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with malignant gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, ZD6474 represents a potentially promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors. Thus, we now propose a phase I trial of ZD6474 in patients with recurrent and progressive low-grade gliomas who are on P450-inducing anti-epileptic drugs and a phase II trial for patients with recurrent gliomas not taking P450-inducing anti-epileptic drugs. Objective: Phase I - To establish the maximally tolerated dose of ZD6474 and to obtain preliminary information regarding the spectrum of toxicities of ZD6474, and to obtain pharmacokinetic data to patients taking EIAED. Phase I - To obtain preliminary information regarding potential anti-tumor activity of ZD6474 in patients taking EIAED. Phase II - To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of ZD6474 and to collect information regarding the spectrum of toxicities in patients not taking EIAEDs. Eligibility: Patients with histologically proven malignant primary gliomas will be eligible for this protocol. Additionally, patients with progressive low-grade gliomas and patients with infiltrative brain stem gliomas, diagnosed radiographically rather than by biopsy will also be eligible. Design: Phase I - Group B patients will be accrued to the formal dose-escalation phase I trial. Groups of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas will be accrued to increasingly higher doses of ZD6474 until the MTD is established. Phase II - Patients will be treated at a dose of 300 mg day, every day, on a 4-week cycle.</brief_summary>

Patients with a history of any other cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma insitu of the cervix), unless in remission and off of all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 1 year are ineligible. This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race. Minorities will actively be recruited to participate. Patients must not be pregnant or nursing, and all patients (both men and women) must be willing to practice birth control during and for 2 months after treatment with ZD6474.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA PHASE I: Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study: Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active hepatic, renal, or psychiatric diseases are ineligible. Active cardiac disease as defined by: Significant cardiac event (including symptomatic heart failure or evidence of cardiac ischemia within 3 months of first dose or presence of any cardiac disease that in the opinion of the Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. Clinically significant arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contraction [PVC], bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia) that is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE v3.0 grade 3), or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia, at the discretion of the investigator. Any concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes (See Appendix C, Table 1).

The average QTc from the 2 screening ECGs must be less than 460 msec in order for the patient to be eligible for the study. If the patient meets eligibility requirements in this way, the "baseline" QTc for this patient will be the average of the 3 ECGs (screen 1, screen 2, and pre1st dose).

A cardiac arrhythmia serious enough to require therapy (i.e. drugs, AID), angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure and/or a cardiac ejection fraction less than 45 percent. Prior serious cardiac disease defined as prior coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, or prior myocardial infarction unless a recent cardiac evaluation (within the last 3 months) demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease (i.e. a negative stress test) and no myocardial wall dysfunction. Concurrent use of other standard chemotherapeutics or investigative agents or vasoconstrictors for the treatment of migraine (ergotamine, zolmitriptan, sumatriptan) because of the potential for exacerbation of coronary vasoconstriction.
