	<brief_summary>The investigators are looking for individuals who have suffered a stroke to participate in an experiment examining the use of robotics in rehabilitation. They are trying to develop a robotic environment for hands after having had a stroke. Participants will interact with up to two small robots and a visual display. The experiment involves minimal risk and may involve testing sessions over multiple weeks. Subjects must be at least 1 year post-stroke and have difficulty picking up small objects. For more information, contact: Bambi Brewer, CMU Ph.D. Student, 412-241-9423 or bambi@andrew.cmu.edu.</brief_summary>
