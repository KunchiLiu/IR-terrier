	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral effects of atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) versus a combination drug of lopinavir (LPV) plus RTV. A combination drug containing tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) will also be taken by participants in both arms.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV RNA ≥5000 c/ml Any antiretroviral therapy within 30 days prior to screening; Women of Childbearing potential (WOCBP) unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study and for up to 8 weeks after the study; WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method WOCBP who are pregnant or breastfeeding; Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug administration; Presence of a newly diagnosed HIVRelated opportunistic infection or any medical condition requiring acute therapy at the time of enrollment; Suspected primary (acute) HIV infection; Prior antiviral therapy (&gt;30 days of NRTI and/or &gt;7 days of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or PI therapies) or any antiretroviral therapy within 30 days prior to screening; some exceptions are allowed for ARV therapy in use for Mothertochild transmission; Participants with Cushing's syndrome; Untreated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A participant who is euthyroid on a stable replacement dose of thyroid hormone is acceptable provided the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) performed within 30 days of screening is within normal drug range; Recent therapy with agents with significant systemic myelosuppressive, neurotoxic, pancreatotoxic, hepatotoxic or cytotoxic potential within 3 months of study start or expected need for such therapy at the time of enrollment; or therapy with methadone or ribavirin/interferons or treatment with neurotoxic drugs or drugs that affect CYP3A4; Participants with obstructive liver disease; Active alcohol or substance use sufficient, in the Investigator's opinion, to prevent adequate compliance with study therapy or to increase the risk of developing pancreatitis or chemical hepatitis; Proven or suspected acute hepatitis in the 30 days prior to study entry; Intractable diarrhea (≥6 loose stools/day for at least 7 consecutive days) within 30 days prior to study entry; Inability to swallow capsules; Active peripheral neuropathy; Presence of cardiomyopathy (due to any cause) or any significant cardiovascular disease, such as unstable ischemic heart disease; Known, clinically significant cardiac conduction system disease. Baseline laboratory values measured within 2 weeks prior to initiating study drugs as follows: 1. calculated creatine clearance &lt;60 mL/min as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation; 2. total serum lipase ≥ 1.4 times the upper limit of normal; 3. liver enzymes (AST, ALT) ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal; 4. total serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of study drug; Prohibited therapies; Any other clinical conditions or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the participant unsuitable for study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements; Prisoners or participants who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must not be enrolled into this study.</criteria>
