	<brief_summary>This research aims to explore the effectiveness of memantine (Namenda) in treating post-menopausal women between the ages of 50 and 65, who are at risk for cognitive decline. Memantine has already been shown to offer cognitive benefits to patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, but it's potential for treating those at risk for cognitive decline without Alzheimer's disease or other dementia has yet to be evaluated. It is possible that memantine may offer neurocognitive benefits to this population, as well. Participants are asked to take medication for six months, complete neuropsychological testing, and one blood draw.</brief_summary>
