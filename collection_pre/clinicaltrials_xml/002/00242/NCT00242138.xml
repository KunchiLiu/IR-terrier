	<brief_summary>The optimal duration of hormonal therapy is yet to be determined in the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate. The RTOG performed a trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent hormones(consisting of Goserelin and Flutamide) compared to radiation alone, and found that there was an improvement in local control and progression-free survival, but no improvement in overall survival. The EORTC performed a similar trial, but used Goserelin alone for a period of 3 years. This trial showed an improvement in local control, disease-free survival, and in contrast to the RTOG trial, an improvement in overall survival. The rate of erectile dysfunction in men who receive a prolonged period of Gosereline (i.e. 2 yrs) is not known, but suspected according to expert opinion, to be significantly higher than a shorter course of hormonal ablation. Therefore the price of of a survival advantage in locally advanced prostate cancer maybe at a cost of increased rates of erectile dysfunction.</brief_summary>
