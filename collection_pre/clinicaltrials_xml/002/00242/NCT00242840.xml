	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Prior participation in study APV30005 AND one of the following studies: APV30001, APV30002, AZL30006, APV30003. Must be failing virologically (&gt;1000 copies at two consecutive timepoints) and have a screening genotype with evidence of at least one new APVassociated protease mutation: V32I (+/ I47V), I50V, I54L/M, I84V acquired since commencing treatment with GW433908. Exclusion criteria: Have 2 or more of the primary resistance mutations D30N, G48V, V82A/F/T/S and L90M. Have a medical need for use of an nonnucleoside reductase transferase inhibitor (NNRTI). Have an acute CDC Class C event requiring therapeutic intervention. Are pregnant or lactating. Have any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude their participation.</criteria>
