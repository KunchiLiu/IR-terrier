	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Docetaxel and ZD1839 Followed by Removal of the Prostate to Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is recognized that there is a subset of patients who are at high risk for progression despite aggressive treatment of localized disease at the time of detection. The critical issue is in addressing micrometastatic disease that has already developed prior to diagnosis. This study utilizes daily doses of ZD1839 and weekly docetaxel for two cycles prior to radical prostatectomy. ZD1839 has demonstrated antiproliferative activity against human tumor xenografts and in coadministration with cytotoxic agents against prostate cell lines (PC-3 and TSU-PRI). The combination of ZD1839 and docetaxel has been reported to be feasible with an acceptable toxicity profile. This phase II, single center trial is specifically targeting those patients with high-risk adenosarcoma of the prostate.</detailed_description>
