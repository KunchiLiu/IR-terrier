	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to determine, via a 6-month randomized controlled study, the efficacy of providing tailored physical activity computer reports to patients and physicians. The primary outcome is minutes of physical activity measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall interview at 6 months. The intervention group completed physical activity surveys at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Based on their responses, participants received four feedback reports at each time point. The reports aimed to motivate participants to increase physical activity, personalized to participants' needs; they also included an activity prescription. The control group received identical procedures, except that they received general reports on preventive screening based on their responses to preventive screening questions.</detailed_description>
