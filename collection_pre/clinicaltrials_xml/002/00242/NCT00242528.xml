	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 2. Confirmed Diagnosis of DurieSalmon Stage III Multiple Myeloma, with the following clinical characteristics: A. At least 1 osteolytic bone lesion demonstrable in a conventional Xray film. B. The patient will have to be receiving treatment for primary neoplasia, at the time of the start of this trial. Ambulatory patients aged ≥ 18 years. Treatment with bisphosphonates in any moment during the last 12 months before visit 1. except for those patients that received only one dosis of bisphosphonates for any indication and when the administration has been 14 days before or older. Patients with an absence of a bone lesion clearly related to the primary cancer, and that is detectable in a conventional bone Xray (simple film). Patients with a Serum Calcium level of ≤ 8 g/dl (2.00 mmol/L) or ≥ 12 mg/dL (3.00 mmol/L) Treatment with other investigational drugs within 30 days before inclusion in the trial. Serum Creatinine levels of &gt; 3 mg/dl (265 umol/L). Total Billirubin levels of &gt; 2.5 mg/dl (43 umol/L) Patients with a heart condition that has the NYHA criteria for a Grade III and IV functional class Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
