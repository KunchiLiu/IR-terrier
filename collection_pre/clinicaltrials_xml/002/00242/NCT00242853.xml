	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to validate various biomarkers in patients with RA with varying levels of disease severity. Subjects with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will be included as controls. The sudy will measure the baseline levels and the intra- and inter-subject variability of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in patients with inactive/mild and moderate/severe RA on stable therapy or during a course glucocorticoids. In addition exhaled NO levels will be correlated with intra-articular inflammation (power Doppler ultrasonography) as well as markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, ESR).</brief_summary>
