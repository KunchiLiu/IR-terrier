	<brief_summary>The twilight phase between being asleep and awake during recovery from anesthesia is a precarious time fraught with risks to the post-operative patient. Hyperventilation accelerates the elimination of inhaled anesthetics but reduces their CO2 blood concentrations which delays their resumption of spontaneous breathing. We previously showed that our method of hyperventilation without affecting the CO2 concentration--which we call IH--accelerates the rate of emergence from anesthesia with isoflurane. In this study we will study the effect of IH on the rate of emergence from Sevoflurane anesthesia.</brief_summary>
