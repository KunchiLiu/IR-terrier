	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of fatty acid composition of a fat supplement: 1. acutely (after single intake) on subjective and objective measurements of hunger, satiety and wellness, on energy intake, and postprandial hormonal changes; 2. in the long-term (after one week) on (regulators of) fat tissue metabolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Fatty Acid Composition on Energy Intake and Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the physiological factors regulating the food intake pattern is satiety. Satiety is defined as the absence of ingestive motivation, which ends when the next meal is initiated (Blundell et al., 1996). Food intake affects a number of physiological objective parameters in blood known to be involved in signaling satiety, such as glucose (Melanson et al, 1999; Chapman et al, 1999; Campfield et al, 1996), insulin (Speechly et al, 2000) and cholecystokinin (CCK) (Gutzwiller et al., 2000; Beglinger et al., 2001; French et al., 2000; Degen et al., 2001; Burton-Freemanet al., 2002, 2004). More recently, the gastric hormone ghrelin was identified as a marker for hunger and meal initiation (De Graaf et al, 2004). Ghrelin concentrations in blood were highly correlated with subjective measures of appetite. PYY, a gut hormone produced postprandially, will be measured in this study because it has been mentioned that this hormone inhibits food intake (Batterham et al., 2003). The baseline level of PYY is lower in obese subjects than in lean subjects. The two groups different in body weight will therefore show different baseline levels, and perhaps different curves as well. Humans do not only eat in response to a metabolic or physiological need. Humans also respond to a significant extend to other internal subjective and emotional signals (cues). The exact relations between the physiological internal signals and subjective and emotional internal signals are not known. Besides also external and social factors modulate physiological-derived hunger and satiety signals. In the present clinical trial, the effect of fatty acid composition of a fat supplement will be studied on hunger and satiety. In the supplement a mixture of fatty acids known for their satiating effect will be tested and will be compared with a control supplement containing fatty acids normally consumed with breakfast.</detailed_description>
