	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to compare PPAR activities (increase of adiponectin level) between MICARDIS and amlodipine after 6 weeks of treatment in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. Moreover, this study will compare serum level of inflammatory markers of the metabolic syndrome after 6 weeks of treatment. An ancillary study performed in one center will assess adipocyte differentiation (PPAR gamma stimulation) in 30 subjects (15 per arm).</brief_summary>
