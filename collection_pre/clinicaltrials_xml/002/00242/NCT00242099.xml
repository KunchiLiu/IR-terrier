	<brief_summary>Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and -7 (HHV-7) infections are common after transplantation. Such infections may predispose transplant patients to other infections, contribute to a recurrence of hepatitis C virus, and affect rejection and function of the transplanted liver. Given the significant clinical impact of these viruses, routine laboratory monitoring may be beneficial by identifying patients who have persistent or high levels of infection. In these patients, immunosuppressive medications could be adjusted, or antiviral medications administered. There are currently no randomized trials that address this important question. This prospective, randomized trial will analyze whether routine laboratory monitoring for HHV-6 and -7 is clinically useful, and whether it would improve overall outcomes in transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
