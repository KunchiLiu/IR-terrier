	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous Aralast Fraction (Fr.) IV-1, a sterile, stable, lyophilized preparation of functionally intact human Alpha1- Proteinase Inhibitor (α1-PI). This pharmacokinetic study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial with a cross-over design. Twenty-four subjects will be enrolled into the study. Overall study duration will be approximately 6-8 months.</brief_summary>
