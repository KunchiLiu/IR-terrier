	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of functional MRI techniques [High Resolution Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (HR-DCE-MRI), diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) and BOLD MRI] to detect, measure and locate intra-prostatic cancer. 70 patients undergoing MRI for staging of prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy will be studied. Results of MRI obtained prior to surgery will be correlated with pathologic specimens to determine MRI accuracy.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients will be recruited from the University Health Network (UHN). Eligible patients will be undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer at UHN. Patients with a contraindication to MRI or MRI contrast agents, claustrophobia, renal failure, allergy to MRI contrast agents, or prior hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for prostate cancer, a biopsy within 3 weeks of the surgical date or active prostatitis will be excluded.</criteria>
