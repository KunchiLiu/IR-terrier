	<brief_summary>This is a two phase study (randomised and non-randomised phase). The randomised phase will initially examine 4 blinded doses of GW640385 boosted with rtv (with continuation of current background therapy) in comparison to an ongoing, open-labeled rtv-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen for 15 days. At the Day 15 visit, all subjects will optimize background therapy. Additionally, subjects receiving the lowest dose of GW640385 will be re-randomised to one of the higher doses and subjects in the control arm will receive a new rtv-boosted PI based on resistance testing at screening. Subjects will remain in the randomized phase on one of these 4 continuing treatment arms for at least 48 weeks. An interim analysis will occur during the randomised phase to select for a dose of GW640385 to evaluate further in Phase III studies. After dose selection subjects will move to the non-randomised phase of the study. In the non-randomised phase subjects who are receiving GW640385 will be assigned to final selected dose for assessment of long term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 18+ years of age (or =16 years of age for nonEU countries, according to local requirements). HIV1 infected subjects. Females must be of either nonchildbearing potential or have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and agree to use a protocol approved method of contraception. Plasma HIV1 RNA (viral load) =1,000 copies/mL at Screening. Evidence of at least 2 multiPI resistant mutations at Screening or within 3 months of Screening. Subjects must have been receiving the same antiHIV medicines that they are on currently for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening; these antiHIV medicines will include a single protease inhibitor (PI) in combination with a low dose of ritonavir (i.e., a ritonavirboosted PI). However, the current PI cannot be tipranavir. Able to understand and follow protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions. Be willing and able to provide signed and dated written informed consent prior to study entry. Exclusion criteria: Subjects cannot change their antiHIV medicines between Screening and Day 1 Visit. Subjects can not be receiving dual ritonavirboosted PIs, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or Tipranavir at Screening. Active CDC Class C disease at screening. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Protocolspecified laboratory abnormalities at Screening.</criteria>
