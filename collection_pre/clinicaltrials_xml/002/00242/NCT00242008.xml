	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess whether it is possible for subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease to switch from ropinirole, pramipexole and cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal system (SPM 962) overnight without worsening of Parkinson's Disease symptoms. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be switched overnight to treatment with rotigotine transdermal patches at a dose considered equivalent to the dose of dopamine agonist that the subject is currently taking. Subjects on ropinirole or pramipexole will take their last dose at bedtime and then apply rotigotine patch(es) upon awakening the next morning. Subjects on cabergoline will apply rotigotine patches 24 hours after the final dose of cabergoline. Subjects will continue rotigotine treatment for 28 days, during which dose can be increased or decreased as needed. At the end of treatment, subjects can select to enroll in an open-label extension trial. The first subject was enrolled on 28 December 2004. The last subject was enrolled in June 2005 and the last subject visit was conducted in July 2005. This study is now closed.</brief_summary>
