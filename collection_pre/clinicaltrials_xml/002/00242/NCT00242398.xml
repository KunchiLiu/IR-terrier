	<brief_title>Hemodialysis Without Anticoagulation in Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis in patients who are at high risk of bleeding complications represents a challenge of balancing the needs for establishment of an adequately functioning extracorporeal circuit for dialytic therapy with the requirement of not exacerbating existing bleeding or precipitating bleeding in predisposed subjects. Several methods of nonheparin dialysis have been used. The method most commonly used to effect such treatment is "saline flushing": saline boluses are delivred at frequent intervals. This method is far from optimal for several reasons, including failure to maintain a patent circuit in significant proportion of patients, an added logistic burden on dialysis nurses. An alternative method of avoiding systemic heparinization is priming the dialysis membrane with heparin before hemodialysis. The method is based on fact that AN69ST (Nephral 400ST , Hospal, France) dialysis membrane have a high affinity for binding heparin, and that the bound heparin exerts a localized antithrombotic effect without systemic spillover. Comparison: heparin free hemodialysis with saline flushes compared heparin free hemodialysis with Nephral 400ST.</detailed_description>
