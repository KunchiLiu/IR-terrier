	<brief_summary>Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam (DRE) are used to screen for prostate cancer. Patients with abnormal DRE or elevated PSA undergo transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (TRUS-Bx). There are some men who have a normal TRUS-Bx despite persistent elevated PSA and may harbor occult prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI using an endorectal coil, and advanced MRI methods called H1 MR Spectroscopy (MRS) and Dynamic MR Perfusion Imaging (dMRI) can help identify and localize prostate cancer in these patients and direct repeat TRUS-Bx to the most suspicious location in the prostate gland. 100 men, currently under observation with elevated PSA but negative TRUS-Bx will be enrolled in the study.</brief_summary>
