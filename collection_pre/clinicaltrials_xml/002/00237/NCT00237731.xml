	<brief_summary>Efficacy and safety of morphine titration on acute pain in emergency medical mobile units with initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg plus 0.05 mg/kg versus morphine titration with initial bolus of 0.05 mg/kg plus 0.025 mg/kg</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-hospital Morphine Titration : Comparison of 0,05 Versus 0,1 mg/kg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVE : Assess the efficacy of a morphine dose of 0.1 mg/kg versus a morphine dose of 0.05 mg/kg in pre-hospital pain METHODS : Consecutive patients with severe, acute pain defined as a verbal rating scale (VRS) of 60/100 or higher may be included. 106 patients at all are required in the study. They will be randomised in two groups : group A will receive an initial intravenous injection of 0.05 mg/kg then injections of 0.025 mg/kg every 5 minutes and group B will receive an initial intravenous injection 0.1 mg/kg then injections of 0.05 mg/kg every 5 minutes. The pain scale will be checked every 5 minutes during 30 minutes. The titration will be stopped before, if the VRS is &lt; or = 30. The patient will be followed during the study until 60 minutes.</detailed_description>
