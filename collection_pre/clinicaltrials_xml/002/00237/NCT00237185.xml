	<brief_summary>In the core study, participants with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors expressing c-kit were treated with either 400 mg or 600 mg imatinib mesylate for 3 years. The 10 year extension study allowed participants, who successfully completed the core study, to continue study treatment with imatinib mesylate provided they still benefited from treatment and did not demonstrate safety concerns as per the investigator's opinion.</brief_summary>
