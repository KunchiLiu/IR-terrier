	<brief_summary>1. Implement a single-visit program (SVP) for cervix cancer prevention in clinics serving a multi-ethnic population of women; 2. Set up an efficient system for interpretation of Pap smears for patients in the SVP that will minimize waiting time; 3. Determine the follow-up rates and compare them between women assigned to the SVP and a usual care program (UCP); 4. Determine satisfaction and compare it between women assigned to the SVP and the UCP; 5. Determine the cost-effectiveness and compare it between the SVP and UCP</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women were recruited from underserved communities to participate in this single visit cervix cancer project. Large loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed on SVP subjects with either a diagnosis of HGSIL/AGUS or suspicion of carcinoma. All other subjects with abnormal Papanicolaou smears were referred to our abnormal cytology clinics or received care in the community.</detailed_description>
