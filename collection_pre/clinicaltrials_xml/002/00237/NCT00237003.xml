	<brief_title>A Brief Alcohol Intervention for Incarcerated Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hazardous alcohol use continues to be a problem of major significance throughout the United States. Alcohol use is a prevalent condition that independently acts as an important behavioral cofactor for HIV infection in women, contributing to both sexual and drug risk. The rationale for a brief intervention with incarcerated women who hazardously use alcohol and have HIV risk behaviors is compelling. For such women, we believe that the negative effects of drinking may be increased. An intervention that successfully connects alcohol use with HIV risk behaviors may be sufficient to tip the decisional balance in favor of reducing risk-prone alcohol consumption. If alcohol consumption is reduced more generally in a person's life, this may improve judgment in pursuing behaviors which risk other negative consequences. Hazardous alcohol, and high-risk drug and sexual activities may be manifestations of a general behavior pattern among incarcerated women, and strategies that engage such individuals are needed. Given the strong association between hazardous alcohol use and high HIV risk sexual and drug activities, interventions that attempt to lower the prevalence of HIV drug and sexual risk activities by lowering alcohol consumption are well justified. Brief alcohol interventions have been efficacious in reducing alcohol use across many populations over the past decade. Comparison(s): Participants are assigned, in this 6 month study, to an assessment-only condition or an assessment plus motivational interview condition. Two motivational interview sessions are conducted during the first month of study participation.</detailed_description>
