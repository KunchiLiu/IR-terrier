	<brief_summary>This trial is the follow-on trial to a preceeding open-label trial which included patients with chronic refractory neuropathic pain. It is conducted at one site in the United Kingdom and the patient enrollment is completed. The patients had successfully completed the above mentioned trial and, in the investigator's opinion, would benefit from long-term administration of Lacosamide. After a 1-week run-in phase the patients were uptitrated to their optimal dose and then continued into the maintenance phase. Different pain qualities are assessed by a patient's diary.</brief_summary>
