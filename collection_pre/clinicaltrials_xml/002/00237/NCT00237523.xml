	<brief_title>Study for Treatment of Moderate or Severe, Periodic, "Cyclic", Breast Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary efficacy parameters will be measured by patient self-assessment of pain/tenderness using a categorical daily pain diary. Clinical pain is defined as a patient assessment of moderate or severe pain for any given day. Total clinical pain per menstrual cycle is calculated based upon the categorical ratings recorded in a patientâ€™s daily pain diary over the course of a complete menstrual cycle. A directed breast examination will be used as a secondary efficacy endpoint. Changes in the brest examination will be determined by the physician after consideration of both the nature of the examination findings and the surface area of breast involvement. Changes as noted after six months of therapy, relative to the screening visit (baseline) will be used to evaluate this endpoint.</detailed_description>
