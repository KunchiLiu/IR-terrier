	<brief_summary>An open, multicenter and prospective study to evaluate the impact of the treatment with zoledronic acid 4 mg, on the quality of life and the skeletal-related events in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis that responds to hormonal therapy. Zoledronic acid is given to patients in a 15 minute-infusion every 4 weeks until a skeletal-related event occurs.</brief_summary>
