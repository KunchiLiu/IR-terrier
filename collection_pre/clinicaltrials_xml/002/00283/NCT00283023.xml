	<brief_summary>Recent developments in the understanding of stem- and progenitor cell differentiation raises hopes that brain damage in chronic neurological diseases may become repaired by systemic or focal transplantation of such cells. Clinical trials of stem- or progenitor cell transplantation in multiple sclerosis are currently premature. The researchers developed a protocol for human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell culture from human brain for the treatment of demyelinating disease.</brief_summary>
