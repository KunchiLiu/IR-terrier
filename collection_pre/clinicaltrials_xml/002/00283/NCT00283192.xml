	<brief_summary>The primary outcome of FAST (a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled, trial of the effect of sertraline vs. placebo in reducing the incidence and severity of hot flushes in healthy women) is to determine if 6 weeks of treatment with sertraline (50mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 100mg per day for 4 weeks, if tolerated) results in a greater reduction in hot flush score (frequency * severity) compared to placebo among women with moderate to severe hot flashes. The secondary aim is to determine the effect of treatment with sertraline on quality of life, sleep, sexual function, and mood.</brief_summary>
