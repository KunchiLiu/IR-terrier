	<brief_summary>Intensive chemotherapy is often associated with low platelet counts often requiring platelet transfusions to maintain platelet counts. In previous clinical studies administration of rhTPO has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Primary Prophylaxis With rhTPO Administered to Patients With High Risk Sarcoma Receiving Intensive Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous rhTPO vs. placebo as primary prophylaxis in reducing the cumulative proportion of patients requiring platelet transfusion for severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;15,000) during the first four study cycles. To evaluate the severity and duration of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia associated with rhTPO prophylaxis, the impact of rhTPO prophylaxis on health economics/cost effectiveness, and patient quality of life. To assess the safety of multiple IV doses of rhTPO.</detailed_description>
