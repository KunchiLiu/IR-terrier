	<detailed_description>Recent studies have suggested the superior effectiveness of second generation (atypical) antipsychotic medications over first generation (conventional) antipsychotics in preventing relapse during the treatment of schizophrenia. It is estimated that a majority of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty adhering to the daily regimen of oral medications, and the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics has been shown to increase compliance. This study includes both retrospective and prospective observations of the treatments and outcomes associated with antipsychotic drug therapy as well as characteristics of the patient population. The study is not product specific and includes patients using therapy with long-acting injectable, tablet, or liquid formulations of conventional or atypical antipsychotic medications. All patients who enroll in the study start treatment with a new antipsychotic medication, which is to be used according to the product labeling in the local country. Retrospective data, collected over a minimum of 12 months, include patient diagnosis, age, sex, history of treatment with antipsychotic medications, hospitalization, Clinical Global Impression of severity of disease (CGI-severity), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and the reason for starting a new antipsychotic treatment. Prospective data, collected every 3 months over 2 years, are evaluated to assess the effectiveness of treatment and include the patient's adherence to antipsychotic medication, CGI-severity, GAF, and clinical deterioration of the patient's condition. The study investigator enters the data into a registry either electronically or on paper record forms. Safety assessments include the incidence, type and severity of adverse events throughout the prospective phase of the study. Atypical or conventional antipsychotics, as tablet, liquid or injectable formulations as prescribed</detailed_description>
