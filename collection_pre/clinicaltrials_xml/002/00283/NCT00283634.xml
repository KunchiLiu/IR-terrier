	<brief_summary>Tarceva, an orally available small molecule, has demonstrated potent activity in tumor models and humans. This randomized, open-label phase 2 study of Tarceva alone and of Tarceva plus VELCADE is designed primarily to determine the objective tumor response rates to these treatments in patients with Stage IIIB or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is refractory to or has relapsed after front-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
