	<brief_summary>Decreased bone strength is a serious medical problem present in many women with Anorexia Nervosa, or disordered eating. Women with weaker bones are more likely to suffer broken bones than women with normal bone strength. We are investigating whether a hormone that is naturally produced by the human body, called growth hormone, can help strengthen the bones of women with this type of disordered eating.</brief_summary>
