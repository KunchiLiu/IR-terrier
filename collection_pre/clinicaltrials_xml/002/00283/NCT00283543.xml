	<brief_title>Radiation With Concomitant and Then Sequential Temozolomide in Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II study of radiation with concomitant and then sequential Temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant glioma who have undergone surgery with Gliadel wafer insertion. To determine the safety and efficacy of Gliadel 3.85% wafers plus surgery and limited field radiation therapy with concomitant Temozolomide followed by Temozolomide alone in patients undergoing initial surgery for newly diagnosed unifocal moderate to high grade glioma.</detailed_description>
