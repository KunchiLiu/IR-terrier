	<brief_title>Simultaneous Care: Linking Palliation to Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The project introduces and evaluates the effects of a Simultaneous Care Education Intervention, using the COPE model (Creativity, Optimism, Planning and Expert Information) developed by D'Zurilla and Nezu, as one of its key components for cancer patients in Phase I, II and III clinical trials. The SCEI team will use the COPE problem solving educational model to instruct patients on how to problem solve and manage challenges associated not only with the investigational therapy, but also the psychosocial issues that arise from cancer diagnosis, disease progression, treatment, and disease or treatment related symptoms. The educational intervention also sets up a system for regularly contacting the patient and caregiver in order to reinforce what is taught. Patients and caregivers randomized to the intervention arm will receive three education sessions. Patients and designated caregiver will be asked to complete the set of measurement tools approximately every 30 days while enrolled in the study.</detailed_description>
