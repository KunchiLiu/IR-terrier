	<detailed_description>This is an uncontrolled pilot trial of yoga among 12 healthy peri- or postmenopausal women experiencing at least 4 hot flashes per day or 30 hot flashes per week. Participants will complete a Screening and Baseline Visit, and then be taught yoga during weekly sessions that will be held in the evening at the Laurel Heights Conference Center. The yoga postures and breathing techniques will be taught by a qualified and certified yoga instructor using the standardized protocol determined by a Yoga Expert Panel. Each group yoga session will take approximately 90 minutes. Participants will also be required to practice yoga at home at least 3 times per week, and be given yoga materials (mat, blocks, straps), and an instruction manual for their use at home. They will be asked to keep a calendar log of the dates/times that they practiced yoga at home. Outcomes will be assessed midway through the yoga training and at a Final Visit. The main efficacy outcomes are change in number of hot flashes per week and change in severity of hot flashes from baseline to post-training reported on a 7-day diary. We will also measure changes in sleep and quality of life.</detailed_description>
