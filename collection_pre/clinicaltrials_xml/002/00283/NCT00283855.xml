	<brief_title>RAHelp.Org: An Online Self Management Program for Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States. More than 7 million persons in this country report limitations in their daily activities due to arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis alone affects 1 of every 100 persons in the US. Clinic-based self-management programs have been found to be effective in reducing both pain and disability for persons with RA. However, barriers to participation exist such as distance, time, limited transportation, and declining functional status. The Internet is widely used as a source of information about health issues and may provide an opportunity to reduce these barriers and extend consumer access to self-management approaches. It is necessary to determine the efficacy of Internet-delivered self-management programs.</detailed_description>
