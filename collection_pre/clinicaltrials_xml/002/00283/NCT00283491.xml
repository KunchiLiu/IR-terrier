	<brief_title>The Effect of Lactobacillus Cultures on Iron Bioavailability.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency and low iron stores are prevalent in infants, adolescents, and women of childbearing age in both Western and developing countries. One cause of iron deficiency is the low iron bioavailability from foods, which is partly due to inhibiting factors in the diet, such as phytate and phenolic compounds. A number of single meal studies with lactic acid fermented vegetables and cereals have shown a significant increase in iron absorption in humans. This is believed to be caused mainly by the lactic acid produced during the fermentation process, which conteracts the inhibiting effect of phytate. A recent study of ours indicate that the increased nonheme iron absorption from a low iron bioavailability meal was due not only to an effect of the lactic acid produced, but also a specific effect of the lactic acid bacteria. As lactic acid bacteria colonizes the entire intestine but mainly the colon it is of interest to determine whether these bacteria can increase iron absorption from the distal part of the intestine since iron absorption normally is believed to be absorbed from the duodenum and most proximal small intestine. The purpose of this study is therefore to determine the the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v in a lactic acid fermented oat gruel on iron absorption in the proximal and distal small intestine, respectively, in a cross-over design with 18 healthy women of childbearing age, served both fermented oat gruel and pasteurized, fermented oat gruel.</detailed_description>
