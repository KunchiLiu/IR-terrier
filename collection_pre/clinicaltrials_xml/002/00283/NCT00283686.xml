	<brief_summary>The efficacy of interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) on the progression of cystic disease and on the decline in renal function in autosomal dominant kidney disease (ADPKD) will be assessed in two multicenter randomized clinical trials targeting different levels of kidney function: 1) early disease defined by GFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Study A); and 2) moderately advanced disease defined by GFR 25-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Study B; NCT01885559). Participants will be recruited and enrolled, either to Study A or B, over the first three years. Participants enrolled in Study A will be followed for at least 5 years, while those enrolled in Study B will be followed for five-to-eight years, with the average length of follow-up being six and a half years. The two concurrent randomized clinical trials differ by eligibility criteria, interventions and outcomes to be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HALT Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease (HALT PKD) Study A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>* Specific Aims of Study A To study the efficacy of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin-receptor blockade (ARB) combination therapy as compared to ACE-I monotherapy and usual vs. low blood pressure targets on the percent change in kidney volume in participants with preserved renal function (GFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73m2)and high-normal blood pressure or hypertension (&gt;130/80 mm Hg). * Hypotheses to be tested in Study A In ADPKD individuals with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure and relatively preserved renal function (GFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2), multi-level blockade of the RAAS using ACE-I/ARB combination therapy will delay progression of cystic disease as compared to ACE-I monotherapy, and a low blood pressure goal will delay progression as compared with standard control.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of ADPKD. Age 1549 (Study A); Age 1864 (Study B). GFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Study A); GFR 2560 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Study B). BP ≥130/80 or receiving treatment for hypertension. Informed Consent. Pregnant/intention to become pregnant in 46 yrs. Documented renal vascular disease. Spot urine albumintocreatinine ratio of &gt;0.5 (Study A) or ≥1.0 (Study B) and/or findings suggestive of kidney disease other than ADPKD. Diabetes requiring insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents / fasting serum glucose of &gt;126 mg/dl / random nonfasting glucose of &gt;200 mg/dl. Serum potassium &gt;5.5 milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L) for participants currently on ACEI or ARB; &gt;5.0 mEq/L for participants not currently on ACEI or ARB. History of angioneurotic edema or other absolute contraindication for ACEI or ARB. Intolerable cough associated with ACEI is defined as a cough developing within six months of initiation of ACEI in the absence of other causes and resolving upon discontinuation of the ACEI. Indication (other than hypertension) for βblocker or calcium channel blocker therapy (e.g. angina, past myocardial infarction, arrhythmia), unless approved by the site principal investigator. (PI may choose to accept an individual who is on only a small dose of one of these agents and would otherwise be eligible.) Systemic illness necessitating nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory medications. Systemic illness with renal involvement. Hospitalized for acute illness in past 2 months. Life expectancy &lt;2 years. History of noncompliance. Unclipped cerebral aneurysm &gt;7mm diameter. Creatine supplements within 3 months of screening visit. Congenital absence of a kidney (also total nephrectomy for Study B). Known allergy to sorbitol or sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Exclusions specific to magnetic resonance imaging (Study A).</criteria>
