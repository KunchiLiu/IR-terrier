	<brief_summary>The purpose of the project is to shown whether a little dose of a short acting insulin analogue given 3 time daily before the meals compared with placebo could normalise the increase in blood glucose after teh meals in diet treated Type 2 diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Substitution of First Phase Insulin Response in Patient With Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Type 2 diabtes has a defect in the insulinsecretion combined with an increased insulin resistance. At an intravenously glucosestimulation, patients with Type 2 diabtes has a decresed first phase insulin response compared to healty peoples. Because the hyperglycemia after meal, observed i Type 2 diabetics patients, is related to the defect in the first phase insulin response it is our hypothesis that substitution of the first phase insulin response with a little dose of insulin could normalise the blood glucose after the meal. 20 patients with Type 2 diabetes will in a randomised, placebocontrolled, dobble-dummy study be included for three days treatment with Insulin aspart vs placebo. Primary endpoint is bloodglucose fluctuations monitored by a continously glucose monitor.</detailed_description>
