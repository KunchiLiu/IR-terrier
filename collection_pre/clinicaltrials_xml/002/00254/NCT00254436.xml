	<brief_title>A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Weekly Procrit Given to Gastric or Rectal Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia and fatigue are common problems in gastric and rectal cancer subjects at the completion of chemoradiation therapy and surgery. Results of several studies in cancer subjects suggest that treatment with epoetin alfa may be effective in maintaining hemoglobin levels, thereby reducing fatigue, decreasing transfusion requirement, and potentially improving quality of life.</detailed_description>
