	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin + PF-3512676 vs Gemcitabine/Cisplatin Alone in Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PF-3512676 dosing was stopped 20 June 2007 in response to DSMC recommendation to close the trial, citing lack of efficacy concerns as the primary reason with a safety issue (thrombocytopenia) also contributing to the decision.
