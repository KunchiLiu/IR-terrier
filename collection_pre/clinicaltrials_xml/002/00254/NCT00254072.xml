	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery is a common procedure being performed for the treatment of morbid obesity. The procedure consists of a creation of a small gastric pouch and rerouting the small bowel to bypass the stomach and duodenum. There are two anastomoses in this procedure: the gastrojejunostomy and the jejunojejunostomy. Potential complications after gastric bypass include gastrointestinal bleeding and leaks. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur at any staple line including the gastrojejunostomy. Potential methods for prevention of postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding include oversewing of the anastomosis or the use of a smaller stapler height. We hypothesize that the use of staplers with smaller staple height will significantly result in a lower rate of staple line bleeding and possible leaks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Endostapled Anastomoses for Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass (EEA-LGB)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE: 1. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can occur in up to 4% of cases. GI bleeding is associated with significant morbidity which may include transfusion and possible re-operation 2. Leaks at the gastrojejunostomy can be potentially life threatening and ranged from 1% to 2%. HYPOTHESES: The smaller circular stapler may be associated with a lower rate of intraoperative intraluminal bleeding and postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding than the larger one.</detailed_description>
