	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a food portion control tool would be effective to result in weight loss in a group of overweight type 2 diabetics. We hypothesized that this tool would be effective to induce weight loss in these patients. We also hypothesized that diabetic control would be improved in patients using these plates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of a Portion Control Food Tool to Induce Weight Loss in Obese Type 2 Diabetics.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Portion size is known to be an important determinant of energy intake. However, to our knowledge, no clinical trials have previously been conducted which examine the efficacy of a food portion control tool to control caloric intake and thereby induce weight loss. Most cases of type 2 diabetes can be attributed directly to obesity. Dietary caloric restriction has been shown to improve glycemic control by virtue of weight loss, with an additional benefit independent of weight loss. Comparison: daily use of a food portion control tool plus usual care at a diabetes care center, compared to usual care alone.</detailed_description>
