	<brief_summary>The present clinical study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the subsequent administration of Aventis Pasteur's DTacP-IPV//PRP~T combined vaccine (PENTAVAC™/PENTAXIM), as a three-dose primary vaccination in 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age schedule followed by a booster vaccination during the second year of life with the aim to cover the WHO EPI primary vaccination schedule at this age for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccines. WHO EPI vaccination schedules for hepatitis B (either 0, 6 and 14 weeks or 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age) will be also assessed in infants born to HBsAg seronegative mothers. To assess the safety of Pentaxim.</brief_summary>
