	<brief_title>Treatment of Bipolar Mania in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first controlled acute treatment study of bipolar disorder in adults 60 years or older with current DSM-IV manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes. The number of older adults with severe and disabling bipolar disorder is increasing, and information to guide the management of the treatment of the disease is lacking in this population. Guidelines for treatment of younger people with bipolar disorder cannot be used for older people, and there are no safety and efficacy data upon which to base initial treatment decisions for older patients with bipolar mania. Mood stabilizers (lithium and divalproex) are the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. However, in aged patients physiological changes and comorbid diseases may increase vulnerability to side effects and limit the benefits of the medications. This double-blind study will compare the benefits and side-effects of 9 weeks of treatment with lithium and divalproex in people with bipolar mania. Participants, who may be treated during inpatient hospitalization or as outpatients, will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium or divalproex. During the first 3 weeks of treatment careful titration of lithium and divalproex will be done to reach dose ranges. All other psychotropic medications will be discontinued. Behavioral interventions and/or lorazepam may be added, if necessary. After the first 3 weeks, if symptoms do not improve, risperidone will be added to be taken everyday with the study medication.</detailed_description>
